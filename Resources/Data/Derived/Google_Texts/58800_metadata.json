The $750,000 set aside will provide a briefly shiny new \"project,\" to which the responsible parties can point and say, \"We're fixing the Hill!\" But this diverts resources from addressing its perpetual run-down condition. The Hill doesn't have a design problem, it has behavior problems \u2014 litter, vagrancy, vandalism \u2014 that drive a greatly increased need for oversight and quality maintenance of its public spaces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new Hill coordinator appears to have no budget, and relies on volunteers to counter minimal upkeep and unending casual abuse. The occasional cleanups and sporadic graffiti/sticker removal efforts timidly avoid removing large tags on private surfaces and dumpsters. The news boxes are trashed. The Brownies are enlisted for a sweet, though inappropriate, planter-pot \"art\" program. The constantly dirty, sticky sidewalks don't get cleaned unless it rains. Snow/ice removal is spotty at best; many walks become glaciers. Planting areas are neglected. All abet the negative perception of the Hill as an \"anything-goes\" zone, especially in late evening.\n\nAn expensive distraction won't remediate the Hill's public space quality and character. The city council needs to show some leadership: Redirect these funds to fix the Hill's real problems and provide this potentially outstanding commercial district the care it \u2014 and the community \u2014 deserve.\n\nMichael Doyle lives in Boulder.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_28802865/michael-doyle-hills-problem-is-not-design", "sailthru.author": "By Michael Doyle", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28802865:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-12T19:40:40-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Re:  \"Boulder seeks feedback on University Hill 'event street' designs\" (Daily Camera, Sept.  3): The \"event street\" designs, about which the community is asked to provide \"feedback,\" address a false premise: the Hill commercial district \"has no gathering space.", "title": "Michael Doyle: The Hill's problem is not design", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_28802865/michael-doyle-hills-problem-is-not-design", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0912/20150912__13dcin3~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Guest Opinions", "modificationDate": "2015-09-12T18:32:25-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-12T18:03:56-0600", "byline": "By Michael Doyle", "pubDate": "2015-09-12T18:34:05-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-12T19:40:40-0600", "sailthru.title": "Michael Doyle: The Hill's problem is not design", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0912/20150912__13dcin3~1_300.jpg", "description": "Re:  \"Boulder seeks feedback on University Hill 'event street' designs\" (Daily Camera, Sept.  3): The \"event street\" designs, about which the community is asked to provide \"feedback,\" address a false premise: the Hill commercial district \"has no gathering space.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_28802865/michael-doyle-hills-problem-is-not-design", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Re:  \"Boulder seeks feedback on University Hill 'event street' designs\" (Daily Camera, Sept.  3): The \"event street\" designs, about which the community is asked to provide \"feedback,\" address a false premise: the Hill commercial district \"has no gathering space.", "title": "Michael Doyle: The Hill's problem is not design"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0912/20150912__13dcin3~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce254\"", "article_summary": "An expensive distraction won't remediate the Hill's public space quality and character.\nThe \"event street\" notion takes advantage of last year's 2A ballot language, \"...improve public streets\" to instead boost a pet scheme favored by a few.\nTo the contrary, the entire commercial district is its \"gathering space.\"\nThe city council needs to show some leadership: Redirect these funds to fix the Hill's real problems and provide this potentially outstanding commercial district the care it \u2014 and the community \u2014 deserve.\nThe Hill doesn't have a design problem, it has behavior problems \u2014 litter, vagrancy, vandalism \u2014 that drive a greatly increased need for oversight and quality maintenance of its public spaces."}
