PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – Breaking the Silence on Mental Wellness — a free two-day conference on mental health — kicks off Friday at Temple University School of Medicine.

The first day of the conference focuses in on those working in mental healthcare and provides professional development opportunities on topics ranging from bully prevention to mental health first aid and avoiding stigma.

Day two of the conference — which is Saturday — is for the general public and has men only and women only workshops, information on the Affordable Care Act as well as discussions on dealing with trauma in children and others.

“There’s a lot of suffering that’s going on, there’s still a tremendous amount of stigma,” says Pennsylvania Senator Vincent Hughes.

Hughes’ office is sponsoring the event, along with The Black Women’s Health Alliance and Temple University.

“The recession that we have experienced has put a tremendous amount of pressure on people. People need outlets, they need professionals available to help them through their situation,” Hughes says.
