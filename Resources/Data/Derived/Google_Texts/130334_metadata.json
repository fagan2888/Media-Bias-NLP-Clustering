One of his sons, Josh Duggar, is executive director of FRC Action, the political arm of the Family Research Council, which sponsored the summit.\n\n\u201cObamacare is going to diminish the wonderful health care system that we have because anytime the government gets involved it becomes more expensive,\u201d Jim Bob Duggar said.\n\n\u201cYou think about quality. You think about in Canada anyone who wants to have surgery, he has to be on a waiting list for like three months, where in America, if you feel like you need to have something done, you can have it done immediately. When you have the best health care system, it\u2019s going to be hard for the government to improve it. Free enterprise, private health care, is really what enhances technology and research and development, and I really think it\u2019s going to put a damper on the health of America.\u201d\n\nDuggar said the annual Values Voter Summit is crucial for reminding the country of what\u2019s always been important to Americans.\n\n\u201cI think people have drifted away from living the values that they were taught as a child and I think that today the world\u2019s media and culture is pushing to the left,\u201d Duggar said. \u201cI think it\u2019s so important that people are seeing trends that are self destructing and\u2026really looking for answers to their lives. And if we really believe the Bible is the owner\u2019s manual for our lives, it really has all the answers to life\u2019s questions, so we should encourage people to go back to that firm foundation of God\u2019s word.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Jim Bob Duggar tells TheBlaze he expects Obamacare to harm American health care \u2013 primarily advancements in medicine.    \u201cObamacare will cost $3 trillion and it really will not insure that many people than what we have right now,\u201d the co-star of TLC's \u201c19 Kids and Counting\u201d...", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/11/which-reality-tv-star-predicts-obamacare-will-put-a-damper-on-the-health-of-america/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jim-Bob-Duggar-G.jpeg", "title": "Which Reality TV Star Predicts Obamacare Will Put a \u2018Damper on the Health of America\u2019?", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "jim, bob, duggar, predicts, obamacare, will, put, damper, health, america", "sailthru.tags": "entertainment, exclusive, faith, health, obamacare, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 2919, "gplus-count": 3, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/680203", "categories": "exclusive,obamacare,entertainment,faith,health", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 87, "description": "Jim Bob Duggar tells TheBlaze he expects Obamacare to harm American health care \u2013 primarily advancements in medicine.    \u201cObamacare will cost $3 trillion and it really will not insure that many people than what we have right now,\u201d the co-star of TLC's \u201c19 Kids and Counting\u201d...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 1, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Jim Bob Duggar tells TheBlaze he expects Obamacare to harm American health care \u2013 primarily advancements in medicine.    \u201cObamacare will cost $3 trillion and it really will not insure that many people than what we have right now,\u201d the co-star of TLC's \u201c19 Kids and Counting\u201d...", "title": "Which Reality TV Star Predicts Obamacare Will Put a \u2018Damper on the Health of America\u2019?", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/11/which-reality-tv-star-predicts-obamacare-will-put-a-damper-on-the-health-of-america/", "image": {"width": 477, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jim-Bob-Duggar-G.jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 564}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-10-11T17:46:13+00:00", "twitter-count": 106}, "article_summary": "When you have the best health care system, it\u2019s going to be hard for the government to improve it.\nJim Bob Duggar tells TheBlaze he expects Obamacare to harm American health care \u2013 primarily advancements in medicine.\n\u201cIt will add all kinds of regulations on business, it will fine people.\u201dDuggar was in Washington, D.C. for this weekend\u2019s conservative Values Voter Summit.\n\u201cObamacare is going to diminish the wonderful health care system that we have because anytime the government gets involved it becomes more expensive,\u201d Jim Bob Duggar said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so important that people are seeing trends that are self destructing and\u2026really looking for answers to their lives."}
