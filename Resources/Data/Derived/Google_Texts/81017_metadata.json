Doherty, MD, introduced Thomas P. Miller, JD, Resident Fellow, Department of Economic Studies, American Enterprise Institute, who was charged with discussing the impact on the health care system if a Republican is elected as US President in November 2016. At press time, it is being regularly reported that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee and so Miller\u2019s remarks centered on him.\n\n\u201cRepublicans can\u2019t party like it\u2019s 2010 or even 2014,\u201d Miller said. There are reduced fiscal pressures and the Republicans can be accused of \u201ccrying wolf too often on the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThere have been fewer legal threats to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, now that the ACA is the law of the land it will be much harder to take away than it was to resist it in the first place, Miller said.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has transformed the Republican Party,\u201d he said. But \u201chealth policy is a lower-tier issue\u201d for Trump.\n\nWhile there is little to go on due to the fact that there was limited debate about health care during the primary season, Miller predicts that Trump would support \u201cblock-grant Medicaid to the states,\u201d present a \u201ckaraoke-version of repeal and replace,\u201d expand Health Saving Accounts, and allow more individual insurance tax deductions.\n\nWhen Trump says \u201chands off senior entitlements \u2013 he means it,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, whatever a Republican Congress gives to me is fine \u2013 I have too many Muslims to deport,\u201d will be the spirit of a Trump presidency, Miller said.\n\nRegardless, Miller said there needs to be longer-term steps toward meaningful reform, noting that 72 million Americans are on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWe must \u201crebalance the mix of health investments more toward improving social determinants, economic mobility, family stabilization, early childhood development and educational opportunity,\u201d he said, with many in the audience applauding in reaction to his recommended approach.\n\nMiller concluded saying that there are signs of \u201cleaner federal subsidies ahead\u201d and forecasts \u201cnew rounds of chronic conditions, broader politicization of health care\u201d and a spirit of \u201cwho\u2019s in charge?\u201d\n\nFor information on ACP\u2019s views of the 2016 Elections, visit acponline.org/advocacy/where-we-stand/election-2016 \u2014 by Joan-Marie Stiglich, ELS\n\nFor more information:\n\nMiller T.
