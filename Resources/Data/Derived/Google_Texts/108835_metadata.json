That decrease is the largest in the country.\n\nAcross the 37 other states in the federal health care marketplace, the average benchmark premium price increased approximately 7.5 percent.\n\nBenchmark plans are the second-lowest-cost plans in the silver tier of the federal health care marketplace.\n\nCovering Kids and Families of Indiana Policy Director Caitlin Priest says this is a good sign for the Hoosier State.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really a sign the ACA is working here,\u201d says Priest. \u201cIt\u2019s showing us that Indiana\u2019s insurers have experience with the Affordable Care Act now, they know what the market is like and they have a better sense of what they\u2019re consumers health needs are.\u201d\n\nPriest says it\u2019s not immediately clear why Indiana\u2019s premiums are dropping while other states\u2019 are rising \u2014 it could be the state started with its prices too high when it joined the marketplace in 2014 \u2014 but she says it could be a result of the increased competition in Indiana\u2019s health care marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhen the ACA first rolled out in Indiana in 2014, there were four qualified health plans on the marketplace,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, there are eight or nine \u2014 that means we have a lot more competitors looking to insure Hoosiers through the marketplace.\u201d\n\nBut as the Indianapolis Star reports, not all Hoosiers say they\u2019re seeing savings.\n\nAnthem, the insurer that covers the most Hoosiers buying plans on the exchange, is raising rates by about 4 percent on average, according to rate filings with the Indiana Department of Insurance.\n\nAnthem customer Les Kiesel, of Haubstadt, however, said the premium for his family plan is increasing from $1,068 a month to $1,269, a 19 percent increase.\n\n\u201cAnthem has totally priced me out,\u201d he said.\n\nKiesel, 47, said he hasn\u2019t seen any control in insurance costs in recent years. Instead, he thinks he\u2019s buying coverage that \u2014 because of its high deductible \u2014 protects him against only major bills, but without the low premiums that used to be available for \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans.\n\nPriest says consumers still need to shop around for a health care plan because tax credits to offset the cost of a marketplace plan are tied to the benchmark plan\u2019s costs and premiums.\n\nOpen enrollment for 2016 begins Sunday, Nov. 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Across the 37 other states in the federal health care marketplace, the average benchmark premium price increased approximately 7.5 percent.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Across the 37 other states in the federal health care marketplace, the average benchmark premium price increased approximately 7.5 percent.", "title": "Average Benchmark ACA Premium To Drop 13 Percent In 2016 | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/average-benchmark-aca-premium-drop-13-percent-2016-89021/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/02-06-2012-HealthCare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/02-06-2012-HealthCare.jpg", "description": "Across the 37 other states in the federal health care marketplace, the average benchmark premium price increased approximately 7.5 percent.", "card": "summary", "title": "Average Benchmark ACA Premium To Drop 13 Percent In 2016"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The benchmark premium cost in Indiana will drop an average of nearly 13 percent next year.\nAcross the 37 other states in the federal health care marketplace, the average benchmark premium price increased approximately 7.5 percent.\nHoosiers buying health care coverage on the federal marketplace could see a significant decrease in their premium costs in 2016.\nPhoto: Bill Shaw/Indiana Public Media News Benchmark plans are the second-lowest-cost plans in the silver tier of the federal health care marketplace.\nBenchmark plans are the second-lowest-cost plans in the silver tier of the federal health care marketplace."}
