MacGillis is especially curious about poor whites in former Democratic strongholds like Kentucky, a state that in November replaced Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear with Tea Party Republican Matt Bevin.\n\nA flashpoint in that election was Obamacare, which Beshear had embraced and defended, establishing one of the country\u2019s more successful health insurance exchanges, Kynect, and expanding Medicaid. As a result, Kentucky saw the country\u2019s largest decrease in the number of uninsured, with some of the state\u2019s poorest residents gaining health coverage.\n\nBevin, by contrast, vowed to repeal the Medicaid expansion and shut down the state exchange. Since winning the election he\u2019s tempered his rhetoric somewhat but remains committed to reducing the Medicaid rolls, which have increased by more than 400,000 with the program\u2019s expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Nevertheless, many of the state\u2019s poorest areas voted for him\u2014like Pike County in Kentucky\u2019s remote eastern coal country, a former Democratic bastion, which went for Bevin by 55 percent.\n\nMacGillis also points to the re-election last year of Maine\u2019s governor, Paul LePage, who has long pushed for more restrictions on welfare programs in a state where nearly 15 percent of residents are on food stamps\u2014third highest in the country. LePage won the governor\u2019s mansion in 2010 by running on an anti-welfare platform, and the 2014 election was in part a referendum on his outspoken anti-welfare record. In a 2012 speech to Maine\u2019s Republican Party LePage was blunt, calling Maine a \u201csinking welfare state\u201d and saying, \u201cTo all you able-bodied people out there, get off the couch and get yourself a job.\u201d\n\nHis Democratic opponent, Rep. Mike Michaud, attacked him on the issue, saying LePage simply wanted to kick people off public assistance without giving them a chance to improve their lot. It didn\u2019t work. LePage won re-election by nearly five points, and as Bevin did in Kentucky, he carried parts of his state that most rely on welfare programs.\n\nYes, Working People Despise Freeloaders How can this be? \u201cThe temptation for coastal liberals is to shake their heads over those godforsaken white-working class provincials who are voting against their interests,\u201d writes MacGillis, alluding to Thomas Frank\u2019s 2004 thesis in \u201cWhat\u2019s The Matter With Kansas.\u201d\n\nVoters who have managed to get by without welfare, or have worked their way off it, resent those who languish on the dole. Frank argued that many low-income voters are distracted by social issues like abortion and gun control, and, poor saps, wind up voting against their own best economic interests. MacGillis\u2019 take is more or less an update on Frank\u2019s argument, but with two additional, albeit somewhat obvious, insights: first, those slightly higher on the income ladder increasingly resent those beneath them, and second, those most dependent on welfare are increasingly disengaged from politics\u2014many of them don\u2019t even bother to vote.\n\nThe first point is a perfectly understandable reaction to a post-recovery economy in which wages are stagnant even as the number of able-bodied, working-age adults on welfare increases (thanks in part to the Obama administration allowing states to waive work requirements for SNAP, the federal food stamp program). Rather than being distracted by social issues, writes MacGillis, \u201cthese voters are consciously opting against a Democratic economic agenda that they see as bad for them and good for other people\u2014specifically, those undeserving benefit-recipients who live nearby.\u201d\n\nTo call redistributive programs like Obamacare or SNAP an \u201ceconomic agenda\u201d is a stretch, but the point stands: voters who have managed to get by without welfare, or have worked their way off it, resent those who languish on the dole. Such voters, as we\u2019ve seen, are increasingly apt to express that resentment by voting against candidates that defend progressive government schemes.\n\nWelfare Saps People\u2019s Will to Govern Themselves The partisan outcome, however, is really a second-order effect of the ideological point that MacGillis is making, whether he realizes it or not, about declining voter participation: the pervasive administrative state erodes democratic self-governance.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville noted something similar back in the 1830s, observing the effects of radical equality in the young American republic. That MacGillis should explore this phenomena in a rehash of Frank\u2019s theory is a testament to the durability of an old idea. Alexis de Tocqueville noted something similar back in the 1830s, observing the effects of radical equality in the young American republic. Of the mild-mannered, earnest Americans the French statesman encountered, he observed: \u201cI have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers, but rather with guardians.\u201d It would be too much, he wrote, to call \u201cthe species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced\u201d by the old names of tyranny or despotism.\n\nThe oppression Tocqueville feared for America was much milder than that. He was thinking of a government that acts toward its citizens the way a doting parent does to a child, one that \u201ctakes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fate\u201d\u2014not to prepare them for manhood, or independence, but \u201cto keep them in perpetual childhood.\u201d\n\nA government like that would eventually sap a people\u2019s capacity, and even their desire, for self-government: \u201cFor their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness; it provides for their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances: what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?\u201d\n\nAnd here we are: those Americans most inclined to avail themselves of government benefits\u2014and to think of welfare as a beneficial thing in itself\u2014are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process. MacGillis notes correctly that voter participation in the poorest areas of country has been declining for years. The solution for Democrats, he argues, \u201cmeans redoubling efforts to mobilize the people who benefit from the programs,\u201d under the assumption that those who benefit from such programs will support politicians who champion them.\n\nBig Government Abandons People\u2019s Highest Aspirations Perhaps they will, but it doesn\u2019t seem to occur to MacGillis that what some welfare beneficiaries might want more than a government handout is a job, and that candidates who speak to those aspirations might have more appeal than the ones who offer welfare\u2014or welfare disguised as economic stimulus.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to occur to MacGillis that what some welfare beneficiaries might want more than a government handout is a job. Consider the coal industry. At no point does MacGillis question whether there might be a connection between the decline of Kentucky\u2019s coal industry and the Obama administration\u2019s draconian Environmental Protection Agency regulations under the Clean Power Plan. If coal country is abandoning candidates who champion progressive, big-government solutions, perhaps it\u2019s because many ex-miners feel they were abandoned by big government first.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be that hard to imagine why a miner deprived of his work because of government regulations should in turn resent welfare from that same government\u2014even if, at the end of the day, he begrudgingly accepts public assistance out of sheer necessity.\n\nLikewise, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to imagine why another man might gladly accept the same assistance and simply not work for as long as possible. Human nature can equally account for both responses, and it\u2019s a tribute to the intellectual isolation of our elites that such things don\u2019t even occur to them. As Kevin Williamson has noted, much of the debate between conservatives and liberals over welfare has to with \u201cwhether we are going to think of poor people as pets.\u201d\n\nThe likes of MacGillis or Frank or Paul Krugman look upon the non-voting poor of Appalachia and think more must be done for them, if not in direct welfare payments then in some other form of \u201ceconomic opportunity\u201d created on their behalf. This is a failure of imagination that Tocqueville, for one, didn\u2019t share. He knew that when a government treats its people like pets, \u201cit every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the uses of himself.\u201d No wonder they don\u2019t vote.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 01 Dec 2015 07:50:20 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The Americans most inclined to tap welfare are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process.", "title": "Why Poor Locales Vote For Welfare Slashers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Bevin1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-02T07:43:12+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/12/01/why-poor-locales-vote-for-people-who-promise-to-slash-welfare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The Americans most inclined to tap welfare are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process.", "title": "Why Poor Locales Vote For Welfare Slashers", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Bevin1.jpg"}, "creator": "@johnddavidson", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Government", "tag": "Alec MacGillis,Food Stamps,Matt Bevin,New York Times,Paul LePage,Thomas Frank,Welfare,welfare programs,welfare reform", "published_time": "2015-12-01T07:50:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T07:43:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Americans most inclined to tap welfare are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a30\"", "article_summary": "MacGillis is especially curious about poor whites in former Democratic strongholds like Kentucky, a state that in November replaced Democratic Gov.\nLePage won re-election by nearly five points, and as Bevin did in Kentucky, he carried parts of his state that most rely on welfare programs.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to occur to MacGillis that what some welfare beneficiaries might want more than a government handout is a job.\nIn a recent New York Times column, Alec MacGillis asks why so many poor Americans who benefit from welfare have lately been voting for Republican candidates who want to curtail those programs.\nThe Americans most inclined to tap government benefits and to think of welfare as a good thing are also the least likely to participate in the democratic process."}
