Update: A BCBS of Alabama customer has submitted a photo of their bill, showing the breakout of Affordable Care Act fees and taxes reported by Kaiser Health News and NPR.





The bill shows ACA taxes and fees of $18.76 on a total bill of $280.04, representing about 7 percent of the total bill.





Earlier: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama wants its customers to know that taxes on health insurance have increased due to the Affordable Care Act.





To convey that message, BCBS of Alabama will list those federal tax increases as a separate line item on consumer bills, according to NPR, citing a Kaiser Health News report.









BCBS of Alabama spokesperson Koko Mackin told NPR that the tax breakout accounts for four new charges: a $2 fee for the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; a premium tax of about 2 percent; a user fee of 3.5 percent to help pay for healthcare.gov; and an additional charge to pay for reinsurance.





Mark Hall, a law professor at Wake Forest University, told NPR that the tax should be thought of as a pass-through, rather than extra money in the federal government's coffers.





"The government doesn't keep the fee," he said. "It's just a pass-through, from some insurers to other insurers."
