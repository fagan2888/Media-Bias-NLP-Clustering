Research that could have been harmful to sugar industry interests was omitted,\u201d the authors note.\n\n\u201cWhat this shows is that sugar interests were running science manipulation in as sophisticated a manner as \u2018big tobacco\u2019 was back in the 50s and 60s,\u201d said UCSF Professor Stan Glantz, a co-author of the study and long time anti-tobacco advocate.\n\nMarion Nestle, professor nutrition of New York University was not involved in the analysis, which she called \u201cincredibly revealing.\u201d\n\nThe paper \u201cmakes it clear that the sugar industry systematically and deliberately adopted strategies to make sure that federal research agencies did not urge the public to cut down on sugar intake as a means to prevent tooth decay,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI can attest that the sugar industry is especially aggressive in defending itself against any suggestion to eat less and is following the tobacco industry\u2019s playbook.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Sugar Association said it \u201cquestions the relevance of attempts to dredge up history when decades of modern science has provided answers regarding the role of diet in the pathogenesis of dental caries.\u201d\n\nThe statement also says that the authors\u2019 \u201cuse of attention-grabbing headlines and scare tactics that liken consumption of all-natural sugar \u2026 to a known carcinogen is a \u2018textbook\u2019 play from the activist agenda.\u201d\n\nThe authors admit their analysis is limited because it \u201cprovides a narrow window into the activities of just one sugar industry trade association\u201d and that they could not \u201cinterview key actors.\u201d\n\nA Long Hunt\n\nCristin Kearns found the papers after a long hunt. In 2007, she says, while attending a conference, she was handed a government pamphlet titled, \u201cHow to Talk to Patients About Diabetes.\u201d She was startled that the diet advice didn\u2019t mention reducing sugar intake. It made her wonder if the sugar industry \u201csomehow impacted what the government can or cannot say about diet advice for diabetics?\u201d\n\nShe started searching online and, ultimately quit her day job. After months of looking, she uncovered some documents and ultimately identified the documents discussed in the analysis today.\n\nKearns says there are more documents to be found, \u201cjust need time and money to do it.\u201d And, with an eye toward the history of tobacco litigation, she believes litigation is \u201ccertainly a possibility\u201d in this case as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just begun to scratch the surface of understanding some of the tactics the sugar groups have implemented.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "UCSF researchers liken sugar industry strategies to those used by tobacco companies.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"'Sugar Papers' Show Industry's Influence in 1970s Dental Program, Study Says\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/10\\/sugar-papers-show-industrys-influence-in-1970s-dental-program-study-says\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-10 11:18:32\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-03-11 14:56:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24387,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Science\",\"Sugar\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/03\\/iStock_000015590176_Large-21-e1426011478306.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "UCSF researchers liken sugar industry strategies to those used by tobacco companies.", "title": "\u2018Sugar Papers\u2019 Show Industry\u2019s Influence in 1970s Dental Program, Study Says", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/10/sugar-papers-show-industrys-influence-in-1970s-dental-program-study-says/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/03/iStock_000015590176_Large-21-640x427.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science,sugar", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSeventy-eight percent of the sugar industry submission was incorporated into the NIDR\u2019s call for research applications.\nResearch that could have been harmful to sugar industry interests was omitted,\u201d the authors note.\nThe documents show that an expert panel formed by the sugar industry included all but one member of the government panel that was examining priorities for research.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only just begun to scratch the surface of understanding some of the tactics the sugar groups have implemented.\u201d\nIt made her wonder if the sugar industry \u201csomehow impacted what the government can or cannot say about diet advice for diabetics?\u201dShe started searching online and, ultimately quit her day job."}
