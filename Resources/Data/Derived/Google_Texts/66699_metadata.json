The bill passed by the House Thursday would require out-of-state retailers to collect state sales taxes.\n\nOklahomans are currently required to keep track of their out-of-state purchases and pay a use tax on their state tax returns. Caldwell says only 4 percent of taxpayers do that each year.\n\nThe Senate approved a similar measure, Senate Bill 1301, and sent it to the House.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday that would allow the state to collect sales tax on online purchases", "author": "NewsOn6.com and Wire Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31445442/oklahoma-house-approves-online-sales-tax-bill", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10077892_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday that would allow the state to collect sales tax on online purchases", "title": "Oklahoma House Approves Online Sales Tax Bill"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10077892_G.jpg", "description": "The Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday that would allow the state to collect sales tax on online purchases", "card": "summary", "title": "Oklahoma House Approves Online Sales Tax Bill"}, "wnreadableurl": "oklahoma-house-approves-online-sales-tax-bill", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/11", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "The Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday that would allow the state to collect sales tax on online purchasesThe House voted 51-39 in favor of House Bill 2531, the \"Oklahoma Retail Protection Act\" and sent in to the state Senate.\nOklahomans are currently required to keep track of their out-of-state purchases and pay a use tax on their state tax returns.\nThe bill passed by the House Thursday would require out-of-state retailers to collect state sales taxes.\nUnder current law, businesses with a physical presence in the state must collect and remit sales tax while out-of-state retailers are exempt.\nThe Senate approved a similar measure, Senate Bill 1301, and sent it to the House."}
