Each one of these situations was tragic for its own reasons, even gaining international publicity \u2013 the case in Canada regarding Baby Joseph, Eluana Englaro in Italy, and in the United States, Jahi McMath to name a few. We\u2019ve also been involved in hundreds of similar cases that did not receive the same kind of attention, but similarly, families were in desperate need to get help for their loved ones.\n\nFortunately, in the vast majority of these situations, we\u2019ve been successful using the Life & Hope resources to get these families the help they were seeking. This includes helping to save the lives of those who were in immediate threat of being killed.\n\nHowever, there is one case that stands out among all of the ones we\u2019ve been involved with the past ten years. Consider the situation involving 32 year-old, African American, Kyle Dantzler.\n\nWhen Kyle was 29 years of age, he needed kidney and liver transplants. Subsequent to this, in 2013, Kyle was having some health issues and was admitted to a leading university hospital in Philadelphia.\n\nKyle\u2019s mom, Bridgette Henson who lived near Atlanta, took temporary residence in Philadelphia and would visit her son daily. Soon after he was admitted to the hospital, and without warning, she arrived to find Kyle hooked up to life support machines. Ms. Henson later learned that her son had fully coded. Subsequently, his EEG showed no brain activity and he was diagnosed as \u201cbrain dead\u201d. His physicians urged Kyle\u2019s mom to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and remove his ventilator so Kyle would die. She refused.\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, Kyle began moving his arms, and his feet and would turn towards his mother when she called his name. His doctors said it wasn\u2019t \u201cpurposeful movement\u201d and wouldn\u2019t chart it because they hadn\u2019t observed his movements themselves. Eventually, proving his doctors wrong, Kyle began to breathe on his own. Then, thanks to his mother\u2019s persistent attention, Kyle began to receive rehabilitation.\n\nTragically, in March of 2014, while still at the hospital, Kyle coded for a second time. As a result, he once again experienced significant injury to his brain. It wasn\u2019t long when Kyle\u2019s mom was being pushed to move Kyle to hospice and \u201callow him to die\u201d, even though he wasn\u2019t dying.\n\nFor Kyle\u2019s safety and wellbeing, Ms. Henson decided she would try and move her son to a facility closer to her home in Georgia with the hopes of ultimately bringing Kyle home. That\u2019s when our organization was contacted by Ms. Henson for help.\n\nIn February 2015 Kyle was moved to a Colquitt, Georgia nursing home several hours from Ms. Henson\u2019s home. It was a nightmare. Despite the nursing home\u2019s willingness to accept Kyle, their mentality was similar to what Kyle was experiencing at the previous facilities. As a result, his health worsened.\n\nBecause of Kyle\u2019s grave condition, and with the aid of the professionals who are part of our network, Kyle was admitted to one of the most prominent hospitals in Atlanta, where he is presently being treated at their intensive care unit.\n\nOne would expect being with treated in their ICU that this young man would be out of harm\u2019s way. This is not the case. Kyle\u2019s mom continues to be in a situation of never-ending battles of uncertainly, not knowing whether or not Kyle will get the aggressive help he needs.\n\nRemarkably, Kyle still shows signs of responsiveness, and at times he desperately tries to communicate with his mom. Nonetheless, it has become painfully evident that this current hospital \u2013 just like the preceding caregivers \u2013 has clearly given up on this young man, providing him with only the minimal care that his insurance will cover. This is evidenced by the more than half-a-dozen pressure sores (commonly known as bed sores) Kyle has over his body (one he recently acquired). Not to mention the ongoing stress they are putting on his mom to find another facility to care for her son.\n\nIndeed, it took a meeting with Ms. Henson\u2019s attorney to persuade this hospital to stop the palliative care team from repeatedly asking her to move Kyle to hospice (again, Kyle is not dying), and to increase his food intake as he clearly shows signs of malnutrition.\n\nThe question is why? Why is this young man not getting the proper treatment he needs to help him improve? At least find a way to help treat the horrific pressure sores that are now covering his malnourished body.\n\nKyle doesn\u2019t lack the will to live. Nor does his heroic mother lack the conviction to fight for her son in the hopes of meaningful rehabilitation. But Kyle\u2019s situation appears grim, despite the heroism and resolve of those closest to him.\n\nSadly, our healthcare system is severely broken\u2014it was broken before President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and it\u2019s broken in many ways today, which has led to a system the experts have been warning about.\n\nHaving been involved in this issue and in cases like this for over ten years, and in particular, advocating for Kyle, it has become disturbingly clear that if you don\u2019t have the financial resources, then you aren\u2019t going to get the help you may need, even if it means denying you the very treatments that could help.\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ\n\nIn particular, if you are deemed too costly and the hospital wants to end your life, it is likely that steps will be taken to do just that. Either deliberately or, as in Kyle\u2019s case, by providing inadequate care. And this can be accomplished legally, without consequence.\n\nQuite simply, our nation has no idea what has happened to the laws that used to protect our medically vulnerable, but are now targeting these individuals as a solution to fix this growing financial situation.\n\nHowever, as much as we want to use the excuse of the affordability of caring for our medically vulnerable, the government has the funds available to care for these persons. Just look at the 2014 report by the Heritage Foundation, Federal Spending by the Numbers. Among the more than 50 examples of how the government wasted billions upon billions of our tax dollars, it exposed that the Department of Defense destroyed $1.2 billion worth of ammunition because it did not have an effective inventory system.\n\nThe Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network believes in a healthcare system that prioritizes hope over the sort of hopelessness that threatens to doom Kyle\u2019s chances of recovery. Criticism of any specific hospital or medical center is rooted in hopefulness for their embrace of an even higher standard of care, and our vision for a national healthcare system with a mandate to help those like Kyle recover.\n\nWe eagerly await healthcare reforms that will inspire not only greater hopefulness within hospitals, but also provide the necessary funding for national recovery centers for those we presently consider hopeless.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not All Black Lives Matter", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Since my family established the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network in response to my sister Terri\u2019s March 2005 death, we have been involved in several high", "title": "Not All Black Lives Matter", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/10/26/not-all-black-lives-matter/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KyleDantzler.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "not all black lives matter", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Tragically, in March of 2014, while still at the hospital, Kyle coded for a second time.\nKyle\u2019s mom, Bridgette Henson who lived near Atlanta, took temporary residence in Philadelphia and would visit her son daily.\nHis physicians urged Kyle\u2019s mom to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and remove his ventilator so Kyle would die.\nIt wasn\u2019t long when Kyle\u2019s mom was being pushed to move Kyle to hospice and \u201callow him to die\u201d, even though he wasn\u2019t dying.\nThis includes helping to save the lives of those who were in immediate threat of being killed."}
