A powerful storm system has flooded parts of Texas, closing roads and causing a freight train to derail.

A Union Pacific freight train derailed before dawn today near Corsicana, about 50 miles south of Dallas, because a creek overflowed and washed away the tracks. A railroad spokesman said the two crew members swam to safety and nobody was hurt.

Authorities have reopened a section of Interstate 45 near Corsicana that was closed overnight due to flooding, backing up traffic for 12 miles.

The National Weather Service says Corsicana has received more than 18 inches of rain since Friday morning. The town of Powell, just east of Corsicana, had more than 20 inches of rain.

Many parts of Texas, including its biggest cities, are under flash flood watches through Sunday or Monday.

Flight tracker flightaware.com reported that about 100 flights have been canceled today at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
