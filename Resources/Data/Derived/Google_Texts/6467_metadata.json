(NASDAQ: PCYC), a Sunnyvale-based clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative oncology and immune-mediated diseases drugs, announced Thursday its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2013.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong earnings were as expected, given the promising developments since the third quarter, including the FDA\u2019s approval of its drug, Imbruvica, for treatment of those with mantle cell lymphoma, and the FDA\u2019s granting Imbruvica with three Therapy Designation status \u2013 a first for any oncology drug.\n\nPharmacyclics reported a net income of $64.2 million, or 82 cents per diluted share for the fourth quarter, which surpasses the $41.9 million, or 56 cents per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nThe earnings per diluted share beat out analysts\u2019 prevailing estimate of 68 cents, a surprise of 120.6 percent, repeating the previous year\u2019s performance, in which the earnings per diluted share outperformed expectations by 133 percent.\n\nContributing to this increase in total revenue was six weeks\u2019 worth of Imbruvica sales following the drug\u2019s first FDA approval on Nov. 13, 2013. Chief Executive Officer Robert Duggan said he considers that first approval to be \u201ca major corporate milestone for Pharmacyclics, and allowed us to establish ourselves as a commercial corporation.\u201d\n\nIn the time between the November approval and fourth quarter end on Dec. 31, 2013, Imbruvica\u2019s sales revenue amounted to $13.6 million.\n\nIn response to Imbruvica\u2019s total sales revenue thus far, analyst Katherine Xu of William Blair & Co. stated, \u201cWe had expected Imbruvica sales revenue to amount to $6.4 million, and Wall Street had expected only $4 million in sales, so the actual number of $13.6 million is a pleasant surprise.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Gregory Wade of Wedbush Securities expressed a similar sentiment, stating, \u201cBefore the earnings release, we expected that Imbruvica sales revenue would be $4.9 million. It surpassed our expectations.\u201d\n\nThe increase in earnings is the result of not only the FDA\u2019s approvals regarding Imbruvica, and subsequent sales, but earnings were also boosted by Pharmacyclics\u2019 license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. In the last quarter of 2013, Janssen Biotech provided Pharmacyclics with $110 million in milestone payments.\n\nTotal revenue rose by 113 percent, reported at $123.6 million, compared to 2012\u2019s fourth quarter total revenue of $58 million.\n\nGiven the promising results of the last quarter of 2013, and the most recent clinical developments since, Chief Financial Officer Manmeet Soni was optimistic about 2014, remarking, \u201cWe are enthusiastic for the earnings results from the first quarter of 2014, and beyond.\u201d\n\nAnalysts echoed that enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cWe think Imbruvica will become the biggest drug in oncology,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first and best in the new wave of blood cancer treatment, and based on the drug profile and analysis of the competitive landscape, we expect peak sales of around $9 billion annually in 15 years from now.\u201d\n\nAt the close of trading, Pharmacyclics shares gained $8.93, or 6.26 percent, to close at $151.61.\n\nShares fluctuated slightly during after-hours trading, reaching a high of $151.98.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gianni Sun,health,Imbruvica,medical,medicine,NASDAQ: PCYC,Pharmacyclics,Sunnyvale,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Health,Science & Tech", "description": "The Sunnyvale-based company\u2019s strong earnings were as expected, given the promising developments since the third quarter, including the FDA\u2019s approval of\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98a8\"", "article_summary": "Total revenue rose by 113 percent, reported at $123.6 million, compared to 2012\u2019s fourth quarter total revenue of $58 million.\nContributing to this increase in total revenue was six weeks\u2019 worth of Imbruvica sales following the drug\u2019s first FDA approval on Nov. 13, 2013.\nIn the last quarter of 2013, Janssen Biotech provided Pharmacyclics with $110 million in milestone payments.\nPharmacyclics, Inc.
