At the same time he scolds that Christian belief dictates we must not \u201coppress the stranger\u201d if those strangers happen to be four or five million illegals who are new potential Democratic voters, his enforcer Attorney General Eric Holder oppresses The Little Sisters of the Poor into court. Obama\u2019s administration thinks it\u2019s more important to force this group of Catholic nuns to violate their religious beliefs by providing Obamacare abortion-inducing drugs than to allow them to help the elderly poor and dying unmolested by an autocratic government.\n\nThere is perhaps no group on earth more deeply ministering to others than these nuns who for over 175 years have been caring for the poorest of strangers \u2013 the elderly, sick and dying in 30 countries worldwide. Their founder, Jeanne Jugan, was born during the French Revolution. One cold night in the winter of 1839 she took pity on a blind, paralyzed old woman in the snow and carried her home to sleep in her own bed. Soon people began bringing destitute old women to Jeanne\u2019s doorstep and she cared for them too, assisted by pious friends.\n\nThe Little Sisters had founded dozens of homes in Europe by the time a small group crossed the sea to America to establish a home in Brooklyn in 1868. Since then, over 30 of their homes minister to the impoverished elderly in the U.S., and care for over 13,000 needy worldwide. Last January the Supreme Court delayed the fines which would be imposed by Obamacare on the Little Sisters which could amount to as much as 2.5 million a year. In response, the government displayed its callous indifference to the poor by doubling down. Recently government attorneys in Denver\u2019s 10th Circuit Court of Appeals argued the Little Sisters must comply with Obamacare mandates.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Sr. Loraine Marie Maguire, Mother Provincial of the Little Sisters of the Poor, said, \u201c\u2026we offer the neediest elderly of every race and religion a home where they will be welcomed as Christ, cared for as family and accompanied with dignity until God calls them to Himself. But now the government demands we choose between our care for the elderly poor and our faith\u2026 to either violate our conscience or take millions of dollars that we raise by begging for the care of the elderly poor and instead pay fines to the IRS.\u201d The Little Sisters seem to be singled out by an administration that already exempts many corporations and businesses from Obamacare mandates.\n\nClearly, Jesus\u2019 instruction for Christians to care for the poor and the sick doesn\u2019t carry as much weight for the Obama administration as the Biblical command to take in illegal immigrants. Oh wait, there isn\u2019t one.\n\nThe Obama administration tends to choose their command and control birth control ideology over the needs of the poor. In 2011 they ended a relationship with Catholic bishops\u2019 Migration and Refugee Services Office to help refugees, immigrant families and trafficking victims because the bishops refused to provide contraceptive and abortion counseling.\n\nIt\u2019s also apparent that Obama\u2019s Christianity fails to heed Christ\u2019s final words as he prepared to leave the planet, known as the Great Commission to: \u201cgo into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d\n\nIncredibly, two Baptist chaplains say they were forced out of a one-year Veterans Affairschaplain training after their instructor pounded the table, insisting they stop quoting the Bible and praying in Jesus\u2019 name. According to the federal lawsuit the Conservative Baptist Association of America filed in 2013, the Christians were ridiculed and harassed for their beliefs, leading to one leaving the program while the other was kicked out. The course is required to work as a chaplain in a VA hospital so this anti-Christian bigotry also deprived them of their right to make a living.\n\nTheir attorney John Wells called the treatment a violation of federal law and the religious freedom of the First Amendment. The training was led by Nancy Dietsch, a Department of Veterans Affairs employee with a history of antagonistic behavior towards evangelicals, Wells said. \u201cShe\u2019s been very, very critical of Christians\u2026Instead of teaching anything dealing with faith issues, she\u2019s dealing with a holistic, humanistic approach\u2026that the spirit comes from within.\u201d Wells added that it seems the government is trying to establish \u201ca secular humanist-based religion free from any influence of Christian dogma.\u201d\n\nChristians were actually branded terrorists at a 2013 U.S. Army Reserve Equal Opportunity training in which the instructor presented a slide with the headline \u201cRELIGIOUS EXTREMISM,\u201d listing \u201cEvangelical Christians\u201d as the number one extremist threat. Published in the UK Daily Mail and elsewhere, the slide claims Christianity is more dangerous than the Muslim Brotherhood which comes in at number two. \u201cUltra-orthodox Judaism\u201d is listed as the number three terrorist threat, and anyone with \u201cChristian identity\u201d in the U.S. comes in at number four, more dangerous than the murdering terrorists of Al Qaeda and Hamas which are five and six.\n\nCalling terrorists the nearly 80 percent of Americans who say they\u2019re Christian awoke the ire of the Archdiocese for the Military Services which complained to the Army, noting that Catholics were number 10 on the terrorist list. The military brass said they had no clue how this happened and denied it was condoned by the Army.\n\nAnti-Christian harassment at veteran funerals at the Houston National Cemetery also led three veterans service organizations to sue the federal government in 2011. According to court documents, Veterans Affairs officials ordered volunteers to stop telling families 'God bless you' at funerals and said that the words 'God bless' had to be removed from condolence cards.\n\nOminously, more is on the way with the government threatening to court-martial soldiers or make them face criminal punishment such as imprisonment for merely talking about their faith or sharing the gospel. So now the government is banning not only freedom of speech and religion, but the Great Commission itself.\n\nThe president who declared America \u201cno longer a Christian nation\u201d seems to be intent on validating his claim. For now, we can thank God we can still worship Him and say Merry Christmas to all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama has a strangely inconsistent view of Christianity..05/27/2016 1:12:41AM EST.", "author": "Joy  Overbeck", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Barack Obama has a strangely inconsistent view of Christianity.", "title": "Joy  Overbeck - Barack Obama\u2019s Contradictory Christianity", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/joyoverbeck/2014/12/23/barack-obamas-contradictory-christianity-n1934141", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/350/2014-12-17T025948Z_1_LYNXMPEABG02L_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Barack Obama has a strangely inconsistent view of Christianity.", "title": "Joy  Overbeck - Barack Obama\u2019s Contradictory Christianity", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/joyoverbeck/2014/12/23/barack-obamas-contradictory-christianity-n1934141", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/350/2014-12-17T025948Z_1_LYNXMPEABG02L_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Barack Obama\u2019s Contradictory Christianity, Joy  Overbeck, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Recently government attorneys in Denver\u2019s 10th Circuit Court of Appeals argued the Little Sisters must comply with Obamacare mandates.\nThe Little Sisters had founded dozens of homes in Europe by the time a small group crossed the sea to America to establish a home in Brooklyn in 1868.\nLast January the Supreme Court delayed the fines which would be imposed by Obamacare on the Little Sisters which could amount to as much as 2.5 million a year.\nPublished in the UK Daily Mail and elsewhere, the slide claims Christianity is more dangerous than the Muslim Brotherhood which comes in at number two.\nObama\u2019s administration thinks it\u2019s more important to force this group of Catholic nuns to violate their religious beliefs by providing Obamacare abortion-inducing drugs than to allow them to help the elderly poor and dying unmolested by an autocratic government."}
