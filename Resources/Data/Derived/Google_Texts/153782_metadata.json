The media were oddly uninterested in that alarming fact.\n\nBut today, Todd Purdum at Politico exposed how Republicans sabotaged the ACA rollout. One small part of their plan was the rejection of the state run exchanges.\n\nBut also, Purdum points out, Republicans refused to fund the extra work on the website after the states refused to do their parts, leaving the administration to cobble funding together for Healthcare.Gov. Putting this extra burden on the website was a deliberate effort to cause the law to \u201cimplode\u201d on itself.\n\nBut the bitter fight over passage was only the beginning of the war to stop Obamacare. Most Republican governors declined to create their own state insurance exchanges \u2014 an option inserted in the bill in the Senate to appeal to the classic conservative preference for local control \u2014 forcing the federal government to take at least partial responsibility for creating marketplaces serving 36 states \u2014 far more than ever intended. Then congressional Republicans refused repeatedly to appropriate dedicated funds to do all that extra work, leaving the Health and Human Services Department and other agencies to cobble together HealthCare.gov by redirecting funds from existing programs. On top of that, nearly half of the states declined to expand their Medicaid programs using federal funds, as the law envisioned.\n\nThe Republican manufactured shutdown on the very day of the opening of the exchanges further burdened the administration and disrupted last minute efforts regarding the rollout. This seems like common sense; it\u2019s amazing that the media never asked Republicans about this in all of their incessant complaining about the website that they sabotaged.\n\nAnd the cherry:\n\nIn fact, putting an excessive burden on the federal government was the explicit aim of the law\u2019s opponents. \u201cCongress authorized no funds for federal \u2018fallback\u2019 exchanges,\u201d the Tea Party Patriots website noted as long ago as last December. \u201cSo Washington may not be able to impose exchanges on states at all.\u201d The group went on to suggest that since Washington was not equipped to handle so many state exchanges, \u201cboth financially and otherwise \u2014 this means the entire law could implode on itself.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to read the entire piece, as I narrowed this down to the salient point that caught my eye since I\u2019ve been suggesting that the Republican states refusals to implement the exchanges placed an extra burden on the federal site and had an impact on the rollout from the beginning. Capacity is a huge part of any website. Their careful denying of funding and public plans that the combination of these forces would prove too much for the website and thus cause the law to implode shows their desperate dedication to destroying ObamaCare.\n\nThe entire two page piece carefully lays out the planned sabotage of ObamaCare. The Republican ability to surgically coordinate these plans and never get busted by the media is impressive. Or it would be if our media weren\u2019t so pathetic. Their plan is still a fail, though, as a failed website was never going to destroy the law. Relying on their illogical, mad belief system is exactly why Republicans can\u2019t get their act together.\n\nRepublicans might not be winning the messaging with their constant destruction of everything in their paths, but they are hurting this country.\n\nTypically, most Democrats \u2014 including Kathleen Sebelius \u2014 refuse to point the finger at Republicans. It\u2019s rude, childish and unfitting. Instead they play the grown up, taking responsibility because the buck stops with them. That is as it should be, but it\u2019s a big fail in this political climate.\n\nDemocrats need to drive these truths home and force the media to cover them. Politicians are the actors and the beltway media is TMZ. Make a stir. Show some metaphorical leg. Point fingers.\n\nYes, it will be degrading and ugly, but the truth is that Republicans are never going to stop this \u2013 they can\u2019t be taught to behave and put country first. They will have to be shamed by the truth each time.\n\nThis media is lazy and they like their narratives to paint the Obama (who refuses to do the beltway thing) as the bad guy. That\u2019s fine for him, as he\u2019s not facing re-election, but Democratic lawmakers can\u2019t afford to let the media chase Republican narratives anymore.\n\nIf for no other reason than this is hurting our country, Democrats need to buck up and kick back. Drop some soundbites, craft a narrative, be outraged. It\u2019s theater, and the most dramatic wins when the media has turned into a Beltway TMZ.\n\nImage: Crooks and Liars", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans refused to fund the extra work on the website after the states refused to do their parts, leaving the administration to cobble funding together for Healthcare.Gov.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Republicans refused to fund the extra work on the website after the states refused to do their parts, leaving the administration to cobble funding together for Healthcare.Gov.", "title": "Republicans Deliberately Sabotaged the ACA Website, Hoping the Law Would Implode", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/01/republicans-deliberately-sabotaged-aca-website-hoping-implode.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-01-at-11.23.05-AM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-02T11:07:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-01T11:35:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-02T11:07:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Putting this extra burden on the website was a deliberate effort to cause the law to \u201cimplode\u201d on itself.\nBut today, Todd Purdum at Politico exposed how Republicans sabotaged the ACA rollout.\n\u201cCongress authorized no funds for federal \u2018fallback\u2019 exchanges,\u201d the Tea Party Patriots website noted as long ago as last December.\nThis seems like common sense; it\u2019s amazing that the media never asked Republicans about this in all of their incessant complaining about the website that they sabotaged.\nTheir plan is still a fail, though, as a failed website was never going to destroy the law."}
