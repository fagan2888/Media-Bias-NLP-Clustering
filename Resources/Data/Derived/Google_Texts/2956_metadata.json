It did so later Thursday.\n\nThe Augusta Republican said he believes the effort will be the first of his goals to come to fruition, adding that legislation he endorsed to revoke the Affordable Care Act, limit House and Senate terms to 12 years, and require the president to propose a balanced federal budget could be the toughest to accomplish.\n\nPresident Obama has threatened to veto legislation that would tweak his health care package. A similar balanced-budget amendment to approve spending plans only where total expenditures didn\u2019t exceed total revenue \u2013 unless with a 60 percent vote from Congress \u2013 failed in 2011.\n\n\u201cOur country is at a critical crossroads and I ran on the conviction \u2026 to make real solutions for citizens both nationwide and in Georgia\u2019s 12th Congressional District,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe must turn around our economy and strengthen our financial position for future generations.\u201d\n\nAllen said he plans to leverage his experiences as a grandfather, knowledge as a local construction company owner and power on the House\u2019s Agriculture and Education and Workforce committees to equip workers and farmers with the tools they need to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nHe said the Keystone pipeline would provide an estimated 42,000 construction jobs, yield $2 billion in national earnings and reduce oil imports from the Middle East.\n\nHe said he\u2019ll turn his attention to repealing the health care law in the coming weeks, when Congress might have to override a presidential veto if a bill passes the Senate, while also working to corral government, which he said \u201ccontinues to spend beyond its means.\u201d\n\nA crowd of more than 100 family and friends applauded Allen\u2019s plan.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dudley Bowen Jr., a friend of Allen\u2019s, said that Allen\u2019s construction company fought hard through many change-order negotiations to build the Plaza Building at Augusta\u2019s Federal Justice Center, but that Allen was always pleasant and willing to negotiate.\n\n\u201cEveryone worked out their differences in a friendly and cordial fashion,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nAllen choked up as he said he has been overwhelmed by the support he and his wife, Robin, have received since they decided to run against Democratic U.S. Rep. John Barrow last March.\n\n\u201cRobin said we have to do this, and folks we can do this,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe are humbled by the faith you have placed in me and I look forward to making a difference in Washington.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Government, Metro, Wesley Brown", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "U.S. Rep.
