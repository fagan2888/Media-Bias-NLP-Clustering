Vermont's exchange, which has struggled, scored the highest, deemed fully operational in three of four categories.\n\nThe report rated Connecticut\u2019s exchange as \u201cpartially operational\u201d in all four.\n\nThe report did not identify specific issues with Connecticut's exchange, but said the \"partially operational\" designation was used to indicate that functions either didn\u2019t work as intended, hadn\u2019t been fully implemented, or required the use of manual processes in addition to automated functions.\n\nSome aspects of the system used by Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT, include manual processes.\n\nFor example, the exchange\u2019s eligibility system can determine if a person is eligible for Medicaid or a private insurance plan, but if a person signs up for Medicaid, his or her information must be manually entered into the state Department of Social Services\u2019 eligibility management system, which cannot communicate with the exchange enrollment system. Last year, delays in getting people\u2019s information into the Medicaid eligibility system led to some new clients being unable to fill prescriptions or schedule doctors\u2019 appointments.\n\nThe state is in the midst of a multiyear project to replace the DSS system, which was implemented in 1989. The replacement is expected to, among other things, communicate with the eligibility system.\n\nSimilarly, Access Health uses a manual process to verify whether a person applying for coverage is in the country legally if an initial check is inconclusive, rather than using a separate federal process. Access Health CEO Jim Wadleigh said the exchange opted not to use the federal process because of concerns that it could take longer for applicants\u2019 information to be verified.\n\n\"We think our process is better,\" he said.\n\nDSS officials have favored more automation, including using the federal system for verifying lawful presence, a spokesman said.\n\nThe report also listed Connecticut\u2019s exchange as being partially operational in financial management functions like collecting premiums for insurance plans and giving them to insurers, and submitting information to the Internal Revenue Service about tax credits used to subsidize customers\u2019 premiums.\n\nWadleigh questioned the report\u2019s characterization of the exchange\u2019s IT functions. Access Health never implemented a financial management system to collect customers\u2019 premiums; instead, customers pay insurers directly. In addition, Wadleigh said the exchange has been providing information to the IRS on a daily basis. He said he also wasn\u2019t sure what aspects of the eligibility and enrollment system the report had deemed less than fully operational.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a point in time,\u201d Wadleigh said of the report. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to read through it and try to understand the background where they made suggestions. As has always been the case with all of our audits, we will continue to improve our system.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, as of March, Connecticut had received $175 million in federal grants for marketplace activities, including $116.4 million authorized for IT. As of March, Access Health had spent $76.8 million on IT.\n\nMembers of Congress requested the review of state and federal actions related to IT projects for insurance exchanges in the wake of problems people had applying for coverage and accessing exchange systems during the first open enrollment period, which began in 2013.\n\nThe report noted that the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the exchanges, had conducted operational readiness reviews of the state-run marketplaces in advance of the first open enrollment period, but \u201cconditionally passed all of those states without fully ensuring that they had conducted all required system testing and demonstrated that their systems were ready for production.\u201d\n\nConnecticut\u2019s exchange fared better than many during the first open enrollment period, although it was not immune to glitches. The GAO report noted that Maryland used Connecticut\u2019s system for the following year, and said that system \u201chad been successfully implemented in Connecticut.\u201d\n\nIn a response included in the report, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wrote that state-run exchanges faced tight implementation timeframes and said some \u201cdeferred automating functionality and utilized operational workarounds to provide their consumers the best possible eligibility and enrollment experience.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges, the agency added, nearly 2.2 million people signed up for coverage during the first three months of the first open enrollment period.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/17/gao-still-work-to-do-on-obamacare-exchange-it-systems/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/17/gao-still-work-to-do-on-obamacare-exchange-it-systems/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "More than a year after launching, state-run health insurance exchanges, including Connecticut's, still hadn't fully completed key information technology functions, federal auditors said in a report released Wednesday.", "title": "GAO: Still work to do on Obamacare state exchange IT systems", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/17/gao-still-work-to-do-on-obamacare-exchange-it-systems/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/11/access-health-store-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/17/gao-still-work-to-do-on-obamacare-exchange-it-systems/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fae\"", "article_summary": "No state was deemed to be fully operational in all categories.\nVermont's exchange, which has struggled, scored the highest, deemed fully operational in three of four categories.\nDSS officials have favored more automation, including using the federal system for verifying lawful presence, a spokesman said.\nHe said he also wasn\u2019t sure what aspects of the eligibility and enrollment system the report had deemed less than fully operational.\nSome aspects of the system used by Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT, include manual processes."}
