Briere, 37, will miss his eighth consecutive game Tuesday night against the visiting Nashville Predators and is unlikely to play Thursday against the Winnipeg Jets or in Saturday\u2019s season finale against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cRight now it doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said regarding Briere, who suffered a foot injury March 23 at Calgary. \u201cObviously, I would like to see him play a game (before) the end.\u201d\n\nBriere is in the final year of a contract paying him $4 million annually, and the Avs undoubtedly will devote that money to a younger player next season. Briere was acquired from Montreal last summer for forward P.A. Parenteau and a draft pick.\n\nBriere and Parenteau are both making $4 million this season, but Parenteau is signed through next season. The trade was about contract length as much as personnel.\n\nBriere was a 1996 first-round draft pick of Arizona Coyotes and is playing for his sixth NHL team. In addition to his 307 career regular-season goals, Briere is stuck on 971 games played and 696 points.\n\nHe is tied for 46th all-time in playoff goals with 53.\n\nThe Avs will make Briere and the other injured players \u2014 including all-star defenseman Erik Johnson and teenage forward Nathan MacKinnon \u2014 available to the media Saturday.\n\nFootnotes. Rookie forward Borna Rendulic, who hasn\u2019t played since fracturing his leg Jan. 17 at Tampa Bay, completed Tuesday\u2019s skate in a regular sweater, but is not a candidate to return to the lineup this season, Roy said. Rendulic \u2014 the first Croatian-born player to score a goal in the NHL \u2014 will enter the offseason close to full-strength. \u2026 Semyon Varlamov will start against the Predators and Saturday against the Blackhawks. Backup Reto Berra is scheduled to play against the Jets on Thursday.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Daniel Briere might finish NHL career on the Avs\u2019 injured list", "title": "Daniel Briere might finish NHL career on the Avs\u2019 injured list", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/07/daniel-briere-might-finish-nhl-career-on-the-avs-injured-list/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150407_122710_daniel-briere.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150407_122710_daniel-briere.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-07T12:22:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T04:59:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Avalanche forward Daniel Briere did not participate in the morning skate Tuesday and might conclude his 307-goal NHL career on the team\u2019s crowded injured list.\n\u201cRight now it doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said regarding Briere, who suffered a foot injury March 23 at Calgary.\nBriere and Parenteau are both making $4 million this season, but Parenteau is signed through next season.\nThe Avs will make Briere and the other injured players \u2014 including all-star defenseman Erik Johnson and teenage forward Nathan MacKinnon \u2014 available to the media Saturday.\nBriere was a 1996 first-round draft pick of Arizona Coyotes and is playing for his sixth NHL team."}
