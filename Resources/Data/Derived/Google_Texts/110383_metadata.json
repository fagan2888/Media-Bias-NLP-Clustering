(WNCN) \u2013 The North Carolina Department of Insurance has been swamped with complaints about Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, it said Thursday.\n\n\u201cTo say that people are frustrated is an understatement. I\u2019m frustrated, too,\u201d Insurance commissioner Wayne Goodwin said in a statement. \u201cAs Insurance Commissioner, I will get answers from Blue Cross as to how this happened and assurances that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nThe department said it has received more than 850 complaints since Jan. 4 related to overbilling, inability to verify effective coverage, and lack of a way to pay premiums due to company system errors.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina said Jan. 11 that about 3,200 customers had the incorrect amount deducted from their checks, but said a day later that most of the issues had been resolved.\n\nCEO Brad Wilson, in a radio advertisement, said, \u201cThese difficulties are unacceptable and we apologize. To improve this situation, we are working around the clock\u2014bringing in more staff and expanding customer service hours.\u201d\n\nBut the Department of Insurance said it was still overrun with complaints. A statement said the problems were \u201cputting a strain on consumer assistance resources at the N.C. Department of Insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina accountable for fixing its problems and doing right by consumers,\u201d said Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin. \u201cIn the meantime, I have shifted additional staff members to the phones at the Department of Insurance to help people get the health care they need.\u201d\n\nIn response, Blue Cross and Blue Shield said in a statement, \u201cWe share the Commissioner\u2019s frustration that we have not been able to provide the level of service our customers have come to expect. We are working diligently to resolve these issues as quickly as possible in collaboration with the Department. We are truly sorry for the difficulties that our customers are experiencing.\u201d\n\nNCDOI\u2019s first priority is assisting people with urgent medical and prescription needs. The department has successfully escalated cases to BCBSNC\u2019s attention for people in need of care for conditions including high-risk pregnancies, heart issues, cancer and diabetes, or services including emergency surgeries, MRIs and CT scans.\n\n\u201cTo say that people are frustrated is an understatement. I\u2019m frustrated, too,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cAs Insurance Commissioner, I will get answers from Blue Cross as to how this happened and assurances that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nConsumers in need of assistance from the N.C.
