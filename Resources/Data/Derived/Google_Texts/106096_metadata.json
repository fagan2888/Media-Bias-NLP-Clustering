The agency warned those two states that their plans to terminate Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood may illegally restrict beneficiary access to services, the spokesperson said in a statement. [\u2026] Federal law requires state Medicaid programs to cover family-planning services and supplies for anyone of child-bearing age. Ending the agreements with Planned Parenthood would limit beneficiaries' access to care and services from qualified providers of their choice, according to HHS.\n\nAlabama and Louisiana of course had made the decision to defund Planned Parenthood after a series of secretly recorded videos came out exposing that the group sells babies\u2019 body parts, among other disturbing practices.\n\nBut is what these states are doing really illegal? LifeNews.com reports that no, it isn\u2019t:\n\nAccording to the Medicaid provider contract between DHH and Planned Parenthood, along with relevant Louisiana law, either party can choose to cancel the contract at will after providing written notice.\n\nLouisiana for its part is refusing to back down, a spokesman for Gov. Bobby Jindal said, reports The Hill.\n\nHe cited a provision in the state Medicaid contract allowing either party to cancel it at will, with 30 days notice. \u201cCMS reached out to DHH after we canceled the Medicaid provider contract with Planned Parenthood,\u201d Reed said. \u201cDHH explained to CMS why the state chose to exercise our right to cancel the contract without cause.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood said the group will do \u201ceverything in our power to protect women\u2019s access to health care in all fifty states.\u201d\n\nGiven that the White House believes the group follows such \u201chigh ethical standards\u201d it\u2019s likely the administration will do everything it can to make sure the abortion giant has access to all the taxpayer money it can in each and every state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of course they did. .05/26/2016 0:12:32AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Of course they did.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Obama Admin Threatens States That Defunded Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/08/13/fed-threatens-states-which-defund-planned-parenthood-n2038560", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/69/c1688008-bad1-460b-9e70-a1f4a4229f4a.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Of course they did.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Obama Admin Threatens States That Defunded Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/08/13/fed-threatens-states-which-defund-planned-parenthood-n2038560", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/69/c1688008-bad1-460b-9e70-a1f4a4229f4a.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Admin Threatens States That Defunded Planned Parenthood, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd218d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCMS reached out to DHH after we canceled the Medicaid provider contract with Planned Parenthood,\u201d Reed said.\nStates wanting to defund abortion giant Planned Parenthood better think again, federal officials are warning.\nHe cited a provision in the state Medicaid contract allowing either party to cancel it at will, with 30 days notice.\nEnding the agreements with Planned Parenthood would limit beneficiaries' access to care and services from qualified providers of their choice, according to HHS.\nThe agency warned those two states that their plans to terminate Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood may illegally restrict beneficiary access to services, the spokesperson said in a statement."}
