Deborah Ross and Spring Lake Mayor Chris Rey said they supported a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country unlawfully, while Kevin Griffin of Durham and Ernest Reeves of Greenville did not support that plan. Griffin outlined a work permit program and Reeves offered \u201ca pathway to stay.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic hopefuls agreed on bringing Syrian refugees into the country, provided they pass a comprehensive screening process; tweaking the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation; and raising the minimum wage.\n\nThe only interaction between candidates came toward the end of the half-hour debate. Griffin threw a jab during closing remarks, criticizing Ross for not responding to voters\u2019 comments on her Facebook page. Ross replied that she\u2019s spoken to thousands of voters in person or over the phone.\n\nThe debate, held by WRAL-TV and moderated by veteran anchor David Crabtree, is the only Democratic debate scheduled in the primary and the biggest exposure the contenders have received before voters. Ross is the only candidate who has bought television spots.\n\nThe Democrats are seeking to replace U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican who is running for his third term.
