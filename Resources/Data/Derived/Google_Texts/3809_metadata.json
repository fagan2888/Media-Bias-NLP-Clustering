From NPR to The New York Times they\u2019re talking about where people were when they found out they had won the MacArthur Fellowship, our society\u2019s most prestigious honor. Twenty-one of these so-called \u201cGenius Grants\u201d were announced two weeks ago by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago; they carry with them a prize of $625,000, to be spent over the course of five years however the Genius in question wishes.\n\nOver the years, stories on the subject have always seemed to start with the phone call from MacArthur HQ in Chicago. Where was the Genius when he or she got the call? What was it like to find out that someone was giving you all that moolah? The famous critic, it was reported, finds she must sit down. The Southerner lets rip with a yell. The cellist thinks it\u2019s a wrong number. The bioengineer thinks it\u2019s a prank. The radio pioneer, who\u2019s visiting a remote Mexican village, has to make his way to the town\u2019s only phone. Their lives have been changed! Here is my favorite, from a 1992 article about the Genius Grants in The New York Times:\n\n\u201cAnd once there was only a long silence, then a distant thump: the sound of a body hitting a laboratory floor in Cambridge, Mass., as a winner fainted.\u201d\n\nAll harmless and amusing stuff, of course. No, the Parable of the Phone Call has nothing to do with brilliance, or merit, or creativity, or whatever it is the Genius Grants are supposed to commemorate, but one can hardly blame the press corps for dumbing things down in this way, decade after decade. After all, it humanizes these people who otherwise stand so high above the rest of us.\n\nWhat I discovered, however, was that it isn\u2019t only the press that pushes this silly narrative. It\u2019s also the people who hand out the Fellowship themselves; they want you to know how their philanthropy affects its recipients in the most intimate and immediate way. The MacArthur website features videotaped interviews with Fellowship winners; in every one I have listened to, the Genius in question winds up telling about how he or she felt when the call came, and often in strangely religious language. \u201cWhen I first got the call from the MacArthur Foundation,\u201d says playwright Samuel Hunter, \u201cit was sort of like an out-of-body experience.\u201d \u201cYou hear about MacArthur fellows,\u201d relates public defender Jonathan Rapping, \u201cand you sort of think of them as people who walk on water and do great work. . . . So, it was disbelief.\u201d\n\nWhy would the Foundation itself encourage us to heed the Parable of the Phone Call? In other situations, they are anxious to correct public simplifications of their philanthropic work\u2014when we stupidly call it a \u201cgenius grant,\u201d for example, rather than what it really is, a prize for \u201cexceptional creativity.\u201d But this business with the life-changing phone calls\u2014this they approve of. How come?\n\n*\n\nIn his 2005 study of prize-giving, \u201cThe Economy of Prestige,\u201d the English professor James English takes note of the dizzying proliferation of honors and awards in recent decades\u2014it\u2019s \u201ca kind of cultural frenzy,\u201d he writes. \u201cJust indexing all these prizes is a daunting task.\u201d Indeed it is. In the course of researching this article, I discovered numerous distinctions I had never heard of before, including the American Creativity Association\u2019s Special Achievement Award, a right-wing imitation of the Genius Grant called the Bradley Prize (every conservative newspaper columnist will eventually get one), and a literary honor that is named for Rob Bingham, a friend of mine who died tragically in 1999.\n\nWhat James English tells us about the countless foundations and academies that make these awards is that they are not simply neutral observers, impartially recognizing merit from some lofty height. They are always engaged in a cultural project of their own\u2014usually to establish themselves as authorities and their own concerns as correct ones.\n\nIn pursuit of that project, all award programs face the same problems. Because the reputation of the prize must itself be established for the academy in question to set about judging the merits of others, all prize programs\u2014even the many \u201ccounter-prizes\u201d set up to resist establishment prizes\u2014lean toward convention. They tend overwhelmingly to reward people whose reputations are already made. Indeed, as the competition between prizes grows more intense, English tells us, the pressure to associate a prize with safe and unquestionably prestigious figures only grows. This is why competing prizes within a field always tend to converge on the same individuals, prize magnets who are fated to stagger through life under the weight of their accumulated laurels.\n\nPrize programs are also subject to scandals and controversies\u2014scandals over the many lousy choices that award juries make and controversies like the avalanche of derision that every year buries the Grammys. There is also the related problem of honorees who hold the whole prize racket in contempt\u2014like Sinclair Lewis, who declined a Pulitzer in 1926; or Jean-Paul Sartre, who declined a Nobel in 1964; or George C. Scott, who declined an Oscar in 1971; or Thomas Pynchon, who won the National Book Award in 1974 but sent a comedian to accept it with a speech of solemn-sounding gibberish.\n\nWell, no one has ever declined a Genius Grant, as far as I have been able to determine. (When Salon asked the MacArthur Foundation about this directly, they refused to comment on the subject.) Even Thomas Pynchon was \u201ccongenial and gracious\u201d about accepting it, according to a story in the Chicago Tribune, when he got one back in 1988.\n\nNor have the Genius Grants ever been the focus of the kind of critical free-for-all that every year engulfs England\u2019s Booker Prize\u2014which, someone always finds reason to insist, has once again gone to the wrong goddam author. Virtually the only really persistent critics of the MacArthur are found on the cranky culture-war right, complaining about the honor being given\u2014yawn\u2014to the politically correct.\n\nBy and large, the way the mainstream media talks about the MacArthur Fellowships is the way the Foundation surely wants the media to talk about them, which is to say, in tones of reverence and admiration for the Geniuses in question. A clich\u00e9 almost as common as the Parable of the Phone Call in genius journalism is what we might call the Delirious Apprehension of the Eclectic, in which the writer is simply amazed by the overwhelming diversity of the fields that have been honored. \u201cThey\u2019re historians and scientists and one of them is a stringed-instrument bow maker,\u201d as a gee-whiz NPR story from 2012 had it. \u201cA neurologist who studies dementia. A jazz drummer who celebrates Latin rhythm. A remedial-reading teacher who writes poetry,\u201d begins a Chicago Tribune account from 2011. And were those geniuses somehow to get together in one place\u2014wow! Here is how that 1992 New York Times story described photographs of just such an event:\n\n\u201cSwimsuited policy analysts lounge at a torchlit poolside on Maui as a theoretical physicist lectures on infinity and galactic spirals. A historian of the Ottoman Empire and a biophysicist on a whale-watching cruise lean perilously over a boat rail, discussing whale song. A marine biologist scrambles up an active volcano\u2019s rocky slope.\u201d\n\nAnd here, just for fun, is a passage from a Donald Barthelme story called \u201cThe Genius\u201d that appeared in The New Yorker in 1971, ten years before the advent of the Genius Grant.\n\n\u201cThe genius proposes a world inventory of genius, in order to harness and coordinate the efforts of genius everywhere to create a better life for all men.\n\nLetters are sent out. . . .\n\nThe response is staggering!\n\nTelegrams pour in. . . .\n\nGeniuses of every stripe offer their cooperation.\n\nThe Times prints an editorial praising the idea. . . .\n\nThree thousand geniuses in one room!\n\nThe genius falls into an ill humor. He refuses to speak to anyone for eight days.\u201d\n\n*\n\nHere is where I should mention all the things I\u2019m supposed to disclose. For many years I have known, and from 2010 to 2013 I worked for Harper\u2019s publisher Rick MacArthur, whose grandfather started the MacArthur Foundation and whose father launched the Fellows Program. And: In 2005 I was paid to speak to an audience at the MacArthur Foundation on the subject of the culture wars.\n\n*\n\nThe real promise of the MacArthur Fellowship program is that it does not require grant writing, or applications, or even achievement of a conventional sort. It could theoretically be used to bypass the world of foundation favorites altogether. It could single out worthy individuals who have been unfairly overlooked, lift them up, launch their careers, and force the world to pay attention. That even seems to have been one of the ideas for the program in the beginning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's genius season, and once again the usual suspects line up for accolades, fated to be prize magnets forever", "title": "Genius grant or TED talk: Does a MacArthur grant make a genius smarter?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's genius season, and once again the usual suspects line up for accolades, fated to be prize magnets forever", "title": "Genius grant or TED talk: Does a MacArthur grant make a genius smarter?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/05/genius_grant_or_ted_talk_does_a_macarthur_grant_make_a_genius_smarter/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/boy_trophy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's genius season, and once again the usual suspects line up for accolades, fated to be prize magnets forever", "title": "Genius grant or TED talk: Does a MacArthur grant make a genius smarter?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/boy_trophy.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thomas Frank", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Genius grants, Junot Diaz, MacArthur grants, MFA, Thomas Frank, Thomas Pynchon, Tom Franl", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa9f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, Genius grants, Junot Diaz, MacArthur grants, MFA, Thomas Frank, Thomas Pynchon, Tom Franl, Innovation NewsIt\u2019s genius season again.\nAnd: In 2005 I was paid to speak to an audience at the MacArthur Foundation on the subject of the culture wars.\nFor many years I have known, and from 2010 to 2013 I worked for Harper\u2019s publisher Rick MacArthur, whose grandfather started the MacArthur Foundation and whose father launched the Fellows Program.\n(When Salon asked the MacArthur Foundation about this directly, they refused to comment on the subject.)\nOver the years, stories on the subject have always seemed to start with the phone call from MacArthur HQ in Chicago."}
