Adjuncts are still considered full-time if the school closes during the summer.\n\nUntil further guidance is issued, the IRS said, this is \"one (but not the only) method that is reasonable for this purpose.\"\n\nAdjuncts make up a majority of the higher education instruction workforce, meaning that the IRS' decision may have far-reaching effects. Under new rules imposed by the Affordable Care Act, employers with 200 or more workers must provide health insurance to full-time employees. For this purpose, a full-time employee is anyone who works 30 hours or more a week.\n\nWhile the new guidelines could lead to health coverage for those who didn't have it before, some schools have said they're too cash-strapped to provide such benefits, and are instead cutting back on the hours adjuncts are allowed to work.\n\nNevertheless, advocates for adjunct faculty were generally pleased with the IRS' decision.\n\n\"It recognizes and attributes to adjuncts some of the many hours they spend grading and preparing for every hour of class time,\" Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, told Politico. Weingarten added that she was worried there is no enforcement mechanism, because \"we're living in such a scorched-earth paradigm that you see insurance companies and employers are looking for any way to avoid the obligations.\"\n\nMaria Maisto, president of New Faculty Majority, told The Chronicle of Higher Education, \"The key takeaway from this is that the IRS recognized that there is a lot of complexity to contingent faculty work.\"\n\nMore: Adjunct Faculty", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Treasury Department and t...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-02-12 19:28:09 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The U.S. Treasury Department and t...", "title": "IRS Clears Up A Major Question For Adjunct Instructors", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/irs-adjunct-work-hours_n_4769465.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1616888/images/o-ADJUNCT-FACULTY-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Treasury Department and t...", "creator": "tylerkingkade", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1616888/images/o-ADJUNCT-FACULTY-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "IRS Clears Up A Major Question For Adjunct Instructors", "site": "@HuffPostCollege", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-11 19:28:09 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4769465", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "college", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "adjunct faculty irs,irs adjuncts,irs adjunct work hours,adjunct faculty health care,irs adjunct faculty,adjuncts health care,adjunct faculty", "article": {"section": "College", "tag": "adjunct faculty irs,irs adjuncts,irs adjunct work hours,adjunct faculty health care,irs adjunct faculty,adjuncts health care,adjunct faculty", "published_time": "2014-02-11 19:28:09 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-02-11 19:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "More: Adjunct Faculty\nNevertheless, advocates for adjunct faculty were generally pleased with the IRS' decision.\nAdjuncts make up a majority of the higher education instruction workforce, meaning that the IRS' decision may have far-reaching effects.\nWhile the new guidelines could lead to health coverage for those who didn't have it before, some schools have said they're too cash-strapped to provide such benefits, and are instead cutting back on the hours adjuncts are allowed to work.\nUntil further guidance is issued, the IRS said, this is \"one (but not the only) method that is reasonable for this purpose.\""}
