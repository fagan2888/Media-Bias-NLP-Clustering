Titled \u201cHippocratic Medicine: the Means to Health and Human Flourishing,\u201d the conference\u2019s sponsors include the Medical Institute for Sexual Health, legal nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).\n\nACPEDS president, Dr. Michelle Cretella, tells Breitbart News the organizations are focused on the wellbeing of children and not the politically driven issues of the day.\n\n\u201cOur two medical groups decided to join forces in this way in part to more effectively counter the relativistic, anti-life and unscientific ideology of mainstream medicine,\u201d says Cretella.\n\n\u201cSince the 1960s, medical, academic and\u2013therefore\u2013government policy in the area of sexual health has been increasingly driven not by rigorous scientific research, but by the relativistic pansexual ideology spawned by Dr. Alfred Kinsey,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe result has been an epidemic of physical and psychological suffering and disease among young people, especially women.\u201d\n\nCretella explains that the conference\u2013which will offer continuing medical education credits to attendees\u2013\u201ccalls physicians and others back to the roots of Western medicine, namely, the Hippocratic philosophy embodied within natural law, and rigorous medical science.\u201d\n\nSpeakers at the conference include Dr. John Patrick, who will address \u201cHippocratic Medicine and the Myth of Moral Neutrality in Medicine;\u201d Dr. Jokin de Irala, who will speak about \u201cSafe-Sex Belief and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Adolescents\u201d; and Dr. Martin McCaffrey, who will address \u201cThe Burden of Abortion and the Preterm Birth Crisis.\u201d\n\nDevelopment specialist Dr. Priscilla Coleman will also speak about \u201cMental Health Risks of Abortion,\u201d and Dr. Angela Lanfranchi will address \u201cReproductive Breast Cancer Risks.\u201d\n\nPsychiatrist Dr. Miriam Grossman, known for calling out the sex ed industry in her books and presentations, will also present at the conference.\n\nDr. Donna Harrison, executive director of AAPLOG, tells Breitbart News the information to which physicians will be exposed at the conference will be unlike anything they will encounter at the conferences of establishment medical organizations.\n\n\u201cThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has been deeply entwined with the leadership of Planned Parenthood Federation of America for years,\u201d Harrison explains. \u201cNot surprisingly, ACOG has long lobbied for extreme pro-abortion measures and against reasonable restrictions like waiting periods and parental consent for minors.\u201d\n\n\u201cACOG ignores both the fact that life begins at conception and the scientific evidence demonstrating serious long-term risks to women who have abortions,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere is a lot of hard science that physicians need to know in order to practice evidence-based medicine and to give their patients true informed consent that they will not encounter in any other medical conference.\u201d\n\nAAPLOG, states Harrison, \u201cexists to promote evidence based, Hippocratic medicine.\u201d\n\nPediatrician Dr. Jane Anderson will speak at the conference on \u201cThe Adolescent Brain and Adolescent Decision-Making.\u201d She tells Breitbart News that research shows adolescent brains are immature, yet the American Academy of Pediatrics continues to promote practice policies that are intended to reflect a liberal political ideology that distances children from their parents.\n\n\u201cNew information on adolescent brain development confirms that adolescents need parents involved in every aspect of their lives,\u201d Anderson says.\n\nShe continues:\n\nLiterally every area of the adolescent brain is immature and develops during the adolescent years. Hormones all respond differently in the adolescent brain as well. Furthermore, new MRI scanning, PET scanning, and other new imaging are being done in research as adolescents are followed over time. The evidence proves to us that every area of the adolescent brain is immature, and that the frontal lobe\u2013which controls decision-making and is sometimes called the \u201cCEO\u201d of the brain\u2013is especially immature. It controls judgment, strategy, and planning abilities and does not fully mature until an individual is between the ages of about 23 and 25.\n\n\u201cIf we look at this information, other medical associations are not following scientific evidence,\u201d Anderson asserts.\n\nShe explains that the American Psychological Association (APA), for example, wrote in the landmark Supreme Court case of Roper vs. Simmons in 2005 that adolescent brain development is immature and that, as a result, adolescents should not be subject to the death penalty. At the same time, however, Anderson notes APA argues that adolescents are cognitively mature enough so that parental notification laws with regard to abortion are not necessary.\n\nAnderson observes the establishment AAP has also ignored other basic scientific evidence that has been around since the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that parents convey their values to adolescents, but the other adolescent medicine people say, \u2018Eh, don\u2019t bother, they\u2019re not going to listen to you. They\u2019re going to have sex. Just give them condoms and long-term birth control,\u2019\u201d she observes. \u201cBut every study shows that teens listen to their parents. Even with high-risk, minority adolescents in low-income areas, teen girls are less likely to have sex when their mothers tell them it\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery study shows that if a teenager is connected to his or her parents, they will navigate their teenage years much better and with less high-risk behavior,\u201d she adds. \u201cYet when we take a teen to a medical office, we\u2019re told 11 and 12 year-olds must be separated from their parents,\u201d with parents told to remain in the waiting room while the child speaks with the doctor alone.\n\nAnderson explains pediatricians who conduct office visits in this way are really sending a message to the child that \u201cI as an authority figure will collude with you to deceive your parents.\u201d But AAP continues to include these practices into their policies for political reasons, she states.\n\nAnderson discusses the LGBT agenda in schools:\n\nWe care about all children, we don\u2019t want any child to be abused, bullied, or made fun of. We\u2019ve gotten to a point, though, that children who normally wouldn\u2019t be thinking about sexual identity at their stage of development are actually talking about whether being friends with another child of the same sex will translate into being gay later on. This is abusive\u2013forcing that type of thinking onto children. This is recruitment for the LGBT agenda.\n\nDr. Jane Orient, executive director of conference sponsor AAPS, says some of her organization\u2019s members will be presenting information that the establishment medical organizations would prefer to suppress.\n\n\u201cOther medical and mental health organizations\u2013AMA and AAP, and the APA\u2013all speak in unison in favor of the cultural revolution that\u2019s overtaking us,\u201d Orient tells Breitbart News. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not even expressing concerns about the public health consequences, not to mention the wider social and moral consequences of destroying the family.\u201d\n\nOrient described the situation in Massachusetts of a physician who was kicked off the hospital staff because he communicated through the hospital system about the dangers of homosexual activity.\n\n\u201cHe was told he was insensitive, unprofessional, offensive, etc., though no one took issue with the truth of what he said,\u201d she relates. \u201cWe are really getting a pro-abortion, pro-sodomy, anti-family, and anti-Christian, extremely intolerant message.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe medical community at large is also trying to suppress evidence about the risk of abortion, the abortion-cancer link, and the link between abortion and infant mortality and long-term serious neurological complications like cerebral palsy,\u201d Orient adds. \u201cWith all of these things, doctors are not telling their patients about them and even denying the existence of it.\u201d\n\nEstablishment medical groups are holding up studies whose research methods are highly flawed over dozens of other positive studies, Orient says, as they also repeat leftwing talking points such as \u201cabortion is safe and legal\u201d and barriers to abortion are counter-productive.\n\nThe influence of groups like the AMA and AAP on public policy is significant, she notes.\n\n\u201cObamacare is forcing people to pay for things that not long ago were widely considered to be immoral or even unthinkable,\u201d she asserts. \u201cThey\u2019re now disregarding the right of conscience\u2013you\u2019re considered an \u2018extremist,\u2019 if not just a bad doctor, if you don\u2019t go along with them. We support freedom of conscience and scientific discussion about these issues.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reached out to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for comment. AAP did not respond to the request, and ACOG replied, \u201cWe have no comment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors are joining together to change the \u201chealthcare\u201d narratives that have been set by a liberal medical establishment's political agenda.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Doctors are joining together to change the \u201chealthcare\u201d narratives that have been set by a liberal medical establishment's political agenda.", "title": "Doctors Revolt Against Liberal Medical Establishment", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Doctor-examining-pregnant-woman-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/27/doctors-revolt-liberal-medical-establishment-launch-new-pathway/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors are joining together to change the \u201chealthcare\u201d narratives that have been set by a liberal medical establishment's political agenda.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Doctor-examining-pregnant-woman-afp.jpg", "title": "Doctors Revolt Against Liberal Medical Establishment", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "adolescents, Alliance Defending Freedom, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Birth Control, Children, freedom of conscience, LGBT agenda, LGBT education, liberal agenda, medical education, medical establishment, sex education,Abortion, Big Government, Medicine,Doctors", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "sex education", "published_time": "2015-10-27T08:18:42-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Abortion,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSeveral organizations of medical doctors and other professionals are joining together to change the \u201chealthcare\u201d narratives that have been set in the nation by a liberal medical establishment that does the bidding of a leftwing political agenda.\n\u201cNew information on adolescent brain development confirms that adolescents need parents involved in every aspect of their lives,\u201d Anderson says.\nAnderson observes the establishment AAP has also ignored other basic scientific evidence that has been around since the late 1990s.\nDr. Jane Orient, executive director of conference sponsor AAPS, says some of her organization\u2019s members will be presenting information that the establishment medical organizations would prefer to suppress.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that parents convey their values to adolescents, but the other adolescent medicine people say, \u2018Eh, don\u2019t bother, they\u2019re not going to listen to you."}
