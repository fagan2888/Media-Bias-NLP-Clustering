Trump spoke about immigration and Obamacare, among other topics, to around 14,000 supporters at the event.\n\nQ: Did Donald Trump tell People magazine in 1998 that if he ever ran for president, he\u2019d do it as a Republican because \u201cthey\u2019re the dumbest group of voters in the country\u201d and that he \u201ccould lie and they\u2019d still eat it up\u201d?\n\nA: No, that\u2019s a bogus meme.\n\nFull answer\n\nThe meme purports to be a quote from Trump in People magazine in 1998 saying, \u201cIf I were to run, I\u2019d run as a Republican. They\u2019re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they\u2019d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.\u201d\n\nWe were alerted to the meme by a reader, A. Douglas Thomas of Freeport, N.Y., among others, who saw it in his Facebook feed, along with a message from someone who said, \u201cI just fact-checked this. Google Donald Trump, People magazine and 1998. This is an actual quote by Trump.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll save you the effort. It is not an actual quote by Trump.\n\nWe scoured the People magazine archives and found nothing like this quote in 1998 or any other year.\n\nAnd a public relations representative with People told us that the magazine couldn\u2019t find anything like that quote in its archives, either. People\u2018s Julie Farin said in an email: \u201cPeople looked into this exhaustively when it first surfaced back in Oct. We combed through every Trump story in our archive. We couldn\u2019t find anything remotely like this quote \u2013 and no interview at all in 1998.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, Trump was cited frequently in the pages of People, but at the time, most of the stories were about Trump\u2019s pending divorce from Marla Maples and appearances at various social and entertainment events.\n\nThere were several stories in the late 1990s about Trump\u2019s flirtation with a presidential run. (This became a running theme for Trump, who claimed he was considering a run for president in 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2012. That prompted some early on to dismiss Trump\u2019s claim this time around that he\u2019d run for president.)\n\nIn an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 30, 1999, Trump said he was mulling a run for president, and it sounded like he was considering a bid as an independent.\n\nTrump, Wall Street Journal, Sept. 30, 1999: Let\u2019s cut to the chase. Yes, I am considering a run for president. \u2026 Unlike candidates from the two major parties, my candidacy would not represent an exercise in career advancement. I am not a political pro trying to top off his resume. I am considering a run only because I am convinced the major parties have lost their way. The Republicans are captives of their right wing. The Democrats are captives of their left wing. I don\u2019t hear anyone speaking for the working men and women in the center.\n\nIn the op-ed, Trump said he came to his decision after then Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura \u2014 who was elected as a Reform Party candidate \u2014 encouraged him to run.\n\nIn a CNN interview with Larry King a couple weeks later, Trump said he was forming an exploratory committee and that the committee would look at whether Trump could win as a Reform Party candidate.\n\nTrump on CNN, Oct. 8, 1999: But really, really the big thing they\u2019re going to look in \u2014 as \u2014 is: Can you win? Can a Reform Party candidate win? Because I believe I could get the Reform Party nomination. I don\u2019t even think it would be that tough. \u2026 I\u2019m not looking to get more votes than any other independent candidate in history, I\u2019d want to win. So we\u2019ll see.\n\nTrump told King that he was a registered Republican and that a Reform Party run would mean a split with a party that he was \u201cclose to.\u201d\n\nTrump on CNN, Oct. 8, 1999: I\u2019m a registered Republican. I\u2019m a pretty conservative guy. I\u2019m somewhat liberal on social issues, especially health care, et cetera, but I\u2019d be leaving another party, and I\u2019ve been close to that party. King: Why would you leave the Republican Party? Trump: I think that nobody is really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. I mean, Bill Bradley, this is seriously left; he\u2019s trying to come a little more center, but he\u2019s seriously left. The Republicans are too far right. And I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s hitting the chord, not the chord that I want hear, and not the chord that other people want to hear, and I\u2019ve seen it.\n\nBut again, we could find nothing in the online People magazine archives that suggests Trump ever was quoted as saying the quote used in the Facebook meme, either in 1998 or any other year. We also did a search in Nexis and could find no such quote from Trump in any major publication in the country.\n\nSnopes.com, which also looked into this bogus meme, pointed out that the reference to Fox News viewers is curious, given that at the time Fox News \u201cwas not exceptionally well-known (or particularly regarded as a right-leaning outlet) in 1998.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Thomas, who contacted us about the Facebook meme, to tell him it was a fake. He said it just goes to show, \u201cEverything you read on Facebook isn\u2019t the gospel truth written in stone by Moses. You need to check your sources.\u201d Hear, hear!\n\nThat advice goes for Trump, as well. On Nov. 23, we wrote about a grossly inaccurate graphic that Trump retweeted that claimed, among other things, that most whites are killed by blacks (which isn\u2019t true). When questioned about the graphic, Trump said that it wasn\u2019t his tweet, that he merely retweeted it. Trump maintained that the graphic came from \u201csources that are very credible\u201d and added, \u201cAm I gonna check every statistic?\u201d That, in a nutshell, is how false memes \u2014 like the one we\u2019ve written about here \u2014 get passed around the Web.\n\nAs always, we encourage readers to pass along any questionable political claims they receive via chain email or in their Facebook or Twitter feeds.
