Arrogance and incompetence by that fucktard Oliar led to this so thanks for voting for the hack, LMAO!!!\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was my first good laugh of the day. It was like getting email bombed by an energy drink\u2013addled 13-year-old. Is there any political office you would like to occupy if this was one of your constituents?\n\nAs predicted, Republicans swept into powah! It was like a low-rent version of Ken Kesey\u2019s Furthur bus pulling into Washington, D.C., and the Scary Pranksters emerging to kick some ass.\n\nMy pen pal wrote again to gloat further, but he\u2019s wasting his time. I think it\u2019s a good thing when the people speak. If it isn\u2019t what I wanted, so what? That\u2019s democracy.\n\nHopefully, the better ideas won the day. Both sides say their way is best. If this new majority really wants to improve things, then I am ready to hear what they have to say.\n\nPolitics isn\u2019t a sporting event. If your party is in the majority, as the Republicans are in both houses, you are tasked with the heavy lifting. It is one thing to complain and obstruct, quite another to govern.\n\nI think the Democrats deserved to lose their majority in the Senate and more seats in Congress. I also think you deserve the government you settle for.\n\nRelated Stories Henry Rollins: The Shangri-Las Were Totally Heavy\n\nI look forward to what the elected majority will bring to the table, although I think I have an idea as to what\u2019s coming. By sometimes great margins, science doubting, abortion hating, marriage equality\u2013opposing men and women presumably will be sending legislation to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nThat is, if they have the time. Constructing grounds for impeachment and looking for new ways to gut Obamacare are time-consuming.\n\nSo, if this what more than 50 percent of America wants, then I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019re all in for.\n\nI believe in American democracy. I am not one who has to \u201cwin\u201d all the time. I just wonder if the winners are ready for what they won.\n\nRepresentative John Boehner doesn\u2019t like the president\u2019s new EPA restrictions, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030. Mr. B called the president\u2019s plan \u201cnuts\u201d and thinks that it will ship more jobs overseas.\n\nBut what\u2019s a job worth if your lungs are too coated with carbon residue to breathe? The president\u2019s nutty plan would involve science, could endanger the coal industry, might lead to innovation and, oh, sorry. I\u2019m in the minority. I\u2019d better just hush up.\n\nTexas\u2019 Sen. Ted Cruz, who almost always looks like he\u2019s about to cry (and bears a strange resemblance to Joe McCarthy), says that net neutrality is \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s in the majority, so let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s allow service providers to start making first class and coach for Internet speed. Let\u2019s find yet another way to divide the American people. Free market!\n\nAll you broke-asses can just get your information slower because you\u2019re poor and, well, fuck you. I know that some of you are Republicans but hey, Mr. Cruz is one of your guys, so this must be the way to go and I am sure you will find a way to suck it up.\n\nDarkening the skies for the sake of stock\u00adholders and letting people\u2019s incomes determine their Internet access don\u2019t sound like things the most exceptional country in the world would do. But this is what got voted into office. This is what the majority wants. I don\u2019t get it but that really doesn\u2019t matter. The majority in both houses has every American\u2019s best interests in mind at all times, so it\u2019s all going to be great now, right? I mean, this damn tyranny has gone on too long! I can\u2019t wait for the liberty.\n\nSome people are beyond democracy and are sure the whole system is corrupt. For them, all election results are the same.\n\nI get amazing letters from one fellow American fairly often. Recently, the sender advised me that the government uses \u201cfalse flag\u201d operations to \u201ctake away our liberties and squash the Constitution.\u201d\n\nI wrote back and asked what liberties were being taken away and what parts of the Constitution are being squashed. With lightning-fast Internet speed (for now), I got a letter back:\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t go to visit my daughters and protect myself at the same time because if I carry my gun with me, I will be arrested. 2nd amendment liberty taken away. False flag =sandy hook elementary, aurora movie theatre. Privacy taken by nsa via all of my communication devices is: internet blogging social media cell phones etc = my 1st amendment right of free speech, homeland security via body scanners at airport, checkpoints throughout the country. My right as a journeyman on free land to travel unaccosted. Drones and facial recognition cameras, stoplight cameras giving speeding tickets unconstitutional also. Look up YouTube videos... Look up sandy hook hoax. Look up Isis fake actors or Isis c.i.a. I have a right to bear arms against a tyrannical government and right to form militias. Government has big guns and so should the peoples of the u.s. Look up on YouTube Ebola formaldehyde in water. Wake all your friends up too. Sheeple.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmerica is a dynamic place. I love our diversity and differences of opinion. I hope for the best for all of us.\n\nLike us on Facebook at LAWeeklyMusic\n\nFollow us on Twitter @LAWeeklyMusic, Henry Rollins @henryrollins and like us at LAWeeklyMusic.\n\nHenry Rollins' 20 Favorite Punk Albums\n\nHenry Rollins: Musical Elitism Is for Lightweights\n\nHenry Rollins: Gay Marriage Is Punk Rock\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A few days before the midterm elections, I got this unsigned email: \u201cHow are you going to feel when the Republicans take the Senate on Tuesday, just...", "author": "Henry Rollins", "og": {"site_name": "L.A.
