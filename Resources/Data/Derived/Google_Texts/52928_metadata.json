It is also abundant in green-leafy vegetables such as spinach and in beans and fortified cereals.\n\nAnd so, Clark says, the trend among female athletes and other health-conscious consumers to move away from red meat and to give up fortified foods creates a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for iron deficiency.\n\nFor example, good ol\u2019 Grape Nuts \u2014 a fortified (\u201cprocessed\u201d) cereal \u2014 has 90 percent of the recommended daily allowance for iron, while the natural Kashi Go Lean Crunch has 8 percent.\n\nFor women who want to get more of their iron from plants, one possibility is to consume greens or beans together with vitamin C, which improves iron absorption. It\u2019s also worth limiting consumption of foods that inhibit the uptake of iron, including calcium and coffee and tea.\n\n\u2013 Gabriella Boston, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/hfnutribrief22-1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Q: Is it true that women athletes need to have extra iron in their diets?\nFor women who want to get more of their iron from plants, one possibility is to consume greens or beans together with vitamin C, which improves iron absorption.\nToo much iron is not healthful, either, so it\u2019s important to be tested before taking an iron supplement.\nBut iron is readily available in food \u2014 especially in red meat and seafood (in particular, clams).\nA: \u201cIt\u2019s quite common for female athletes to have iron deficiency,\u201d says Nancy Clark, author of the \u201cSports Nutrition Guidebook.\u201dClark attributes iron deficiency among female athletes to monthly blood loss and an added demand on iron stores through high-intensity training, as well as a focus on lean, vegetarian and natural foods."}
