Rates are set to increase between 3 and 7 percent at Tufts Health Plan, 6 to 12 percent at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and 9.5 percent on average at Fallon Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe jumps in premiums come as insurers pass on the costs of rising drug prices, insurers and analysts said, and grapple with the cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Most of the state\u2019s major health insurers are sharply raising premiums for individuals, small firms, and big businesses, according to a Globe review of figures provided by the insurers and the state Division of Insurance.\n\nFor many, the upward trend is troubling.\n\n\u201cPeople cannot sustain the amount of money they\u2019re paying for health care, \u201d said Joshua Archambault, senior fellow at the Pioneer Institute, a right-leaning Boston think tank. \u201cAt some point, people really can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nThe Division of Insurance will hold a two-day public hearing on the issue. Insurers will be called to discuss their rates at the first-of-its-kind hearing on Jan. 11, and members of the public can comment on Jan. 12.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of transparency, we\u2019re holding these [hearings] so insurers can explain the rates they say they need,\u201d said Chris Goetcheus, a spokesman for the division.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rise in health care costs for insurers \u2014 and subsequently consumers \u2014 comes after prices moderated in recent years. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, more people have coverage, and as a result they are using more medical services and prescription drugs, analysts said. In addition, they said, insurers may be passing along the costs of millions of dollars in taxes and fees to finance the expansion of health coverage.\n\nNot all spending growth is surprising or troubling, said Michael E. Chernew, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nSome spending growth is expected, given that locally and nationally, more people have gained insurance,he said. But other trends are concerning, he said, such as the move by many drug companies to put high price tags not just on innovative medicines but on long-established drugs as well. The prices of some common generic drugs have surged 15, 25, and even 75 times what they were just two years ago.\n\n\u201cSome of the increased spending is good,\u201d Chernew said, \u201cand some of the increased spending is bad.\u201d\n\nSeveral insurers and the state Division of Insurance, which approves rates for individual and small-business plans, attribute rising premiums in part to a controversial element of the federal health care law. That program, called risk adjustment, requires insurers with healthier members to make payments to companies with sicker members in order to share the risks and cost of insuring people with a lot of medical needs. It is designed to prevent insurers from boosting profits by enrolling only healthy members.\n\nWhen the program went into effect in 2015, most insurers ended up paying money to their largest competitor, Blue Cross, which received more than $51 million in risk adjustment payments. Tufts Health Plan received more than $8 million.\n\nThe program aims to smooth and stabilize insurance rates, but some insurers say it is having the opposite effect. Companies, including Harvard Pilgrim, which made about $4 million in payments, Fallon, which paid about $11 million, and Neighborhood Health Plan, which paid about $28 million,said they raised rates more in 2016 because of risk-adjustment.\n\nOne portion of the market, health plans for individuals and small businesses, shows the steepness of some increases. Harvard Pilgrim raised premiums 8.7 percent for these plans in 2016, compared with a 1.4 percent decline in rates in 2015. Fallon\u2019s rates are up 16.5 percent, compared with a 4.9 percent increase a year earlier. At Neighborhood Health, premiums rose 9.4 percent in 2016, compared to 5.9 percent a year earlier.\n\nThe national insurer United HealthCare raised rates 13 percent in 2016, after raising them 4.5 percent a year earlier.\n\nBlue Cross, on the other hand, said the payments it received to help cover its higher population of sicker members helped it keep its premium increases modest: rates for individuals, small businesses, and large businesses are up about 5 percent this year, compared with 4.2 percent in 2015.\n\nEven while increasing their rates, insurers said they are taking steps to rein in rising premiums.\n\nAt Tufts Health Plan, premiums for individual and small businesses plans are rising 6.8 percent in 2016, compared to 4.5 percent in 2015. But Tufts said it has redesigned some plans so members can keep premium increases to about 1 percent by opting to pay higher co-payments and deductibles for medical services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing new programs to try to control the costs customers are experiencing,\u201d said Marc Spooner, Tufts\u2019 president of commercial products. \u201cWe take our responsibility to control costs very seriously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1882458973", "eomportal-id": 221797, "description": "Consumers and businesses across Massachusetts will have to pay more for health care in 2016 as some premiums soar by double digit rates.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Consumers and businesses across Massachusetts will have to pay more for health care in 2016 as some premiums soar by double digit rates.", "title": "Health care costs rising faster in 2016 - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/03/health-care-costs-rising-faster/WUfquz4gBEjncURDm20b6L/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/01/04/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/a4468b69e663408fa271532cf6eb2a06-a4468b69e663408fa271532cf6eb2a06-0.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 06:33:46 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "health insurance,premiums,health care costs,prescription drugs,affordable care act,obamacare,risk adjustment,Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "61603cf4-b282-11e5-82ee-9ff962600f9a", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "health insurance,premiums,health care costs,prescription drugs,affordable care act,obamacare,risk adjustment,Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University"}, "article_summary": "Rates are set to increase between 3 and 7 percent at Tufts Health Plan, 6 to 12 percent at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and 9.5 percent on average at Fallon Health.\nAdvertisementThe rise in health care costs for insurers \u2014 and subsequently consumers \u2014 comes after prices moderated in recent years.\nAt Tufts Health Plan, premiums for individual and small businesses plans are rising 6.8 percent in 2016, compared to 4.5 percent in 2015.\nNot all spending growth is surprising or troubling, said Michael E.
