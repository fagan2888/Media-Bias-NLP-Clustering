This pass-by means scientists could get the rare chance to study two pieces of a broken-off comet.\n\nNASA says you'll likely only be able to view the pair with a telescope.\n\nThis video includes clips from NASA / JPL-Caltech, The Sky Live and NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope and an image from Paul Stewart / CC BY 2.0.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two comets with the same orbit will pass by Earth this week and give scientists the chance to study possible twin comets.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Two comets with the same orbit will pass by Earth this week and give scientists the chance to study possible twin comets.", "title": "2 Comets Will Pass By Earth This Week \u2014 The Closest In 250 Years", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/2-comets-will-pass-by-earth-this-week-the-closest-in-250-years/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1458483622.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two comets with the same orbit will pass by Earth this week and give scientists the chance to study possible twin comets.", "title": "2 Comets Will Pass By Earth This Week \u2014 The Closest In 250 Years", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/2-comets-will-pass-by-earth-this-week-the-closest-in-250-years/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1458483622.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=BpZjA3MjE6FXj1pdvWEFPpkVaGnOAN5p&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://58201", "iphone": "newsy://58201", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://58201", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "keywords": "Twin comets, NASA comets, comet breaks 250 year record, comet comes third closest to earth, P/2016 BA14, P/2016 BA14, comets splitting a part, comets with same orbit, newsy, newsy videos", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1458483622.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Two comets with the same orbit will pass by Earth this week and give scientists the chance to study possible twin comets.\nTwo comets will pass by Earth this week, and one will come close enough to break a 250-year record.\n252P/LINEAR, the bigger comet set to fly past Earth on Monday, might be related to P/2016 BA14 \u2014 as in twins.\nComet P/2016 BA14 will still be a safe 2.2 million miles away when it flies by on Tuesday, but it will take the record for the third-closest comet to Earth on record.\nBecause 252P/LINEAR and P/2016 BA14 have a similar orbit, it could mean the two broke off from a larger comet or that P/2016 BA14 broke off from 252P/LINEAR."}
