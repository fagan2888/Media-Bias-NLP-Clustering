The Heritage Foundation tracks Islamist-inspired terror plots, which have occurred within the United States since Sept. 2001. Five plots have recently been added to the interactive timeline. Since the New Year there have already been three domestic terror plots in the U.S., one having been successful.

1. Philadelphia, Pa.—Police officer Jesse Hartnett was shot and wounded by self-proclaimed jihadist Edward Archer in Philadelphia on Jan. 7. Thirty-year-old Archer fired over 13 shots at Hartnett with a stolen gun, and Hartnett returned fire in spite of his injuries. Ultimately, Archer was wounded and arrested by other officers.

2. Houston, Texas—Iraqi refugee Omar Faraj Al Hardan was arrested on Jan. 8 and charged for trying to offer support to ISIS and lying about his citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security noted that Harden had a desire to set off explosive devices in two Houston malls.

3. Milwaukee, Wisc.—On Jan. 26, 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh was charged for possessing machine guns and a silencer. Investigations dating back to last September reveal that Hamzeh was first planning an attack on Israelis in the West Bank as well as on a Masonic temple in Wisconsin.

Other Plots Added to Timeline

In July of 2015, 24-year-old Mohammad Abdulazeez fatally shot four Marines and a sailor at two separate military facilities in Chattanooga, Tenn.

On Dec. 14, 2015, Mohamed Elshinawy was arrested for “attempting to provide material support to ISIL.” Elshinawy desired to create bombs and had in mind several targets to attack. He had conspired with others over the course of the year about supporting the well-known terrorist group.

2015 had the greatest number of Islamist-inspired domestic attacks and plots, with a total of 15. In the midst of the growing number of terror plots and attacks, Americans must remember to be cautious and vigilant.
