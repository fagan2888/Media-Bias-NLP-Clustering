Among the runway trends during Milan Fashion Week, in its fourth day Saturday, are silken blouses tied with an off-skew bow around the neck.\n\nHighlights from Saturday\u2019s shows, including Bottega Veneta, Roberto Cavalli, Jil Sander and Pucci:\n\n___\n\nBOTTEGA VENETA POP ART\n\nColors popped at Bottega Veneta: Emerald green, teal, yellow, russet, violet and orange, matching in tone and intensity the bold polka-dot patterns that dominated the runway for the first part of the show.\n\nThe repetitive dotting in contrasting colors would transpose easily into a Roy Lichtenstein painting \u2014 but the women wearing Tomas Maier\u2019s creations show none of the existential distress that the pop artist normally portrayed.\n\nShe is confident in polka-dot tunics in teal or emerald green with a contemporary neck line that flips over to reveal contrasting colors. From bold, the looks grew more pretty with overlays of delicate black or rust lace over colorful dresses, and Maier maintained the contemporary edge with transparent panels in overcoat that become a show-window of sorts to the eye-popping color of the daywear underneath. Capes had a trapezoidal shape, offset by streaks of color.\n\nMaier anchored the collection with a pair of black suits set off by a crinkled silk scarf twisted around the neck \u2014 a stylistic gesture that conveys what Maier means by a \u201cnonchalant sense of style.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSOBER FRIVOLITY\n\nJil Sander designer Rodolfo Paglialunga\u2019s first winter womenswear collection for the brand put the coat at front and center \u2014 keeping the lines very long.\n\n\u201cJil Sander represents a little bit of the elegant world for me, and that\u2019s why I wanted to do this long silhouette,\u201d Paglialunga said backstage after the show.\n\nThe collection puts its focus on the basics: pants, footwear and coats. Belted overcoats are worn casually over flared trousers. Dresses and tunics were based on the overcoat form, with big pockets and lean lines, adhering to the brand\u2019s minimalist roots. Shorter jackets were worn with cropped trouser-skirts.\n\nGeometric lines running diagonally or along garment edges underscored the discipline of the pieces.\n\nWhat frivolity there was came in the form of color \u2014 bright orange booties or yellow knee boots \u2014 and subtle detailing like an orderly ruffle peeking out from a neckline.\n\nPaglialunga called it \u201cthat touch of frivolity in a garment that isn\u2019t so frivolous. A little delicateness. It was a touch of femininity.\u201d\n\nFor Paglialunga, it\u2019s normal for women to wear men\u2019s trousers, jackets and shirts.\n\n\u201cYou need to know what to add on to make it more confident and elegant,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nKEEPIN\u2019 IT SEXY\n\nRoberto Cavalli isn\u2019t about to give up his perch as designer to the sex bombs, no matter the trends around him and no matter what happens after the sale of the brand that has been showing in Milan for 20 years.\n\nHis collection for next winter was unapologetically sexy, from the exotic print mini-dress beneath a fur-lined overcoat to the last plisse gown with cutout diamond-shapes accentuating the waistline.\n\nFew do red carpet gowns with more billow and bluster, and the newest creation comes in either a halter top or with feminine, blousy sleeves. The two-tone gown fades from powder blue to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll purple, or blue into rust for a psychedelic sunset.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Femininity gets a rethink during Milan Fashion Week", "author": "Colleen Barry", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Femininity gets a rethink during Milan Fashion Week", "title": "Femininity gets a rethink during Milan Fashion Week", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/28/femininity_gets_a_rethink_during_milan_fashion_week/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/italy-fashion-bottega-veneta.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Femininity gets a rethink during Milan Fashion Week", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/italy-fashion-bottega-veneta.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Femininity gets a rethink during Milan Fashion Week", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Femininity gets a rethink during Milan Fashion Week", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0283\"", "article_summary": "Among the runway trends during Milan Fashion Week, in its fourth day Saturday, are silken blouses tied with an off-skew bow around the neck.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsMILAN (AP) \u2014 Femininity is getting a rethink in Milan.\nThe two-tone gown fades from powder blue to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll purple, or blue into rust for a psychedelic sunset.\nDresses and tunics were based on the overcoat form, with big pockets and lean lines, adhering to the brand\u2019s minimalist roots.\nDesigners are incorporating more masculine tailoring, while giving a contemporary edge to normally girly touches like bows, ruffles, lace and, yes, polka dots."}
