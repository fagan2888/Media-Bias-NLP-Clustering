A further 22% feel indifferent with only 15% opposing more building.\n\nCrucially three quarters (74%) of those who support more social housing construction say they would also support homes being built in their area. This finding throws into doubt the long held assumption among many that new developments are often likely to be opposed by the majority of local residents.\n\nWith the housing crisis continuing to climb up the political agenda and the general election only nine months away the findings should give confidence to politicians at national and local levels that backing developments of social housing could be a vote winner.\n\nThe think tank report \u2018Silent Majority: How the public will support a new wave of social housing\u2019 has been supported by the not-for-profit Home Group \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s largest providers of affordable housing.\n\nBrian Ham, Home Group executive director of enterprise and development, said: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the UK housing market isn\u2019t working. A new era of growth in affordable housing construction has a major part to play in addressing the situation.\n\n\u201cThe findings of this report confirm what Home Group has experienced in practice at some of our developments and it\u2019s fitting the authors of the report have used the phrase Silent Majority in the title.\n\n\u201cThe small number of residents who oppose development are very good at shouting very loudly and can give the impression of a local community being opposed. The reality can be very different.\n\n\u201cPoliticians understandably will always want to take into account the public\u2019s view when deciding where they stand on an issue but this research suggests that those who shout the loudest are necessarily speaking in behalf of everyone.\n\n\u201cNewspapers and media will naturally focus on campaign groups when covering planning applications as conflict generates headlines. But decision makers should take account of the silent majority which clearly back the idea of building more social housing.\u201d\n\nReport co-author Robert Tinker said: \u201cIt has long been held that social housing is an unpopular area for politicians to dabble in\u2026Our research shows these fears are unjustified.\n\n\u201cPeople are strongly supportive of new social housing and remain broadly supportive of new social housing even if it will be in their area. There are no public opinion restrictions to action.\u201d\n\nCopies of the report \u2018Silent Majority: How the public will support a new wave of social housing\u201d can be downloaded from the Fabian Society.", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": "http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2014-09-02-UK-public-would-back-new-era-of-social-housing-construction", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Politicians should not shy away from campaigning for a new era of social housing construction after a new survey showed the majority of the public would back it.\r\nResearch from the Fabian Society shows that an overwhelming 93% of the population feels...", "title": "UK public would back new era of social housing construction", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.publisher": "24dash.com", "channel": "News", "PublicationDate": "2014-09-02", "DC.date.created": "2014-09-02", "DC.title": "UK public would back new era of social housing construction", "thumbnail": "http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/24dash-media/image/2014/09/01/56878/580_Image_Standard_housing_pic_8_175481489.jpg", "DC.language": "en-GB", "displayDate": "Tuesday, September 2, 2014"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople are strongly supportive of new social housing and remain broadly supportive of new social housing even if it will be in their area.\nUK public would back new era of social housing constructionPublished by Anonymous for 24dash.com in Housing and also in Central Government, DevelopmentTuesday 2nd September 2014 - 1:01amUK public would back new era of social housing construction Image: Housing via ShutterstockPoliticians should not shy away from campaigning for a new era of social housing construction after a new survey showed the majority of the public would back it.\nCrucially three quarters (74%) of those who support more social housing construction say they would also support homes being built in their area.\nBrian Ham, Home Group executive director of enterprise and development, said: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the UK housing market isn\u2019t working.\nA new era of growth in affordable housing construction has a major part to play in addressing the situation."}
