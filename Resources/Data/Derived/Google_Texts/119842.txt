A man is locked up after police say he attempted to rob a fast food chain.

Greenville Police say that 59-year-old Joseph Taft has been charged with attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon.

Officials say that Taft walked into the Captain D’s restaurant at 626 S. Memorial Drive on Friday afternoon. We’re told that Taft bought a drink, lingered for about 5 to 10 minutes talking to the staff, and then pulled a handgun and demanded money. Police say that Taft took off in a Ford Taurus when the staff refused to comply. The staff was able to get the license tag.

Officials say within 45 minutes, GPD Street Crimes Unit officers located the suspect vehicle near the intersection of Kennedy and Skinner Streets and eventually arrested Taft.

Taft is being held on a $75,000 secured bond.
