Leticia Van de Putte, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, advocated for a higher minimum wage in Texas.\n\n\u201cWe know that people who live off of minimum wage live a poverty-ridden life,\u201d Van de Putte said. \u201cRaising the minimum wage is good for the economy.\u201d\n\nVan de Putte\u2019s remarks come a week after Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis called for pushing the minimum wage in Texas to $10 per hour. In her remarks, Van de Putte said she was unsure whether increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour from the current requirement of $7.25 per hour was the necessary hike, but she indicated that the Texas Legislature should raise the rate.\n\nHer campaign had hoped the town hall event would be a debate with her Republican opponent, state Sen. Dan Patrick. But Patrick \u201crespectfully declined\u201d to participate in the event, according to event organizers. During the hour, she answered questions from three panelists, from a studio audience, and some asked via social media.\n\nAsked for a response to Van de Putte\u2019s comments about increasing the minimum wage, a Patrick spokesman said \u201cSenator Patrick is looking forward to debating his opponent on Sept. 29\u201d when the two candidates are set to face off in an hourlong debate that will be hosted by The Texas Tribune, Austin\u2019s KLRU-TV and Univision. That is the only debate currently scheduled in this race between now and Election Day in November. Van de Putte had originally proposed five debates between the candidates.\n\nVan de Putte slightly stumbled on her words at times during the hourlong town hall, which was livestreamed in Spanish on Univision San Antonio\u2019s website. But she hit Patrick on issues including immigration, abortion and the Affordable Care Act, attempting to reach out to Hispanic voters whose turnout could be crucial to her electoral success.\n\n\"I'm frustrated like thousands of others,\" Van de Putte said about the lack of action by President Obama and Congress on immigration reform.\n\nShe criticized Patrick\u2019s Republican primary description of the influx of undocumented immigrants from Mexico as an \u201cillegal invasion,\u201d calling it disrespectful to Hispanics in the state.\n\nAnd she also defended Davis\u2019 two terminated pregnancies, which the gubernatorial candidate wrote about in a memoir published this week. Van de Putte dismissed the idea that voters would be turned off by the revelations, saying they were personal decisions that were made for medical reasons.\n\nIf elected lieutenant governor, Van de Putte would lead a Senate that is overwhelmingly Republican. But on Friday she said she would work with conservatives to increase funding to women\u2019s health programs to help prevent the need for abortion instead of further restricting access to the procedure.\n\nPatrick emphatically opposes abortion and has been a loud advocate for the strict abortion regulations lawmakers have enacted in recent years. He sponsored the legislation that led to the state\u2019s requirement that doctors perform a sonogram on a woman at least 24 hours before she has an abortion.\n\nVan de Putte also called for finding a state-specific solution to expanding Medicaid to cover poor, uninsured adults under the federal Affordable Care Act. Since the federal health law was passed in 2010, Texas Republicans, including Patrick, have strongly opposed an expansion, saying Medicaid must be reformed before it is expanded.\n\n\u201cWe can find a Texas Solution,\u201d Van de Putte said during the town hall. \u201cOther states with Republican-led Legislatures have done it.\u201d\n\nThe event recorded on Friday evening was set to air on Univision San Antonio stations on Friday at 10 p.m., and in Houston, Dallas and Austin \u201cat a later date,\u201d according to organizers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a Spanish-language townhall on Univision, state Sen.
