The grand opening event will also coincide with the dance troop\u2019s 24th anniversary.\n\nLucy McLemore, better known as \u201cMiss Lucy\u201d is the owner and director of The Dance Gallery 2. She said the new studio in West Roseville is designed like a dancer\u2019s dream, boasting two large spring-suspended floating Beachwood floors, mirrors, ballet barres and a professional sound system. Every aspect of the studio\u2019s design is meant to give dance students the feel of professional rehearsals.\n\nThe new Dance Gallery 2 building sat vacant for more than three years, as Miss Lucy and her team struggled with Placer County officials over a host of expensive zoning and permit issues. More than 18 men, whose daughters are dancers at DG2, volunteered 700 collective hours of free work on the building.\n\n\u201cEven though my husband and I took our retirement savings, we think doing it the right way was the best way to go,\u201d Miss Lucy told the Press Tribune this week. \u201cAll these dancers have been around since they were 3 or 4 four years old. (Instructor) Ashley Rudolph has been here since she was three, and our other instructor here has been here since she was five \u2014 now they are in their 30s \u2026 It\u2019s a family thing. When you are coming to my home you are part of my family.\n\nClass enrollment for DG2 is underway, and the studio will host its Grand Opening Celebration Carnival Saturday Nov. 1 from 10 am to 2 pm. The festivities are open to the public and include pony rides, hot dogs, popcorn, a bounce house, cotton candy and carnival games. The Dance Gallery 2 is located at 6680 Baseline Road in West Roseville.
