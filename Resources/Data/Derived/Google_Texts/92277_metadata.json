Of course there\u2019s no libertarian moment, huffed Democratic and Republican partisans. Yet if you want more evidence that a libertarian moment is gathering in contemporary America\u2014and that it is fundamentally a pre-political, pre-partisan impulse with the potential to seriously alter existing conversations and coalitions\u2014look no further than Ferguson, Missouri, where a tragically delayed discussion about police militarization and race that has finally captured the public imagination.\n\nIn small towns and big cities alike, African Americans have long complained about having to deal with (predominantly white) cops who sometimes act like occupying armies. Sadly, there\u2019s nothing particularly unique about the August 9 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police. Police kill unarmed people\u2014especially unarmed black men\u2014all the time, and it usually doesn\u2019t touch off a wide-ranging national discussion about much of anything. For instance, how many Americans have heard about John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by police after picking up a toy gun in a Wal-Mart earlier this month?\n\nOne of the reasons Ferguson is different is because of the spectacularly ham-fisted response by local law enforcement when faced with protests after a highly questionable death. It goes without saying that there is still much to be learned about the circumstances of Brown\u2019s shooting and the events surrounding it, all of which may exonerate the police. However, there\u2019s no question that local authorities helped to massively escalate a tense situation with every decision they made, from refusing at first to name the officer involved in the shooting, to confronting peaceful demonstrators with weapons of war, to releasing a videotape of Brown apparently robbing a convenience store the day he was shot.\n\nWhat has helped the story to go fully national, however, is that the events surrounding it exemplify the concerns that libertarians have been raising for decades about the militarization of police, which has its roots both in the drug war and the post-9/11 terror-industrial complex. As my former colleague Radley Balko, now at The Washington Post, has documented for years (first at The Cato Institute, then at Reason, and most fully in last year\u2019s Rise of the Warrior Cop), \u201cThe buzz phrase in policing today is officer safety. You\u2019ll also hear lots of references to preserving order, and fighting wars, be it on crime, drugs, or terrorism. Those are all concepts that emphasize confrontation. It\u2019s a view that pits the officers as the enforcer, and the public as the entity upon which laws and policies and procedures are to be enforced.\u201d\n\nBalko is just one of many libertarians who worked to highlight these issues long before Ferguson erupted. \u201cDress like a soldier and you think you\u2019re at war,\u201d Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at University of Tennessee and the proprietor of the massively influential libertarian aggregator site Instapundit, wrote in 2006. \u201cAnd, in wartime, civil liberties\u2014or possible innocence\u2014of the people on \u2018the other side\u2019 don\u2019t come up much. But the police aren\u2019t at war with the citizens they serve, or at least they\u2019re not supposed to be.\u201d\n\nAt the same time that libertarians have been archly critical of the Pentagon and other federal programs that have shipped surplus war gear to local police with little training and even less accountability, we\u2019ve also been talking up the revolutionary power of cheap, decentralized technology that allows individual citizens to talk back to power, including by filming the police. \u201cWatched cops are polite cops,\u201d after all, especially now that videos of police brutality can be spread through social media.\n\nIn Ferguson, minority outrage at police mistreatment has intersected with the libertarian critique of state power in a way that has brought the concerns of both groups to a national audience. Most interestingly, the coverage of Ferguson hasn\u2019t been dominated by figures such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. Even a few years ago, they would have been at the forefront of the coverage. Now, the people at the center of this conversation have been journalists on the scene and local community spokespeople.\n\nAnd when it does come to the political class, Rand Paul\u2019s op-ed in Time was far and away the most trenchant (and early) sustained commentary on Ferguson and the issues it raises. \u201cThere is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, what Ferguson demonstrates is how tightly related abstract concerns libertarians have about the government\u2019s power and the very real-life fears of police harassment that many African Americans have really are. So too are other issues of interest to both groups, ranging from school choice to sentencing reform to occupational licensing. As these sorts of newly recognized common causes filter through the culture, all sorts of new coalitions and possibilities can come to fruition. Glimpses of this are already visible in actions such as the nearly successful effort by Republican Rep. Justin Amash and Democratic Rep. John Conyers to defund National Security Agency surveillance programs last summer.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "nickgillespie"}, "keywords": "Ferguson Missouri, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201408210945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Ferguson Missouri, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Libertarian Moment in Ferguson", "tags": "obsessional:michael-brown-ferguson-missouri,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "A new kind of politics is being born in the discussion over race and militarized policing in Ferguson.", "title": "The Libertarian Moment in Ferguson", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/21/the-libertarian-moment-in-ferguson.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/21/the-libertarian-moment-in-ferguson/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1408614333706.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "A new kind of politics is being born in the discussion over race and militarized policing in Ferguson.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Nick Gillespie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-08-21T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/nick-gillespiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/21/the-libertarian-moment-in-ferguson", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Libertarian Moment in Ferguson\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/21/the-libertarian-moment-in-ferguson.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/21/the-libertarian-moment-in-ferguson/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46953811.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/08/21/the-libertarian-moment-in-ferguson\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-21T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Nick Gillespie\",\"tags\":[\"michael-brown-ferguson-missouri\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/n/nick-gillespie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf542\"", "article_summary": "Of course there\u2019s no libertarian moment, huffed Democratic and Republican partisans.\nOne of the reasons Ferguson is different is because of the spectacularly ham-fisted response by local law enforcement when faced with protests after a highly questionable death.\nIn Ferguson, minority outrage at police mistreatment has intersected with the libertarian critique of state power in a way that has brought the concerns of both groups to a national audience.\nUPRISINGA new kind of politics is being born in the discussion over race and militarized policing in Ferguson.\nMost interestingly, the coverage of Ferguson hasn\u2019t been dominated by figures such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton."}
