Buckley Air Force Airman Shaquille Hargrove was trying to prevent violence when he was gunned down.

His fatal shooting on July 13, 2013, happened in Lower Downtown Denver. He became one of the latest murder victims in a hot zone for violence early weekend mornings. His murder remains unsolved.

Closing time in Denver’s “LoDo” entertainment district can be dangerous. Brawls and sometimes shootings can happen.

Colorado state law dictates that bars serving liquor must shut their doors at 2 a.m.

In LoDo, huge crowds of people pack sidewalks in the minutes before and after that deadline.

According to one Denver Post report, a person is more likely to be a crime victim between 1 and 3 a.m. in LoDo than in any other part of the city at that time.

It’s been that way for a long time.

For example, in the early morning hours of Sunday, Nov. 6, 2007, 15th Street between Market and Blake streets in the heart of LoDo became a shooting gallery.

Rob McGowan, an audio engineer at Poor House Pub, 1435 Market St., told a Denver Post reporter at the time that he first heard tires squealing as a car raced down Market.

Then a fusillade of bullets erupted and people began dropping on the street.

Eight people were shot including Theodore Padilla, a father of three, who was fatally injured outside Hush nightclub.

In 2008, there was a closing-time gunfight in a parking lot at 18th and Market, in which officers killed one man and wounded another who fired a shotgun at them.

Hargrove’s murder happened at 2:04 a.m. on a Saturday. The morning at closing time several fights broke out at 15th and Market streets.

It was chaos.

A gunshot was fired in a LoDo alley. In another incident, a man accidentally shot himself in the leg while pulling out a gun.
