Florida ranks as the ninth-best state for an early retirement, according to a survey released Tuesday.

The Sunshine State is one of the top states for people 55- to 64-year-olds wanting to retire early because it has no income tax and relatively low living expenses, reported SmartAsset, a personal finance website.

The absence of income tax alone saves early retirees hundreds of dollars a year compared with most other states on the East Coast, the personal finance website said.

Living expenses are low or moderate in most parts of Florida, allowing early retirees to keep more of their nest egg, SmartAsset added. However, it warned about South Florida. "Housing costs in the Miami area are quite high, while Panhandle cities like Tallahassee are far more affordable," it said.

The website also looked at state and local sales tax rates, average property tax rates, the non-housing cost of living and the average annual cost of a silver Obamacare health insurance plan.

The top state for early retirees was Kentucky with its income tax breaks to retirees — no matter their age — and low living expenses, including housing.
