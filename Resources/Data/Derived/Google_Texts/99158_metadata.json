But it was widely seen as undermining the fight against corruption.\n\nKabul Bank had to be bailed out by the government in 2010 after racking up losses of almost $1 billion in a scandal that shook confidence in Afghanistan's financial system and exposed widespread corruption among the country's business elite.\n\nAlong with Kabul Bank founder Sher Khan, Ferozi was sentenced in November last year to 15 years in prison for embezzling more than $800 million from the bank.\n\nA government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ferozi had been allowed to work during the day to be able to pay off his debts while serving his prison sentence at night.\n\nGhani said in a statement that the Smart City deal with Ferozi had been cancelled, while the sentence against him and others in the Kabul Bank case would be enforced in full. The status of some 34 acres of land he had put up for the project has also been put under review, he said.\n\nSpeaking by telephone from jail, Ferozi said the project had already raised $14 million in debt repayments and, if it went ahead, would raise $75 million for the government.\n\n\"The land belongs to me but if the government wants to sell it, they have the authority. But if they let the company build the township, from the money I earn, I will pay Kabul Bank's loan back,\" he told Reuters.\n\nFerozi's involvement in Smart City Township was branded \"outrageous\" by Integrity Watch Afghanistan, an anti-corruption watchdog.\n\n\"Allowing a convicted criminal to take part in a huge investment project brings Afghan government's commitment to fight corruption under serious question,\" the group's Executive Director Sayed Ikram Afzali said in a statement this week.\n\nAfter the government bailout, Kabul Bank was renamed New Kabul Bank and authorities have invited bids for privatisation of the new entity.
