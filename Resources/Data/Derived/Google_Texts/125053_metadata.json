James Clyburn (D-SC), a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that the protesters should have let the candidates speak.\n\n\u201cIf I ask you a question, I must want your answer. And so if I ask you a question and talk over your answer, what have I done?\u201d Clyburn said, stressing the importance of substance over symbolism and cautioning against anyone who wants to \u201cmake a headline rather than make headway.\u201d\n\nYet, as Peoples noted, all three major Democratic candidates have spent the week showing their concern for the black community.\n\nClinton, who skipped Netroots Nation, used a Facebook chat on Monday to emphasize that \u201ceveryone in this country should stand firmly behind\u201d the notion that \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\n\nSanders began working the phrase \u2018black lives matter\u2019 into his stump speech and social media efforts, while O\u2019Malley apologized and has made sure to repeatedly say he\u2019s \u201clistening and speaking to leaders\u201d from the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe candidates were acknowledging that, Brooks said, \u201cthe campaign rhetoric has not risen to the level of reality.\u201d\n\nSeizing the moment, the Black Lives Matter group \u2014a movement organizing action on topics important to the black community and racial injustice \u2014 decided to quickly put together a summit in Cleveland, Ohio. The summit describes itself as \u201chundreds of Black freedom fighters from around the country\u201d coming together to coordinate and build a new coalition for action in the black community. The conference offers panels on, for instance, self defense and organizing for black activists.\n\nIt comes after national attention fell on Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old African-American woman from Chicago who was pulled over by a Texas state highway patrolman for not signaling before changing lanes and then was jailed for not putting out her cigarette in her car, even though that\u2019s not illegal. She died in jail, allegedly by hanging herself.\n\nBland\u2019s death has further galvanized black leaders to demand that their concerns be heard. Many appreciate how the Democratic candidates talk about the black community\u2019s economic disadvantages, but want them to more explicitly tie those gaps to racism \u2014 while others note that Bland was a college graduate.\n\n\u201cWe get that the solution to the structural racism that black folks are facing is connected to fair wages, issues of access to education,\u201d Peoples said. \u201cThe piece that\u2019s missing is talking about how the legacy of racism, anti-blackness, and racial violence plays out in all of those issues.\u201d\n\nThere were also setbacks. Sanders, for instance, reportedly skipped a meeting with Black Lives Matters protesters during the Netroots Nation weekend and ended up sending campaign manager Jeff Weaver instead. That resulted in some grumbling.\n\n\u201cBullshit \u2014 I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jamal Simmons, a Democratic consultant, said. \u201cIf he was scheduled to meet with activists, then he should have met with activists. You can\u2019t not show up. You gotta show up.\u201d\n\nOther black leaders said that merely showing up wouldn\u2019t be enough, either.\n\n\u201cThe day is over for [the candidates] saying \u2018I believe in justice,\u2019 and \u2018Everyone should have equality, whether black or white, male or female, young or old,\u2019\u201d Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) said in a phone interview from Nairobi on Friday.\n\nTalking about how economic inequality affects African Americans is fine, legislators, activists and strategists said \u2014 but specific plans to address it are better.\n\nFor instance, Clyburn said, Sanders should offer a plan for dilapidated schools and Medicaid expansion in states that have resisted Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYes, the criminal justice stuff is big,\u201d said Democratic strategist and pollster Cornell Belcher. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to African-American women who will be a plurality in a lot of these Democratic primary states, education and not losing a lot of young people to crime and violence is still tops. And yeah, they have angst economically about jobs.\u201d\n\nOf the three main Democratic candidates, Clinton has been the most assertive in speaking to those issues.\n\nEarlier in the year, she unveiled a set of criminal justice reform proposals with mentions of the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, and Trayvon Martin in Florida. On Thursday, Clinton continued to beat that drum, saying in a panel at South Carolina\u2019s influential Brookland Baptist Church, \u201cIt\u2019s essential that we all stand up and say, loudly and clearly, that yes, black lives matter.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeeches like that have helped Clinton stay visible in the African-American community, Belcher said.\n\n\u201cI think that most of the polling that you see right now is that Sanders and O\u2019Malley are not very well known figures in the community,\u201d Belcher said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is for you to build a strategy around how to introduce yourself in the black community in a way that resonates with the value of the community and that\u2019s not hopefully tone-deaf which is what Bernie came across with.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something O\u2019Malley seems to have realized. On Wednesday, he released a statement saying his \u201cheart breaks for Sandra Bland and her family\u201d and called for a \u201cthorough and independent investigation of the traffic stop, the arrest and Ms. Bland\u2019s tragic death in custody.\u201d\n\nHe also called Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree on Wednesday to discuss the Black Lives Matter movement and topics important to the African-American community, as part of a series of discussions ahead of unveiling his criminal justice platform.\n\n\u201cWe had a robust and informative and strikingly candid conversation about the past, present, and future,\u201d Ogletree said, adding he expected to talk more with O\u2019Malley going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders has made sure to try and offer more specifics in media interviews and over social media.\n\n\u201cWe have more people in jail than any other country on Earth,\u201d Sanders said in an MSNBC interview on Wednesday. \u201cMillions of lives have been destroyed because people are in jail for non-violent crimes, so we have to take a look at mandatory minimums and the drug policy and the militarization of police forces all over the country. We have to take a look at use-of-force policy. That is what you saw in that dreadful and painful video of Sandra Bland.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work in front of us,\u201d Sanders added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protesters' clashes with Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley has sparked debate.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Protesters' clashes with Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley has sparked debate.", "title": "Netroots disruption energizes black activists", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/netroots-disruption-energizes-black-activists-120617.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/24/20150724_omalley_protest_netroots_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton 2016,Hillary Clinton,2016 Elections,Netroots,Bernie Sanders 2016,Martin O'Malley,Bernie Sanders,Elections,Protest,Democrats,Race,Martin O'Malley 2016,Arizona", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/daniel.strauss.758"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b68\"", "article_summary": "O\u2019Malley at one point said, \u201cblack lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter\u201d \u2014 a statement that offended many in the Black Lives Matter movement, who recall the phrase being used to diminish their cause.\n2016 Netroots disruption energizes black activistsProtesters who hijacked a presidential forum in Arizona last Saturday demanding that the candidates spend more time addressing problems in the black community left feeling dissatisfied.\nThe summit describes itself as \u201chundreds of Black freedom fighters from around the country\u201d coming together to coordinate and build a new coalition for action in the black community.\nSanders, for instance, reportedly skipped a meeting with Black Lives Matters protesters during the Netroots Nation weekend and ended up sending campaign manager Jeff Weaver instead.\nAnd yeah, they have angst economically about jobs.\u201dOf the three main Democratic candidates, Clinton has been the most assertive in speaking to those issues."}
