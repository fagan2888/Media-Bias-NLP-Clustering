COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Swedish police say several people were injured, including one seriously, when mounted police charged demonstrators in the southern part of the country.

Police spokeswoman Ewa-Gun Westford said Saturday that officers on horseback chased rock-throwing demonstrators who were “causing violent riots.” Local media had photos of people on the ground as police horses raced over them down a street in Malmo, Sweden’s third-largest city.

Westford also told the Swedish news agency TT that another person was injured after they were hit by a police van.

Approximately 1,000 people had gathered in Malmo to protest an election rally by a far-right group, the Party of the Swedes, ahead of the country’s Sept. 14 parliamentary vote.
