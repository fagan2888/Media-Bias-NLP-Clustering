That's when I got into politics and got involved,\" he said. \"A lot of young people around me were thinking that same thing, and it wasn\u2019t about anything else.\"\n\nBut don't expect the same jubilation this November in Raleigh, Stubbs said. With the first African-American president re-elected \u2014 his place in history secure \u2014 Stubbs and many of his peers are significantly less enthused about participating this year.\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old had only a vague notion that there was an election in 2014 and no idea who was on the ballot.\n\n\"We're on pause,\" Stubbs said of how he feels about the country's direction. \"It don\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going in no direction right now.\"\n\nFor Kay Hagan, the first-term senator from this traditionally conservative state \u2014 and for a Democratic Party banking on her re-election to help it hold its Senate majority \u2014 that is worrisome news.\n\nHagan was elected in 2008, riding a wave of enthusiasm about Obama\u2019s candidacy among typically Democratic-leaning voters. A record 72 percent of registered black voters went to the polls then, surpassing the 66 percent turnout among white voters, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan good-governance group Democracy North Carolina. About 55 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 cast ballots in North Carolina, playing a decisive role in Democratic victories in the state.\n\nBut seven months before the midterm elections, there are early indications that the Hagan campaign and Democrats will have to work much harder to get those voters back.\n\nTwo years ago, Mitt Romney narrowly reclaimed the state for Republicans in the presidential election. And in 2010, despite a continuing demographic transformation powered by an influx of young and minority voters, there was a surge of older whites casting ballots that led to a North Carolina Democratic rout.\n\nA repeat of 2010 would prove a nightmare scenario for Hagan and other Democrats running in traditionally Republican states this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to come out at 2008 levels,\u201d Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University, said of those who catapulted Hagan to national office the first time. \u201cBut if the electorate looks like 2010, she's just toast.\u201d\n\nThe silver lining might be that Hagan still has time to make an impression.\n\n\n\n\"People aren\u2019t tuned into the U.S. Senate race right now, and they\u2019re not going to tune in until the fall,\" said Thomas Mills, a Democratic political consultant who runs the website PoliticsNC.com. \"If those people still don\u2019t know there\u2019s a Senate race in the fall, that\u2019s worrisome.\"\n\n\n\nStill, according to The Washington Post, outside conservative groups have already spent $7 million against Hagan, hammering her for her support of the Affordable Care Act, which remains unpopular in the state.\n\nPolitical analysts note that Hagan is trying to walk a very fine line, attempting to activate the Obama coalition while also branding herself an independent-minded moderate Democrat palatable to a state that still has a strong strain of small-government conservatism.\n\nDespite the high stakes, among more than a dozen interviews with young African-American voters in Raleigh, the most common reaction to questions about the midterms was surprise that there were elections at all.\n\n\n\nThat was the case for Shaw senior Gregory Fisher. Without the excitement of a historic presidential race, 23-year-old Fisher admitted, it was harder for students like him to feel they had a stake in politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of those people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m not hearing about it and Obama\u2019s not in the picture, I guess I ain\u2019t got to vote.\u201d\n\nJerika Fisher, another 23-year-old Shaw senior, remembers her mother and her grandmother waking her up in the middle of the night to celebrate Obama\u2019s victory in 2008, before she was old enough to vote.\n\n\u201cThey felt like there would be a president that actually cared about them,\u201d she said.\n\nFisher said she voted for the president in 2012 and plans to vote again this year \u2014 probably for Democratic candidates \u2014 but that the last few years have taught her to be wary of politicians' promises.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see much change,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people have been let down after they were excited about voting the first time, they get discouraged. They don\u2019t feel like it\u2019ll make a difference.\u201d\n\nShaw senior Alibaba Odd put his support for Obama in 2012 more simply. \u201cHe embodied the struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be there, and he was.\u201d\n\nNow, Odd added, \u201cpeople aren\u2019t really aware of what\u2019s going on [politically].\u201d\n\nFrederick Harris, director of the Center of African-American Politics and Society at Columbia University, pointed out that in addition to Obama\u2019s absence from the ticket, there have been few policies coming out of a gridlocked Washington that give black voters a reason to come to the polls. While immigration reform can be a galvanizing issue for Hispanic-Americans and gay rights for the LGBT community, there\u2019s no equivalent lightning rod for black voters.\n\nThere remain, however, recalcitrant problems for the African-American community. In the Obama era, the black unemployment rate is still double that of whites; black men are six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men nationwide; in North Carolina, black families are almost three times as likely to be in poverty as white families.\n\nIn order to galvanize black voters, along with young people and women, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has launched something called the Bannock St. Project, a sophisticated voter-turnout machine that will bring $60 million and 4,000 field staffers into 10 states, including North Carolina.\n\nHagan campaign spokeswoman Sadie Wiener promised a turnout operation that was \"the biggest, most effective that North Carolina has ever seen in a Senate race,\" although she did not detail any specific minority outreach efforts when contacted by Al Jazeera.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it's going to be [Hagan's] personal appeal that makes the difference with African-American turnout,\" said North Carolina political analyst John Davis. \"She is simply not that dynamic a candidate when it comes to appealing to voters.\n\n\"This Bannock St. Project is designed to come in and do what she cannot do for herself,\" Davis added. \"Which is motivate the most loyal Democratic constituencies.\"\n\nKevin Hall, 18, a Shaw freshman, said he has had no contact with the Hagan campaign or Democrats yet, although his parents were strong Obama supporters in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenators don\u2019t really come to young people and ask us to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say they\u2019re going to do stuff and then they don\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They helped propel Kay Hagan to Senate in 2008, but Washington has had little to offer them in the past six years", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/4/north-carolina-senatekayhaganafricanamericanvoters.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/4/4/north-carolina-senatekayhaganafricanamericanvoters/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.nc_voter_polls_040214.1396604161608.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "They helped propel Kay Hagan to Senate in 2008, but Washington has had little to offer them in the past six years", "title": "With history made, N.C.\u2019s young black voters may pass on election"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/4/4/north-carolina-senatekayhaganafricanamericanvoters/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.nc_voter_polls_040214.1396604161608.jpg", "description": "They helped propel Kay Hagan to Senate in 2008, but Washington has had little to offer them in the past six years", "card": "summary", "title": "With history made, N.C.\u2019s young black voters may pass on election"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, North Carolina, Election 2014, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While immigration reform can be a galvanizing issue for Hispanic-Americans and gay rights for the LGBT community, there\u2019s no equivalent lightning rod for black voters.\nA record 72 percent of registered black voters went to the polls then, surpassing the 66 percent turnout among white voters, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan good-governance group Democracy North Carolina.\nAbout 55 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 cast ballots in North Carolina, playing a decisive role in Democratic victories in the state.\nAnd in 2010, despite a continuing demographic transformation powered by an influx of young and minority voters, there was a surge of older whites casting ballots that led to a North Carolina Democratic rout.\n\"A lot of young people around me were thinking that same thing, and it wasn\u2019t about anything else.\""}
