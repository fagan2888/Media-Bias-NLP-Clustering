A convicted child rapist from Hutchinson who was paroled last year is back in jail on new charges.

It was about 3:30 Wednesday afternoon when detectives arrested 55-year-old Steven R. Peterman in the parking lot of the Hutchinson Mall at 1500 East 11th Avenue, Capt. Steve Lutz said. The arrest is the result of two-week investigation conducted by the Reno County Sheriff’s Office.

It’s alleged that Peterman was engaged in conversations via cell phone with a detective who he believed to be a 14- or 15-year-old girl. He then went to the mall to pick up the girl with the intentions of helping her run away from home.

He was under surveillance the entire time he was in the parking lot, so no citizens were in danger, Lutz said.

Peterman is being held on charges of electronic solicitation of a child, indecent solicitation of a child, attempted indecent liberties with a child, two counts of violation of the sex offender registration act, and violating parole. His bond was set at $52,500.

Officials say Peterman also failed to register a cell phone and website, which he allegedly used to contact who he thought was an underage girl, the Hutch Post reports.

A hearing is scheduled for February 19.

Peterman spent 10 years in prison for December 2002 convictions of two counts of rape and electronic solicitation of a child. He was paroled in January of 2013.

He also has convictions for three counts of theft, perjury and issuing a worthless check. Those cases go back to 1979 and 1980. Records show he was also incarcerated from March of 1980 to September of 1983.
