But I\u2019ve seen nothing in our coverage about the mall\u2019s most landmark moment: its appearance in the one and only film ever directed by David Byrne, the head Talking Head.\n\nNorthPark is actually one of two local malls in True Stories, which was released in 1986 and set during the Texas Sesquicentennial (in a place called \u201cVirgil, Texas\u201d); the other was Big Town in Mesquite, razed in 2006 to make room for development that never developed. In the movie, The Mall represents the new town square of small-town Virgil. \u201cShopping,\u201d says Byrne\u2019s nameless Narrator, \u201chas become the thing that brings people together.\u201d Big Town served as the exterior; NorthPark provided the interior.\n\nThe movie, inspired by tabloid items clipped and collected during the Heads\u2019 Stop Making Sense tour, is less a cohesive plot than an unstructured \u201ctime line,\u201d as Oak Cliff\u2019s own Stephen Tobolowsky put it in his podcast about the making of True Stories. Byrne \u2014 who wrote the film with Tobolowsky and his fellow SMU Mustang and longtime girlfriend Beth Henley, then ditched about 94 percent of the first draft \u2014 didn\u2019t even intend to set the film in Texas, much less shoot it here. But as he writes in the companion book, long out of print, Byrne ultimately decided it was the only place in which to shoot True Stories.\n\n\u201cAfter the first trip it was hard to think of the story as taking place anywhere else,\u201d he writes in the intro. \u201cThe people in Texas and the people who gravitate there have always had this fiercely independent spirit. While they may not be tolerant of a lot of things, they seem to be fairly tolerant of personal eccentricities. There\u2019s enough room in Texas for people to live their personal lives any way they want.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: It\u2019d be interesting to see if he still agrees with that sentiment.] \u201cWhatever works for you is OK. This leads to a lot of excess \u2026 Most of all, Texas looked great.\u201d\n\nHe goes on for a while about the landscape, about our highways, about how \u201cthe modern urban center is a hole.\u201d He writes about how we abandoned the city for the suburbs and abandoned the urban core, and about the city center\u2019s slow rebirth \u2014 from \u201cdisrepair and decay to a state of \u2026 cute.\u201d And he writes about how, while he was here, Trammell Crow was putting the finishing touches on the Infomart on the site of the old Cobb Stadium on Stemmons. Byrne was bemused by its gleaming presence: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the weirdest pieces of architecture ever, a huge trade mart devoted to the microelectronics industry modeled after the Crystal Palace or maybe it was the Brighton Pavilion. It\u2019s like trying to make a computer look like a grandfather clock.\u201d\n\nHe never wrote about NorthPark, but the book does feature an excerpt from Michael Ennis\u2019 November 1985 Texas Monthly about NorthPark \u2014 the one bearing the headline \u201cPost-Modern Times: NorthPark dared to be different. It dared to be good.\u201d You can read the story here. This is one of the lines Byrne chose to pull from that piece: \u201c[Ray] Nasher believed that a mall could be the nucleus of something that could eventually rival the great city centers of the Old World. The roads were leading away from Rome, so move Rome.\u201d\n\nThe very sentiment echoed by the Talking Head\u2019s Narrator below as he and, eventually, John Goodman stroll through NorthPark:\n\nThat scene leads to the second one below \u2014 the runway show, a surreal spectacle filmed outside the old Lord & Taylor once next to the NorthPark I & II cinemas. Somewhere in that scene, you might be able to spot my oldest friend, Michael Thum, who called me after he\u2019d returned home from shoe-shopping with David Byrne. I asked Michael to recap that night.\n\n\u201cWe were looking at shoes \u2014 it was the shoe store where Eiseman Jewels is now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was at night. We were both sitting there, next to each other, waiting for someone to come help us, but no one came. Finally, Byrne got up, walked to the back and, in a pretty rude tone, asked if someone was there and could someone come help us, then he sat back down. Finally, someone came out and said, \u2018Who said that?\u2019 Byrne pointed at me.\n\n\u201cAnyway, the next day they were shooting the runway scene, so he invited me to come be an extra, a mall shopper in the background. So I skipped football practice to be an extra in the movie. But I\u2019ve never been able to find me in the scene.\u201d\n\nLook again, Michael.\n\nThere are two great pieces about True Stories, if you\u2019re so inclined: Nathan Rubin\u2019s 2014 appreciation for The Dissolve, and Rick Poynor\u2019s for the Design Observer two years earlier. The latter addresses the scene above, and returns us to The Mall:\n\nIn his song \u201cThe Big Country\u201d (1978), Byrne had looked down from his seat on a plane at the folksy communities of Middle America and seemed to be eulogizing the homeland, until he declared, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t live there if you paid me.\u201d Now, visiting Virgil\u2019s mall, he paints a sympathetic picture of consumers choosing to shop where it is convenient, clean and there are bargains to be found. \u201cPeople here are inventing their own system of beliefs,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re creating it, doing it, selling it, making it up as they go along.\u201d Kay Culver, the immaculately groomed wife of Earl Culver, a civic leader, introduces the mall\u2019s fashion show \u2014 \u201cShopping is a feeling,\u201d she lilts. \u201cSometimes I get a wobbly feeling. I have a commercial feeling. Be sexy in business. Be successful at night\u201d \u2014 before launching into \u201cDream Operator,\u201d a song full of silky-sweet yearning.\n\nWhich is so NorthPark.\n\nTrue Stories was made available on DVD 16 years ago as a dreadful pan-and-scan \u2014 suitable only for viewing on a tube TV, perhaps as God and David Byrne intended.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA4L3RydWUtc3Rvcnktc3Ryb2xsaW5nLXRocm91Z2gtbm9ydGhwYXJrLXdpdGgtZGF2aWQtYnlybmUtZHVyaW5nLXRoZS1tYWxscy01MHRoLWJpcnRoZGF5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Much has been made in these pages, virtual and otherwise, about NorthPark Center's 50th, which officially kicks off today with a \"Fifty Years of Excellence\" daylong wingding featuring a celeb\u2026", "title": "True story: Strolling through NorthPark with David Byrne during the mall\u2019s 50th birthday", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/08/true-story-strolling-through-northpark-with-david-byrne-during-the-malls-50th-birthday.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/08/DavidByrneatNorthPark.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-08-22T08:37:10Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "But as he writes in the companion book, long out of print, Byrne ultimately decided it was the only place in which to shoot True Stories.\n\u201cShopping,\u201d says Byrne\u2019s nameless Narrator, \u201chas become the thing that brings people together.\u201d Big Town served as the exterior; NorthPark provided the interior.\nTrue Stories was made available on DVD 16 years ago as a dreadful pan-and-scan \u2014 suitable only for viewing on a tube TV, perhaps as God and David Byrne intended.\nBut I\u2019ve seen nothing in our coverage about the mall\u2019s most landmark moment: its appearance in the one and only film ever directed by David Byrne, the head Talking Head.\n\u201cAfter the first trip it was hard to think of the story as taking place anywhere else,\u201d he writes in the intro."}
