Recent medical advances around resuscitation and life support for extremely premature infants are no exception, and new options have opened a set of difficult conversations that many would rather avoid.\n\nEarlier Viability\n\nThis fall, two groups of experts lowered their bar for neonatal resuscitation from 23 weeks gestation to 22 weeks because new medical technologies allow an increasing number of infants delivered at that stage to survive by completing their gestation outside of the womb. For couples who are yearning for a baby but faced with a tenuous pregnancy, this news offers new hope.\n\nThere is good reason to believe that sometime in the future it will be possible to incubate a healthy human infant outside the womb from the time of conception, and medical practice is inexorably moving toward that point. If we ignore, for the moment, the question of healthy development after the fact and focus simply on survival, the statistics are already impressive: About 72 percent of infants born at 25 weeks gestation survive, followed by 55 percent of those born at 24 weeks, 26 percent of those born at 23 weeks, and 6 percent of those born at 22 weeks.\n\nIn the past, the second trimester miscarriage of a wanted pregnancy led to loss and grief. Now things are more complicated. The potential for survival means that doctors and families faced with late miscarriage are also faced with a complicated decision\u2014whether or not to initiate life support that includes incubation, intubation, a chemical bath to stimulate lung development, and possible repeated surgeries and transfusions during the coming months or even years.\n\nLife and Quality of Life\n\nWere this simply a matter of life and death, the questions faced by families and medical ethicists might be much clearer. Unfortunately, at this point in history, most extremely premature infants grow into children who experience a lifetime of cognitive or physical disability, sometimes subtle and sometimes severe, and doctors are unable to predict in advance which few will go on to lead healthy, normal lives. In one study of 357 live births at 22 weeks, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, active treatment was started in 79 cases and 18 survived. Of those, 11 were moderately or severely impaired as toddlers, presaging a lifetime of special needs and intensive support services. The extent of more subtle mental and health impairments in the other seven remains to be seen.\n\nThe challenges come in part because at this stage in history even the best state-of-the-art care outside the womb fails to provide a perfect incubation environment for a developing fetus. Also, the process of transitioning a fetus from womb to external incubation is imperfect. Interruptions in the flow of oxygen, temperature fluctuations and other aspects of the transition can have lifelong consequences, whether that life is short or long.\n\nNature\u2019s Imperfect Wisdom\n\nBut another set of challenges comes from the fact that early miscarriages are pregnancies that nature herself is rejecting, often (though not always) because the mother\u2019s body has not been able to provide a healthy gestational environment or because the fetus is defective. In other words, these are budding lives with the odds stacked against survival and subsequent health even before any question of imperfect medical technology or care comes into play.\n\n\n\nMiscarriage\u2014or in medical terms, spontaneous abortion\u2014is one of nature\u2019s mechanisms for stacking the odds in favor of healthy children. Sexual reproduction, which combines DNA from two individuals of a species, is a vastly imperfect process, and nature optimizes for healthy offspring by rejecting most combinations at some point along the path. Very defective eggs or sperm may fail to form an embryo. Most embryos fail to implant or else spontaneously self-abort. As pregnancy progresses, spontaneous abortion becomes less likely, but a high death rate from imperfect reproduction continues clear into infancy for most species, as it has historically for ours.\n\nIn human beings, an estimated 60 to 80 percent of fertilized eggs fail to reach the live birth stage even without therapeutic abortion as part of the mix. In humans as in other species, this failure rate is\u2014to put it in tech terms\u2014a feature, not a bug. It allows for the mother\u2019s body to put energy into those offspring most likely to survive and thrive and go on to have healthy children of their own. But this process too is imperfect. Sometimes a healthy fetus gets rejected from a healthy mother; sometimes horrible defects slip through\u2014even those that are incompatible with any form of life outside the womb.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As we lower the bar for neonatal resuscitation, questions faced by families & medical ethicists become more urgent", "title": "Moving the dial on what\u2019s possible: When it comes to extremely premature infants, what we can and what we should do are not always the same", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As we lower the bar for neonatal resuscitation, questions faced by families & medical ethicists become more urgent", "title": "Moving the dial on what\u2019s possible: When it comes to extremely premature infants, what we can and what we should do are not always the same", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/28/moving_the_dial_on_whats_possible_when_it_comes_to_extremely_premature_infants_what_we_can_and_what_we_should_do_are_not_always_the_same/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/woman_upset.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As we lower the bar for neonatal resuscitation, questions faced by families & medical ethicists become more urgent", "title": "Moving the dial on what\u2019s possible: When it comes to extremely premature infants, what we can and what we should do are not always the same", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/woman_upset.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Valerie Tarico", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Medical ethics, Pregnancy, premature birth", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In other words, these are budding lives with the odds stacked against survival and subsequent health even before any question of imperfect medical technology or care comes into play.\nSometimes a healthy fetus gets rejected from a healthy mother; sometimes horrible defects slip through\u2014even those that are incompatible with any form of life outside the womb.\nRecent medical advances around resuscitation and life support for extremely premature infants are no exception, and new options have opened a set of difficult conversations that many would rather avoid.\nFor couples who are yearning for a baby but faced with a tenuous pregnancy, this news offers new hope.\nMiscarriage\u2014or in medical terms, spontaneous abortion\u2014is one of nature\u2019s mechanisms for stacking the odds in favor of healthy children."}
