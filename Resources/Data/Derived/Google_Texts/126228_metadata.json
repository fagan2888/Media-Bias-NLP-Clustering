They want fast-food workers to unionize, so they can keep filling up while union membership rates in other industries run dry.\n\nService Employees International Union president Mary Kay Henry, who was paid $276,439 in worker dues in 2014, joined union activists at a McDonald\u2019s protest in San Francisco.\n\nSay Henry works full-time. Her hourly wage, then, amounts to $132.90 an hour. Say she worked 60-hour weeks. She would still make $88.60 \u2014 per hour.\n\nHenry was one of nine SEIU officers and employees paid more than $200,000 last year. Union secretary-treasurer Michael Fishman got $250,615, deputy chief of staff Scott Courtney was paid $232,060, and executive vice president Gerald Hudson made $227,605.\n\nAverage pay at SEIU headquarters was $83,960 in 2014, equivalent to more than $40 an hour at 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. The union paid 252 officers and employees more than $100,000 each.\n\nFor several years, SEIU has tried to unionize the fast-food industry. The union has spent almost $50 million on the Fight for $15 campaign, according to Worker Center Watch.\n\nChanting: \"Hold the burgers!\" \"Hold the fries!\" \"Make our wages supersize!\" #FightFor15 pic.twitter.com/6W6ifash94 \u2014 Mary Kay Henry (@MaryKayHenry) April 15, 2015\n\nWe're in McDonalds!

AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who was paid $322,131 last year, expressed his support.\n\nToday\u2019s #FightFor15 actions significantly advances a raising wages agenda that gives every worker a chance to achieve the American Dream. \u2014 Richard L.
