Abrams has revealed a first look at an X-Wing fighter that will appear in the upcoming \u201cStar Wars: Episode VII\u201d via a video posted on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d YouTube channel. The acclaimed director checks in from the set, where he\u2019s detailed a new reward for the film franchise\u2019s charity initiative, \u201cForce for Change.\u201d\n\nHere, Abrams touts a new prize package that includes a set visit, the chance to appear in the film and a private screening in the winner\u2019s hometown before the film hits theaters on December 18, 2015. During his short plea, the camera pans out to reveal the sleek, possibly banged up fighter vessel. As Abrams wraps up, a small droid scurries through the set and the rightful owner of the X-Wing hops aboard.\n\nThe charity drive is raising money for UNICEF\u2019s Innovation Labs and is hosted by Omaze. Fans can enter the contest by making a donation as small as $10. So far, Abrams says participants from 119 countries have donated; the effort raised more than a million dollars in the first 24 hours of launch.\n\nThe highly anticipated installment in the franchise will feature the return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) along with new cast members, \u201cGirls\u201d star Adam Driver, Academy Award winning actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Gwendoline Christie and \u201cInside Llewyn Davis\u201d star Oscar Isaac.\n\nCheck out the clip below:", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "J.J.
