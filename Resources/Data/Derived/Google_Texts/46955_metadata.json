His Facebook page weighed in on the same story, calling it \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and vowing that House Republicans \u201cwill continue working to scrap this broken law.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: The shocking claim \u2014 that the President\u2019s health reforms resulted in sick children being denied care \u2014 was flat-out false. Which Boehner\u2019s staff must have known, assuming they actually read the material they were helping to spread across the Internet.\n\nIn fact, all of the children in question did get care, as was perfectly clear in the Jan. 30 press release from Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital that got this snowball started.\n\nIt said so right in the headline: \u201cChildren\u2019s Hospital Treats 125 Patients in January Who Lost Contracted Access Through Washington\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange.\u201d\n\nPeople versed in health-industry jargon will spot what\u2019s really going on here: a dispute over out-of-network coverage.\n\nTo control costs, some of the insurance companies pitching plans on Washington\u2019s health exchange chose to leave Seattle Children\u2019s out of their coverage networks. (The hospital is suing the state insurance commissioner for allowing them to do this.)\n\nNow, families who enrolled in those plans \u2014 many unaware of the restriction \u2014 are showing up at Seattle Children\u2019s with their kids, some of them seriously ill.\n\nInstead of transferring them to another provider, the hospital chose to go ahead and treat them, battle it out with the insurance companies and eat any losses. Of the 200 \u201cexception requests\u201d filed on behalf of 125 patients, 12 have been approved and eight denied. The rest are still pending.\n\nSo, again, no kid was heartbreakingly denied care. The hospital is being denied its usual reimbursement for some, but not all, of the out-of-network patients it knowingly and voluntarily served.\n\nSeattle TV station King 5 carelessly framed this as \u201cpatients being denied specialty treatment.\u201d The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, then further mangled the story in a blog post as \u201cSick kids denied specialty care due to Obamacare in Washington.\u201d Which is what Boehner promulgate d to his 292,000 Twitter followers and 410,000 Facebook friends.\n\nLike many of the Obamacare horror stories circulating in conservative cyberspace, it was too horrific to be true.\n\nBeyond the inaccuracy is the gall it takes for Boehner to point his finger at Obama for denying care to anyone.\n\nHad his House GOP gotten its way with one of their 40 votes to repeal Obamacare, millions of newly covered Americans would still be living without private insurance or reliable access to health care of any kind.\n\nOn top of that are the millions of low-income families \u2014 including plenty of children \u2014 being left in the cold because Boehner\u2019s fellow Republicans in 25 states refused to expand Medicaid, even with Washington picking up 100% of the extra cost.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s head-spinningly hypocritical for Republicans to bemoan coverage limits in Obamacare while simultaneously attacking it for being too expensive.\n\nThe ACA does arguably encourage health plans to use limited networks as a cost-cutting strategy \u2014 since they\u2019re now competing on price through the exchanges and no longer allowed to use such counterproductive tactics as denying coverage for preexisting conditions. The practice can be a hassle or worse for patients and providers alike.\n\nBut it\u2019s been around since before Obama was a state senator from Illinois. And stopping it altogether would push America\u2019s highest-in-the-world health costs further into the stratosphere. It would also require even more government intervention in the health insurance market, which I thought Republicans opposed.\n\nBut the House GOP has no interest in presenting a coherent critique of Obamacare, let alone a workable alternative. That would involve making polically dicey choices about costs and benefits.\n\nInstead, making hay in an election year, they\u2019re attacking Obamacare from any direction they think will score political points \u2014 from raising legitimate questions about the botched website, to blaming the President for health-care snafus that have nothing to do with his law, to working themselves up into fits of fake outrage over sick kids.\n\nNever mind the facts. Forget logic. The House GOP is now channeling Groucho Marx: Whatever Obamacare is, they\u2019re against it.\n\nwhammond@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Bill Hammond", "twitter": {"description": "Hammond: House Speaker John Boehner lobbed a social media stink bomb this weekend that distilled Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act to their cynical, knee-jerk essence.", "title": "Anti-Obamacare, facts be damned", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/anti-obamacare-facts-damned-article-1.1601052", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1601051.1391475486!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/42-54739116.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "John Boehner, Seattle, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, U.S. Republican Party", "parsely-author": "Bill Hammond", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "John Boehner, Seattle, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, U.S. Republican Party", "news_keywords": "John Boehner, Seattle, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, U.S. Republican Party", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/anti-obamacare-facts-damned-article-1.1601052", "parsely-title": "Anti-Obamacare, facts be damned", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-04T04:00:00-0500", "sailthru.title": "Anti-Obamacare, facts be damned", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-04T09:00:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1601051.1391475486!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/42-54739116.jpg", "description": "Hammond: House Speaker John Boehner lobbed a social media stink bomb this weekend that distilled Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act to their cynical, knee-jerk essence.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Hammond: House Speaker John Boehner lobbed a social media stink bomb this weekend that distilled Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act to their cynical, knee-jerk essence.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Hammond: House Speaker John Boehner lobbed a social media stink bomb this weekend that distilled Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act to their cynical, knee-jerk essence.", "title": "Anti-Obamacare, facts be damned", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/anti-obamacare-facts-damned-article-1.1601052", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1601051.1391475486!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/42-54739116.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1601051.1391475486!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/42-54739116.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Bill Hammond", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd114\"", "article_summary": "It would also require even more government intervention in the health insurance market, which I thought Republicans opposed.\nSo, again, no kid was heartbreakingly denied care.\nWhich Boehner\u2019s staff must have known, assuming they actually read the material they were helping to spread across the Internet.\nPlus, it\u2019s head-spinningly hypocritical for Republicans to bemoan coverage limits in Obamacare while simultaneously attacking it for being too expensive.\nThe hospital is being denied its usual reimbursement for some, but not all, of the out-of-network patients it knowingly and voluntarily served."}
