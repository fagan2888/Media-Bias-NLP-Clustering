A white paper on the topic includes a scenario that would require contractors with the county to pay employees $16 an hour. California\u2019s current minimum wage is $9 an hour and will increase to $10 an hour Jan. 1. The general purpose of such an ordinance is to ensure that employers who hold county contracts pay employees a wage that keeps them above the poverty level, County Manager John Maltbie wrote in a report to the board. The basic principle of such an ordinance is to pay employees of county contractors a \u201cwage that allows them to take care of themselves without government assistance,\u201d Supervisor Dave Pine said. The county also has about 180 employees currently that do no earn $16 an hour. Lifting those wages would cost about $1 million annually. The community-based organizations, generally nonprofits, the county contracts with would see their expenses rise by up to $1.3 million annually under one scenario. Those expenses, however, would likely be absorbed by the county, Supervisor Don Horsley said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost us more money. We can\u2019t impose this without revisiting the contracts,\u201d he said. Pine agrees. \u201cThey already operate under extremely tight budgets. We would have to adjust their contracts but how much is unclear right now,\u201d Pine said Thursday.The county developed a rough estimate of both the Health System and Human Services Agency related to their $68.9 million annual contracts with nonprofits. In Santa Clara County, contractors are required to pay their employees $19.06 an hour and are given $2 an hour credits if they provide their employees with health benefits and another $2 an hour if they provide matching retirement benefits. The living wage in San Francisco is $13.34 an hour for for-profit contractors and $12.25 an hour for nonprofit contractors. A living wage ordinance could also affect Affordable Care Act eligibility because it is determined by income. \u201cIncreasing wages may make some employees ineligible for fully subsidized health care. They would still be eligible for insurance but may have to pay higher deductibles and/or premiums,\u201d Maltbie writes in the report. The county is looking at three possible approaches and potential impacts to contractor costs ranging from $14, $15 and $16 an hour living wage requirements. Horsley said the contracted employees provide valuable services but are often unable to afford to live locally. The living wage ordinance is being considered partly due to the housing crisis, Horsley said. \u201cMore and more service employees have to live farther and farther away and having to commute long hours,\u201d he said. Boosting the wage, however, will not solve the housing crisis, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small way in helping them with the added stresses of daily life,\u201d he said. A survey of all county contractors, however, will be required to get a true sense of the costs. \u201cThese jobs are vital to the community,\u201d Horsley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral and ethical obligation. They are being undercompensated for vitally important work.\u201d He noted that contract employees provide mental health, rehabilitation and services for the homeless that are critically needed in the area. Maltbie also discusses in his report how other counties enforce the living wage ordinance. Santa Clara County relies on contracted employees to ensure compliance by creating private rights of action for those improperly denied a living wage, Maltbie wrote in the report.
