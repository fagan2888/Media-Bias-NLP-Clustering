CAROLINA BEACH, NC (WWAY) — The 12th annual Polar Plunge was held at the Carolina Beach Boardwalk Saturday. The event also included a 5K race and 1-mile walk in efforts to raise money for the Special Olympics of New Hanover County.

Special Olympics NHC is a year-round program that involves about 600 local athletes who have intellectual disabilities.

Water temperatures are near 50 degrees and wind chills in the 20s didn’t stop people like Danny Tangredi from freezing for a reason.

“It was definitely worst than I thought it was going to be,” Tangredi said. “My skin is hurting and I’m frozen like a popsicle. I can barely talk. I feel like my face is frozen.”

New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office had officers in and around the water just in case someone needed medical attention.
