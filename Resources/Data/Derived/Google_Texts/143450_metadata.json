This was just the beginning of his sportswriter\u2019s voice.\n\nTo his peers, Kawakami, 49, San Jose Mercury News sports columnist, is known as the guy at the press conference who asks the hard questions. For 30 years, the old-school Philadelphia-trained journalist is absolutely unafraid to tell his readers (and Jim Harbaugh) what he thinks in his columns to expose the misleading realities. In 2013, his dogged reporting earned him California Sportswriter of the Year.\n\n\n\nIn (covering) sports, the guys were always having a ball.\n\nHe says he believes in respect, pride and the truth.\u201cThere are some columnists that write things for a reaction, but they don\u2019t necessarily believe them,\u201d San Francisco Chronicle sports columnist and former colleague Ann Killion said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tim really does that.\u201dGrowing up, Kawakami and his oldest brother and chore buddy, Paul, always argued about sports. They didn\u2019t lack self-confidence. \u201cClearly communicating your beliefs was important,\u201d Paul said of their upbringing.Journalism has been in the family\u2019s blood. His grandfather owned The New World-Sun, a San Francisco Japanese-language newspaper. His uncle also wrote for the publication.Out of the four boys, Paul and Tim both shared a passion for writing. Paul gave up that when he enrolled in law school. Years later, when Tim was applying to colleges, Paul convinced his little brother to pursue his dream of journalism. Kawakami attended Northwestern University \u201con a whim.\u201dAt The Daily Northwestern, Kawakami explored different beats covering campus fraternities to politics. However, he soon recognized the livelier sports section. When Kawakami was young, he lived in Oakland and cheered for the colorful Raiders in the 1970s when they won six American Football League division titles. His family moved to Burlingame and then he followed the struggling 49ers. Above all, the Giants was the team he cared about most since baseball was the sport of his childhood. He was already immersed in the conversation.\u201cI didn\u2019t have to do the research,\u201d he said. \u201cI was already thinking about it anyway.\u201dIt was when Kawakami wasn\u2019t covering sports when he realized that was his calling. \u201cIn sports, the guys were always having a ball,\u201d he said.During his senior year, his internship at the Philadelphia Daily News covering the Philadelphia Eagles served as his training ground. \u201cYou never want to be irrelevant or bad, and definitely if you\u2019re bad, you\u2019ll become irrelevant,\u201d Kawakami said of the vibrant yet ruthless sports atmosphere.Kawakami didn\u2019t want to sink before even starting his career. He learned how to be aggressive and readable.He aspired to imitate San Francisco Chronicle sports columnist Herb Caen\u2019s \u201czippy and quick\u201d writing style. He also admired Chicago Sun-Times sports columnist Mike Royko. \u201cIt was an 800-word journey and you\u2019d remember every word of it,\u201d Kawakami said. Both journalists represented the voice of their city.\u201cThere\u2019s not many fluffy features,\u201d Comcast SportsNet Bay Area sports columnist Ray Ratto said of Kawakami\u2019s columns. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of a Rottweiler in training.\u201dAt the Los Angeles Times, Kawakami covered the Lakers\u2019 beat during the Kobe-Shaq era. He worked 145 out of 147 days until the championship. \u201cIt was intoxicating because it was so important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was incredibly wearing.\u201dThe burnt-out Kawakami had his eyes set on becoming a columnist.\u201cAt the beat, I was already writing as a columnist,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a clear point of view.\u201d He wrote with wit, elegance and style.In 2000, there was an opening as a sports columnist at the Los Angeles Times, but his colleague T.J. Simers got the job. Kawakami returned to his hometown writing the page-2 column for the San Jose Mercury News.Over the years, Kawakami became one of the early digital media pioneers extending his reach through Tim\u2019s Talking Points blog in 2006, Twitter account in 2009, and \u201cThe TK Show\u201d podcast series this February. He has more than 57,000 Twitter followers . Now, he is everywhere.His dogged voice can easily be recognized. \u201cWhile 20 of him in a room could be really overbearing one of them is very refreshing,\u201d Ratto said.At Jim Tomsula\u2019s first public interview session as 49ers head coach, Kawakami asked him: \u201cI assumed you didn\u2019t miss throughout the season the reports that Jim Harbaugh was on his way out, that he had lost the locker room and also reports that you were in line maybe to be the next coach \u2026 Do you think they destabilized the team and this season and what did that do to your relationship with Jim Harbaugh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to figure out who knows what he or she is doing and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d Kawakami said of his direct questioning.Kawakami doesn\u2019t take cheap shots. He wants to know the essence of the story. \u201cIf their decisions shape a team and lead to success or failure, then what drives them to think the way they think and act the way they act?,\u201d he asks himself.\u201cI think readers would like to know that. I know I always want to know that \u2014 whether I\u2019m writing a column or just watching a game on TV,\u201d he said.Killion admires Kawakami\u2019s ability to quickly recognize and understand where the friction is and its source. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019m a step or two behind,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019m not throwing people under the bus because it\u2019s fun,\u201d Kawakami said.He takes the time to understand his sources\u2019 motivations and listens to both sides. \u201cHe has strong opinions about things, but he doesn\u2019t hold on to them as a gospel,\u201d Ratto said. The people who have the most trouble with him are the ones who don\u2019t engage with him.Early on, when Joe Lacob bought the Golden State Warriors, Kawakami was one of his toughest critics. However, Kawakami always reached out to Lacob to give him a chance to express his point of view. \u201cThe first year I made some big mistakes. [In regards to local columnist] Tim Kawakami early on, and now I\u2019ve managed to get that all on the right side,\u201d Lacob said in a Sports Illustrated interview. They eventually gained an understanding that they\u2019re both on this up-and-down ride together. The mutual respect was clear when Kawakami introduced Lacob as his fifth podcast guest.\u201cIt\u2019s not a buddy-buddy relationship,\u201d Kawakami reassured. \u201cIt\u2019s understanding the relationship.\u201dMany accuse Kawakami\u2019s column as a ploy or a formula to evoke a response. Perhaps the most notable instance is when Raiders\u2019 executive, John Herrera, confronted Kawakami at a press conference in 2008. Herrera towered over the 5-foot-7 sports columnist. Kawakami calmly folded his arms behind his back and maintained a tall chest while Herrera screamed at him.\u201cGet your facts straight!\u201d Herrera yelled, pointing his finger in Kawakami\u2019s face. \u201cYou built a whole column on lies!\u201dThe room quickly became silent and five cameras focused on Herrera and Kawakami.Raiders head coach, Lane Kiffin, walked by smiling as the seething Herrera concluded the conference and continued pacing around Kawakami. A day later, Kiffin called Kawakami to apologize.\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d Kawakami said defending his beliefs. \u201cLook as stupid as them?\u201dHerrera was fired eight days later.Kawakami gets paid for his columns, but the blog has taken over his life.His colleagues admire his determination to reach across platforms to connect with his evolving readers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to push through those walls when editors are heading in a different direction,\u201d San Jose Mercury News sports columnist Mark Purdy said. \u201cHe developed his own little kiosk of sports columns.\u201dTwitter allows Kawakami to reveal his free-flow thoughts that sometimes is the genesis for his columns. He wants to join the conversation. \u201cI love that I\u2019m old media,\u201d he said. \u201cI can play that game.\u201d His Twitter feed consists of back-and-forth wars with fans. \u201cNow with social media, they can shout at me,\u201d Kawakami said. He can instantly recognize if his content is engaging.No matter what media outlet he uses, Kawakami will continue to write with conviction and be a voice that people need to read to understand the larger picture. \u201cHe pisses people off,\u201d Killion said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a truth teller.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "San Jose Mercury News sports columnist Tim Kawakami is not afraid to write what he thinks.
