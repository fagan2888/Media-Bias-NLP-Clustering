The increase in employment by small businesses as well as the overall improvement in employment is cause for optimism as the country moves into the new year.\n\nThe data in the report is based on numbers from Intuit Online Payroll and QuickBooks Online Payroll that were gathered between Nov. 24 and Dec. 23.\n\nWhile the trend in small business employment has been rising, the number of new hires had remained flat through much of the second half of 2013. The recovery by small businesses from the lows of early 2010 has been slower than that of the overall economy, according to Susan Woodward, an economist who works with Intuit on analyzing the data.\n\nWoodward pointed out that overall employment had improved by 7% since February 2010, while small businesses had improved only 2.8% over that same time frame.\n\nThe gains in small business employment were spread across much of the country, with 38 states showing increases. The largest increase came in Washington, while Oregon, Florida and Minnesota also showed strong gains.\n\nThe largest decline was in Michigan. Other states showing declines in small business employment were Connecticut, Idaho, New Jersey, Ohio and Wisconsin. Both Massachusetts and Hawaii remained unchanged.\n\nEven as things improve, some are warning that small businesses need to keep track of legislative changes that could affect the bottom line. Paychex, which provides payroll services, recently identified a number of areas that small business owners need to monitor.\n\nThose include the American Affordable Healthcare law, the expansion of the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, immigration reform and potential changes in IRS rules.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Small businesses added 20,000 jobs in December, continuing a trend that started two years ago of more small business employers bringing in workers.", "og": {"site_name": "Business Administration Information", "description": "Small businesses added 20,000 jobs in December, continuing a trend that started two years ago of more small business employers bringing in workers.", "title": "Employment Continues to Rise at American Small Businesses - Business Administration Information", "url": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/news/employment-continues-to-rise-at-american-small-businesses", "image": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bigstock-Jobs-increasing-sketch-42350671-300x292.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1478982362392941}, "msvalidate.01": "E97402E8C75E1396BEAE2A02AE1A06E8", "google-site-verification": "-7d0XhlweD9ac6X0iGygOuxos-tqbyEAEVk9SXNyc-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "business, economy, employment, job market"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f6d\"", "article_summary": "The total number of jobs added at small businesses since March 2010 stands at more than 555,000, according to numbers from the Intuit Small Business Employment and Revenue indexes.\nThe increase in employment by small businesses as well as the overall improvement in employment is cause for optimism as the country moves into the new year.\nThe gains in small business employment were spread across much of the country, with 38 states showing increases.\nEven as things improve, some are warning that small businesses need to keep track of legislative changes that could affect the bottom line.\nOther states showing declines in small business employment were Connecticut, Idaho, New Jersey, Ohio and Wisconsin."}
