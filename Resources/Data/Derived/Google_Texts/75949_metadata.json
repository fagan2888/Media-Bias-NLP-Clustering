The hospital implemented the layoffs and cuts to address a $3 million budget shortfall. \"This is largely as a result of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, which really got into full swing in 2014,\" Laura Gingras, vice president of philanthropy and community relations for MCH, told The Keene Sentinel. \"So, we saw a similar gap last year, and even one the year before too.\"\n\n2. While six people were laid off, some vacant positions also will not be filled and some employees' hours have been cut, Ms. Gingras said, according to the report. She told the publication the number of work hours cut represent the equivalent of 15 full-time jobs.\n\n3.
