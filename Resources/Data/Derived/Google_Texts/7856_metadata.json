Terry Branstad (R) as a way to contain Medicaid\u2019s $4.2 billion cost and \u201cimprove patient outcomes\u201d for the 560,000 Iowans served by the program.\n\nRunaway Costs\n\nJohn Hendrickson, president of the Public Interest Institute, says Branstad\u2019s managed-care plan will save taxpayers money.\n\n\u201cSenate and House Democrats tend to believe and argue that the governor\u2019s plan will reduce the quality of care and create gaps in coverage,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cI believe that if the plan is prevented, it will result in the costs of Medicaid increasing in Iowa.\u201d\n\nWith or without Branstad\u2019s managed-care plan, Iowa\u2019s Medicaid costs are out of control, Hendrickson says.\n\nToo Big to Fail\n\nNicholas Horton, a senior research fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability, says at this point the only solution to the cost problems posed by Iowa\u2019s expanded Medicaid program is too roll it back. The program was expanded under provisions contained within the Affordable Care Act in 2014.\n\nAs of November 2015, more than 600,000 Iowans were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\n\u201cNo tweaks or minor changes to the program can solve these fundamental problems,\u201d Horton said. \u201cIowa should start working to unwind its Medicaid expansion now and make the truly needy their top priority.\u201d\n\nHorton says Iowa officials grossly underestimated the number of people who would sign up for Medicaid, a problem Arkansas shares, as he and coauthor Jonathan Ingram noted in Arkansas\u2019 Failed Medicaid Experiment: Not a Model for Nebraska, a study published in January by the Platte Institute for Economic Research.\n\n\u201cIowa\u2019s expansion has enrolled more able-bodied adults than the state said it would ever possibly enroll\u2014over 120,000 adults,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThese enrollment and cost overruns are putting truly needy Iowans at risk, thousands of whom are sitting on Medicaid waiting lists right now, waiting for care.\u201d\n\nMichael McGrady (mmcgrady@uccs.edu) writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "On February 11, the Democrat-controlled Iowa Senate approved Senate File 2125, which would terminate the state\u2019s contracts with private insurance companies managing health care plans for Iowans on Medicaid, by a vote of 29\u201319.\nRunaway CostsJohn Hendrickson, president of the Public Interest Institute, says Branstad\u2019s managed-care plan will save taxpayers money.\n\u201cI believe that if the plan is prevented, it will result in the costs of Medicaid increasing in Iowa.\u201dWith or without Branstad\u2019s managed-care plan, Iowa\u2019s Medicaid costs are out of control, Hendrickson says.\nAs of November 2015, more than 600,000 Iowans were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nAccording to a report by the Des Moines Register, the Republican-controlled Iowa House is unlikely to repeal the existing managed-care model, touted by Gov."}
