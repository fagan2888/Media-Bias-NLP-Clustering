So why do we keep doing them?\n\nThe state of The State of the Union response is horrible.\n\nOn life support, actually. Just as landing the cover of Sports Illustrated tends to be a curse for promising young athletes, the honor of delivering a SOTU response seems to be some sort of jinx. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s awkward \u201cKenneth the Page\u201d act in 2009 didn\u2019t do him any favors, and possibly derailed a 2012 presidential bid. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s otherwise fine 2013 speech was marred by his awkward reach for water (he would spend the next year or so embroiled in a damaging internecine fight over immigration reform).\n\nThe best response in recent memory probably came from then-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell... who was recently sentenced to prison (the curse will get you one way or another!) I thought last year\u2019s response by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers was quite strong, but in hindsight, it is essentially forgotten. (I\u2019m picking on Republicans here, since they\u2019ve delivered the last six responses; but this is a bipartisan phenomenon. Then-Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius delivered the 2008 Democratic response. She then went on to preside over the Obamacare rollout debacle.)\n\nTo be fair, much of the problem is structural. There is an inherent and insurmountable disadvantage for any member of the opposition party who is unfortunate enough to be tapped to deliver the official response. The president has the trappings of power. He is positioned from on high, and is frequently interrupted by applause.\n\nConversely, the response is usually delivered by a much less-seasoned politician in a much less grand milieu. This is typically a person sitting in a dark room by themselves looking into a camera. It\u2019s almost destined to look shoddy in comparison to the spectacle of the State of the Union.\n\nMaking matters worse, in recent years we have witnessed the proliferation of multiple \u201cresponses\u201d (remember the time Michele Bachmann delivered hers while appearing to look into the wrong camera?). If the goal is for the party out of power to have an opportunity to deliver an official response, then having multiple responses only muddies the message even more. (It also magnifies the opportunity for gaffes. Just last night, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s response was botched when someone uploaded a video of his \u201cflubbed\u201d response, and it was noted that only the Spanish version of the response mentioned immigration reform.)\n\nIronically, the proliferation of responses reinforces the point about this being an antiquated practice. Back in the old days, before social media, it probably made sense for networks to provide some equal time to respond to the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nBut that was when we had three networks and they controlled the means of production and dissemination. Today, anyone can (and will) record and upload their thoughts. The notion that the party out of power might obtain a modicum of parity and have a chance for an \u201cofficial\u201d response is already out the window, meaning this is a pointless process with more potential downside than upside.\n\nWhich brings us to last night\u2019s response, delivered by Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, \u201ca mother, a soldier, and a newly elected senator from the great state of Iowa\u201d famously known for castrating hogs. It\u2019s fair to say she didn\u2019t hit many high notes. The speech read well enough, and included populist heart-string tugs such as informing us that when she grew up, she had \u201conly one good pair of shoes. So on rainy school days, my mom would slip plastic bread bags over them to keep them dry.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of message that could resonate with a lot of Americans, but her delivery was too stilted. State of the Union responses \u201care always a challenge,\u201d tweeted ex-Romney adviser Avik Roy, \u201cbut Joni Ernst sounds like she\u2019s reading a speech instead of *delivering* a speech.\u201d There were also jokes about her hair and shoes. In the end, though, she basically succeeded by virtue of not committing any embarrassing gaffes. \u201cJoni Ernst survived. That is all she had to do. The #SOTU response is a death sentence,\u201d noted MSNBC co-host Abby Huntsman.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mattklewis"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201501211453, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "As Joni Ernst showed us last night, the official opposition party response to the State of the Union is almost always a train wreck.
