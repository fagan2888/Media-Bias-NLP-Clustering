Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who weeks of polls show with a substantial, double-digit lead over the former Secretary of State.\n\nRelated: Sanders Closes the Gap on Clinton \u2013 and Cleans Up Against the GOP\n\nIf Clinton loses to Sanders by only single digits because of the extra boost, her campaign can spin it as her beating expectations in an attempt to give her once inevitable bid new momentum heading into the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 20.\n\nA bigger shake-up could occur on the Republican side. While billionaire Donald Trump holds a commanding lead over Sens. Marco Rubio (FL) and Ted Cruz (TX) \u2013 both of whom are jockeying for second place \u2013 three GOP governors are locked in a no-holds-barred cage match for a top place finish to keep their struggling campaigns afloat.\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush need a strong showing n Tuesday night to punch their ticket out of the Granite State. Independents voters could give any of them the percentage point or two that makes all the difference, something the contenders are very much aware of.\n\nRelated: Why Carson Might Poison the Well for Cruz with Evangelicals\n\n\"I ought to be running in a Democrat primary, I got more Democrats for me -- you have any Republican friends?\" Kasich joked on Saturday during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, according to CBS.\n\nBut there is one saving grace to the first in the nation\u2019s primary: voting is straightforward. Unlike the complex caucuses, the primary is run by the state, not the two major parties themselves. That means more changes for the Democratic side, where the totals came back in terms of delegates, not votes, won.\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s system should prevent the kind of fallout that\u2019s occurred since Iowa, with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson accusing Cruz of spreading rumors that he dropped out to the race to try to tilt the results, and Sanders questioning the returns that had him losing to Clinton by a fraction of a percentage point.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Much like the evangelicals and liberals that took part in last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, there is a bloc of voters poised to play an influential role in the looming New Hampshire primary: independents.", "title": "Here\u2019s the One Group of Voters that Could Decide the New Hampshire Primary", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/Here-s-One-Group-Voters-Could-Decide-New-Hampshire-Primary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02072016_New_Hampshire_Campaign_Posters.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/Here-s-One-Group-Voters-Could-Decide-New-Hampshire-Primary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02072016_New_Hampshire_Campaign_Posters.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Much like the evangelicals and liberals that took part in last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, there is a bloc of voters poised to play an influential role in the looming New Hampshire primary: independents.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Independents voters could give any of them the percentage point or two that makes all the difference, something the contenders are very much aware of.\nMuch like the evangelicals and liberals that took part in last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, there is a bloc of voters poised to play an influential role in the Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary: independents.\nUnlike the complex caucuses, the primary is run by the state, not the two major parties themselves.\nUnlike the Hawkeye State, where registered Iowans had to stick to their party\u2019s voting process, independent, or \u201cundeclared,\u201d voters in the Granite State can cast their ballots in either primary.\nBut there is one saving grace to the first in the nation\u2019s primary: voting is straightforward."}
