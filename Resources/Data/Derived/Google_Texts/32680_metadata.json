A healthy adult should be consuming around 50g of sugar per day (and if you want to be really healthy you should be down around 25g).\n\nThe chart below shows how bad this is: The average American consumes about as much sugar as the average Indian, Chinese, Russian, Turk, and Brazilian combined. In a day.\n\nThe U.S. is not alone in exceeding WHO\u2019S recommendation: individuals in 31 other countries tracked by Euromonitor purchase 50g or more of sugars a day from packaged food and soft drinks in 2014. Eighteen purchase more than 75g, 50% more than the recommended amount.\n\nBut they all pale in comparison to the U.S. And here\u2019s the chart showing where it\u2019s all coming from \u2014 mostly soft drinks (which includes juice).\n\nAgain, on an average day, an American can expect to consume all of this!\n\nSo far, only Mars (the corporation not the planet) has issued any kind of response to the WHO report, pledging to make more products that are fewer than 200 calories. Nor is any relief coming from the Obama Administration, which just delayed by one year an Affordable Care Act requirement that chain restaurants must start posting calorie counts.\n\nIf there\u2019s any solace, it\u2019s that growth in the ratio of overweight Americans appears to be plateauing.\n\nBut we\u2019ve still got a hefty problem on our hands.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Our favorite drug.", "title": "America Continued to Consume Sugar at Voracious Levels Last Year", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/167717/america-continued-to-consume-sugar-at-voracious-levels-last-year/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2474643298_b48e54f9c8_b.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our favorite drug.", "title": "America continued to consume sugar at voracious levels last year", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/167717/america-continued-to-consume-sugar-at-voracious-levels-last-year/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2474643298_b48e54f9c8_b.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rob.wile.5"}, "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Our favorite drug."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbe3\"", "article_summary": "In a new blog post, EuroMonitor analyst Lauren Bandy shows that America is still consuming way, way too much sugar.\nAgain, on an average day, an American can expect to consume all of this!\n\u201cIn the US\u2026 the average consumer purchases 126g of sugars from packaged food and soft drinks a day, with 50g coming from soft drinks alone,\u201d Bandy writes.\nBut they all pale in comparison to the U.S. And here\u2019s the chart showing where it\u2019s all coming from \u2014 mostly soft drinks (which includes juice).\nA healthy adult should be consuming around 50g of sugar per day (and if you want to be really healthy you should be down around 25g)."}
