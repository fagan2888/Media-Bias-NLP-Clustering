A 3-year-old girl who lost her heartbeat for nearly 12 minutes after drowning in a pool has made an astonishing recovery with no ill effects.

Alise Nipper, from Missouri, had been playing by the pool one day in late July, when her mother, Jamie, saw lightning and got all the other kids out of the pool. When she couldn’t find Alise among them, she searched the pool and found her underneath a raft. Jamie pulled Alise out of the pool, but her body was blue and lifeless. Jamie had asked Alise to wear a life vest, but Alise had apparently taken it off.

Jamie and another party guest performed CPR until paramedics arrived, and they finally heard a heartbeat on the way to the hospital.

Without oxygen getting to her brain for that amount of time, doctors feared that Alise may have suffered long-term brain damage. “For her brain to come through this and be as functional as possible is astounding,” Dr. Jeremy Garrett said to KVFS. She stayed in an intensive care unit and was fully conscious within a week. Two weeks after the incident, Alise returned home after achieving a full recovery.

"I'm thankful every night," said Alise’s father, Chris Nipper. "I'm extremely grateful we have more of a chance to have her on earth with us."

Earlier this year, another Missouri child survived a lengthy amount of time underwater with no apparent injuries. Fourteen-year-old John Smith sank to the bottom of a frozen lake and was deprived of oxygen for nearly 15 minutes but was rescued and made a full recovery.
