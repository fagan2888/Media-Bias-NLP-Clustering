Humana sells plans in 15 states.\n\nSEE ALSO: 1 state could be abandoning Obamacare after Election Day\n\nThe company said on Wednesday that first-quarter earnings fell 46 percent due to higher costs in individual plans, including Obamacare, and its direct-to-customer Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc said last month it was losing money and would largely exit the 34 states where it sells plans.

Because the market is smaller than foreseen, there is not a big enough pool of healthy users to cover the costs, they say.\n\nHumana said it is in the process of finalizing the sort of insurance plans it will offer in the business next year, but is considering a number of changes, including exiting certain states or products. It also said it may raise premium prices.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obamacare moves to cover more criminals\n\nHumana said there is higher use of medical services and prescriptions among 2015 members who renewed 2016 plans versus those who canceled them. New members in Obamacare plans sold outside the exchanges also had higher use than those who renewed, Humana said.\n\nIn late 2015 the company set aside $176 million in reserves to cover losses on the individual business. This quarter, it earned money on the operation but increased reserves by that amount to cover additional anticipated losses, it said.\n\nHumana said it had 875,700 individual members as of March 31, a decline of 150,000 from a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell to $234 million, or $1.56 per share, in the first quarter, from $430 million, or $2.82 per share, a year earlier. It earned $1.86 per share on an adjusted basis and revenue was $13.80 billion versus $13.83 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected profit of $1.81 per share on revenue of $13.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nShares fell 0.5 percent to $176.01.
