Five percent of homes sold in the third quarter were flipped \u2014 sold within a year of purchase in an arms\u2019 length transaction.\n\n\u201cAfter curtailing flipping activity last year due to slowing home price appreciation and shrinking inventory of flip-worthy homes, real estate investors have started to jump back on the flipping bandwagon in 2015,\u201d Daren Blomquist, RealtyTrac vice president said in a statement.\n\nHere\u2019s Why Home Prices Are Climbing So Quickly\n\nThe profit margins are huge but the housing crisis reminded us just how risky the business of flipping homes can be. That\u2019s why many of today\u2019s home flippers are professional investors rather than part-time speculators trying to get in while the market is hot.\n\nOne factor helping investors is an influx of buyers using FHA loans, many of whom are first-time home buyers looking for starter homes. Even so there are fewer foreclosed homes available for flippers to buy and inventory remains tight, so it\u2019s getting harder to find properties priced lower enough to guarantee a decent margin.\n\nThe median existing-home price in September was $221,900, a 6.1 percent increase over September 2014, according to the National Association of Realtors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the housing market stabilizes and home prices continue to rise, home flippers are m", "title": "House Flippers Are Back \u2013 Here\u2019s How Much They\u2019re Making", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/House-Flippers-Are-Back-Here-s-How-Much-They-re-Making", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042011_housing_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/House-Flippers-Are-Back-Here-s-How-Much-They-re-Making", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042011_housing_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the housing market stabilizes and home prices continue to rise, home flippers are m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "As the housing market stabilizes and home prices continue to rise, home flippers are making steady profits buying, fixing and selling properties.\nFive percent of homes sold in the third quarter were flipped \u2014 sold within a year of purchase in an arms\u2019 length transaction.\nHere\u2019s Why Home Prices Are Climbing So QuicklyThe profit margins are huge but the housing crisis reminded us just how risky the business of flipping homes can be.\nThat\u2019s why many of today\u2019s home flippers are professional investors rather than part-time speculators trying to get in while the market is hot.\nThe median existing-home price in September was $221,900, a 6.1 percent increase over September 2014, according to the National Association of Realtors."}
