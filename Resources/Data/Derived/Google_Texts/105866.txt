The role of the federal government, Obamacare and market alternatives were discussed. In addition, Petersen detailed what he would do about the broken VA health system, how he would change , eliminate or otherwise the following federal health agencies–CDC, NIH and FDA, the drug abuse situation and how he differs on health policy from Gov Gary Johnson.
