The Affordable Care Act was designed to address this inequality by improving access to quality healthcare to all populations.\n\nIn this study, Jemal and colleagues calculated age-standardized colorectal cancer death rates for three educational categories, by race/ethnicity, and by state among individuals aged 25 to 64 years from 2008 to 2010. In addition, they calculated the proportion of premature death due to colorectal cancer that could be avoided.\n\nResults of the study showed that in almost every state, individuals with the least education had significantly higher colorectal cancer death rates for each racial/ethnic group compared with those individuals with the most education.\n\n\u201cCompared to persons with 16 years of education or more, persons with 12 years of education or less had a disproportionately higher burden of colorectal cancer mortality regardless of their race and residence,\u201d Jemal said.\n\nOne example given by the researchers was that rate ratios ranged from 1.15 in Delaware to 3.18 in New Mexico among white individuals and from 0.84 in Mississippi to 2.41 in Virginia among blacks.\n\nThe researchers calculated that if the lowest death rates of the most educated whites were applied nationwide, more than half of premature deaths from colorectal cancer\u20147,690 deaths\u2014could have been avoided.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we found large state variations in colorectal cancer mortality rates, with rates significantly higher in the southern states than in the northeastern states,\u201d Jemal said.\n\nIn these southern states, as much as 60% to 70% of premature deaths could potentially be avoided.", "article_metadata": {"dc.date": "2014-11-24", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=660483448", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A significant proportion of deaths due to colorectal cancer in southern states, and half of deaths due to colorectal cancer nationwide are a result of racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7d1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn addition, we found large state variations in colorectal cancer mortality rates, with rates significantly higher in the southern states than in the northeastern states,\u201d Jemal said.\nIn addition, they calculated the proportion of premature death due to colorectal cancer that could be avoided.\n\u201cCompared to persons with 16 years of education or more, persons with 12 years of education or less had a disproportionately higher burden of colorectal cancer mortality regardless of their race and residence,\u201d Jemal said.\nA significant proportion of deaths due to colorectal cancer in southern states, and half of deaths due to colorectal cancer nationwide are a result of racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities, according to the results of a study published recently in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\nIn this study, Jemal and colleagues calculated age-standardized colorectal cancer death rates for three educational categories, by race/ethnicity, and by state among individuals aged 25 to 64 years from 2008 to 2010."}
