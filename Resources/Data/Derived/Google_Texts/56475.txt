Maxine Waters (D-CA) just got called out. Big time. The pejorative “Poverty Pimp” is used to identify those that personally benefit from acting as an advocate for the poor, downtrodden, or otherwise disadvantaged. California’s 43rd District, located in South Central Los Angeles, is certainly one where many live who fit those descriptions.

Maxine Waters, who is neither poor, downtrodden, or disadvantaged in any way, lives in Hancock Park, which is also most definitely not anything at all like South Central.

Note the dollar signs in her eyes and the “Nig*as Better have my money,” a line from a slew of underground and gangster rap songs.

The iconic Randy’s Donuts is in Inglewood – which is part of her district. The “T.O.S.” on her lapel makes reference to the time she called herself “this old socialist.”

The Forum, the former home of the L.A. Lakers and Kings, is also in the 43rd District.

South Central is one of the most depressed and violent areas in all of California, let alone Los Angeles. Waters has represented the area for 23 years.

This is in front of Waters’ home in Hancock Park, about 12 actual miles, but an almost infinite symbolic miles from her office in South Central.

This is a street view of the home, which Zillow values at just over $4.3 million. Median price in this area is just under $1 million. For contrast, in Waters’ district the median price is just over $350,000, one of the lowest in all of Los Angeles County; there isn’t a single home for sale there above $775,000.

Waters has been a very controversial representative, due in no small part for sometimes saying things that are utterly ridiculous, receiving a “most corrupt” rating from a non-partisan Congressional watchdog group, and being the subject of a very high profile ethics case regarding banking and financial improprieties.

Waters won reelection in 2012 with 71% of the vote, a margin that will likely be repeated next week, as well. Aren’t her constituents lucky…
