Ayden fire officials say two children were taken to the hospital by EMS following a wreck on Highway 11 Saturday afternoon.

Barry Wood, assistant fire chief, says a white Toyota Camry heading north on Highway 11 veered sideways across the grass median. A gray Honda heading south hit the passenger side of the Camry.

A pregnant woman with two children was driving the Camry. Firemen had to cut her out of the vehicle. Wood says the woman was transported via EMS to Vidant Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries. Highway Patrol Trooper Swanson says the two kids were also transported but appeared to be uninjured.

The driver and passenger of the Honda were not injured.

Swanson says the driver of the Camry, Jamika Ward, is charged with exceeding safe speed and driving left of center.
