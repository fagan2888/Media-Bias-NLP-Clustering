So much so that on this week\u2019s episode of Saturday Night Live he prayed for God to \u201csend a flood to Washington and just drown everybody.\u201d\n\nAppearing on the set of \u201cWeekend Update\u201d in one of his infamous bow ties, Black \u2014 played by Kenan Thompson \u2014 immediately launched into a prayer that Congress would \u201cstop being a bunch of blabbering knuckleheads that go on to the television and spout all kinds of nonsense until you want to slap them across the face with a bag full of quarters.\u201d\n\nSince the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, the real Senate chaplain Black has received news coverage for his scathing prayers critiquing Congress.\n\nAnd his frustration over the lack of a compromise in Washington boiled over in increasingly aggressive prayers on SNL.\n\nHost Seth Meyers asked Black whether he thought his daily prayers have helped improve the static situation within government. Black said he was optimistic about it since Republicans in Congress have been meeting with White House officials. Meyers reminded him that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) promised on Saturday that he would fight even harder to keep the government shutdown until the proper resolution was determined.\n\nThe chaplain immediately began to pray.\n\n\u201cBless and forgive these braying jack***es\u2026,\u201d he prayed. \u201cMay they find themselves in a restroom stall devoid of toilet paper, with nothing to use but a receipt from CVS in their wallet \u2014 a receipt for a small purchase that they must then tear into small pieces.\u201d\n\nAnd after learning that a piece of legislation deemed a compromise has very little support, Black resorted to praying for a flood to get rid of everyone in Washington.\n\nWatch the segment below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Senate chaplain Barry Black is sick of the partisan bickering that has produced a stalemate in Washington, D.C.
