Yes, the Republicans are stubborn. But stubbornness takes two. And which side is asking to negotiate? The Republicans. Who is refusing to give a centimeter? Obama and the Senate Democrats. And the voices in the press (around here, anyway) are saying, \u201coh, you pig-headed Republicans.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be fair here. What has happened? The Democrats in the Senate have passed a continuing resolution that funds everything in the government. The Republicans in the House have passed one that funds everything in the government except Obamacare.\n\nImagine two families were going to have a barbecue and the plan made months before was to have beef, pork, chicken and fish. Imagine one family changed its mind about the fish: They hated the whole idea of fish, but they were OK with the beef, pork and chicken. And if the first family insisted on the original plan and the second family insisted on no fish, and they were at loggerheads and guests were starting to go hungry, what would be the reasonable course of action?\n\nHave the beef, pork and chicken, and save the fish until later. And if they couldn\u2019t agree and the result was no food at all, would it be reasonable to put the entire blame on the family who didn\u2019t want the fish?\n\nIt\u2019s true that Obamacare is the law. But so was paid family leave, and the Legislature in Olympia refused to fund it, and it wasn\u2019t funded. Legislatures can do that. They make the law. And Obamacare was a partisan law, passed entirely by Democrats, including members of the House of Representatives who are no longer in office. It squeaked through the U.S. Supreme Court by one vote. It is the law, yes, but this fight means it is still in play.\n\nBasically, the people making ugly faces at Republicans are supporters of Obamacare. They are saying, \u201cWe won! Fight\u2019s over.\u201d And it\u2019s not over. It angers them that it isn\u2019t over, and they are having a tantrum about it.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|editorialsopinion|opinionnorthwest|front|article", "description": "Civil Disagreement is an occasional feature of the Seattle Times editorial board.
