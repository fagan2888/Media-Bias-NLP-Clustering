Shortly after the Broncos’ practice Saturday, Peyton Manning hopped on a flight to Canton, Ohio, to see the man who drafted him with the No. 1 pick in 1998 take his place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Bill Polian, the former president of the Indianapolis Colts, thanked his former players and colleagues, from Kansas City to Buffalo to Carolina to Indianapolis. But with Manning watching from the crowd, Polian had a personal message for “No. 18.”

“If you keep playing,” Polian said, “I may not be around for your introduction. But wherever I am, I’ll be thrilled and proud.

“There is a mural atop the entrance to Lucas Oil Stadium depicting scenes from our Super Bowl season. It says simply, ‘Lucas Oil Stadium: Built by champions.’ Yes, you are.”
