(AP) \u2014 The Montreal Forum was the Canadiens\u2019 home for one of the most successful dynasties in professional sports. The Bruins and Celtics filled the Boston Garden rafters with championship banners.\n\nFor the NHL Winter Classic, the Original Six foes found a worthy venue to extend their rivalry.\n\nWith the New England Patriots\u2019 logo and the image of their four Super Bowl trophies adorning his mask, Bostonian Mike Condon stopped 27 shots to lead Montreal to a 5-1 victory over the Bruins on Friday at the home of the reigning NFL champions.\n\nPaul Byron scored twice, and Brendan Gallagher returned from two broken fingers to score a goal and add an assist. David Desharnais and Max Pacioretty also scored for the Canadiens, who passed Florida and moved into first place in the Atlantic Division with 47 points.\n\nTuukka Rask stopped 25 shots for the Bruins, and Matt Beleskey scored in the third period to avert the first shutout in Winter Classic history. The four-goal win was the largest for the event since it began in 2008.\n\nBoth goalies paid tribute to the Patriots and quarterback Tom Brady on their masks, and coach Claude Julien worked the Bruins bench in a hoodie straight from the wardrobe of his NFL counterpart, Bill Belichick.\n\nBut the Bruins fell to 0-1 in a building where the Patriots have lost only one meaningful game in three years.\n\nBefore a crowd of 67,246, and under cloudy skies with temperatures for the opening faceoff of 40 degrees, the teams dodged the slushy ice that has greeted other Winter Classic events, including the old-timers and women\u2019s exhibitions on Thursday. Organizers compensated for the lack of snow in the Boston area so far this winter by spreading white, puffy fabric over the football field.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Winter Classic: Canadiens top Bruins 5-1 at home of Patriots", "author": "Jimmy Golen", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Winter Classic: Canadiens top Bruins 5-1 at home of Patriots", "title": "Winter Classic: Canadiens top Bruins 5-1 at home of Patriots", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/01/winter_classic_canadiens_top_bruins_5_1_at_home_of_patriots/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/winter-classic-hockey.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Winter Classic: Canadiens top Bruins 5-1 at home of Patriots", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/winter-classic-hockey.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Winter Classic: Canadiens top Bruins 5-1 at home of Patriots", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Winter Classic: Canadiens top Bruins 5-1 at home of Patriots", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For the NHL Winter Classic, the Original Six foes found a worthy venue to extend their rivalry.\nTuukka Rask stopped 25 shots for the Bruins, and Matt Beleskey scored in the third period to avert the first shutout in Winter Classic history.\nBefore a crowd of 67,246, and under cloudy skies with temperatures for the opening faceoff of 40 degrees, the teams dodged the slushy ice that has greeted other Winter Classic events, including the old-timers and women\u2019s exhibitions on Thursday.\nBut the Bruins fell to 0-1 in a building where the Patriots have lost only one meaningful game in three years.\n(AP) \u2014 The Montreal Forum was the Canadiens\u2019 home for one of the most successful dynasties in professional sports."}
