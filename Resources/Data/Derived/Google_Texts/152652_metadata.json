Obviously these two dudes are the next GOP ticket. MITTMENTUM:\n\nSeventeen percent pick Romney, who says he isn\u2019t running, as their first choice for president; Carson, a conservative author best known for separating conjoined twins, is next at 11 percent. Rand Paul is just behind, with 10 percent\u2026 The poll suggests a tough road in Iowa for other GOP names testing the waters nationally \u2014 with 7 percent favoring Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Rick Perry, 6 percent New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and just 2 percent Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker each drew 4 percent. Ohio Governor John Kasich and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal were the top choice for 1 percent, while Ohio Senator Rob Portman and Indiana Governor Mike Pence drew less than 1 percent each.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that Carson would perform that well given how little known he is to voters compared to the rest of the field, but there\u2019s a sound explanation for it. The \u201cDraft Ben Carson for President Committee\u201d has raised boatloads of money for him this year, outstripping even the \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d crew. They\u2019ve already appointed co-chairs for their operation in Iowa. Word is getting out about Carson among social conservatives and righties whose disgust with Washington has reached the point where they\u2019re willing to look outside the political class for new leadership. Whether Carson can build on that enthusiastic 11 percent once Cruz, Huckabee, and Santorum are in the race is a separate question.\n\nHere are the favorables for the field. Quick, whose numbers jump out?\n\nThat 39/45 split for Chris Christie is gruesome, far worse than anyone else\u2019s. Iowans interviewed by Bloomberg for the poll were unsparing:\n\nInterviews with poll respondents show what\u2019s hurting Christie, at least to a degree, is his brusque personality. His frequent tongue lashings, such as referring to political opponents as \u201cnumbnuts,\u201d may play well in New Jersey, but it\u2019s repelling some of the more polite Midwestern voters. \u201cHe\u2019s a very pompous individual when it comes to getting in front of the cameras,\u201d said Steven Starnes of Ringsted, Iowa, of Christie. \u201cHe\u2019s a show-off, and that\u2019s an automatic turn off for me.\u201d\u2026 \u201cIt may or may not be his fault, but that bridge thing doesn\u2019t sit very well with me,\u201d said Phil Metcalf, a retired pharmacist in Decatur County. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything that Christie\u2019s done that has looked that great to me.\u201d\n\nLooking at that makes me wonder if Christie might skip Iowa\u2019s socially conservative electorate altogether and proceed directly to New Hampshire. A Twitter pal argues that that\u2019s stupid: With so many right-wing candidates, including a possibly formidable Ben Carson, running and splitting the conservative vote, a centrist with 25 percent could win. That would make sense if Christie is the only centrist in the field and can consolidate the RINO vote behind him \u2014 but he won\u2019t be. That was my point in this post earlier today. He\u2019s so vulnerable that there\u2019s simply no way the establishment will allow him to be their champion in Iowa. Either Jeb Bush will run or Marco Rubio or Scott Walker will be elevated to centrist hero; Christie will need to compete with them for votes, which risks a split in the center as well \u2014 meaning, in theory, that some conservative with 20 percent of the vote could slip through to victory. Maybe Christie, knowing that, will skip the caucuses altogether. Although, of course, that\u2019s risky too: If Rubio or Walker wins in Iowa with 25 percent thanks to Christie having vacated the field, suddenly they\u2019ll be the centrist favorite headed into New Hampshire. How does Christie win there while having to fend off conservatives on his right and the Iowa winner on his left?\n\nOne other jazzy number from those favorables above: At 75/14, Iowans love, love, love Paul Ryan. If centrists drafted him as their Jeb Bush fallback option, he could plausibly win both Iowa and New Hampshire and lock things up early, something no one else in the field (except, interestingly, Rand Paul) seems capable of right now. But I don\u2019t know if Ryan would want to run knowing that he\u2019d have to compete not just against tea partiers but against people like Rubio and Walker who are aiming to fill the same niche Ryan would fill, namely, the young, pleasant go-getter who\u2019s more or less acceptable to both wings of the party. And maybe we\u2019re overestimating Ryan\u2019s chances, notwithstanding his rosy favorable rating. A lot of people might like him, but how many like him more than every other candidate in the field? He\u2019d get a lot of Romney voters, but not all. Would that be enough this time?\n\nHere\u2019s Ben Carson telling Hannity last night that the odds are now at least 50/50 that he runs. In lieu of an exit question, I\u2019ll leave you with this factoid from the Bloomberg crosstabs: When asked whether they think it would help or hurt their party to place a greater emphasis on Christian beliefs, Republicans split 50/40. Democrats split 30/57. Seven years ago they split 30/37.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s wide open.\u201d", "title": "Top two in new 2016 poll of Iowa Republicans: Mitt Romney and Ben Carson, of course", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/10/14/top-two-in-new-2016-poll-of-iowa-republicans-mitt-romney-and-ben-carson-of-course/", "image": {"width": 375, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rep.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-15T00:41:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-15T11:44:04+00:00"}, "keywords": "Ben Carson, bloomberg, caucus, Chris Christie, GOP, huckabee, Iowa, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, republican,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "The \u201cDraft Ben Carson for President Committee\u201d has raised boatloads of money for him this year, outstripping even the \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d crew.\nHere\u2019s Ben Carson telling Hannity last night that the odds are now at least 50/50 that he runs.\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker each drew 4 percent.\nMITTMENTUM:Seventeen percent pick Romney, who says he isn\u2019t running, as their first choice for president; Carson, a conservative author best known for separating conjoined twins, is next at 11 percent.\nWhether Carson can build on that enthusiastic 11 percent once Cruz, Huckabee, and Santorum are in the race is a separate question."}
