For unknown reasons, a small bite on my finger ballooned and left me with a buoyant ham where my left hand used to be. Despite having been told by a dead-eyed pharmacist, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Take Benadryl\u201d, there was no way (as a formidable hypochondriac) I wasn\u2019t going to get it checked out.\n\nMy sister lives in New York, so I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the States, visiting her. But this is my first time navigating my way through the USA\u2019s Kafkaesque healthcare system. First comes the paperwork, a War And Peace-thick pile of it, on which I write my name so many times that the words \u201cEleanor\u201d and \u201cMargolis\u201d become hilariously absurd. Good thing I\u2019m right-handed. I\u2019ve been an American patient for fifteen minutes and I\u2019m already starting to sweat. I bought health insurance at home, but I\u2019m convinced that the company will play dirty; trying every trick in their sputum-dripping book not to cover me. While my hand is getting bigger and redder right before my eyes, I envisage a bill for a mighty stack of dollars. This is met with a peel of laughter by my insurance company, because I forgot to specify on their forms that I have one tit bigger than the other. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d they\u2019ll say, \u201cWe only cover the evenly-breasted. Enjoy prison.\u201d\n\nAs the US government shutdown draws to some kind of close, maybe, I find myself lost within the system that started the whole thing.\n\nI\u2019m in a hospital bed, on an antibiotic drip. Some kick-ass painkillers have started to take effect, and I feel like human cheese on toast. I\u2019m sharing my room with an elderly Hispanic lady called Carmen. Carmen is motherly and flatulent. Worried that I might catch a chill, she covers me in a blanket, then retreats behind her curtain and loudly farts.\n\nMy attempts to get to sleep are intermittently interrupted by the nearby calls of a nurse with a thick Brooklyn accent.\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d she says, again and again. I hazard a guess at Mary being a difficult patient.\n\nDay two. I\u2019m woken by a man\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cMiss Margolis?\u201d\n\nMedicated and soporific, I murmur something.\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d I say, perhaps.\n\nThe owner of the voice draws back my curtain and, to my drowsy horror, I\u2019m met not by one person, but a crowd. I\u2019m sprawled out in a star shape and half my face is coated in dried-up saliva. The man (a doctor) has brought along an eager troupe of young med students, to ogle my freak hand. A few pretty blonde girls in white coats jot down notes as the doctor points to bits of me and says sciencey things. Blood rushes to my cheeks.\n\n\u201cI am not a monster!\u201d I want to say.\n\nThe doctor ushers the students away, and I go back to sleep. I\u2019m next woken by the Food Bringer.\n\n\u201cBreakfast,\u201d she says as she drops down a tray containing something that might be egg. I pick at whatever it is and endure a rush of overwhelming sadness. I can\u2019t clear my mind of the fact that I\u2019m in a place where a lot of people come to die. In another room, someone is hacking up a lung. Unable to concentrate on even the trashiest of American TV, I spend what seems like an hour poking holes in a polystyrene cup with a pencil.\n\n\u201cMary, don\u2019t touch that!\u201d\n\nMy brother-in-law arrives with coffee. Having just been doped up with more painkillers, I gaze blankly at the ceiling while he speaks gibberish over the phone to my insurance company. Kind and attentive as the hospital staff may be, it\u2019s hard to appreciate that you\u2019re recovering when you have that constant, underlying fear of a giant bill.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re in there, Mary!\u201d\n\nCarmen is arguing with a nurse in Spanish. I make out the words \u201cMedicare\u201d and \u201cMedicaid\u201d \u2013 America\u2019s vestiges of socialized healthcare. Poor Carmen. I hope she\u2019s covered.\n\nSomewhere nearby, I can hear a nurse talking about the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThey just have to have their Obamacare,\u201d she says, her words oozing contempt.\n\nI begin to wonder how the Republicans have managed to convince even those in the very midst of a system that punishes the poor, that the slightest implementation of state-funded healthcare is an evil, communist conspiracy.\n\nDay three. A good-natured Polish nurse has just hooked me up to a drip and given me an injection of blood-thinner in the stomach. Carmen is leaving.\n\n\u201cGet better, darling,\u201d she says, \u201cAnd remember \u2013 if you need anything \u2013 money talks.\u201d\n\nShe chuckles and exits my life. With her final words to me, Carmen may have been joking\u2013but she\u2019s neatly summed up the bare-faced callousness of the American healthcare system. This isn\u2019t a hospital; it\u2019s the Wild West. As a foreigner with travel insurance, I\u2019m lucky enough to observe American healthcare from a safe distance. But to someone fully enmeshed, like Carmen, Obamacare is a tiny drop in the murkiest of quagmires.\n\nThis piece first appeared on newstatesman.com.\n\nEleanor Margolis is a freelance journalist, whose column \"Lez Miserable\" appears weekly on the New Statesman website.
