They would not be subject to a mandatory, or even optional, on-ice session; if they wanted to skate, they could, but otherwise, they were asked to relax, regroup and refocus for Monday night.\n\nThe mental aspect of the game may be the most crucial for the Capitals, who prepare for a deciding Game 7 in their first-round playoff series against the New York Islanders with the specter of past failures leering over their shoulders. In recent years, the do-or-die scenario has been fatal, as the franchise has been defeated, occasionally in humiliating fashion, in four of the last five occasions it has hosted the deciding game.\n\nWipe away those memories, came the charge, and players maintained they have, casting aside notions that they have been haunted by their past inadequacies. They maintain this team is different \u2014 even though 13 of the 19 players who participated in their last Game 7 loss, a knockout by the New York Rangers in 2013, should suit up for the team again on Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get up for Game 7, you\u2019re not human or an athlete,\u201d said defenseman Mike Green, one of those players. \u201cNothing we do today on the ice \u2014 there\u2019s no Xs and Os we can go over. It just comes down to willpower.\u201d\n\nWhether the Capitals have that willpower couldn\u2019t be determined on Sunday morning, but coach Barry Trotz, who never oversaw a Game 7 during his recent 15-year tenure guiding the Nashville Predators, laid a foundation in a team meeting. Green called Trotz\u2019s speech a \u201cgood motivator,\u201d while the coach said he merely stated facts.\n\nBoth statements could be correct.\n\n\u201cI just want them to leave their best game out there,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cLeave your best game out there, and if it\u2019s good enough, you win, and if it\u2019s not, you can look back and say, \u2018Hey, I left it out there. I don\u2019t have an ounce of anything left to give.\u2019 If you do that, then the result, good or bad, you can keep your head up high.\u201d\n\nWashington, of course, doesn\u2019t want a bad result. Unable to eliminate the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum on Saturday, the Capitals fought all season for the opportunity to host a deciding first-round playoff game \u2014 which is what they will do. The two teams finished tied in the standings during the regular season, and Washington needed a second tiebreaker, the head-to-head matchup, to eke out that advantage.\n\nWhat Washington hopes is the same kind of atmosphere and approach that spurred the Islanders to a 3-1 victory on Saturday will lead to success. While the Capitals out-shot their opponent over the first period, New York again scored the first goal, then coasted on its desperation and aggression. The frustrations from a physical afternoon boiled over after the final horn sounded, when play degenerated into a dust-up between the players on the ice.\n\nThe summary after the game was that it was part of hockey \u2014 \u201cjust a little nastiness that goes on,\u201d as Islanders coach Jack Capuano said afterward \u2014 yet the lesson, for the Capitals, was clear. Engaging in that behavior in Game 7, they know, could be a costly mistake.\n\n\u201c[We know] what\u2019s at stake and what\u2019s important,\u201d defenseman Karl Alzner said. \u201cHitting a guy after the whistle or saying something is not important. I think our heads are going to be in the right spot. We know they feed off that, and that some of their players play better when that\u2019s the style of game. We know we can\u2019t feed into that. We\u2019re a good team when we just play.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why on Monday, Trotz decided rest, and not work, would be the best approach for his players. Not since 1996 \u2014 \u201cwhen I had long hair and a mullet,\u201d Trotz joked \u2014 has he experienced the pressure of a deciding Game 7. That year, he navigated the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League to the Calder Cup Finals, where they lost to the Rochester Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s also why players have continued to focus on their recent accomplishments and downplay their previous failures. When confronted on Sunday morning with a question about the historical context of the game, right wing Troy Brouwer shot down the premise. \u201cWe\u2019re not worried about the historical element,\u201d he interrupted.\n\nYet Brouwer\u2019s response demonstrated that while the Capitals may not be worried about the past, they\u2019re acutely aware of it. Trotz\u2019s challenge, then, is for his players to change that narrative. That opportunity looms.\n\n\u201cIf they park it the right way and say, \u2018Hey, I learned that from last series, we\u2019re not going to do that again, this is what we\u2019re going to do and this is how we\u2019re going to win,\u2019 then I think you\u2019re in a good place,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for both teams to close out another team, and whoever is willing to put more on the line will come out with a victory. That\u2019s in as simplest terms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In recent years, the do-or-die scenario has been fatal, as the Capitals have been defeated, occasionally in humiliating fashion, in four of the last five occasions they have hosted the deciding game.", "Author": "Zac Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In recent years, the do-or-die scenario has been fatal, as the Capitals have been defeated, occasionally in humiliating fashion, in four of the last five occasions they have hosted the deciding game.", "title": "Capitals ignoring past Game 7 failures, focusing on task of defeating Islanders", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/capitals-ignoring-past-game-7-failures-focusing-ta/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/25/Capitals_Islanders_Hockey.JPEG-0aee4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/25/Capitals_Islanders_Hockey.JPEG-0aee4.jpg", "title": "Capitals ignoring past Game 7 failures, focusing on task of defeating", "description": "In recent years, the do-or-die scenario has been fatal, as the Capitals have been defeated, occasionally in humiliating fashion, in four of the last five occasions they have hosted the deciding game.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Capitals, Barry Trotz, New York Islanders"}, "article_summary": "Physically exhausted and emotionally spent, Washington Capitals players arrived at their practice facility on Sunday morning to welcome news.\nIn recent years, the do-or-die scenario has been fatal, as the franchise has been defeated, occasionally in humiliating fashion, in four of the last five occasions it has hosted the deciding game.\nNot since 1996 \u2014 \u201cwhen I had long hair and a mullet,\u201d Trotz joked \u2014 has he experienced the pressure of a deciding Game 7.\nThe mental aspect of the game may be the most crucial for the Capitals, who prepare for a deciding Game 7 in their first-round playoff series against the New York Islanders with the specter of past failures leering over their shoulders.\nYet Brouwer\u2019s response demonstrated that while the Capitals may not be worried about the past, they\u2019re acutely aware of it."}
