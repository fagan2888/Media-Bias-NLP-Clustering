Gardiner added:\n\nIn humiliating fashion, you have the Secretary of State up behind a great American musician groveling, trying to give the impression that the administration cares about the trans-Atlantic. It doesn\u2019t. This is Kerry and the administration leading from behind.\u201d Once again this is amateur hour by the Obama administration on the world stage. U.S. allies are looking for robust American leadership \u2026. A musical performance in Paris cannot disguise the immense failure of the Obama administration foreign policy.\n\nKerry and the Obama administration have come under fire for failing to attend or send a top U.S. official to attend a march in Paris on Sunday to show support. The White House later apologized.\n\nThis article has been corrected to reflect that the song\u2019s title is \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d not \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This really happened.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This really happened.", "title": "At Invitation of John Kerry, James Taylor Sings 'You've Got a Friend' to the French", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-10.29.56-AM.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-16T12:51:46+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1y5tsGO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This really happened.", "title": "At Invitation of John Kerry, James Taylor Sings 'You've Got a Friend' to the French", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-10.29.56-AM.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "diplomacy", "published_time": "2015-01-16T10:18:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T12:51:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "john kerry, james taylor, you've got a friend, france"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc775\"", "article_summary": "This article has been corrected to reflect that the song\u2019s title is \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d not \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me.\u201d\nThis is Kerry and the administration leading from behind.\u201d Once again this is amateur hour by the Obama administration on the world stage.\nA musical performance in Paris cannot disguise the immense failure of the Obama administration foreign policy.\nSecretary of State John Kerry sought to show the United States\u2019 support of France after the recent terrorist attack against the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by having James Taylor sing \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d at a Paris press conference.\nKerry and the Obama administration have come under fire for failing to attend or send a top U.S. official to attend a march in Paris on Sunday to show support."}
