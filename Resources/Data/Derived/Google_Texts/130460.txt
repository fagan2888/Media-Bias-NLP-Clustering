Rubesch spoke for the teachers and staff Thursday who filed the complaints.

The complaints accuse Schwab of being a bully by intimidation and harassment, which in turn, according to the teachers and staff, forced dozens of employees to flee the district.

Spooner Communication Specialist Diana Maas confirmed Wednesday the district’s board received the complaints by hand.

“The board received an envelope this morning. They are told that it includes 8 complaints. The envelope has not been opened,” Maas said.

“Before the envelope is opened, the Personnel Committee will meet to clarify all Board Policies so that the Board acts appropriately as outlined,” Maas continued.

The formal complaints come after high publicized protests for Schwab to resign.

Meanwhile the district has stressed emotions are high as tough financial decisions have to be made to deal with a budget shortfall of nearly $1 million from the start of the school year that just ended.

The district also says they are working through added costs from the Affordable Care Act and Act 10.
