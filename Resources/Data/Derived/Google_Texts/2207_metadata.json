Home Depot reports that the malware has been removed from the computer system.\n\nWith reports that 56 million credit cards were impacted, this attack is even bigger than the security breach that Target faced during the holiday season in 2013 when 40 million people were affected.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s press release says that the malware was unique and custom-built, though contradicting reports that said that the attack used the same malware as the Target breach.\n\nThe press release also said that \u201cenhanced encryption of payment data\u201d has been enacted at all of Home Depot\u2019s U.S. locations.\n\nFrank Blake, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, apologized to customers for any anxiety or inconvenience caused by the cyber-attack and assured customers that they would not be liable for charges made under fraudulent circumstances.\n\nCustomers who used a credit card at Home Depot during the time of the cyber-attack can get free credit monitoring and other identify protection services. Go to Home Depot\u2019s website or call 1-800-HOMEDEPOT.\n\nIt\u2019s important for consumers to monitor their credit cards and account activity closely following cyber-attacks like this one to make sure that they aren\u2019t getting any fraudulent charges.\n\nMonitoring credit cards and bank accounts year-round can help keep consumers informed about the safety of their accounts.
