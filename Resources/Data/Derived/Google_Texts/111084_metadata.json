We\u2019re prepared to talk to our clients about what we\u2019re learning here. We\u2019ve not been banned from anything. We\u2019re not barred.\u201d\n\nCGI, Canada\u2019s largest technology company, has bids in for about $1.3 billion in potential U.S. government business, Roach said yesterday in an interview at the firm\u2019s Montreal headquarters. Roach said he\u2019s also seeking contracts with states and corporate clients.\n\nRoach\u2019s challenge is separating CGI from the fallout that followed Obamacare\u2019s Oct. 1 debut, as delays and error messages foiled applicants on the insurance exchange serving 36 of the 50 U.S. states. After years of providing services as basic as running the Medicare website and processing 25 percent of all U.S. passports, CGI found itself thrust into partisan sniping over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cThere have been many instances in our industry where other companies have run into something similar, and it\u2019s passed with time,\u201d Roach said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it, this one got a lot more publicity.\u201d\n\nEnter Accenture\n\nNowhere did the spotlight burn brighter than in the U.S., the source of about C$2.5 billion ($2.26 billion) in revenue in the year ended in September, or about 25 percent of CGI\u2019s global sales. Last month, the U.S. government said Accenture Plc would take over from CGI when its contract expires Feb. 28.\n\nCGI rose 1.2 percent to C$33.23 in Toronto today. The shares slumped 19 percent through yesterday since reaching an all-time closing high of C$40.72 in November after President Barack Obama named Jeffrey Zients, his choice to become chief White House economic adviser, to fix the Obamacare website\u2019s software.\n\nLorne Gorber, CGI\u2019s investor relations chief, declined to comment yesterday on the value of the Obamacare contract beyond the $93.7 million total announced when the company won the job in 2011. Scott Penner, a TD Securities Inc. analyst in Toronto, estimated in October that the project generated C$290 million, or less than 3 percent of CGI\u2019s annual sales.\n\nObamacare Risk\n\nObamacare \u201cis still a risk\u201d for CGI, according to Eyal Ofir, an analyst at Clarus Securities Inc. in Toronto.\n\n\u201cObviously there is some reputational damage,\u201d Ofir said. \u201cThe question is how much of an impact this will really have. Management seems to think there is no impact, but the only way to tell is when we start to look at the orders they book over the next two quarters\u201d -- and whether the so-called book-to-bill ratio of orders to sales increases.\n\nCGI said Jan. 29 that its book-to-bill ratio in the U.S. was 1.02 for the quarter ended in December, and 1.08 for the last 12 months. U.S. work made up 26 percent of CGI\u2019s global backlog of C$19.3 billion.\n\n\u201cIf we see a March quarter decline in the ratio, and it doesn\u2019t rebound in June, this would send a signal to the market,\u201d Ofir said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf it remains above 1 it would be positive.\u201d\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Ratings\n\nOfir cut his rating on CGI to hold in October, saying the shares had become too expensive. He is one of five analysts with that recommendation, while 14 say buy and one says sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On Jan. 29, CGI said it was renewing a plan to buy back as many as 21.8 million shares, or 10 percent of the public float.\n\n\u201cThe cheapest opportunity in the world is to buy back their own stock right now,\u201d Brandon Snow, a fund manager at CI Investments Inc.\u2019s Cambridge Advisors unit, said in a telephone interview from Toronto. Cambridge oversees about C$9 billion in assets in Toronto including CGI stock.\n\nThe federal government makes up the biggest share of CGI\u2019s U.S. business, with about C$1.4 billion of revenue last year, according to Gorber, the investor relations chief. That compared with about C$500 million for state and local governments and C$600 million for U.S. companies, Gorber said.\n\nCGI may be interested in acquiring some information-technology companies to expand its U.S. business, Roach said, without identifying targets. CGI made its biggest-ever purchase in 2012, paying C$2.7 billion for London-based Logica Plc, which was then northern Europe\u2019s second-largest information technology company.\n\nAcquisitions Ahead?\n\nChairman Serge Godin told shareholders Jan. 29 in Montreal that CGI wants to double annual revenue over five to seven years, and will use acquisitions as a means to get there.\n\nRoach, who has been CEO since 2006, wouldn\u2019t discuss what went wrong with the Obamacare contract, citing a desire to preserve existing and future U.S. business.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good time to get into details while you\u2019re working on those contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s tempting to go there, it\u2019s not the right thing to do in the services business. Other customers look at how you\u2019re handling this -- and there but for the grace of God goes another customer.\u201d\n\nCGI will continue to work on the Obamacare website until its contract runs out at month\u2019s end, Roach said.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t fired,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cFeb. 28 is when our contract expires. There was an option year, which the customer chose not to exercise.\u201d\n\nRoach said he remains optimistic CGI can start picking up business in the U.S. this year as the pace of federal contract awards returns to normal following the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nCGI\u2019s ties with the federal government remain \u201cvery important,\u201d Roach said. Obamacare \u201cturned out to be a very political hot potato in the U.S. -- not only in relation to technology work, but the policy itself. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen anything like it in the past, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever see anything like it again in the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Frederic Tomesco", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-06/cgi-s-obamacare-rebound-plan-is-winning-new-deals-in-u-s-", "title": "CGI\u2019s Obamacare Rebound Plan Is Winning New Deals in U.S.", "description": "CGI Group Inc., the Canadian company that lost the Obamacare website contract after a botched rollout, is pursuing new federal and state government work in the U.S. to bolster sales in its biggest market.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Frederic Tomesco", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Canada,Michael E Roach", "news_keywords": "Canada,Michael E Roach", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-06/cgi-s-obamacare-rebound-plan-is-winning-new-deals-in-u-s-", "parsely-title": "CGI\u2019s Obamacare Rebound Plan Is Winning New Deals in U.S.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-06T21:39:26.410Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "CGI Group Inc., the Canadian company that lost the Obamacare website contract after a botched rollout, is pursuing new federal and state government work in the U.S. to bolster sales in its biggest market.", "parsely-tags": "Canada,Michael E Roach,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-02-06T21:39:26.410Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-06/cgi-s-obamacare-rebound-plan-is-winning-new-deals-in-u-s-", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "CGI Group Inc., the Canadian company that lost the Obamacare website contract after a botched rollout, is pursuing new federal and state government work in the U.S. to bolster sales in its biggest market.", "title": "CGI\u2019s Obamacare Rebound Plan Is Winning New Deals in U.S."}, "fb": {"status": "CGI Group Inc., the Canadian company that lost the Obamacare website contract after a botched rollout, is pursuing new federal and state government work in the U.S. to bolster sales in its biggest market."}, "parsely-post-id": "N0JAND6KLVRV01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a43\"", "article_summary": "CGI may be interested in acquiring some information-technology companies to expand its U.S. business, Roach said, without identifying targets.\nLorne Gorber, CGI\u2019s investor relations chief, declined to comment yesterday on the value of the Obamacare contract beyond the $93.7 million total announced when the company won the job in 2011.\nObamacare RiskObamacare \u201cis still a risk\u201d for CGI, according to Eyal Ofir, an analyst at Clarus Securities Inc. in Toronto.\nRoach, who has been CEO since 2006, wouldn\u2019t discuss what went wrong with the Obamacare contract, citing a desire to preserve existing and future U.S. business.\nWe\u2019re not barred.\u201dCGI, Canada\u2019s largest technology company, has bids in for about $1.3 billion in potential U.S. government business, Roach said yesterday in an interview at the firm\u2019s Montreal headquarters."}
