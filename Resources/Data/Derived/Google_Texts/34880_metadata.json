We've had one for years and it looks like we're going to have one for four more.\n\nIt's nothing new. It's the norm. It's how Washington works.\n\nIt's frustrating for those of us who want a smaller, weaker, cheaper federal government. But divided government doesn't necessarily mean that nothing a conservative wants ever gets done in D.C.\n\nMy father had to deal with a Congress controlled by Democrats. But he still was able to get enough things done to be considered the greatest president of our lifetime.\n\nIt's time for the conservatives who support Trump to grow up.\n\nNo party ever gets everything it wants. No voter will, either, especially from Trump.\n\nHe promises to kick out 11 millions illegal immigrants.\n\nHe promises to build the Great Wall of Trump at the border and make Mexico pay for it.\n\nHe promises he'll temporarily keep Muslims out of America.\n\nHe promises he'll put a 35 percent tariff on Fords imported from Mexico, repeal Obamacare, rebuild the military, defeat Isis, make better trade bills and make America great again.\n\nSure he will.\n\nIn the era of divided government, unless he magically makes the House and Senate disappear, Trump's vague promises aren't worth the hot air they were written on.\n\nMy question to the angry Republican voters who support Trump is this - How are you going to feel when The Donald is not able to follow through on his promises?\n\nIt's inevitable, even if he beats Hillary. What will you do when your Republican hero goes to D.C. and fails to deliver? Take to the streets?\n\nElecting a president named Trump or a qualified candidate like John Kasich this fall won't be enough to get things done in D.C. if the GOP doesn't increase its hold on the Senate.\n\nNo matter who he is, a Republican in the White House is going to need 60 votes in the Senate or everything important he proposes to pass or repeal will be filibustered to death.\n\nAll remaining Republican primary voters - especially conservative ones who excuse Trump's wide liberal streak or are too blinded by his celebrity bluster to see it - need to ask themselves something important before it's too late.\n\nDo you know in your heart that the nominee you've picked - even if he wins - has a chance of changing anything in D.C.? Or are you just hoping?\n\nHoping for change isn't going to work. Ask Obama. If you really want to start getting things done in Washington, you can't just be angry, you need to be realistic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone talks about \"The Anger.\".05/27/2016 5:08:10AM EST.", "author": "Michael Reagan", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Everyone talks about \"The Anger.\"", "title": "Michael Reagan - Get Real Angry Trump Voters", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelreagan/2016/02/25/get-real-angry-trump-voters-n2124644", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/55/2016-02-24T063357Z_1_LYNXNPEC1N0A4_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Everyone talks about \"The Anger.\"", "title": "Michael Reagan - Get Real Angry Trump Voters", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelreagan/2016/02/25/get-real-angry-trump-voters-n2124644", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/55/2016-02-24T063357Z_1_LYNXNPEC1N0A4_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Get Real Angry Trump Voters, Michael Reagan, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "But it's time for angry Trump voters, especially the most conservative ones, to stop waving their \"Make America Great\" signs for a few days and face the political facts of life.\nMy question to the angry Republican voters who support Trump is this - How are you going to feel when The Donald is not able to follow through on his promises?\nThe reason Donald Trump is getting so much support from primary voters, the pundits tell us, is because of \"The Anger.\"\nAll remaining Republican primary voters - especially conservative ones who excuse Trump's wide liberal streak or are too blinded by his celebrity bluster to see it - need to ask themselves something important before it's too late.\nIf you really want to start getting things done in Washington, you can't just be angry, you need to be realistic."}
