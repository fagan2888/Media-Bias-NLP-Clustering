Although Regis Groff was one of the first black legislators in Colorado history, he would say his biggest achievement in life was teaching history.

Groff, the second black state senator in Colorado history, died Sunday with family all around him. He was 79.

Groff is survived by his wife, Callie Brownlee-Groff; children Peter, Traci and James; and eight grandchildren. He had been in hospice care while staying at his daughter’s house the past two weeks. The family will announce funeral plans.

“If you asked him what his biggest accomplishment was, he would tell you he was a teacher,” his eldest son, Peter, said Sunday. “He taught for 40 years.”

Groff once taught with former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb at Smiley Middle School, Webb recalled Sunday.

“He was a great teacher. Charismatic,” Webb said. “Regis was a dedicated family man. If you look at his life at its totality, he was a true public servant. … He was a voice for the voiceless. … He was a defender of civil liberties, making sure that the Constitution was for everyone.”

Groff served as a state senator from 1974 to 1994. There were only a handful of blacks who served with him during that period, including Penfield Tate and Webb’s wife, Wilma, said Webb. Peter Groff became Colorado’s first black state Senate president in 2008.

The history teacher’s proudest moment came when he spearheaded passage of a law establishing the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in Colorado, Peter Groff said. He also spearheaded a bill to require Colorado to divest in any business relationship with South Africa, Groff said.

Groff left the state Senate when former Gov. Roy Romer appointed him as the first director of the youth offender corrections system following the summer of violence in 1994. Webb noted that Groff was a religious man dedicated to serving his church.

“His passing will be a great loss to Colorado,” Webb said.
