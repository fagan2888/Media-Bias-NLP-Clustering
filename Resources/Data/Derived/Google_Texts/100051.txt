A former Weld County deputy accused of shooting his wife to death in 2012 and extradited from Indiana back to Colorado to face charges has posted bond.

Tom Fallis, 34, posted $500,000 bond on Monday, according to court records. Fallis was indicted last month on a charge of second-degree murder and arrested in Bloomington, Ind., where he was living with his three children.

Fallis, who did not fight his extradition, arrived in Colorado last week. He is next due in court on Thursday.

Fallis is accused of killing his wife, Ashley, 28, at their Evans home after a fight that began over smoking a cigarette on New Year’s Eve.

Ashley Fallis’ death initially was ruled a suicide, but the case was reopened this year after it was alleged that an officer assigned to the case possibly tampered with evidence. Police in April said the new information “includes alleged eyewitness accounts and other information which requires additional investigation.”

While the officer was cleared of tampering with evidence, the subsequent investigation resulted in probable cause to arrest Fallis.

The Fallises’ children are at the center of a custody dispute between Ashley’s parents and Fallis’ family.

“My clients, Ashley’s parents, are very happy that there is now a prosecution for murder pending against Tom Fallis,” attorney Dan Recht told The Denver Post last month. “It has been a series of nightmares for them over the last three years.”
