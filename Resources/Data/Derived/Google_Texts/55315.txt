GALLOWAY TWP. — The newest member of the Kennedy family was born at a South Jersey hospital Nov 29.

Former Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy (D-RI) and his wife, Amy Kennedy, posed for some of their first photos with the newborn Nell Elizabeth Kennedy at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Pomona on Tuesday, according to a release from the hospital. Nell was born at 4:31 a.m., weighing 6 pounds and measuring 19 inches long.

Kennedy, a nephew of John F. Kennedy who served 16 years in the House of Representatives, married Amy — who is originally from Absecon, not far from the hospital where the new baby was born — in 2011. They now live in Brigantine, according to the Associated Press. Nell has three older siblings. Her brother, Owen Patrick, is 3, and she has two sisters: 2-year-old Nora Kara and 7-year-old Harper Gray.

People Magazine adds that Patrick J. Kennedy recently chronicled his family's history of alcoholism and mental illness in a memoir. During his time in Congress, he made awareness and treatment of psychiatric disorders a major personal cause. The Kennedy Forum, a mental health advocacy group, launched in 2013.
