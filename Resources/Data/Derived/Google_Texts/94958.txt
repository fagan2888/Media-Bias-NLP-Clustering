Want updates on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign? You’ll have to search next to their headlines on Kim Kardashian, says the Huffington Post. In a mocking note about the billionaire businessman Friday morning, the liberal site announced it would be treating the Donald’s White House run as “Entertainment.”

After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won't report on Trump's campaign as part of The Huffington Post's political coverage. Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section. Our reason is simple: Trump's campaign is a sideshow. We won't take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you'll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.

American voters seem to find him so “entertaining,” that he is currently the frontrunner in new national election polls.

Trump is indeed a polarizing figure, one that has unexpectedly shaken up the 2016 field. His uncensored and inarticulate comments, however controversial, seem to be striking a chord with the public in a way that stale, political talking points never could.

How long will his momentum last? Hard to tell. For now, enjoy Round Ten of Trump v. the Media.
