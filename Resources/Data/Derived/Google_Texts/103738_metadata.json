Howard used a can at the scorer\u2019s table that was covered with tape, perhaps to hide what it really was.\n\nAs you might expect, the referees on hand warned both benches about it, and Rockets coach J.B. Bickerstaff soon removed the can from the scorer\u2019s table. Still, Howard didn\u2019t seem too concerned after the game.\n\nA beat writer for the Houston Chronicle tweeted Howard's response: \"I don\u2019t know why people are making a big deal out of it. I do it every game. It\u2019s not a big deal. I ain't tripping.\"\n\nYou've gotta give Howard credit for coming clean here, though there\u2019s a chance Howard might not know using stickum is against NBA rules, despite the fact referees reminded him during the game.\n\nWhile Howard's use of stickum is surprising, the substance has turned up in other sports before. The gloves NFL players use are so tacky the league has considered looking into whether it\u2019s too much of an advantage.\n\nAs for Howard, we'll just have to wait and see if the NBA penalizes him, which would be bad news for the Rockets. Houston already sits in seventh place in the Western Conference, just a game-and-a-half ahead of missing the playoffs.\n\nThis video includes clips from Memorial Hermann, CNN and ESPN and images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Houston Rockets big man Dwight Howard was caught using stickum in a game \u2014 and afterward admitted he's used it for years.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Houston Rockets big man Dwight Howard was caught using stickum in a game \u2014 and afterward admitted he's used it for years.", "title": "NBA Investigating Dwight Howard's Sticky Fingers", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/nba-investigating-dwight-howard-s-sticky-fingers/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1458485348.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Houston Rockets big man Dwight Howard was caught using stickum in a game \u2014 and afterward admitted he's used it for years.", "title": "NBA Investigating Dwight Howard's Sticky Fingers", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/nba-investigating-dwight-howard-s-sticky-fingers/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1458485348.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=JpaDA3MjE6vGaxIncXcJAWm-B01_nooc&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://58203", "iphone": "newsy://58203", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://58203", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "Dwight Howard,Houston Rockets,NBA,basketball,Dwight Howard stickum,NBA news,NBA video,Atlanta Hawks,Paul Millsap,Rockets,Dwight Howard penalty,stickum NBA,stickum NFL,JB Bickerstaff,NBA news video,basketball,sports", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1458485348.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d3e\"", "article_summary": "Carter WoodielHouston Rockets star Dwight Howard is under investigation by the NBA for having sticky fingers \u2014 literally.\nHouston Rockets big man Dwight Howard was caught using stickum in a game \u2014 and afterward admitted he's used it for years.\nHoward used a can at the scorer\u2019s table that was covered with tape, perhaps to hide what it really was.\nAs for Howard, we'll just have to wait and see if the NBA penalizes him, which would be bad news for the Rockets.\nA beat writer for the Houston Chronicle tweeted Howard's response: \"I don\u2019t know why people are making a big deal out of it."}
