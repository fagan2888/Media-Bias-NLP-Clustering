(REUTERS/Larry Downing)\n\n4209698\n\nMaryland\u2019s beleaguered Obamacare exchange released initial premium rates for 2015 late Friday, with one insurance plan proposing a 30 percent hike.\n\nCareFirst of Maryland Inc. and Group Hospitalization and Medical Services Inc., both CareFirst companies, submitted filings to the Maryland insurance department requesting a 30.2 percent premium increase for individual plans in 2015. CareFirst Blue Choice Inc. requested a 22.8 percent increase for next year, citing an older average membership age and a sicker patient pool.\n\nMaryland\u2019s exchange has only five insurers which participated in 2014 and will add another insurer in 2015. All Savers Insurance, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, requested a 4.8 percent. A nonprofit Kaiser Foundation plan offered a 12.1 percent rate reduction and Evergreen Health Cooperative, 10.3 percent reduction.\n\nThe non-profit Kaiser Foundation Health Plan reported that the primary reason it opted to lower rates is the \u201cassumed risk adjustment recoveries\u201d for 2015. Risk adjustment provisions in Obamacare collect and redistribute payments from Obamacare insurers to those who have the sickest pool of patients. Experts believe risk adjustment measures are keeping Obamacare premiums artificially low now, but expect drastic premium hikes when two such provisions run out in 2017.\n\nKaiser Foundation also noted that higher patient co-payments also contributed to the decision to lower the rates.\n\nEvergreen Health Coop is offering new products and admitted in its proposal that it does not have its own data to base the proposal on. They noted that reduced physician reimbursements, increased co-pays for primary care services, pharmacy benefits and prescription drug changes contributed to their ability to lower rates.\n\nMaryland\u2019s insurance commissioner Therese Goldsmith released the rate proposals Friday but made sure to remind the public that the department may not approve all increases.\n\n\u201cWe will conduct a thorough review and may require changes to the rates before they are approved,\u201d Goldsmith said in a statement.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Maryland's beleaguered Obamacare exchange released initial premium rates for 2015 late Friday, with one insurance plan proposing a 30 percent hike.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Maryland's beleaguered Obamacare exchange released initial premium rates for 2015 late Friday, with one insurance plan proposing a 30 percent hike.
