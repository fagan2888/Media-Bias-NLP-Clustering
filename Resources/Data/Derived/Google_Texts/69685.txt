Boulder County sheriff's officials say an 83-year-old man from Niwot who went missing today after going out for groceries was found tonight near Lincoln, Neb.

Louis Bova, who lives in the 7300 block of Dry Creek Road in Niwot, was last seen by his wife around 11 a.m. today, when he left to pick up some groceries at Sprouts in Longmont.

When he did not return home, Bova's family contacted the sheriff's office, and deputies conducted an extensive search of the area, but were unable to locate him.

Bova's vehicle and driver's license information was entered into the national law enforcement database, and he was located around 8:45 tonight when a Nebraska State Patrol trooper stopped to check on Bova's disabled car along the side of a highway.

Sheriff's officials say it appears Bova became "disoriented as to where his home was located."

Bova is safe and unharmed, and arrangements are being made for his family to meet him in Lincoln, officials said.
