Rand Paul\u2019s fears of Ebola let loose in a nation where 44 million people remain uninsured are confirmed, Ebola might come to be known to history as the Republican contagion. Because nobody will have done more to pave the way for the disease than the Republicans who have done their utmost best to keep people uninsured, and balked at finding a cure.\n\nNow that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that the first case of Ebola has been diagnosed in the United States, not only is Lindsey Graham undoubtedly cringing beneath his bed, but Republicans have found something else to attack Obama for. Benghazi, ISIL, Ebola \u2013 they are all just sticks with which to beat the president.\n\nThe CDC has tried to downplay fears of Ebola spreading in the U.S. The CDC has pointed out that,\n\nyou can\u2019t catch Ebola through the air;\n\nyou can\u2019t catch it through water or food;\n\nyou can only get Ebola from \u201ctouching blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola,\u201d from \u201ctouching contaminated objects, like needles,\u201d or \u201ctouching infected animals, their blood or other body fluids, or their meat.\u201d\n\nIn a word, \u201cEbola poses no significant risk to the United States.\u201d\n\nBut according to Paul, who if not to Ebola is at least immune to irony, and who got together with Laura Ingraham Wednesday on her radio program, the Obama administration and CDC are underestimating the seriousness of the Ebola threat.\n\n\u201cI think because of political correctness we\u2019re not really making sound, rational, scientific decisions on this,\u201d the senator said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake to underestimate the potential for problems worldwide.\u201d\n\nOkay, let\u2019s say he\u2019s right. Let\u2019s just grant for a moment that everything he says is true. Think about this:\n\nIn what might go down in history as the most ironic epitaph in history, Ingraham bills herself as \u201cyour healthy radio addiction.\u201d\n\nNot so much, if Ebola strikes, and their GOP has refused to do even the minimum necessary, like funding research and ensuring Americans have adequate healthcare. I mean, think about how useful actual health insurance might be in the event of an Ebola outbreak.\n\nYou have to remember too that it was Paul\u2019s fellow Republicans who refused to fund Ebola research just last month. Obama wanted $88 million, but as The Hill reported on September 9, Republicans decided he needed only $40 million \u2013 that\u2019s $25 million for the CDC and $15 million for the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\nWouldn\u2019t you think Rand Paul would do better to be attacking House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) than Obama? After all, Obama wanted to do something about Ebola, but Republicans haven\u2019t. They just want to complain about it, just like they want to complain about ISIL without doing anything about it.\n\nThen again, they don\u2019t even want to fund our federal government period, a decision they might come to regret, if only privately and as their innards liquefy.\n\nSo Paul doesn\u2019t think Obama is taking thing seriously enough. Wants him to do something. But Paul doesn\u2019t even like that Obama is sending troops to help contain Ebola, worrying that they will become infected and then return to America carrying the disease.\n\nInterestingly, both John Boehner and Mitch McConnell agreed with Obama on sending troops, with McConnell going so far as to say \u201cWhat the administration\u2019s doing is correct.\u201d\n\nOf course, if Paul sounds, well, like Rand Paul, there is always Michael Savage to make him sound sane. Michael Savage is claiming that President Obama wants Ebola in the US, that he \u201cwants to infect the nation with Ebola,\u201d so he can kill white people. Right, because Ebola only targets white people. That\u2019s why all those black people in Africa are dying.\n\nBut Savage isn\u2019t alone. Ingraham is already on record as saying Obama is sending American troops to Africa to atone for colonialism and as part of some bizarre plot to redistribute wealth (don\u2019t hurt yourself trying to figure that one out).\n\nThe Tea Party Nation agrees with him, saying Obama \u201cwants Ebola here.\u201d And Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), who hasn\u2019t met crazy he doesn\u2019t like, and who has said that \u201cundocumented Democrats\u201d from Central America are smuggling Ebola across the border \u2013 and that, oh, by the way, he\u2019s not fear-mongering \u2013 told Lou Dobbs the other day that Obama is sending \u201c3,000 military into where they can get Ebola that they can bring back.\u201d\n\nThe military is not trained to go catch Ebola and die. They\u2019re trained to go in and kill the people that want to come back and kill us. The president\u2019s priorities are all mixed up here. All you got to do is shut down traffic in and out of places where there\u2019s high risk of Ebola.\n\n\u201cBut political correctness,\u201d Gohmert says, \u201cis going to get people killed in all of these areas.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019 exactly what Paul said \u2013 political correctness is to blame for getting us all killed by Ebola, not the refusal of Republicans to fund healthcare or research into finding a cure.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think political correctness has anything to do with the threat posed by Ebola. Republicans stupidity and inflexible ideology and hatred of our first black president \u2013 now that might have something to do with it.\n\nJust to prove my point, Gohmert thinks the solution is more Benghazi-like witch hunts, saying what we need is not research but hearing to find out \u201cwho has instilled this atmosphere of political correctness.\u201d\n\nYes, that will protect us all from the threat of Ebola. Hearings. Assigning blame while Rome burns Here is my not-so-hypothetical Q&A with Gohmert:\n\nQ: \u201cDon\u2019t you think we ought to be finding a cure?\u201d\n\nA: \u201cNo, we\u2019ve got to find out who is responsible for all this political correctness!\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re truly worried about Ebola, you won\u2019t vote Republican. Republicans aren\u2019t really worried about Ebola. Ebola to Republicans is just another weapon, like Benghazi, ISIL, or even Jesus, with which to attack our president.\n\nIf they were really worried about Ebola, rather than attacking Obama\u2019s decisions, they\u2019d be coming up with some ideas of their own, or coming up with some research money \u2013 after all, there is ALWAYS enough money to give to oil companies.\n\nBut then they\u2019re Republicans, and that means they don\u2019t have any ideas. And the money? They\u2019d rather give that to their rich friends.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are saying Obama is underestimating threat of Ebola, which might explain why they're refusing to fund a cure and provide healthcare", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Republicans are saying Obama is underestimating threat of Ebola, which might explain why they're refusing to fund a cure and provide healthcare", "title": "Republicans Caught Between Opposition to Healthcare and Fear of Ebola", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/03/republicans-caught-opposition-healthcare-fear-ebola.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ebola_virus_virion.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-03T08:11:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,america,Barack Obama,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Ebola,Healthcare,laura ingraham,Louie Gohmert,Obama Administration,Rand Paul,United States,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2014-10-03T08:11:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T08:11:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america, Barack Obama, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ebola, Healthcare, laura ingraham, Louie Gohmert, Obama Administration, Rand Paul, Republican Party, United States"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe006c\"", "article_summary": "You have to remember too that it was Paul\u2019s fellow Republicans who refused to fund Ebola research just last month.\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think political correctness has anything to do with the threat posed by Ebola.\nEbola to Republicans is just another weapon, like Benghazi, ISIL, or even Jesus, with which to attack our president.\nAfter all, Obama wanted to do something about Ebola, but Republicans haven\u2019t.\nMichael Savage is claiming that President Obama wants Ebola in the US, that he \u201cwants to infect the nation with Ebola,\u201d so he can kill white people."}
