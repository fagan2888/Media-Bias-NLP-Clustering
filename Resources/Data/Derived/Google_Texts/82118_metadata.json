Their Senate counterparts are meeting, too, ahead of the justices\u2019 ruling at the end of this term.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a plan in place by then,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama taunts Republican critics on 5th anniversary of Obamacare: \u2018It\u2019s working\u2019\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the closely watched case known as King v. Burwell, with challengers saying the administration is breaking the law by paying tax subsidies to customers in states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange. The law says subsidies can be paid to customers in exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d\n\nIf the subsidies are struck down, the law will be much less attractive to customers in at least 34 states that rely on the federal portal. Plans would no longer be affordable, and premiums could skyrocket if healthier enrollees drop coverage first.\n\nRepublicans are cheering on the case, as it provides their best opportunity yet to scale down Obamacare and present their own ideas ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSEE ALSO: GOP House bill would balance budget, cut Obamacare\n\nThe opportunity comes with political peril, because the administration and its Democratic allies will hold the GOP responsible for the case\u2019s fallout.\n\nAdministration officials say the law is fine as written, and there is no need to put a Plan B in place to deal with an adverse ruling.\n\nMr. Ryan said Republicans cannot take a similar stance.\n\n\u201cWe need to have an alternative. That is the responsible thing to do,\u201d he said. The president is saying that he had no back-up plan. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsible.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say Republicans are fanning the flames of the King challenge and then asking the administration to put them out.\n\nThere is no evidence, they\u2019ve said, that any state or federal leaders thought the availability of the subsidies would be tied to how the states set up their exchanges.\n\nThe law is working and should be left alone, they\u2019ve argued.\n\nMr. Ryan said Democrats couldn\u2019t get a single-payer system or federal-only platform through Congress when they hammered out the Affordable Care Act five years ago, since some senators wanted to empower the states.\n\nHe thinks the state-centered language at issue in King was put into the bill to appease those senators, but framers couldn\u2019t clean up any problems between the Democratic majorities in each chamber because newly elected Republican Sen. Scott Brown broke their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cPoorly drafted, but I think it was intentionally drafted the way it was,\u201d Mr. Ryan said of the contested language. \u201cThat\u2019s my impression of the situation.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown\u2019s election in early 2010 forced Democrats to finish up the health package through a budget process known as reconciliation.\n\nNow, Republicans may use the same tool to put an Obamacare-repeal bill on Mr. Obama desk.\n\nHouse Republicans muscled through a budget plan this week, and Senate Republicans are expected to follow suit.\n\nThat sets the table for a compromise that allows Congress to pass spending bills and other legislation to carry out the blueprint, such as the Obamacare repeal or an overhaul of the tax code.\n\nMr. Ryan said the GOP\u2019s use of reconciliation will be colored by how the justices rule in the King case, so they\u2019re keeping their options open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too soon to tell,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan says Republicans must have a plan to replace Obamacare by late June, a deadline that coincides with a Supreme Court decision that could blow a huge hole in the controversial law.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan says Republicans must have a plan to replace Obamacare by late June, a deadline that coincides with a Supreme Court decision that could blow a huge hole in the controversial law.", "title": "Paul Ryan: GOP must have Obamacare replacement by late June", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/26/paul-ryan-gop-must-have-obamacare-replacement-late/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/01/1_1_2015_ap6691953434898201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/01/1_1_2015_ap6691953434898201.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan: GOP must have Obamacare replacement by late June", "description": "House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan says Republicans must have a plan to replace Obamacare by late June, a deadline that coincides with a Supreme Court decision that could blow a huge hole in the", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Paul Ryan, Republican Party, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde81e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPoorly drafted, but I think it was intentionally drafted the way it was,\u201d Mr. Ryan said of the contested language.\n\u201cWe have to have a plan in place by then,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters.\nMr. Ryan said the GOP\u2019s use of reconciliation will be colored by how the justices rule in the King case, so they\u2019re keeping their options open.\nMr. Ryan said Republicans cannot take a similar stance.\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan says Republicans must have a plan to replace Obamacare by late June, a deadline that coincides with a Supreme Court decision that could blow a huge hole in the controversial law."}
