Almost 25% of drivers have been with the same auto insurance company for more than 16 years, and 7% have hung around for more than 30 years.\n\nHow comfortable are we with doing absolutely nothing about our car insurance. More than a third of U.S. drivers (36%) never shop around for auto insurance quotes, and only 30% only shop for quotes every few years.\n\n\"Americans may think loyalty pays off, but when it comes to insurance, that's not always the case,\" says Laura Adams, insuranceQuotes.com's senior analyst. \"If you haven't shopped for auto insurance since the '90s, it's probably safe to say that you're not getting the best deal.\u201d\n\nThat would be great, if U.S. drivers cared about getting the absolutely lowest price. Oddly, with car insurance, comfort seems to be key. If drivers don't have to think about it, they tend to like it. While 64% find shopping for auto insurance \"worthwhile,\" 45% describe the process as \"simple\" and 29% even say it is \"interesting.\u201d Just as many find insurance shopping time-consuming (62%), frustrating (44%) and complicated (40%). As a result, 66% of policyholders never or rarely check to see if they could get their coverage more cheaply.\n\nAnd, honestly, does it sound like all that great a time? Your parents and grandparents actively avoided door-to-door insurance salesmen as if they were carrying plague. Do you think young drivers are going to actively hang out in an insurance office on an annual basis. There's a reason why Millennials (ages 18 to 29) and seniors (65 and up) are the age groups least likely to shop around for car insurance, and it isn't because they're lazy.\n\n\"It's not very glamorous to shop for car insurance,\" Jeremy Bowler, a property and casualty insurance expert and senior vice president of research and consulting in the financial services division of market research company Market Strategies International, told InsuranceQuotes.\n\nWell, there's that. But there's also the fact that switching insurance is tricky. Insurance folks regularly beat it into your head that any lapse in coverage is going to make your rates go up, yet 50% of those surveyed by InsuranceQuotes still didn't know that. You have to get new insurance before you cancel your old policy, which may have led 46% of Americans -- and six in ten Millennials -- to wrongly believe they have to wait until renewal time to switch insurers.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "The majority of U.S. drivers won't change their auto insurance for more than a decade.
