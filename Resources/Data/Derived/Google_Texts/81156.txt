Jake Tapper grilled Bernie Sanders on CNN’s State of the Union today over whether his continued attacks against Hillary Clinton hurt the Democrats in the fall.

Sanders continued to make arguments about the Democratic party being too out-of-touch, but Tapper brought up just how unlikely it is that he would actually “achieve the majority of the pledged delegates.”

He confronted Sanders over whether he believes the candidate with the majority of delegates heading into the convention should be the Democratic nominee. Sanders, who minutes earlier railed against the unfair superdelegate system, said that superdelegates should be taking an “objective look” at which candidate would be better in the fall.

Tapper said, “With all due respect, sir, she has more votes than you and she has more pledged delegates.”

Sanders remarked upon the irony of being called out on the superdelegate issue when they practically “anointed” Clinton from the start.
