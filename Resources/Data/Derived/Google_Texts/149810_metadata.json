Gawande concluded that these increased costs were likely due to the culture of medical practice in the region, which resulted in more unnecessary and costly care and procedures.\n\nA study released late last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation tells the story:\n\nAlthough Medicare per capita spending nationwide averaged $9,415 in 2013, per capita spending on average totaled $13,140 in 20 counties with the highest levels, but only $6,726 in the 20 counties with the lowest levels.\n\nAs the chart below illustrates, Medicare per capita spending in 2013 was twice as large in the 20 highest-spending counties than in the 20 lowest-spending counties.\n\nRelated: Millions Face a 50 % Medicare Premium Hike If Obama and Congress Don\u2019t Act\n\nThe 20 counties with the highest unadjusted Medicare per capita spending in 2013 were primarily located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and the South. In contrast, most of the counties with the lowest per capita spending were in the West.\n\nFor years, researchers have argued that the differences in Medicare spending across the country were prompted by variances in the way doctors and hospitals treated and billed their patients \u2013 with some ordering inordinate numbers of medical tests or failing to coordinate the medical services. Experts believed that many of those problems and excesses could be overcome by \u201cpolicy interventions,\u201d such as change in the financial incentives for health care providers.\n\nBut other researchers have argued, in effect, that \u201cgeography is destiny\u201d and that much of the variation in cost has to do with the beneficiaries\u2019 general health and socio-economic status, as well as how frequently areas residents require costly hospitalization and post-operative services.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t take a stand on the predominant factor, these vastly different regional costs may well become an issue when and lawmakers finally tackle additional health care reform.\n\nRelated: Millions Facing a Hefty Increase in Medicare Premiums in 2016\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act included a number of provisions designed to encourage greater efficiency in the delivery of care for Medicare beneficiaries by modifying incentives for providers to reduce excess costs and improve quality of care \u2013 and they may have contributed to bringing down costs in some areas.\n\nYet even with such efforts, deep differences in per capita Medicare costs persist throughout the country.\n\n\u201cWe did do an analysis that suggests the gap between the highs and the lows has narrowed,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation and the director of its Program on Medicare Policy. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s narrowed raises interesting questions as to why that has occurred\u201d but the study stopped short of advancing a theory.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act may well have been a factor and some of the other initiatives that have been put out,\u201d she added. \u201cFor example, we saw a narrowing with respect to durable medical equipment spending, and there was a competitive bidding effort that the administration did. And there was some narrowing with respect to home health services.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we really didn\u2019t set out to do any causal analysis,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the study\u2019s authors avoided clear conclusions about the factors at play in creating the geographic cost disparities, it does provide a detailed look at the typical high-cost county\n\nHere are four brief factors that help to explain the counties with the costliest Medicare costs:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The long-standing problem of disparity in the value of healthcare available to patients in different parts of the country isn\u2019t going away any time soon, though a new report suggests the differences tighten when certain costs are factored in.", "title": "The Big Medicare Mystery\u2014Why the Same Services Cost Double in Some Areas?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/14/Big-Medicare-Mystery-Why-Same-Service-Cost-Double-Some-Areas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_medicare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/14/Big-Medicare-Mystery-Why-Same-Service-Cost-Double-Some-Areas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_medicare_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The long-standing problem of disparity in the value of healthcare available to patients in different parts of the country isn\u2019t going away any time soon, though a new report suggests the differences tighten when certain costs are factored in.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Yet even with such efforts, deep differences in per capita Medicare costs persist throughout the country.\nAs the chart below illustrates, Medicare per capita spending in 2013 was twice as large in the 20 highest-spending counties than in the 20 lowest-spending counties.\nThe government\u2019s cost for providing the same Medicare services to seniors can vary by thousands of dollars, depending on where they live.\nIn contrast, most of the counties with the lowest per capita spending were in the West.\nIn the ongoing struggle of policy makers to contain government health care costs, one of the most perplexing challenges has been coping with often huge variations in Medicare spending throughout the country."}
