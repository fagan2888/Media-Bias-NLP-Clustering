ColoradoCare, a single-payer health care alternative to Obamacare, will appear on the state’s ballot in 2016.

Colorado Secretary of State Wayne William announced Monday more than 156,000 people signed a petition calling for the measure to be approved for a vote, far exceeding the 98,492 needed.

The proposal is designed to establish a universal health care system, which would be funded by a 10 percent increase to the state’s payroll taxes.

The $25 billion tax increase would replace Medicare and supplemental Medicaid plans — 3.33 percent would be paid for by employees while 6.67 percent would be paid for employers.

While its proponents say the plan will save individuals and businesses billions, opponents say that analysis is a fallacy.

“ColoradoCare will triple our taxes, lead to rationing of health care and will make Colorado a less attractive state for Millennials, businesses and families,” said Advancing Colorado Executive Director Jonathan Lockwood in a statement. “Coloradans do not want to see their taxes triple and all the progress with health care reform thrown in the trash for a single-payer health care system.”

Under the Affordable Care Act, states are able to offer waive out of Obamacare as long as the alternative covers as many people.

Vermont decided against a similar measure last year due to unsustainable costs.
