Christopher Miles It\u2019s been a long time since the United States declared war against another nation and fought army against army on a conventional battlefield. Even the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which initially focused on taking out Saddam Hussein\u2019s army, quickly morphed into irregular warfare with U.S. and NATO troops fighting rogue groups with different agendas united against the occupation. Now America is more war-weary than ever and no longer interested in getting involved with the problems in far-away countries. Saturday\u2019s decision by Obama to ask Congress to vote on whether to strike Syria illustrates the new mood in this country: No more war unless absolutely necessary. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, \u2018war\u2019 has come to mean something different for the U.S. military, which has spent the last decade battling all kinds of unconventional enemies who use guerilla warfare and are more transient than ever. Both President Bush and Obama have used this new landscape to authorize military action in places most Americans never heard of before, like Afghanistan and Iraq, Yemen and Libya. The threats facing the United States are so great and ever-changing, they require different responses of force \u2013 and not necessarily the approval of Congress.\n\nObama ordered military action in Libya without consulting Congress. While the campaign was successful in taking down the brutal dictator Moammar Gadhafi, the country is still a mess two years later. While Obama believes that the use of chemical weapons in Syria surpasses a red-line that leaves the U.S. no chance but to respond, he also knows that a unilateral strike in a country mired in a bloody, complicated civil war is not as appetizing as it was on 9/11. And the claim that a strike against Syria would not last long, would avoid U.S. casualties and would not pull the U.S. into a broader conflict in the Middle East is no longer as believable as it once was. In his address in the Rose Garden on Saturday, Obama acknowledged that his decision to strike Syria would only be bolstered by a congressional vote. \u201cOur democracy is stronger when the President and the people\u2019s representatives stand together,\u201d he said. \u201cI know well that we are weary of war. We\u2019ve ended one war in Iraq. We\u2019re ending another in Afghanistan. And the American people have the good sense to know we cannot resolve the underlying conflict in Syria with our military. In that part of the world, there are ancient sectarian differences, and the hopes of the Arab Spring have unleashed forces of change that are going to take many years to resolve. And that's why we\u2019re not contemplating putting our troops in the middle of someone else\u2019s war,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019ll continue to support the Syrian people through our pressure on the Assad regime, our commitment to the opposition, our care for the displaced, and our pursuit of a political resolution that achieves a government that respects the dignity of its people.\u201d While many are applauding Obama\u2019s choice to consult Congress, others question whether it undermines the power of the U.S. presidency. The New York Republican congressman Pete King said that in doing so, \u201cPresident Obama is abdicating his responsibility as commander-in-chief and undermining the authority of future presidents \u2026 The president doesn't need 535 Members of Congress to enforce his own redline\u201d on the use of chemical weapons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama&#39;s decision to seek Congressional authorization for a Syrian intervention illustrates the new mood in the country.", "author": "Stephanie Gaskell", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Obama&#39;s decision to seek Congressional authorization for a Syrian intervention illustrates the new mood in the country.", "title": "How the War on Terror Changed the Way America Fights", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/defense-large/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/how-the-war-on-terror-changed-the-way-america-goes-to-war/279250/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Saturday\u2019s decision by Obama to ask Congress to vote on whether to strike Syria illustrates the new mood in this country: No more war unless absolutely necessary.\nNow America is more war-weary than ever and no longer interested in getting involved with the problems in far-away countries.\nIn his address in the Rose Garden on Saturday, Obama acknowledged that his decision to strike Syria would only be bolstered by a congressional vote.\nAnd that's why we\u2019re not contemplating putting our troops in the middle of someone else\u2019s war,\u201d he said.\nChristopher Miles It\u2019s been a long time since the United States declared war against another nation and fought army against army on a conventional battlefield."}
