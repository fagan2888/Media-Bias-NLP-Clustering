Going on Offense on Obamacare

* Health care costs are the biggest financial concern for families - more than low wages, college expenses, and even losing a job.

* Democrats want to claim that Obamacare is working; Americans disagree. Disapproval of the law is at its highest level in two years.

* People will start selecting their insurance for next year - with higher premiums and fewer choices - just one week before Election Day .

According to a recent Gallup poll, health care costs are the biggest financial concern for families - more than low wages, college expenses, and even losing a job. While Democrats make the case for their agenda, this top financial concern of Americans is notably absent. In fact, Democrats seek to cover it up.

Just last month Democrat Leader Reid said, "It's too bad my Republican friends continue to attack Obamacare. It's working." Americans aren't buying it. An April 2016 Pew poll shows Obamacare at 54 percent disapproval and 44 percent approval. That's the law's highest disapproval in two years.
