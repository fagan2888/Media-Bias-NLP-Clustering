Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted to provide an additional view of our operational performance. Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Net Insurance Service Revenues as insurance service revenues less insurance costs, which include the premiums we pay to insurance carriers for the health and workers compensation insurance coverage provided to our clients and WSEs and the reimbursements we pay to the insurance carriers for claim payments within our insurance deductible layer. We define Net Service Revenues as the sum of professional service revenues and Net Insurance Service Revenues. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income, excluding the effects of our income tax provision, interest expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income, excluding the effects of our effective income tax rate, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense, debt prepayment premium, and the income tax effect of these pre tax adjustments at our effective tax rate. For purposes of our non-GAAP financial presentation, as a result of a 2016 increase in New York City tax rates and an increase in blended state rates, we have adjusted the effective tax rate to 42.5% for the periods ended March 31, 2016, from 40.5% for the periods ended March 31, 2015. Each of these effective tax rates exclude income tax on non-deductible stock-based compensation and discrete items including the cumulative effect of state law changes. Non-cash interest expense represents amortization and write-off of our debt issuance costs.

We believe that the use of Net Insurance Service Revenues provides useful information as it presents a measure of revenues from our provision of insurance services to our clients that eliminates the cost to us of that insurance. We believe that Net Service Revenues provides a useful measure of total revenues for the two main components of our revenues calculated on a consistent basis. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted provides additional period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain one-time and non-cash expenses. We believe that Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted are useful for our stockholders and board of directors by helping them to identify trends in our business and understand how our management evaluates our business. We use Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted to monitor and evaluate our operating results and trends on an ongoing basis and internally for operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes, in addition to allocating our resources to enhance the financial performance of our business and evaluating the effectiveness of our business strategies. We also use Net Service Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in determining the incentive compensation for management.

Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measurements required by GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As non-GAAP measures, Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:

Net Insurance Service Revenues and Net Service Revenues are reduced by the insurance costs that we pay to insurance carriers;

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the amounts we paid in taxes or other components of our tax provision;

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted do not reflect the non-cash component of employee compensation;

Although depreciation and amortization of intangible assets are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures or similar measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Net Insurance Service Revenues, Net Service Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share – diluted alongside other financial performance measures, including total revenues, net income and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.
