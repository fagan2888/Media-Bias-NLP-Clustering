Garett Bembridge is making a difference both on and off the ice for the Denver Cutthroats.

The forward not only leads the team in goals and points, but he’s also leading some teammates in a Toys for Christmas drive.

On Dec. 22, Bembridge — accompanied by teammates T.J. Fox, Phil Tesoriero, Sean Zimmerman and Nick Schneider — will head to Denver Health to give gifts to children in the hospital during the holidays.

The team got involved last week selling bracelets at the Dec. 13-14 home games. They sold 200 bracelets at $10 apiece and will sell 66 ornaments during this weekend’s games for $20 each.

The players will shop for the gifts the morning of Dec. 22 and deliver them later that day.

“I took this proposal to the staff and they’ve done a heck of a job,” Bembridge said.

Bembridge has tried to lead similar campaigns in other cities where he’s played. He and a teammate set it up together about four years ago. Bembridge also tried to do a toy drive in Italy last year, but did not have as much success.

Bembridge currently leads the Central Hockey League with 21 goals and 38 points in his first season with the Cutthroats.
