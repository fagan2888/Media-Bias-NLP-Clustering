So why is the IRS threatening massive fines on businesses that try to help their employees buy an ObamaCare plan?\n\nBack in 2013, the IRS issued a startling new rule. Any business that doesn\u2019t provide insurance but does help employees with the cost of their own insurance will be fined $100 per day \u2014 which works out to $36,500 a year \u2014 per employee.\n\nIn the bizarre logic of the Obama administration, a company that offers such help is actually providing a group plan, one that doesn\u2019t meet ObamaCare\u2019s ridiculous array of mandates and regulations.\n\nAllegedly, the goal of the penalty \u2014 which went into effect this month \u2014 was to keep businesses from dumping workers into the ObamaCare exchanges. But to small businesses that have been helping their employees in this way for decades, it\u2019s a devastating blow.\n\n\u201cThis is a brand-new penalty that nobody knew about, and it\u2019s huge,\u201d Jack Mozloom of the National Federation of Independent Business told The Hill.\n\nThe NFIB figures that 14% of companies that don\u2019t offer insurance have such policies in place.\n\nEven Obama\u2019s own Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, who oversees the IRS, can\u2019t quite fathom this rule.\n\nHe told Congress recently, \u201cThe objective of the Affordable Care Act is to make sure that affordable health care is available to all, and I believe that the provisions that you\u2019re referring to are not consistent with that.\u201d\n\nThere are currently two bills in Congress to eliminate this fee. We hope that a fix gets passed soon and that Obama isn\u2019t so arrogant as to veto it. Regardless, it\u2019s only a foretaste of what\u2019s to come if ObamaCare remains the law of the land.\n\nWhen designing ObamaCare, Democrats gave regulators vast discretion to implement it. And as a result, decisions about insurance, benefits, coverage, treatments and so on will increasingly be made by unelected, unaccountable and, apparently, brain-dead bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., not by individuals or private companies acting on their own.\n\nJust keeping up with all the costly and misguided rules that regulators spew out will require Congress\u2019 full time and attention. That is, unless lawmakers can find a way to chuck the entire ObamaCare law and replace it with reforms that actually make health care more affordable, not less.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bureaucracy: The central goal of ObamaCare is supposed to be to make health care more affordable.
