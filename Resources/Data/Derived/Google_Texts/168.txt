“When I go out, people do look. They try to be polite, you can see when something’s not right,” Maurer told the Battle Creek Enquirer.

The 39-year-old wants to get rid of the abnormal growth before it ruins his relationship with his partner of 20 years, Mindy. “I don’t want to lose her,” Maurer said.

He is hoping to raise $20,000 for his operation.

“Hello my name is Dan. I have Scrotal Lymphedema and the doctor that specializes in that type of surgery is who I would prefer to remove the 75 pound growth on my abdomen is not covered by my insurance,” Maurer wrote on GoFundMe. “Please help me get this done as I don’t see any other way to live a semi normal life. Thank you for taking the time to read this and god bless.”

Maurer realized that his problem could be treated after seeing the TLC show, titled The Man with the 132 Pound Scrotum.

The Maurers say they haven’t had relations in seven years, but Mindy has vowed to stay with her husband.

“She’s amazing. I don’t see myself as being worth it, but she is. That’s why I’m going through this,” Maurer said.
