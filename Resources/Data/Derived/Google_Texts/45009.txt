CBS: Forced to learn Islam? Mass. minister fights ruling

The highest court in Massachusetts is being asked to decide if a judge violated the constitutional rights of a landlord when he ordered her to take a course on Islam after she was convicted of pushing her Muslim tenant down a flight of stairs.

The Supreme Judicial Court will hear arguments Jan. 8 in the case of Daisy Obi, the pastor of a Somerville church.

Obi was convicted of assault and battery for pushing her tenant, Gihan Suliman, in 2012. The tenant testified that Obi also made disparaging remarks about Muslims to her and her children.

During the sentencing, Judge Paul Yee Jr. called Obi "the landlord from hell" after pointing out that she had harassment prevention orders issued against her by two other tenants.

He sentenced her to two years in jail on the assault and battery charge for pushing Suliman but required her to serve only six months, with the remaining 18 months suspended if she complied with certain probation conditions.

"I want you to learn about the Muslim faith," he said. "I want you to enroll and attend an introductory course on Islam.

"I do want you to understand people of the Muslim faith, and they need to be respected. They may worship Allah ... but they need to be respected."

Obi vehemently denied making any anti-Muslim statements to Suliman or pushing her. She testified she was inside her apartment praying when she heard a knock at the door from the police, who arrested her.

Obi's lawyer argues that the order infringes on Obi's constitutional rights.
