I'm also proud of our work to make communities more livable and age-friendly; our Drive to End Hunger among seniors; and AARP Experience Corps, our mentoring program to ensure that children are reading at grade level by third grade. And I'm pleased that we are making AARP more responsive to people in their states and communities, not just in Washington. We've come a long way in helping people to realize that their life experience has value and that, as they get older, their lives remain filled with real possibilities.

What I love about AARP most are the social mission and the people. Enhancing the quality of life for all as we age is inspiring work, made even more so by the people we meet along the way. I loved meeting you, our members, either in person at AARP events or through the letters and emails you sent me. I don't think I will ever forget my first Life@50+ event in Las Vegas. In my keynote speech, I told people to stop and give me a hug if they saw me around the exhibit hall. It took me over an hour just to get from one side of the exhibit floor to the other as AARP members came up to give me a hug, wish me well and tell me what was on their minds. That experience served as a constant reminder that I was working for all of you.

AARP is now in the capable hands of Jo Ann Jenkins. She and I share a belief that age and experience can expand everyone's possibilities. I know she feels a great responsibility for ensuring that AARP remains a trusted ally for people 50-plus and their families, and that we continue to protect the most vulnerable among us.

Serving you has been a tremendous experience and privilege. Thank you.
