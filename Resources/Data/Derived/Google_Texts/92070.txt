In anticipation of the fifth season premiere of “Game of Thrones,” the College Republican National Committee (CRNC) has released graphics themed after the hit HBO series that knock Hillary Clinton ahead of her now-official presidential campaign.

The CRNC has posted the graphics on its Facebook page, entitling the series appropriately “Game of Clinton.”

Hillary Clinton’s official announcement of her White House bid came just hours before the season premiere of the HBO series. The former secretary of State launched her campaign with a message on social media and an accompanying video.

“Game of Thrones” premieres Sunday night at 9pm on HBO.

Let the games begin!
