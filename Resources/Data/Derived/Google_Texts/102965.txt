A group of small, independent hospitals in Connecticut said the increasing cost of providing health care coupled with lower reimbursement rates from insurance providers and the government is making it harder for them to survive, and they’re seeking help from state lawmakers.

The Value Care Alliance is an association of seven of Connecticut’s smaller hospitals.

Patrick Charmel, CEO of Griffin Hospital in Derby, chairs the alliance. He told lawmakers on the state General Assembly’s hospitals roundtable that the current system is not sustainable. Charmel gave the example of health care premiums that have increased by double digits in recent years.

"[It's] to the point now, here in Connecticut," Charmel said, "employees are paying about 40 percent of the cost of care out of pocket, when you combine the premium share with co-pays and deductibles. So not only are employers saying enough, their employees are as well."

Charmel said the hospitals he represents want Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates increased.
