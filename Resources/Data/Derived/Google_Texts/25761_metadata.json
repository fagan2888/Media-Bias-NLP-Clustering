The full note, below:\n\nThis article contains many errors, some of them fundamental to the analysis.\n\nThe article repeatedly refers to the number and location of kidnappings. But the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) \u2014 the data source for the article \u2014 is a repository of media reports, not discrete events. As such, we should only have referred to \u201cmedia reports of kidnappings,\u201d not kidnappings.\n\nThis mistake led to other problems.\n\nWe should not have published an animated map showing \u201ckidnappings\u201d over time, or even \u201cmedia reports of kidnappings\u201d over time. Because we have no data on actual kidnappings, showing a time series requires normalizing the data to account for the increasing number of media reports overall. Thus, showing individual media reports is a mistake. The second map, showing \u201cKidnapping rate per 100,000 people, 1982-present,\u201d has the same flaw.\n\nThe animated map also incorrectly locates some reported kidnappings. If the location of a reported kidnapping isn\u2019t in a media report, GDELT defaults the location to the center of Nigeria. So that part of the country is overrepresented in the animated map.\n\nThe article also should have made clear that while GDELT makes an effort to remove duplicate media reports of the same event, it is not always successful in doing so because media reports often conflict with one another. There were many conflicting reports about the mass kidnapping of hundreds of girls from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok in April. This likely accounts for at least some of the rise in media reports of kidnappings referred to in the last paragraph of the post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A post in the data-driven blog made several mistakes in its analysis", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A post in the data-driven blog made several mistakes in its analysis", "title": "FiveThirtyEight issues brutally honest correction: \u201cWe will do better\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/16/fivethirtyeight_issues_brutally_honest_correction_we_will_do_better/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/nate_silver.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A post in the data-driven blog made several mistakes in its analysis", "creator": "@prachigu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/nate_silver.jpg", "title": "FiveThirtyEight issues brutally honest correction: \u201cWe will do better\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "FiveThirtyEight issues brutally honest correction: \u201cWe will do better\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, data, FiveThirtyEight, Journalism, kidnappings, Nate Silver, Nigeria, statistical analysis", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2cb\"", "article_summary": "We should not have published an animated map showing \u201ckidnappings\u201d over time, or even \u201cmedia reports of kidnappings\u201d over time.\nAs such, we should only have referred to \u201cmedia reports of kidnappings,\u201d not kidnappings.\nThe second map, showing \u201cKidnapping rate per 100,000 people, 1982-present,\u201d has the same flaw.\nThis likely accounts for at least some of the rise in media reports of kidnappings referred to in the last paragraph of the post.\nBecause we have no data on actual kidnappings, showing a time series requires normalizing the data to account for the increasing number of media reports overall."}
