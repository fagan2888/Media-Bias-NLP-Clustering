SXSW and all that. But city officials there did not take it well when a municipal employee enlivened a 45 page presentation by using a satirical map of the city to demonstrate a point about a street. Tony Plohetski reports in the Austin Statesman :\n\nThe map, which the staffer apparently downloaded from the Internet, made the rounds months ago on social media as \u201cJudgmental Austin\u201d and \u201cfeatures derogatory labels for our city,\u201d City Manager Marc Ott told the mayor and City Council in a memo late Wednesday. \u201cUsing this backdrop was completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe actual presentation and meeting sound deadly dull, in desperate need of a little humor to keep people awake:\n\nThe objectionable map was part of a meeting of the city\u2019s zoning and platting commission focused on \u201cstreet connectivity and strategic mobile initiatives,\u201d Ott\u2019s memo said. It was used to \u201cemphasize the point that a street traverses many places.\u201d\n\nBut no humor is allowed, when the targets are the \u201crich diversity\u201d groups that Austin loves to tout.\n\nHere is the map the unidentified employee used, with the street in question highlighted:\n\nAnd here is the original map, which pokes fun at the city\u2019s various neighborhoods.\n\nLet's just say that the city oficials lost their cool.\n\nHat tip: David Paulin", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/01/tolerant_austin_tx_will_not_tolerate_being_made_fun_of.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2016-01/195973_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Tolerant Austin, TX will not tolerate being made fun of"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Here is the map the unidentified employee used, with the street in question highlighted:And here is the original map, which pokes fun at the city\u2019s various neighborhoods.\nIt was used to \u201cemphasize the point that a street traverses many places.\u201dBut no humor is allowed, when the targets are the \u201crich diversity\u201d groups that Austin loves to tout.\nTony Plohetski reports in the Austin Statesman :The map, which the staffer apparently downloaded from the Internet, made the rounds months ago on social media as \u201cJudgmental Austin\u201d and \u201cfeatures derogatory labels for our city,\u201d City Manager Marc Ott told the mayor and City Council in a memo late Wednesday.\nBut city officials there did not take it well when a municipal employee enlivened a 45 page presentation by using a satirical map of the city to demonstrate a point about a street.\nLet's just say that the city oficials lost their cool."}
