Recognizing this reality, and the fact that budgets are tight, the Congressional leaders who introduced WIOA wisely focused on advancing innovation and accountability by including new provisions like the Pay for Success approach to financing social programs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPay for Success is a performance oriented approach to achieving measurable outcomes to social problems, incentivizing more efficient use of government resources by rewarding what works and linking government dollars to positive outcomes. In other words, the taxpayer doesn't pay unless and until the service provider achieves the desired and required results.\n\nAmerica Forward and the America Forward Coalition worked closely with Sens.

First, it means that at least some scarce federal dollars will be paid out only when results are achieved, ensuring that these funds go to programs that work and not to those that do not. Second, by opening eligibility to new programs not currently supported by workforce legislation, the WIOA embraces innovation by expanding support to new providers with strong track records that would otherwise be shut out of the federal system.\n\nToo often, public programs have no incentive to find the most productive providers. In many cases, they don\u2019t even measure results, making it hard to tell which providers are the most effective. By failing to track outcomes, decoupling funding from effectiveness, and prioritizing compliance with rules (and even proscribing new approaches), most government programs actually discourage innovation.\n\nIn the business world, the opposite is true. There, new value is created every day through innovation. The concept is simple: a product, service, or process is invented and tested. If it is successful, it attracts investment to take it to market, and then to expand its reach. Profits gleaned from the invention can be reinvested in research and development efforts which that will result in continuous improvement or new inventions that will displace the original. And if customers don\u2019t want the product, it goes away (unlike government programs that may stay in existence long past their useful life.)\n\nThis innovation cycle rarely operates in the public sphere. However, the new workforce legislation enables this concept to take root for the first time in our nation\u2019s publicly funded workforce development system. These kinds of provisions are essential to enabling public programs to evolve in response to the increasingly rapid changes in society and achieve greater results at a lower cost. They are especially needed when Congress takes a decade or more to update expiring programs. Now that the WIOA legislation has a good chance of passing through Congress, we hope that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was last updated when today\u2019s graduating seniors were in kindergarten, will not be far behind!\n\nSmolover is the executive director of America Forward, a public education initiative of the venture philanthropy organization New Profit Inc., and leads the America Forward Coalition of over 50 innovative organizations achieving results in education, workforce development, and poverty alleviation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Congress has not passed major workforce development legislation since 1998 despite the fact that more and more Americans are falling behind the pace of change in today\u2019s economy.", "description": "Congress has not passed major workforce development legislation since 1998 despite the fact that more and more Americans are falling behind the pace of change in today\u2019s economy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Congress has not passed major workforce development legislation since 1998 despite the fact that more and more Americans are falling behind the pace of change in today\u2019s economy.", "title": "'Pay for Success' could change the way government works", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/209332-pay-for-success-could-change-the-way-government-works", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/209332-pay-for-success-could-change-the-way-government-works", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-16T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Deborah Smolover", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T15:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Michael Bennet, Susan Brooks, Rob Portman,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/209332-pay-for-success-could-change-the-way-government-works", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Congress has not passed major workforce development legislation since 1998 despite the fact that more and more Americans are falling behind the pace of change in today\u2019s economy.", "card": "summary", "title": "'Pay for Success' could change the way government works"}, "dcterms.title": "'Pay for Success' could change the way government works"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc966a\"", "article_summary": "However, the new workforce legislation enables this concept to take root for the first time in our nation\u2019s publicly funded workforce development system.\nCongress has not passed major workforce development legislation since 1998, the year Google was incorporated, despite the fact that more and more Americans are falling behind the pace of change in today\u2019s economy.\nIn other words, the taxpayer doesn't pay unless and until the service provider achieves the desired and required results.\nToo often, public programs have no incentive to find the most productive providers.\nThese kinds of provisions are essential to enabling public programs to evolve in response to the increasingly rapid changes in society and achieve greater results at a lower cost."}
