Predominately female, nursing is the largest health care occupation, with salary differences by gender affecting about 2.5 million women, according to the researchers.\n\nTo better understand the current pay discrepancy between male and female nurses, researchers led by Muench used data from the last six quadrennial National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) for 1988-2008. This mail, electronic and web survey selected a state-based probability sample of currently licensed RNs from data provided by state boards of nursing with a sample size of more than 30,000 RNs per year and response rate of approximately 60 percent.\n\nThe NSSRN is ideally suited for analyzing gender differences in the RN workplace because of the large amount of employment information available in this survey compared to other surveys that are typically used by social scientists to study pay differences by gender.\n\nThe American Community Survey, a household survey with a 90 percent response rate, also was used to extend the time trends to 2013 and establish that unadjusted salary differences by gender were not limited to the national sample survey.\n\nBoth surveys showed that unadjusted male salaries were higher than female salaries every year by an average of approximately $10,000. Male adjusted salaries were, on average, higher by $5,148.\n\nMuench notes that the salary gap is affecting most specialty areas and positions and not improved since 1988, the earliest survey year used by the researchers. Specifically, the gap was $7,678 for ambulatory care and $3,873 for hospital settings. It occurred in all specialties except orthopedics, ranging from $3,792 for chronic care to $6,034 for cardiology. Salary differences also existed by position, ranging from $3,956 for middle management to $17,290 for nurse anesthetists.\n\nMuench said over the course of a 30-year career, female RNs will have earned about $155,000 less than male RNs using the adjusted earnings gap, $300,000 less using the unadjusted gap.\n\n\u201cGiven the large numbers of women employed in nursing, gender pay differences affect a sizable part of the population and their families,\u201d Muench said. \u201cWe hope that our results will bring awareness to this important topic, which we believe might best be addressed through both private and public efforts.\u201d\n\nThe researchers suggest that nurse employers can take important steps towards eliminating pay inequality by increasing transparency in compensation and determining if gender differences in pay exist in their organizations.\n\n\u201cIf that is the case, employers should examine whether there are legitimate reasons for paying these men more than women and take action to correct existing inequities,\u201d Muench said. \u201cBy increasing transparency of gender differences in compensation, the hiring climate may become more conducive for female nurses to negotiate with their employer for wage parity, which also may help in the closing of the gap.\u201d\n\nOther contributors to the JAMA research letter were senior author Peter Buerhaus, PhD, RN, Vanderbilt University Medical Center Department of Health Policy; and Jody Sindelar, PhD, and Susan Busch, PhD, Yale School of Public Health Department of Health Policy and Management.
