Currently, it said, some seniors work beyond the retirement age to hold onto health coverage. Without that necessity, some of them may instead drop out of the workforce.\n\nThat would be a decline in the U.S. workforce by just less than 1 percent.\n\nSome Republicans on Monday cited the report as proof that the ACA causes more harm than good.\n\n\"The CBO's latest report confirms yet another broken promise and negative consequence stemming from Obamacare,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. \"When the president's health law hurts the labor force at the same time it increases healthcare premiums and taxes, it's clear the law is not working for the American people.\"\n\nThe CBO, though, acknowledged that its estimates are partially based on unsubstantiated evidence related to the labor force.\n\nWhile Obama has relentlessly defended the ACA, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced last week that he plans to reveal a proposal next year to replace the controversial law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act will cost the U.S. economy 2 million jobs over the next decade, a congressional advisory agency said Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act will cost the U.S. economy 2 million jobs over the next decade, a congressional advisory agency said Monday.", "title": "Obama healthcare law will cost U.S. 2 million jobs by '25, government agency says", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2015/12/07/Obama-healthcare-law-will-cost-US-2-million-jobs-by-25-government-agency-says/3971449534570/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3971449534570/2015/1/30f614430491aae11dad0ed68811a65a/v2.1/Obama-healthcare-law-will-cost-US-2-million-jobs-by-25-government-agency-says.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@UPI", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3971449534570/2015/upi/30f614430491aae11dad0ed68811a65a/v2.1/Obama-healthcare-law-will-cost-US-2-million-jobs-by-25-government-agency-says.jpg?lg=4", "description": "President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act will cost the U.S. economy 2 million jobs over the next decade, a congressional advisory agency said Monday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama healthcare law will cost U.S. 2 million jobs by '25, government agency says"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Barack Obama, Orrin Hatch, Paul Ryan", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Barack Obama, Orrin Hatch, Paul Ryan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd218c\"", "article_summary": "Specifically, the CBO said there will be about 2 million fewer jobs by 2025 -- more than a decade into President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.\nAffordable Care Act, which has made health insurance available to millions of Americans, will end up costing the domestic economy 2 million jobs over the next decade, a congressional advisory agency said Monday.\n\"When the president's health law hurts the labor force at the same time it increases healthcare premiums and taxes, it's clear the law is not working for the American people.\"\n\"The ACA's health insurance subsidies will make it easier for some people to work less or stop working without losing health insurance coverage,\" the agency said.\nThe CBO, though, acknowledged that its estimates are partially based on unsubstantiated evidence related to the labor force."}
