The target sells skin, hair and beauty products with "health protective" ingredients through partners, including J.Crew and Gwyneth Paltrow's website, Goop.com

TPG Growth has made a minority investment in Beautycounter, a personal care company.

Crew and Goop.com, actress Gwyneth Paltrow's website. For more on e-commerce, see Retail Reboot: Investors Snatch Up E-Commerce Services.

Beautycounter aims to develop products with ingredients the company dubs "health protective."

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

The deal underscores rising consumer interest in better-for-you products.
