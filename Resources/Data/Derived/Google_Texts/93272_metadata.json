Nearly all of the modern world is constructed on Turing\u2019s accomplishments. He helped crack Germany\u2019s \u201cEnigma\u201d code in World War II, contributed two important proofs to mathematics, and established foundational concepts in computer science and artificial intelligence. Without him, the Allies might not have won the war, and you might not have a machine which can display this article. Turing also had consensual sexual relations with other men, and, for them, was convicted for \u201cgross indecency\u201d under an 1885 criminal law. The queen pardoned him for these on Tuesday. The pardon is written in a high royal celebratory register, which doesn\u2019t match the somber tone which the events seem to deserve. I was surprised when, in the text of the pardon, I found something that almost constituted recursion, a building block of programming.\n\nFirst, the formal document declares it intentions: \u201cto pardon and remit unto [Turing] the sentence imposed upon him.\u201d Then, it turns the document into the pardon itself, and makes the pardon a reality: \u201cAnd for so doing[,] this shall be a sufficient Warrant.\u201d The pardon executes, as a program would, and Alan Turing is forgiven. *** Renaissance English royal law insists, mystically and metaphysically, that the king has two bodies. Its theorists did so explicitly: \u201cFor the King has in him two Bodies, [namely] a Body natural, and a Body politic,\u201d writes the jurist Edmund Plowden in 1571. The king\u2019s first body, the natural one, remains a \u201cBody mortal, subject to all Infirmities that come by Nature or Accident.\u201d The body politic, meanwhile, is everlasting, \u201cconsisting of Policy and Government, and constituted for the Direction of the People.\u201d It is immutable, \u201cutterly void of Infancy, and old Age.\u201d The body politic, most importantly, \u201ccannot be seen or handled\u201d; it\u2019s invisible, passed down from reign to reign. The logic of the two bodies illuminates the cheer\u2014\u201cThe King is dead; long live the King!\u201d\u2014and it led Elizabeth I to proclaim in her ascension speech, \u201cI am but one body naturally considered, though by [God\u2019s] permission a body politic to govern.\u201d Now the queen, the second named Elizabeth, has granted a rare royal pardon, the fourth during her reign. Usually only granted to those found innocent by investigation, Turing\u2019s was extended at the request of the justice minister, Chris Grayling. Her \u201cnatural body\u201d did not even lend its signature to the declaration: It is signed by Grayling. When Turing was convicted for gross indecency, the British government forced him to choose between chemical castration and imprisonment; he chose castration, which meant taking estrogen pills. The pills made him impotent and grow breasts. They also depressed him. Turing was used to eating an apple before bed. On June 7, 1954, he ate one that had purportedly been injected with cyanide, and he died. The local coroner\u2019s office ruled his death a suicide; now, at least one expert doubts that ruling. Turing was 41.\n\nThe queen\u2019s pardon follows a years-long attempts to excuse Turing through other legal means. In 2009, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Gordon Brown, apologized to him. \u201cI am very proud to say: we\u2019re sorry,\u201d Brown wrote in the Telegraph. \u201cYou deserved so much better.\u201d Last year, on Turing\u2019s centenary, members of parliament introduced legislation to formally pardon him. It did not pass: Parliamentarians decided they could not pardon someone for a crime that person had knowingly committed, even if the government no longer considered the offending act criminal. As Brown wrote in 2009, Turing \u201cwas dealt with under the law of the time, and we can't put the clock back.\u201d (After the pardon\u2019s failure, 10,000 people promptly petitioned for Turing to be added to the \u00a310 note.) Now, Queen Elizabeth II has done what elected officials did not. The \u201croyal prerogative of mercy,\u201d the formal title for a King or Queen\u2019s pardon, is one of the central affordances of English royalty. Its language is old and pleonastic, comfortable in its somber power. That makes it all the more stomach-turning to read. \u201cNow Know Ye,\u201d it reads, \u201cthat We, in consideration of circumstances humbly represented unto Us, are Graciously pleased to extend Our Grace and Mercy unto the said Alan Mathison Turing and to grant him Our Free Pardon posthumously in respect of the said convictions.\u201d Perhaps this is standard language, but being \u201cpleased to extend Our Grace and Mercy\u201d feels inadequate in any register. Turing should be forgiven for nothing; he did nothing we\u2019d consider criminal. If any entity requires pardoning, it\u2019s the government. And yet the same government, in the body of its messenger, is pleased to excuse itself. The pardon continues, becoming more and more magically legal. There is that recursion again: \u201cAnd to pardon and remit unto him the sentence imposed upon him as aforesaid; And for so doing this shall be a sufficient Warrant.\u201d The document only has to say the pardon exists, and it becomes real. *** Addressing the question \u201cCan machines think?\u201d, Turing proposed a game. He called it \u201cthe Imitation Game,\u201d and it goes like this: A human judge corresponds in writing with two unseen parties. One of the parties is human; the other is a machine. If the hidden human successfully convinces the judge of her humanity, the human wins. If the judge can\u2019t tell which of the two is human, the machine wins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There&#39;s no command-Z for this great man&#39;s suffering.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "There&#39;s no command-Z for this great man&#39;s suffering.", "title": "Alan Turing's Body", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/2717067471_f455795edf_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/alan-turings-body/282641/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6c7\"", "article_summary": "The king\u2019s first body, the natural one, remains a \u201cBody mortal, subject to all Infirmities that come by Nature or Accident.\u201d The body politic, meanwhile, is everlasting, \u201cconsisting of Policy and Government, and constituted for the Direction of the People.\u201d It is immutable, \u201cutterly void of Infancy, and old Age.\u201d The body politic, most importantly, \u201ccannot be seen or handled\u201d; it\u2019s invisible, passed down from reign to reign.\nIts theorists did so explicitly: \u201cFor the King has in him two Bodies, [namely] a Body natural, and a Body politic,\u201d writes the jurist Edmund Plowden in 1571.\nPlease consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these waysJon Callas/Flickr On Christmas Eve, Queen Elizabeth II pardoned the computer scientist Alan Mathison Turing.\nNow, Queen Elizabeth II has done what elected officials did not.\n\u201cYou deserved so much better.\u201d Last year, on Turing\u2019s centenary, members of parliament introduced legislation to formally pardon him."}
