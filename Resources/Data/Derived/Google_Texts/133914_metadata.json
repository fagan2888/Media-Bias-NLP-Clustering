Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) continued her effort on Saturday to tank a potential 2016 presidential bid by Hillary Clinton, telling the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference that a woman should eventually be president -- but not the one many Democrats are rooting for.\n\n\"We will have a woman for president, just the right one,\" she said, adding that Republicans are the only party that had a woman on the presidential ticket this century: former Gov. Sarah Palin as the vice presidential nominee in 2008.\n\nBachmann, who ran for the Republican nomination unsuccessfully in 2012 and declined to run for reelection in Congress this year, was invited to CPAC as a guest of Jenny Beth Martin, the president and co-founder of Tea Party Patriots.\n\nShe went on to attack Clinton's work as secretary of state, including relations with Russia and the Benghazi attacks in 2012 that killed four Americans.\n\n\"She's going to have to answer a very tough question: Did she pick up the phone and call the secretary of defense and the president of the United States and demand that they send a military rescue operation into Benghazi to rescue Americans that were under fire?\" Bachmann said.\n\nThe congresswoman said previously that Americans \"aren't ready\" for a female president.\n\n\"I think there was a cachet about having an African-American president because of guilt,\" she said in February. \"People don't hold guilt for a woman.\"\n\nDuring her CPAC speech, Bachmann went on to attack President Barack Obama for Obamacare and his desire to grant so-called \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: CPAC 2014 Speakers CPAC 2014 Speakers\n\n1 of 25 Ted Cruz U.S. Senator (R-Texas) Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
