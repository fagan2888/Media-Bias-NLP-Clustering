Why on Earth should anyone believe this?\n\nFirst off, we already know that this ObamaCare number is inflated because it counts anyone who picked a plan during open enrollment, not those who actually paid their first premium.\n\nA year ago, the White House bragged that 8 million had signed up, only to admit months later that the actual enrollment number was just 6.7 million.\n\nAssuming the same rate of attrition this year, the real enrollment number will be more like 9.8 million, which is well below the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s forecast of 13 million paid enrollees for this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, enrollment in California and New York \u2014 the two biggest markets that enthusiastically embraced ObamaCare \u2014 barely increased this year, suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for this \u201cbenefit.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not likely to improve next year, when ObamaCare premiums are expected to spike across the board as government bailout money dries up, and because insurers can\u2019t wring much more savings out of narrow networks or deductibles.\n\nThose higher premiums will also exacerbate what is already a problem for ObamaCare \u2014 not enough young people are signing up.\n\nBecause the law bans insurers from charging more based on health, and strictly limits pricing based on age, the exchanges must attract sufficient numbers of young people to avoid a premium \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nBut as Jed Graham notes on IBD\u2019s Capital Hill blog, enrollment among the young is way below expectations.\n\n\u201cIf participation among young adults had matched their share of the population,\u201d Graham reports, \u201cthen 4.8 million young adults would have enrolled \u2014 but just 3.25 million selected plans.\u201d\n\nThat, too, will put upward pressure on premiums.\n\nIn any other context, ObamaCare would be deemed a failure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Reform: The Obama administration is touting the \"fact\" that nearly 12 million people either signed up or re-enrolled for ObamaCare this year.
