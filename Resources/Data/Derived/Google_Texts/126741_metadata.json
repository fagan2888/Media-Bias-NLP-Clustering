Obviously, as a Republican, this has not been an easy path to be on and has attracted failed primaries against me.\n\nThe main thrust of Planned Parenthood\u2019s bitterness toward me is that I voted for Senate Bill 268, the fetal homicide bill. According to them, \u201cyou cannot support fetal personhood and be pro-choice.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look at the facts. If passed, SB 268 would\u2019ve given prosecutors the ability to charge an attacker of a pregnant woman with murder if the woman survived the attack, but her unborn child did not. The existing gap in Colorado\u2019s criminal laws was made obvious when the Boulder district attorney was unable to charge the attacker with murder of the baby in the horrific Longmont case this spring.\n\nYet, that case is not the sole reason to seek new law. When hearing SB 268 in Judiciary Committee, we learned that pimps currently can be charged only with assault when they beat their pregnant prostitutes to kill the fetuses and get the women quickly back out on the streets. We also heard prosecutors speak of the high rate of domestic violence acts aimed directly at a woman\u2019s pregnancy and causing the death of a fetus, but escaping stronger prosecution.\n\nUnlike the Indiana case repeatedly brought up as a red herring by opponents, this bill language posed no threat of prosecution to a pregnant woman who self-aborts. SB 268 specifically exempted any act committed by the mother of an unborn child. SB 268 specifically exempted any medical procedure by a licensed provider requested by the mother, keeping abortions legal. SB 268 also specifically exempted lawful dispensation of medications such as the morning-after pill.\n\nSB 268 expressly stated that the \u201cperson\u201d status is bestowed upon the unborn child only for purposes of the criminal offenses of murder, manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and assault. That \u201cperson\u201d status is required to prosecute for homicide. Under SB 268, the limited \u201cperson\u201d status applied from conception, which is the case in most of the nearly 40 states that have fetal homicide laws. Similar federal law recognizes the crime of fetal homicide from the time of being in utero; in other words, from conception.\n\nIn their personal attacks on me, Planned Parenthood fails to mention that some pro-life groups, including Colorado Right to Life and Personhood USA, (the latter group having sponsored the trio of recent failed personhood initiatives in Colorado), opposed SB 268 because the language protected the continuation of lawful abortions. Despite this, Planned Parenthood insists on calling SB 268 a personhood measure, claiming that it\u2019s just like past ballot initiatives that have been voted down by huge margins.\n\nUnlike Planned Parenthood\u2019s assertion to the contrary, an intellectually honest legislator could vote for SB 268 and still hold to the principle that abortion in Colorado should remain legal.\n\nWhat\u2019s most disappointing to me is that we\u2019re still without a fetal homicide law. With nine years in the state legislature, I\u2019ve heard the debates and watched the politics surrounding fetal homicide bills numerous times. It\u2019s frustrated me that some in this highly charged and emotional debate repeatedly cling to their fears and their talking points, refusing to budge to address the issue at hand.\n\nThis year, some of the pro-life groups swallowed hard to support a bill that wasn\u2019t all they wanted it to be. They found philosophical room to set aside an all-or-nothing agenda and agreed that it should be a crime to kill an unborn child, without the mother\u2019s consent, even if SB 268 preserved the right to legal abortions. I wish I could say the same for Planned Parenthood and its allies, but that they couldn\u2019t find the same room wasn\u2019t a reason for me to vote no on the bill.\n\nEllen Roberts is a Republican state senator representing Senate District 6.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: In defense of vote on fetal homicide bill", "title": "Guest Commentary: In defense of vote on fetal homicide bill", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/22/guest-commentary-in-defense-of-vote-on-fetal-homicide-bill/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150522__20150525_Z00_OP26G_ROBERTSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150522__20150525_Z00_OP26G_ROBERTSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-22T16:18:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T06:39:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The main thrust of Planned Parenthood\u2019s bitterness toward me is that I voted for Senate Bill 268, the fetal homicide bill.\nSimilar federal law recognizes the crime of fetal homicide from the time of being in utero; in other words, from conception.\nWith nine years in the state legislature, I\u2019ve heard the debates and watched the politics surrounding fetal homicide bills numerous times.\nAccording to them, \u201cyou cannot support fetal personhood and be pro-choice.\u201dLet\u2019s look at the facts.\nWhat\u2019s most disappointing to me is that we\u2019re still without a fetal homicide law."}
