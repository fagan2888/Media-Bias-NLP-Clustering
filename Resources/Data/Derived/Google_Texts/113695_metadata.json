We became more and more aware that what we needed was a whole different developmental model that took into account their historical context, their geographical context, community context, family context and peer context.\u201d\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with Whitbeck's earlier work. For example, he is vehement in his defense of indigenous parenting practices. \u201cI have especially strong feelings about parenting programs. When people go out, well-meaning, good people go out onto reservations with parenting programs that are based on two-parent nuclear families that don\u2019t take into account cultural variations in family structure, particularly extended family influence, clans and that kind of thing, they\u2019re basically doing what the boarding schools did. They\u2019re going out and teaching white parenting and undermining the traditional strengths of indigenous families, which are huge.\u201d\n\nThe developmental model the researchers constructed for adolescents, explains Whitbeck, has concentric circles representing each of the developmental contexts for indigenous kids. \u201cThen we have a wedge that goes right down through those circles.\u201d The wedge represents historical cultural losses. \u201cEthnic cleansing,\u201d he says, \u201chas impacted every single developmental context that these kids are experiencing.\u201d\n\nThe model has provided the basis for creating the kind of prevention program Whitbeck was looking for. The program, explains Whitbeck, is intended to delay the onset of substance use among kids. It has been adapted for several tribes\u2014Lakota, Dakota, a couple of pueblos and one Navajo community\u2014but Whitbeck stresses that tribes will need to adapt the model and the prevention program to fit their own kids and communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to think in terms of community-wide intervention,\u201d says Whitbeck. One extremely important finding from the research is that negative, stressful life events, on which there has been a lot of focus recently as predictors of poor outcomes for kids, do not necessarily cause permanent damage.\n\n\u201cWe saw something that was totally unexpected,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you take positive life events\u2014and positive life events were defined by the kid getting community recognition, being recognized by the tribal council, recognized in school, participating in community activities\u2014they blow those negative life events out of the water! So now we\u2019re thinking that maybe there\u2019s a key there. Involving kids early in tribal community activities, recognizing them, honoring them, getting them involved in community things. I think there\u2019s a real opportunity there.\u201d\n\nCommunity is key to this work in more ways, too. Whitbeck describes the eagerness with which adult study participants (researchers interviewed family and caretakers as well as the kids) embraced communal activities that were part of the research.\n\nAnd it was the tribal communities themselves that helped develop and oversaw the study. \u201cWe started out with the partnership model where they approved first of all us being here. There was great support for the study. The tribal councils appointed advisory boards on each of the reservations and reserves. They literally approved every word of the questionnaire.\n\n\u201cWe also developed through the elders, service providers and our advisory boards a concept of major historical loss, which is a different kind of approach to historical trauma. With this concept we use a measure of stress caused by repeated thoughts of historical losses suffered and then see how that impinges on everyday functioning and mental health,\u201d explains Whitbeck.\n\nAnd much of the research\u2014leading focus groups with elders, parents, relatives and the kids themselves, for example\u2014was carried out by American Indians, among them Melissa Walls, Bois Forte and Couchiching First Nation Ojibwe, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, who led the focus groups on parenting, which addressed questions such as, \u201cHow does the act of taking care of a little one from birth to even through adulthood look unique or similar to what we see in non-Native populations?\u201d\n\nSeveral scholarly papers have come out of the research. But the book is different. \u201cWe write these very technical articles that involve very sophisticated statistical analyses and approaches. Our tribal advisory boards read the articles that we were putting in the book. And they came back to us and they said, \u2018You know, Les, can you write in English?\u2019\u201d So the researchers wrote the book for a lay audience so the information would be accessible and useful to service people, tribal leaders and educators.\n\nThen they went out and bought dozens of copies to give to the tribes that participated in the study because the price of the book is so high. \u201cThe worst ethical thing you can do is take people\u2019s lives and sell it back to them,\u201d says Whitbeck. He\u2019s hoping to convince the publisher to put out a paperback edition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Working closely with four American Indian tribes and four Canadian First Nations, Les Whitbeck has developed a model of adolescent development.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/making-natives-copy-white-parents-destroys-indigenous-families-155590", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/les-whitbeck.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Making Natives Copy White Parents Destroys Indigenous Families"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-07T09:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Making Natives Copy White Parents Destroys Indigenous Families"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/making-natives-copy-white-parents-destroys-indigenous-families-155590", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American youth, Parenting, University of Nebraska, Historical Trauma, Tanya H.
