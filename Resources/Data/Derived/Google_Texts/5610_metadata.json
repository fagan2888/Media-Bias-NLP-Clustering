She along with a staff of volunteers spent Wednesday helping prepare and file 2015 federal income taxes for residents.\n\nLandreth said the AARP has been providing the service to her district for well over two decades. The Central Texas district includes Temple, Harker Heights, Killeen, Copperas Cove, Lampasas, Burnet and Marble Falls. The AARP Tax-Aide volunteers are making their rounds throughout the area in the weeks leading up to the April 15 tax deadline.\n\nIn Copperas Cove, AARP will be at the library every Wednesday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m., with those seeking tax preparation assistance receiving help on a first-come, first-served basis. AARP tax aide volunteers are all IRS-certified, Landreth said.\n\nBut what some might not know is that this tax assistance isn\u2019t limited to AARP members or senior citizens.\n\n\u201cWe will prepare taxes for anyone, not just senior citizens,\u201d Landreth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had families come in. The only taxes we don\u2019t prepare is for military.\u201d She explained that on post, there are services for military families to file their taxes, but AARP wants to help fill in the gaps for those who don\u2019t have access or funds for tax preparation assistance.\n\nLandreth said before people come, they should make sure they bring everything they need along with them\u2014Social Security numbers, photo identification, any W-2s, bank interest statements, as well as Affordable Care Act information.\n\nThose who arrived for help with tax preparation checked in at the table and were given a form to complete, which helps the Tax-Aide volunteer when completing the online tax forms. When a tax return is completed, it is also doubled-checked by another certified tax preparer before it is transmitted. Those who electronically file their returns on site will also receive a printed paper copy of their completed return.\n\n\u201cSome of the older filers don\u2019t have to file because they\u2019re on Social Security and their income level is low enough not to, but they feel better about filing anyway, Landreth said.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But what some might not know is that this tax assistance isn\u2019t limited to AARP members or senior citizens.\nThe AARP Tax-Aide volunteers are making their rounds throughout the area in the weeks leading up to the April 15 tax deadline.\nIn Copperas Cove, AARP will be at the library every Wednesday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m., with those seeking tax preparation assistance receiving help on a first-come, first-served basis.\nAARP tax aide volunteers are all IRS-certified, Landreth said.\n\u201cWe will prepare taxes for anyone, not just senior citizens,\u201d Landreth said."}
