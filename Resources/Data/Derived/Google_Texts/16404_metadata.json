That\u2019s $1,160 a month and $13,920 a year, again without taxes deducted.\n\nFamilies USA reported the new 2014 federal poverty line for the 48 contiguous United States as $11,670 a year. So technically, one person working full-time at a minimum-wage job is above poverty level in the U.S.\n\nBut let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s cutting it awfully close. For a single parent with a child, it\u2019s just not enough anymore \u2014 and apparently, members of Congress are finally beginning to see it, too.\n\nYet in spite of the legislative branch\u2019s recent epiphany, the only thing worse than their government shutdown issues in the last six months is their timing.\n\nThose employed under the federal minimum wage of $7.25, understandably, have the desire to raise that wage immediately, but with a large \u2014 and expensive \u2014 health care act still being worked out, now couldn\u2019t be a worse time.\n\nThe Huffington Post showed CNBC\u2019s Dan Mangan\u2019s report in 2013 that expressed the startling finds by a Gallup poll commissioned by employment law firm Littler Mendelson.\n\nIt found that as a direct result of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, nearly 41 percent of the businesses polled had frozen hiring completely, with one-fifth of those same businesses having reduced the number of employees they had as a \u201cspecific result of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBusinesses have already been hit hard with being forced to provide health care to their employees. Ethics aside, now that employers have to fork out extra to stay in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, they aren\u2019t going to want to fork out even more to pay a new $10 minimum wage.\n\nThe arguments of what an employer should be required to provide for his or her employees is a heated one, including contraception \u2014 just look at the federal court decision in Chicago concerning Notre Dame\u2019s health care and birth control \u2014 that hasn\u2019t died down yet, and a lot of people aren\u2019t under the new health care coverage rules.\n\nCNN Money reported that the Congressional Budget Office estimates anywhere from 500,000 or fewer jobs lost to maybe just more than a million.\n\nIf it stays at 500,000 jobs lost, that\u2019s only a \u201c0.3 percent decrease in employment.\u201d But that still hurts families, especially the members that are minimum-wage earners, who aren\u2019t always just teenagers and the unskilled.\n\nLast year, The Wall Street Journal reported about 284,000 Americans with college degrees were working minimum-wage jobs.\n\nA report from the National Employment Law Project reported that three-fifths of the middle-income jobs lost were replaced with \u201clow-wage work.\u201d The job market has changed, making it difficult to look at since a lot of the open jobs are in the low paying sector \u2014 not to mention, it hurts more in a recession.\n\nThe Denver Post reported one of America\u2019s foremost \u201cprivately-held economic research facilities,\u201d the Institute for Trend Research, as predicting another recession this year. The company has had a well-developing reputation since 1948 for \u201cmaking accurate calls on the business cycle.\u201d\n\nTherefore, ITR\u2019s prediction for another recession in 2014 is nothing to scoff at and set aside with any printed-out articles of the latest grassy-knoll theory.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, The Denver Post included ITR economist Alan Beaulieu\u2019s thoughts on the effect of health care reform on the economy, including the recession as a result, saying that \u201cthe added costs associated with health-care reforms will cause employers to cut hours this year and next, reducing incomes.\u201d\n\nIn the end, with the Affordable Care Act and a recession predicted for the near future, our economic instability is not something to bombard with further changes.\n\nWe need to work through each major change at a time, and when the time is right and our economy is more stable, we can up the minimum wage and really change some people\u2019s lives.\n\nOpinion columnist Rachel Lee is an English sophomore and may be reached at [email protected]\n\nIncreased minimum wage should be the decision of the business, not a national mandate\n\nThe hot topic that has politicians and economists buzzing is whether the federal government should raise minimum wage to $9 from $7.25 an hour. The last time minimum wage was raised was on July 24, 2009. At the 2014 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama said raising the minimum wage could be the step that could benefit millions of working families.\n\nObama\u2019s message to help reduce poverty has been misconstrued. The decision to seek a raise in minimum wage comes with good intentions, but this may not reduce poverty in America.\n\nFor decades, many labor economists and business executives have held the view that forcing companies to increase pay will lead them to hire fewer employees. Sure, employees will get a higher wage, but companies might have to lay off another employee because of limited resources.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Republicans are saying an increase in minimum wage could translate to a decrease of jobs. If the price of employment is raised, there will be fewer jobs to go around because all firms have to budget for the influx of current employees. Even then, economists are also split on whether the minimum wage should be raised.\n\n\u201cRaising minimum won\u2019t kill jobs; it will kill job vacancies,\u201d said Michael Reich, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nAccording the LA Times, the case against a higher minimum wage is that it makes it more expensive for firms to hire workers. In turn, the people who get to stay employed will earn more, while those who lose their jobs and fail to get new ones will suffer.\n\nThe general consensus seems to be that raising the minimum wage will hurt employment among teenagers and restaurant workers \u2014 the people whom the decision would impact the most.\n\nWorkers who earn minimum wage tend to be younger and largely unskilled. For these inexperienced workers, an increase would make it more difficult to find a job because these businesses would have to eliminate available openings or choose to hire someone more experienced.\n\nIndividual states have increased their minimum wage laws, and I think that\u2019s a better response to fit each job market and the demand.\n\nCompanies such as Whole Foods, Costco or Gap Inc. \u2014 which also operates Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta \u2014 have raised their minimum pay to at least $10 per hour. It\u2019s a decision that can be made because these companies can afford to.\n\nGap Inc. had discussed raising wages for a period of time, and the decision was unrelated to the nationwide minimum wage debate, said Old Navy vice president Lynn Albright.\n\nThese companies believe higher wages will be more profitable to them because it will minimize employee turnover and maximize employee productivity, commitment and loyalty, said Costco CEO Craig Jelinek.\n\n\n\nThis was a decision these companies made on their own and not because of federal law. If Obama wants to help the poor, I don\u2019t think this could be an effective long-term solution.\n\nRather than increasing minimum wage, start by cutting back on the costly regulations that prevent job creators and limit the job market. The move toward a higher wage looks unlikely to progress and pass. The wage increase might bring 900,000 out of poverty but would in turn take away 500,000 jobs.\n\nThe minimum wage should not be increased \u2014 at least not until there\u2019s a hike in the cost of living, which I don\u2019t see happening for about another decade.\n\nOpinion columnist Gemrick Curtom is a public relations junior and may be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cougar", "description": "The economy is not stable enough to handle minimum wage increase, recession in near future Working at the minimum federal wage of $7.25 an hour for 40 hours a week results in $290 a week, without taxes.
