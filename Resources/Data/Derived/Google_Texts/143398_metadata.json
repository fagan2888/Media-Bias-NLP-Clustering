ACA\u2019s underlying elements \u2014 Medicaid expansion and reform \u2014 are under close examination.\n\nDerek Bang, CPA, CGMA, Chief Innovation Officer and Leader Of Healthcare Performance Consulting at Crowe Horwath LLP, spoke with RevCycleIntelligence.com about direction of the healthcare revenue cycle regarding payer demographic shifts and what happens when hospitals sacrifice their reimbursements in an attempt to generate increased revenue.\n\nBang says providers can effectively adapt dynamic benchmarking solutions to properly assess performance and ROI of tools used to assist in collection and uninsured conversion to coverage. \u201cWe are collecting daily transaction-level data from hundreds of hospitals that allows for \u2018pure\u2019 calculation of performance metrics and in near-real time (versus periodic surveys of hospitals or asking them to self-report data),\u201d he reveals.\n\nAs revenue cycle\u2019s structure continues to change, the need to better understand its performance is rapidly increasing. Bang says this loud demand is being actively addressed.\n\n\u201cThe response from health systems wanting to participate in our initiative has been phenomenal, so there seems to be a real belief and desire for more precise analytics around revenue cycle performance, and the timeliness of the data is very important, given how quickly the landscape is changing,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe report we have just released is merely a snippet of the data that we now have access to for benchmarking performance.\u201d\n\nSuch analysis comes at a critical time. Hospitals are sacrificing their reimbursements in an attempt to receive more revenue. The focus of revenue cycle and medical reimbursement is shifting.\n\n\u201cConsumer-driven healthcare is a very significant trend, given the growing prevalence of high-deductible health plans noted in our report, along with an increasing focus by the payers on value-based reimbursement models,\u201d Bang maintains. \u201cCompetitive and transparent pricing of services, high quality clinical outcomes, and effective billing and collection process are becoming more important than ever.\u201d\n\nThe payer base has shifted amid market changes. Perspectives require adjusting. This directly affects long term revenue cycle, Bang claims.\n\n\u201cThere are several important impacts driven by the shift in payer mix,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe front-end of the revenue cycle must be diligent with determining Medicaid eligibility and assist uninsured patients understand their coverage options with the insurance exchanges. There must be greater focus on point-of-service cash collections, given the growing amount of patient responsibility for payment. Lastly, communication and coordination between revenue cycle teams and clinical areas to properly support and document outcomes, respond to denied claims, etc. will continue to be a challenge.\u201d\n\nThe primary reason a state chooses to consider Medicaid expansion, especially in regard to those who most recently implemented expansion, is driven by a variety of factors.\n\n\u201cMost Republican states have taken the view that traditional Medicaid programs are fiscally unsustainable and have not supported expansion,\u201d Bang observes. \u201cMost recently, Indiana (Republican leadership) has agreed to expand Medicaid through the Healthy Indiana Plan (after getting clearance from CMS), which is a non-traditional Medicaid program that requires some patient payment responsibility and other factors that may better control the long-term fiscal impact on the state.\u201d\n\nThe future implications of claim management mean an outpouring of problematic outcomes requiring fresh resolution, says Bang.\n\n\u201cClaim management will likely only become more complex, due to several factors: difficulty in verifying coverage and determining the responsible party (patient, insurance, Medicaid, etc.) for portions of claims, managing a high amount of uncompensated care from high-deductible health plan members, responding to a higher volume of claim denials from a larger population of insured claims, and the need to support value-based reimbursement determinations,\u201d he states.\n\nAccording to the Crowe Horwath benchmarking analysis, 18 percent of high-deductible health plans are employer-sponsored. Bang expects this number to increase in 2015.\n\n\u201cMany employers are having to move to high-deductible health plans from preferred provider organizations or other products to avoid being penalized in future years by the \u2018Cadillac plan\u2019 tax under the Affordable Care Act (in addition to the potential economic benefits of lower benefit costs/smaller annual premium increases to employees),\u201d Bang adds.\n\nCrowe Horwath\u2019s data shows contrasting financial indicators between Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states.\n\nIt additionally reports net revenue per case in Medicaid expansion states has increased more substantially than in non-expansion states because of the conversion from self-pay to Medicaid.\n\nAlthough there was a 10.8 percent increase and a 2.2 percent increase, respectively, Bang says it may be too early at this time to effectively define what such information implies.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that pent up demand for services from newly-eligible Medicaid patients could account for the increase in 2014 but may not necessarily continue, but that is speculation at this point,\u201d he notes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Providers continue to evaluate healthcare revenue cycle and volume in relation to ACA.
