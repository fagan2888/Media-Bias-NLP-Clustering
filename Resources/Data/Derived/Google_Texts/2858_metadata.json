George Pataki is thanking Twitter for its leadership.\n\nICYMI, the three-term Republican has launched a new feed, @GovernorPataki, just in time for election season.\n\nPataki dedicated most of his early tweets on the (unverified, as yet) account to his time on the stump for GOP candidates in New Hampshire.\n\nHe also posted a photo of himself appearing at an event for \"my good friend John Cahill,\" the former aide who's challenging incumbent Democratic state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.\n\nLet me just say a rep confirmed the account's real.\n\nSince leaving office as of 2006, Pataki -- who's been variously talked up as a potential presidential contender and/or cabinet pick in a Republican administration -- has remained active on the political scene in a variety of ways.\n\nAmong them: He ran Revere America, a PAC dedicated to ending Obamacare, lent his name to the Pataki Center to promote New York students' study of government, and hit the airwaves for the 2013 mayoral run of his longtime supporter, John Catsimatidis.\n\nPataki's Twitter bio boils him down as a \"3-Term Governor of NY, Husband, Father, Proud Military Dad. Conservative w/ a passion for people, policy & getting this nation back on track. God Bless America.\"\n\nIt also gives a link to georgepataki.com, which, as of publication time, I couldn't get to work.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1990549.1414533138!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pataki-twitter.jpg", "description": "Pataki dedicated most of his early tweets on the (unverified, as yet) account to his time on the stump for GOP candidates in New Hampshire.", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Pataki dedicated most of his early tweets on the (unverified, as yet) account to his time on the stump for GOP candidates in New Hampshire.", "title": "Just in time for Election 2014, it's... @GovernorPataki", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/time-election-2014-governorpataki-blog-entry-1.1990535", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1990549.1414533138!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pataki-twitter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pataki dedicated most of his early tweets on the (unverified, as yet) account to his time on the stump for GOP candidates in New Hampshire.", "title": "Just in time for Election 2014, it's... @GovernorPataki", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/time-election-2014-governorpataki-blog-entry-1.1990535", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1990549.1414533138!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pataki-twitter.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-28T18:14:14-0400", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.title": "Just in time for Election 2014, it's... @GovernorPataki", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "nydn_section": "dailypolitics", "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Pataki dedicated most of his early tweets on the (unverified, as yet) account to his time on the stump for GOP candidates in New Hampshire.", "viewport": "width=1070, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "ICYMI, the three-term Republican has launched a new feed, @GovernorPataki, just in time for election season.\nPataki dedicated most of his early tweets on the (unverified, as yet) account to his time on the stump for GOP candidates in New Hampshire.\nIt also gives a link to georgepataki.com, which, as of publication time, I couldn't get to work.\nGeorge Pataki is thanking Twitter for its leadership.\nPataki's Twitter bio boils him down as a \"3-Term Governor of NY, Husband, Father, Proud Military Dad."}
