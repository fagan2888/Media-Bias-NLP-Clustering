While U.S. housing prices increased impressively to start 2016, the gains were largely felt in just a dozen states. Home values rose 6.9 percent in January compared with a year ago, and were up 1.3 percent compared to December, according to CoreLogic’s most recent report.

The year-over-year increase exceeded 2015’s average and was the largest gain since August, when prices rose 7 percent from the year before.

The news comes a day after a report showed that pending home sales for January slipped 2.5 percent from December, but remained 1.4 percent higher than in January 2015. The National Association of Realtors attributed the slowdown mostly to higher prices and tight inventory.

“While January’s blizzard possibly caused some of the pullback in the Northeast, the recent acceleration in home prices and minimal inventory throughout the country appears to be the primary obstacle holding back would-be buyers,” said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement. “Additionally, some buyers could be waiting for a hike in listings come springtime.”

Taking a closer look at CoreLogic’s report, there were only 12 states that recorded price increases that outpaced the national average. Home values in the remaining 38 states and the District of Columbia missed the average, with Louisiana and Mississippi posting declines, at 1.1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.
