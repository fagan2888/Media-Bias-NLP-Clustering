The latest in a long line of Obamacare missteps is an embarrassing administration mistake that the taxpayers will end up paying for, Rep. Diane Black (R-TN) argued Friday.

“From a faulty website, to staggering cost estimates, to more Administration-led delays, the hits just keep coming under Obamacare. Now, the White House tells us in a classic Friday news dump that nearly one million Americans could see their tax refunds delayed because of this President’s inability to implement his own law,” Black, a former nurse, said.

Friday, the Obama administration revealed it sent some 800,000 Obamacare users the wrong tax information, a glitch that will cause delays in their tax refund.

“This is beyond embarrassing for President Obama and is an unfair blow to taxpayers who are once again left holding the bag for this Administration’s incompetence,” Black said.

“Moreover, it is yet another example of why the House voted earlier this month with my support to repeal this disastrous law once and for all,” she added.

According to Black, the law is “so complex, so confusing, and so costly that even [Obama administration members] don’t know how to properly administer it.”
