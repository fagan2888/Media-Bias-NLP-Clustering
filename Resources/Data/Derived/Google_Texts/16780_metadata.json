Then we noted environmentalists who said they would not criticize or attack lawmakers who supported the Keystone Pipeline, as long as they were Democrats.\n\nLast week, we expanded the discussion to progressives\u2019 wide-ranging willingness to contradict their own professed principles: gun-control proponents who travel with armed bodyguards, voucher opponents who send their kids to private schools, and minimum-wage-hike advocates who pay their staff less than the minimum wage, among others.\n\nSo what do progressives really want? If, as I suspect, the currency of progressivism isn\u2019t policies or results, but emotions, what does that approach build? What kind of a country do you get when political leaders are driven by a desire to feel that they are more enlightened, noble, tolerant, wise, sensitive, conscious, and smart than most other people?\n\nThe evidence before us suggests progressives\u2019 ideal society would be one where they enjoy great power to regulate the lives of others and impose restrictions and limitations they themselves would never accept in their own lives. Very few people object to an aristocracy with special rights and privileges as long as they\u2019re in it.\n\nFor example, a key provision of Obamacare is a tax on \u201cCadillac health-care plans\u201d \u2014 the architects of the legislation having concluded that part of the problem with America\u2019s health-care system is that some employers are just too generous with their employees\u2019 health insurance. Plans worth more than $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for families face a 40 percent excise tax starting in 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress \u2014 at least the ones not covered by their spouse\u2019s plans, as quite a few of them are \u2014 purchase their insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which offers about 300 different plans. On average, the government pays 72 percent of the premiums for its workers, according to FactCheck.org \u2014 a setup that has been characterized as, if not quite a \u201cCadillac\u201d plan, then \u201cthe best Buick on the block.\u201d The New York Times noted that, even though they are now required to purchase insurance through an exchange, lawmakers have \u201ca larger menu of \u2018gold plan\u2019 insurance choices than most of their constituents have back home\u201d and have an easier time navigating the exchange, with special \u201cconcierge\u201d services provided by insurers. And the Times noted that members of Congress can receive care from the attending physician to Congress, conveniently located in the U.S. Capitol, for an annual fee of $576.\n\nThus, lawmakers who could rest assured they would see little change to their own plans enacted massive, complicated, headache-inducing changes to the nation\u2019s system of health-insurance plans.\n\nFor what it is worth, the president signed up symbolically:\n\nObama, who is on vacation in Hawaii, had a staffer do the heavy lifting for him, a White House official says. He had to be enrolled in person, in no small part because his personal information is not readily available in the variety of government databases HealthCare.gov uses to verify identities. \u201cThe act of the president signing up for insurance coverage through the DC exchange is symbolic since the president\u2019s health care will continue to be provided by the military,\u201d the official added.\n\nObviously, President Obama is unlikely to ever argue with an insurance company over his family\u2019s care; former presidents and their spouses are entitled to medical treatment in military hospitals, paying at rates set by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThen there is progressives\u2019 appetite for special exemptions for energy use. On the campaign trail in 2008, then-senator Obama envisioned a not-too-distant future in which every American would embrace personal sacrifices in the name of combatting climate change: \u201cWe can\u2019t drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times . . . and then just expect that other countries are going to say \u2018okay.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis bold statement was hypocritical in a general sense, as almost all Washington lawmakers spend perhaps 90 percent of their lives in climate-controlled bubbles \u2014 awakening in a nice air-conditioned or heated home, then driving (or being driven) in an air-conditioned or heated car to work in an air-conditioned or heated workplace. (Quite a few lawmakers travel in SUVs and eat as much as they want, too.) But then there\u2019s the personal hypocrisy, as relayed by the New York Times:\n\nObama, who hates the cold, had cranked up the thermostat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s from Hawaii, O.K.?\u201d said Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser, David Axelrod, who occupies the small but strategically located office next door to his boss. \u201cHe likes it warm. You could grow orchids in there.\u201d\n\nProgressives in the private sector also conclude that any amount of carbon emissions are okay, as long as you\u2019re emitting them in the name of reducing carbon emissions: \u201cWhile touting green technology, and lobbying the federal government on environmental policy, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt have put 3.4 million miles on their private jets in recent years, polluting the atmosphere with 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide,\u201d the Blaze reported.\n\nThe progressive aristocracy is comfortable with our ever-more-complicated tax code because they can afford accountants to sort through it all, and compliance with the law is, at least for them, effectively optional. Recent years have demonstrated that if a prominent progressive breaks the law and fails to pay required taxes, the consequences are minimal.\n\nIn early 2009, new Treasury secretary Tim Geithner testified before Representative Charlie Rangel\u2019s Ways and Means Committee \u2014 promising that the Obama administration intended to propose \u201ca series of legislative and enforcement measures to reduce . . . tax evasion and avoidance.\u201d Geithner failed to pay about $40,000 in taxes he owed while working for the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2004; Rangel was under investigation for tax evasion and failing to report income, for which he was eventually officially censured by Congress. Still, Geithner\u2019s unpaid taxes were small potatoes compared with the $128,000 owed by former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, or the $287,273 in back taxes owed by Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Or the $2.6 million Al Sharpton owed the IRS.\n\nIn the progressive mindset, laws are primarily designed to regulate and manage the actions of other people. Last month in the Daily Beast, columnist Jamelle Bouie (who is now writing for Slate) argued that allegations of illegal secret donations to the election campaign of Washington, D.C., mayor Vincent Gray didn\u2019t really matter because he deemed Gray a good enough mayor:\n\nAs a D.C. resident, I don\u2019t care that Gray funded a shadow campaign and violated campaign finance laws. It would be different if Gray\u2019s activities were in service of his personal pocketbook \u2014 if he were funneling funds to a bank account, and not his campaign\u2019s coffers. (Though, it is true that Thompson gave $10,000 to a \u201cclose family member\u201d of Gray\u2019s to settle debts with campaign workers, as well as $40,000 to a \u201cclose personal friend\u201d of the mayor\u2019s.) But this \u2014 illegal cash to fund a campaign \u2014 seems more benign; the \u201chonest graft\u201d of George Washington Plunkitt. . . . I\u2019m inclined to cut Gray a little slack. If Gray took money from Thompson, then it was to win an election and lead a city. And, as mayor of D.C., Gray has had a solid tenure, with lower crime and greater growth. Gray may be corrupt, but if it\u2019s helped him build coalitions and utilize power then \u2013 looking at the full picture of municipal politics \u2013 that might be a good thing.\n\nProgressives are increasingly open about the fact that their elected leaders can take actions that they would find scandalous and criminal if taken by their opponents. The Obama administration did not feel the need for any explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones until administration officials realized the president might not win a second term; they quickly formulated limitations and procedures to be implemented in case Romney won. Once Obama won reelection, the effort \u201clost some urgency,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nPut even more bluntly elsewhere in the Times:\n\nSome liberals acknowledged in recent days that they were willing to accept policies they once would have deplored as long as they were in Mr. Obama\u2019s hands, not Mr. Bush\u2019s. \u201cWe trust the president,\u201d former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan said on Current TV. \u201cAnd if this was Bush, I think that we would all be more up in arms because we wouldn\u2019t trust that he would strike in a very targeted way and try to minimize damage rather than contain collateral damage.\u201d\n\nApparently a progressive president is incapable of abusing the power of drone strikes.\n\nMembers of the aristocracy are even effectively exempt from gun laws. Recently a District of Columbia judge found a man guilty of \u201cattempted possession of unlawful ammunition\u201d for owning antique replica muzzleloader bullets. The man had no previous criminal charges. A few years ago, the attorney general for D.C. declined to prosecute NBC\u2019s David Gregory for breaking the law against possessing a \u201chigh-capacity magazine\u201d despite, in the prosecutor\u2019s words, \u201cthe clarity of the violation of this important law.\u201d Gregory held up the magazine during Meet the Press. The attorney general said prosecuting Gregory was not in the interest of public safety; it is unclear why the prosecution of a man in possession of antique replica muzzleloader bullets is in the interest of public safety.\n\nFinally, progressives would happily accept a society where the choices of the lower classes about what food to eat was limited for their own good, while the special caste could continue to eat whatever they want. Thus we see former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg attempt to ban Slurpees (570 calories) and large Diet Cokes (zero or negligible calories) \u2014 beverage choices of the working class \u2014 but the law\u2019s exemption for milk-based beverages means it wouldn\u2019t hit the venti java chip Frappuccino from Starbucks (580 calories), the milkshake-in-disguise selection that\u2019s more popular among the usually progressive-minded Manhattan Yuppies. Bloomberg\u2019s large soda ban was struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nBloomberg himself has notoriously bad eating habits:\n\nHe dumps salt on almost everything, even saltine crackers. He devours burnt bacon and peanut butter sandwiches. He has a weakness for hot dogs, cheeseburgers, and fried chicken, washing them down with a glass of merlot. And his snack of choice? Cheez-Its. . . . An examination of what enters the mayoral mouth reveals that Mr. Bloomberg is an omnivore with his own glaring indulgences, many of them at odds with his own policies. And he struggles mightily to restrain his appetite. . . . Mr. Bloomberg, 67, likes his popcorn so salty that it burns others\u2019 lips. (At Gracie Mansion, the cooks deliver it to him with a salt shaker.) He sprinkles so much salt on his morning bagel \u201cthat it\u2019s like a pretzel,\u201d said the manager at Viand, a Greek diner near Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s Upper East Side town house. Not even pizza is spared a coat of sodium. When the mayor sat down to eat a slice at Denino\u2019s Pizzeria Tavern on Staten Island recently, this reporter spotted him applying six dashes of salt to it.\n\nBloomberg similarly sought a law requiring New Yorkers to separate their food scraps for composting; we all know the astronomical odds against the billionaire former mayor ever willingly personally partaking of the task of separating coffee grounds and the stuff growing hair in the Tupperware in the back of the refrigerator from the rest of his trash.\n\nProgressive leaders want us to obey them, but not emulate them.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot on NRO.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "The Progressive Aristocracy", "sailthru.author": "Jim Geraghty", "description": "In recent weeks, we examined the Obama administration\u2019s willingness to reverse positions that it had once proudly proclaimed \u2014 on whether an individual mandate is necessary, whether the individual mandate is a tax, whether it is important that you can keep your plan or doctor, whether lobbyists should work in a president\u2019s administration, whether a donor should be appointed U.S. ambassador, and so on.

Recent years have demonstrated that if a prominent progressive breaks the law and fails to pay required taxes, the consequences are minimal.\n\nIn early 2009, new Treasury secretary Tim Geithner testified before Representative Charlie Rangel\u2019s Ways and Means Committee \u2014 promising that the Obama administration intended to propose \u201ca series of legislative and enforcement measures to reduce\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0tax evasion and avoidance.\u201d Geithner failed to pay about $40,000 in taxes he owed while working for the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2004; Rangel was under investigation for tax evasion and failing to report income, for which he was eventually officially censured by Congress. Still, Geithner\u2019s unpaid taxes were small potatoes compared with the $128,000 owed by former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, or the $287,273 in back taxes owed by Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. Or the $2.6 million Al Sharpton owed the IRS.#ad#\n\nIn the progressive mindset, laws are primarily designed to regulate and manage the actions of other people. Last month in the Daily Beast, columnist Jamelle Bouie (who is now writing for Slate) argued that allegations of illegal secret donations to the election campaign of Washington, D.C., mayor Vincent Gray didn\u2019t really matter because he deemed Gray a good enough mayor:\n\n\nAs a D.C. resident, I don\u2019t care that Gray funded a shadow campaign and violated campaign finance laws. It would be different if Gray\u2019s activities were in service of his personal pocketbook \u2014 if he were funneling funds to a bank account, and not his campaign\u2019s coffers. (Though, it is true that Thompson gave $10,000 to a \u201cclose family member\u201d of Gray\u2019s to settle debts with campaign workers, as well as $40,000 to a \u201cclose personal friend\u201d of the mayor\u2019s.) But this \u2014 illegal cash to fund a campaign \u2014 seems more benign; the \u201chonest graft\u201d of George Washington Plunkitt. . . .\n\nI\u2019m inclined to cut Gray a little slack. If Gray took money from Thompson, then it was to win an election and lead a city. And, as mayor of D.C., Gray has had a solid tenure, with lower crime and greater growth. Gray may be corrupt, but if it\u2019s helped him build coalitions and utilize power then \u2013\u00a0looking at the full picture of municipal politics \u2013\u00a0that might be a good thing.\n\n\nProgressives are increasingly open about the fact that their elected leaders can take actions that they would find scandalous and criminal if taken by their opponents. The Obama administration did not feel the need for any explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones until administration officials realized the president might not win a second term; they quickly formulated limitations and procedures to be implemented in case Romney won. Once Obama won reelection, the effort \u201clost some urgency,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nPut even more bluntly elsewhere in the Times:\n\n\nSome liberals acknowledged in recent days that they were willing to accept policies they once would have deplored as long as they were in Mr. Obama\u2019s hands, not Mr. Bush\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe trust the president,\u201d former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan said on Current TV. \u201cAnd if this was Bush, I think that we would all be more up in arms because we wouldn\u2019t trust that he would strike in a very targeted way and try to minimize damage rather than contain collateral damage.\u201d\n\n\nApparently a progressive president is incapable of abusing the power of drone strikes.\n\nMembers of the aristocracy are even effectively exempt from gun laws. Recently a District of Columbia judge found a man guilty of \u201cattempted possession of unlawful ammunition\u201d for owning antique replica muzzleloader bullets. The man had no previous criminal charges. A few years ago,\u00a0the attorney general for D.C. declined to prosecute NBC\u2019s David Gregory for breaking the law against possessing a \u201chigh-capacity magazine\u201d despite, in the prosecutor\u2019s words, \u201cthe clarity of the violation of this important law.\u201d Gregory held up the magazine during Meet the Press. The attorney general said prosecuting Gregory was not in the interest of public safety; it is unclear why the prosecution of a man in possession of antique replica muzzleloader bullets is in the interest of public safety.\n\nFinally, progressives would happily accept a society where the choices of the lower classes about what food to eat was limited for their own good, while the special caste could continue to eat whatever they want. Thus we see former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg attempt to ban Slurpees (570 calories) and large Diet Cokes (zero or negligible calories) \u2014 beverage choices of the working class \u2014 but the law\u2019s exemption for milk-based beverages means it wouldn\u2019t hit the venti java chip Frappuccino from Starbucks (580 calories), the milkshake-in-disguise selection that\u2019s more popular among the usually progressive-minded Manhattan Yuppies. Bloomberg\u2019s large soda ban was struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nBloomberg himself has notoriously bad eating habits:\n\n\nHe dumps salt on almost everything, even saltine crackers. He devours burnt bacon and peanut butter sandwiches. He has a weakness for hot dogs, cheeseburgers, and fried chicken, washing them down with a glass of merlot.\n\nAnd his snack of choice? Cheez-Its.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\nAn examination of what enters the mayoral mouth reveals that Mr. Bloomberg is an omnivore with his own glaring indulgences, many of them at odds with his own policies. And he struggles mightily to restrain his appetite.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\nMr. Bloomberg, 67, likes his popcorn so salty that it burns others\u2019 lips. (At Gracie Mansion, the cooks deliver it to him with a salt shaker.) He sprinkles so much salt on his morning bagel \u201cthat it\u2019s like a pretzel,\u201d said the manager at Viand, a Greek diner near Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s Upper East Side town house.\n\nNot even pizza is spared a coat of sodium. When the mayor sat down to eat a slice at Denino\u2019s Pizzeria Tavern on Staten Island recently, this reporter spotted him applying six dashes of salt to it.\n\n\nBloomberg similarly sought a law requiring New Yorkers to separate their food scraps for composting; we all know the astronomical odds against the billionaire former mayor ever willingly personally partaking of the task of separating coffee grounds and the stuff growing hair in the Tupperware in the back of the refrigerator from the rest of his trash.\n\nProgressive leaders want us to obey them, but not emulate them.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot on NRO.", "title": "The Progressive Aristocracy", "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/374779/progressive-aristocracy-jim-geraghty", "image": "http://c8.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_related_040214_A.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/374779/progressive-aristocracy-jim-geraghty", "image": "http://c0.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/uploaded/pic_giant_040214_A.jpg", "description": "In recent weeks, we examined the Obama administration\u2019s willingness to reverse positions that it had once proudly proclaimed \u2014 on whether an individual mandate is necessary, whether the individual mandate is a tax, whether it is important that you can keep your plan or doctor, whether lobbyists should work in a president\u2019s administration, whether a donor should be appointed U.S. ambassador, and so on. Then we noted environmentalists who said they would not criticize or attack lawmakers who supported the Keystone Pipeline, as long as they were Democrats.\n\nLast week, we expanded the discussion to progressives\u2019 wide-ranging willingness to contradict their own professed principles: gun-control proponents who travel with armed bodyguards, voucher opponents who send their kids to private schools, and minimum-wage-hike advocates who pay their staff less than the minimum wage, among others.\n\nSo what do progressives really want? If, as I suspect, the currency of progressivism isn\u2019t policies or results, but emotions, what does that approach build? What kind of a country do you get when political leaders are driven by a desire to feel that they are more enlightened, noble, tolerant, wise, sensitive, conscious, and smart than most other people?\n\n#ad#The evidence before us suggests progressives\u2019 ideal society would be one where they enjoy great power to regulate the lives of others and impose restrictions and limitations they themselves would never accept in their own lives. Very few people object to an aristocracy with special rights and privileges as long as they\u2019re in it.\n\nFor example, a key provision of Obamacare is a tax on \u201cCadillac health-care plans\u201d \u2014 the architects of the legislation having concluded that part of the problem with America\u2019s health-care system is that some employers are just too generous with their employees\u2019 health insurance. Plans worth more than $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for families face a 40 percent excise tax starting in 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress \u2014 at least the ones not covered by their spouse\u2019s plans, as quite a few of them\u00a0are \u2014 purchase their insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which offers about 300 different plans. On average, the government pays 72 percent of the premiums for its workers, according to FactCheck.org \u2014 a setup that has been characterized as, if not quite a \u201cCadillac\u201d plan, then \u201cthe best Buick on the block.\u201d The New York Times noted that, even though they are now required to purchase insurance through an exchange, lawmakers have \u201ca larger menu of \u2018gold plan\u2019 insurance choices than most of their constituents have back home\u201d and have an easier time navigating the exchange, with special \u201cconcierge\u201d services provided by insurers. And the Times noted that members of Congress can receive care from the attending physician to Congress, conveniently located in the U.S. Capitol, for an annual fee of $576.\n\nThus, lawmakers who could rest assured they would see little change to their own plans enacted massive, complicated, headache-inducing changes to the nation\u2019s system of health-insurance plans.\n\nFor what it is worth, the president signed up symbolically:\n\n\nObama, who is on vacation in Hawaii, had a staffer do the heavy lifting for him, a White House official says. He had to be enrolled in person, in no small part because his personal information is not readily available in the variety of government databases HealthCare.gov uses to verify identities.\n\n\u201cThe act of the president signing up for insurance coverage through the DC exchange is symbolic since the president\u2019s health care will continue to be provided by the military,\u201d the official added.\n\n\nObviously, President Obama is unlikely to ever argue with an insurance company over his family\u2019s care; former presidents and their spouses are entitled to medical treatment in military hospitals, paying at rates set by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThen there is progressives\u2019 appetite for special exemptions for energy use. On the campaign trail in 2008, then-senator Obama envisioned a not-too-distant future in which every American would embrace personal sacrifices in the name of combatting climate change: \u201cWe can\u2019t drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and then just expect that other countries are going to say \u2018okay.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis bold statement was hypocritical in a general sense, as almost all Washington lawmakers spend perhaps 90 percent of their lives in climate-controlled bubbles \u2014 awakening in a nice air-conditioned or heated home, then driving (or being driven) in an air-conditioned or heated car to work in an air-conditioned or heated workplace. (Quite a few lawmakers travel in SUVs and eat as much as they want, too.) But then there\u2019s the personal hypocrisy, as relayed by the New York Times:\n\n\nObama, who hates the cold, had cranked up the thermostat.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s from Hawaii, O.K.?\u201d said Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser, David Axelrod, who occupies the small but strategically located office next door to his boss. \u201cHe likes it warm.
