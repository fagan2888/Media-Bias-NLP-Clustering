Jeff Merkley at the KOIN 6 News studio, October 3, 2014 (KOIN 6 News)\n\nRelated Coverage KOIN 6 One-on-One: Senate candidate Dr. Monica Wehby\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN 6) \u2014 Running for election to a second term in the US Senate, Jeff Merkley answered questions in an extended interview Friday with KOIN 6 News.\n\nMerkley\u2019s opponent, Dr. Monica Wehby, previously answered questions in an interview with KOIN 6 News.\n\nThe entire 22-minute interview with Jeff Merkley is at the bottom of this article.\n\n\n\nMerkley blasted Wehby on the millions of dollars spent on campaign ads for her by the conservative Political Action Committee, Freedom Partners, controlled by the Koch brothers.\n\nAsked about Wehby\u2019s allegations that he is controlled by the Democratic Party, Merkley said he took on the party when they were wrong.\n\n\u201cI took on (President Obama) when he decided to change CPI which would change the purchasing power of Social Security,\u201d Merkley told KOIN 6 News. \u201cI took on the president in his initial plan to attack Syria, without a framework of authorization from Congress. I took on the president on his nominee for the Federal Reserve Board.\u201d\n\nOpenCongress.org said Merkely votes with the Democrats 94% of the time, and GovTrack put Merkley in the \u201cfar left\u201d ideology category.\n\nMerkley demurred. \u201cActually what those statitics mean is I\u2019m willing to take on the powerful on behalf of working families.\u201d\n\nWhen Oregon\u2019s other senator, Ron Wyden, endorsed Merkley, he said very few voters know about what Merkley\u2019s done in his first term. Merkley doesn\u2019t see that as a problem.\n\n\u201cThe fact is you get more done if you\u2019re interested in doing good policy than publicizing it,\u201d he told KOIN 6 News. \u201cThe first fight I did, I did get a lot of publicity and that was taking on the Wall Street casino in which the big banks were operating as taxpayer-subsidized hedge funds.\u201d\n\nThe sitting senator won\u2019t take a position on legalizing marijuana in Oregon, said the Cover Oregon website was a debacle, but is proud Obamacare is getting people insurance and medical care.\n\nHe\u2019s been vocal about keeping American boots off the ground in Iraq over the ISIS issue.\n\n\u201cThe power vacuum was created do to the failure of the Iraqi government, the infighting and the Shiites decided not to work in concert with the Sunnis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have fought each other forever. If the argument is until they can get along peacefully and competently we\u2019re going to be there, we\u2019re going to be there forever.\u201d\n\nAs for upcoming debates, Merkley and Wehby can\u2019t agree. He\u2019s accepted earlier proposals, she declined one and proposed different ones.\n\nThe election is November 4.\n\nStay with KOIN 6 throughout Campaign 2014.", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "Running for election to a second term in the US Senate, Jeff Merkley answered questions in an extended interview Friday with KOIN 6 News.", "title": "KOIN 6 One-on-One: Sen.
