That\u2019s largely because low-income women tend to have a higher birth rate than wealthier women, and unintended pregnancies are becoming increasingly concentrated among women living in poverty.\n\nConservatives\u2019 takeaway from those figures, however, didn\u2019t have anything to do with pledging to ensure that those economically disadvantaged women have access to affordable family planning services. Instead, right-wing outlets decried the fact that Medicaid is \u201cpicking up the tab for out-of-wedlock childbirth.\u201d\n\nOf course, conservatives advocating against single parenting is nothing new. Right-wing organizations like the Heritage Foundation frequently blame single mothers for poverty, and Republican lawmakers often suggest that stronger families will eliminate the need for a strong government safety net. The aversion to providing government support for unwed mothers fits neatly into that worldview.\n\nBut it also speaks to another ethos at the heart of the conservative approach to women\u2019s health issues: Women\u2019s \u201cimmoral\u201d sexual choices shouldn\u2019t be subsidized by taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe idea that government programs shouldn\u2019t enable women\u2019s sexuality is a common thread that runs throughout right-wing policies. From the very beginning, when it comes to health classes in public schools that might introduce kids to sexual health issues, conservatives make the case that sex is an inherently dirty subject that shouldn\u2019t be covered in state-mandated courses. Instead, they advocate abstinence curricula that tell students to keep themselves pure until marriage.\n\nThat type of \u201cpurity culture\u201d rests upon the understanding that virginity \u2014 and specifically, women\u2019s virginity \u2014 holds a place of high esteem, and tarnishing it with any sexual activity automatically has moral implications. Elizabeth Smart, a kidnapping and sexual assault victim who was raised in a conservative Mormon community, recently pointed out that abstinence education often teaches women they automatically become worthless, dirty, and filthy after having any type of sexual contact \u2014 consensual or otherwise.\n\nFollowing that line of thinking, it\u2019s perhaps not hard to see why conservatives so vehemently attacked Sandra Fluke last year for advocating for Obamacare\u2019s contraception policy. Pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O\u2019Reilly claimed Fluke wanted the government to \u201cpay for her social life\u201d and suggested she must be a slut if she needed so much birth control.\n\nTo conservatives, Fluke represented one of the most threatening right-wing tropes: an immoral woman who wants the government to fund her decision to have sex outside of marriage. And despite the massive outcry about the smears against the Georgetown law student, conservatives have continued this line of attack against the health law\u2019s birth control benefit, claiming that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize women\u2019s sex lives.\n\nAbortion policy is typically even more controversial than birth control coverage. Over the past several decades, abortion opponents have launched an all-out war on taxpayer funding for abortion, ensuring that federal dollars are barred from covering the procedure. Currently, Peace Corps volunteers don\u2019t receive any abortion coverage, women in the military can only get coverage for it in a few extreme cases, Congress members and their staffers aren\u2019t allowed to have insurance plans that cover it, and most low-income women can\u2019t get any abortion coverage through their Medicaid plans.\n\nThe idea that taxpayer dollars might go toward abortion care has become so politically contentious that Planned Parenthood now spends most of its time emphasizing that abortion represents a small fraction of its services, and repeatedly producing the paperwork to prove that it\u2019s not illegally funneling federal money toward it.\n\nIt\u2019s just a short leap, then, to the outrage over taxpayer dollars going toward unwed mothers\u2019 health care. The government shouldn\u2019t teach women about sex. It shouldn\u2019t encourage women to be sexually active by funding their birth control pills or abortion procedures. And it shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for any births that result from that illicit sexual activity. It\u2019s a comprehensive approach to policing women\u2019s bodies, and shaming them for making the \u201cwrong\u201d choices with their sexuality.\n\nUltimately, the constant fights over taxpayer funding have huge implications for the widening class divisions within women\u2019s access to reproductive care. Low-income and rural women are less likely to have access to sexual health resources, less likely be able to afford modern forms of birth control, less likely to be able to pay for an abortion, more likely to give birth after an unintended pregnancy, and more likely to slip deeper into poverty if they don\u2019t regain control over their reproductive choices. Nonetheless, Republican lawmakers continue to chip away at the social safety net that helps address some of these issues.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "From taxpayer-funded birth control to taxpayer-funded abortion, conservatives say they strongly oppose subsidizing women's sexual choices.
