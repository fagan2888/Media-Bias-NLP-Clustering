But when NAMI surveyed 2,720 people living with mental illness and their families with private health insurance, as well as analyzed 84 existing health plans in the top 15 states by projected 2014 exchange enrollment, this isn\u2019t what they found. Instead, people surveyed reported high rates of denial of authorization for this kind of care; high costs, from co-pays to insurance rates; and \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in general information that help inform patients which health plan best suits their needs.\n\nThe most significant problem, however, seemed to be difficulty accessing therapists or counselors for outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatments, second to accessing psychiatrists (though inpatient care wasn\u2019t exactly easy). To be fair, NAMI added this may be a result of the severe shortage in qualified mental health professionals: 55 percent of US countries have no practicing psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers. But still, mental health patients and their families generally find they don\u2019t equally struggle to find out- and inpatient medical specialty or primary care.\n\n\u201cMy insurance will pay my primary care doctor more for a 10-minute appointment for the flu, than it will allow my psychiatrist for an hour-long treatment session,\u201d one participant said. \u201cFor this reason, my own psychiatrist along with many others, no longer accepts insurance.\u201d\n\nAnother major problem stems from the medical necessity criteria insurance companies follow to approve or deny care; they use the criteria to determine if the patient care is reasonable, necessary, and appropriate. NAMI found among their respondents, insurance companies \u201carbitrarily and without reasonable explanation\u201d deny patient care. In fact, nearly one-third of respondents said their family member had been denied mental health care on the basis of medical necessity; 18 percent were denied substance abuse care; and 14 percent were denied general medical care.\n\nJenny Gold, a reporter for Kaiser Health News, told NPR she spoke with Clare Krusing from the America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans \u2014 the industry\u2019s main trade group \u2014 and she says \u201cthey\u2019re really doing their best to try to make this work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plans have made tremendous steps since the final rules have come out to implement these changes and requirements in a way that is affordable for patients,\u201d Krusing said. \u201cAnd again, this goes back to, you know, the fact that we are at a point where health care costs continue to go up.\u201d\n\nGold added it\u2019s also hard to compare mental and physical health, which are \u201csort of apples and oranges.\u201d She believes it\u2019s hard to make them equal if treatment doesn\u2019t line up.\n\nAs mental health and medical health care providers work toward this parity, NAMI suggests states strongly enforce MHPAEA and both health insurers and health plans become more transparent with relevant criteria to approve, deny, and/or inform care.\n\nSource: Honberg R, et al.
