So it\u2019s a big embarrassment,\" Daley said on CBS' \"This Morning.\"\n\n\"It will be corrected. It will take time. I think you\u2019ll see the hearings today and next week to some degree turn into the typical sort of political sideshow, but the real question is what happened here, and how did a program that\u2019s so vital to the country get screwed up this way at the beginning?\"\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee is holding a hearing Thursday morning on the rollout of the health-care law and its glitchy website. E\n\nExecutives of CGI Federal, which designed the federal HealthCare.gov website that serves 36 states, and QSSI \u2014 which created the features that verify applicants' income \u2014 are testifying Thursday before the committee.\n\nDaley was asked if he thinks Sebelius should be \"held accountable\" for the disastrous rollout so far.\n\n\"Some people are calling for her to be fired. To me, that\u2019s kind of like firing Captain Smith on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg \u2014 it\u2019s not going to do much right now,\" Daley said.\n\n\"I think they\u2019ve got to get it fixed, I think they\u2019ve got to get it straightened out, and then there\u2019s the question obviously whether there needs to be new leadership at that department, not only with the secretary but other things going forward. I think she\u2019s in a tough situation right now, but the bottom line is they\u2019ve got to get this working.\"\n\nHere's the clip:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Brett LoGiurato", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Bill Daley, the former White House chief of...", "creator": "brettlogiurato", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-daley-obamacare-rollout-website-titanic-kathleen-sebelius-2013-10", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/52691df269bedd1372e18b45-506-253/former-obama-chief-of-staff-the-obamacare-rollout-has-been-a-big-embarrassment.jpg", "title": "FORMER OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF: The Obamacare Rollout Has Been A 'Big Embarrassment'", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "White House, Bill Daley, Obamacare, Kathleen Sebelius, Brett LoGiurato", "description": "Bill Daley, the former White House chief of...", "author": "Brett LoGiurato", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-24", "sailthru.title": "FORMER OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF: The Obamacare Rollout Has Been A 'Big Embarrassment'", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52691df269bedd1372e18b45-50-50/former-obama-chief-of-staff-the-obamacare-rollout-has-been-a-big-embarrassment.jpg", "news_keywords": "White House, Bill Daley, Obamacare, Kathleen Sebelius, Brett LoGiurato", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/52691df269bedd1372e18b45/former-obama-chief-of-staff-the-obamacare-rollout-has-been-a-big-embarrassment.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-10-24", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/brett-logiurato"}, "sailthru.description": "Bill Daley, the former White House chief of...", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Bill Daley, the former White House chief of...", "title": "FORMER OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF: The Obamacare Rollout Has Been A 'Big Embarrassment'", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-daley-obamacare-rollout-website-titanic-kathleen-sebelius-2013-10", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52691df269bedd1372e18b45-1190-625/former-obama-chief-of-staff-the-obamacare-rollout-has-been-a-big-embarrassment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "FORMER OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF: The Obamacare Rollout Has Been A 'Big Embarrassment'", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/52691df269bedd1372e18b45/former-obama-chief-of-staff-the-obamacare-rollout-has-been-a-big-embarrassment.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe60ff\"", "article_summary": "Bill Daley, the former White House chief of staff under President Barack Obama, called the rollout of the Affordable Care Act \"a big embarrassment.\"\n\"The president has looked forward to the rollout of Obamacare, and it hasn\u2019t gone as well obviously as he expected or demanded.\nDaley was asked if he thinks Sebelius should be \"held accountable\" for the disastrous rollout so far.\nSo it\u2019s a big embarrassment,\" Daley said on CBS' \"This Morning.\"\nI think she\u2019s in a tough situation right now, but the bottom line is they\u2019ve got to get this working.\""}
