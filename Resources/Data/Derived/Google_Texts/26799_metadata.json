That's when policyholders must have policies compliant with the Affordable Care Act. It's a process at Blue Cross that does not involve canceling but rather transitioning, Mackin wrote.\n\n\"To ensure our customers do not experience any gap in coverage, we have transitioned them to plans that most closely mirror their existing coverage and are compliant with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act,\" she said.\n\nDoes this mean that the policy an individual has in 2013 is the same policy being offered for 2014?\n\n\"No,\" Mackin answered. \"The new policies for 2014 meet the requirements of the ACA.\"\n\nSo they are, indeed, \"new policies\" just as described in BCBS' letter to the 87,000 policyholders.\n\n\"We will offer new individual and family health plans,\" the letter tells policyholders.\n\n\"Your current plan does not meet all of the new Affordable Care Act benefit requirements,\" the letter states.\n\nSo if they weren't canceled, what happened to those current plans?\n\n\"Canceled,\" Mackin wrote, \"carries the connotation that coverage has been terminated and that they do not have coverage, which is not the case. Their policies are being transitioned to coverage that is compliant with the Affordable Care Act. Not one of the 87,000 policyholders was canceled or experienced a break in service.\"\n\nBut some policyholders can't afford their new policies because the rates went up -- two and three times as much in some cases that have been reported.\n\nCanceled or not, the 2013 policies with lower rates are not available anymore.\n\nAnd that brings it back to the original questions for BCBS:\n\nHow many policyholders in the group of 87,000 will see an increase in premiums? And what is the average rate hike?\n\nThose questions remain unanswered.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Blue Cross in Alabama: We didn't 'cancel' health policies -- we 'transitioned' them under Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \" Blue Cross in Alabama: We didn\\u0027t \\u0027cancel\\u0027 health policies -- we \\u0027transitioned\\u0027 them under Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/12/blue_cross_in_alabama_we_didnt.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13873777-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11753231\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-02T18:51:41Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"affordable care act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13873777-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MikeOliverAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "View full size From left, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Humana CEO Bruce Broussard, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida CEO Patrick Geraghty, and other health care chief executive officers arrive at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2013,..."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, December 02, 2013,  1:49 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/spotnews/photo/-939ee27b52711a9a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"toniokroger\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com\", \"author_id\": \"9375881\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from Birmingham\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/spotnews/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "View full size From left, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Humana CEO Bruce Broussard, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida CEO Patrick Geraghty, and other health care chief executive officers arrive at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2013,...", "title": "Blue Cross in Alabama: We didn't 'cancel' health policies -- we 'transitioned' them under Obamacare", "url": "http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/12/blue_cross_in_alabama_we_didnt.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/13873777-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, December 02, 2013, 12:55 PM", "article_author": "Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com", "Description": "What's in a word?
