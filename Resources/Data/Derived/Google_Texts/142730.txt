There may have been storms on election day, but for Delegate Donna Christensen the sun was shining. She and her running mate, Basil Ottley, beat out a crowded six candidate field to win the Democratic primary for Governor of the Virgin Islands.

Del. Christensen’s primary win and all but certain victory in the general election means she will be the first Black female Governor of the U.S. and its territories.

The Virgin Islands is one of five U.S. territories who claim as their President Barack Obama but oddly can’t vote in presidential elections. The largest U.S. territory is Puerto Rico with over 5 million people. Thanks to the House Republicans, Del. Christensen does not have a vote in on the House floor — all the Delegates in the U.S. House are Democrats.

“Our community has a lot of work to do as we address the economy, energy costs, health care, education, the government retirement system, and our infrastructure,” a note from team Christensen read on facebook.

Back in March, Delegate — and Doctor — Christensen, announced she would be running for governor of the Virgin Islands. Christensen has been known in her Congress for her work on health care and as a member of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. She had focused lots on energy on getting the Virgin Islands Obamacare coverage.

There were storms in the Caribbean yesterday as voters hit the polls. A message to supporters:

“We would like to urge all of you to be prepared for the storm, securing your homes and your families before coming out to work or vote tomorrow. With the closing of ports and the potential grounding of aircraft, our candidates will visit the polls on their respective home islands on Election Day, Donna on St. Croix and Basil on St. Thomas before ending the day at headquarters for the election night count.”

For Christensen and Ottley the day ended just fine.
