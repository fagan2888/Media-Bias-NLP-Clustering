Photos by Scott Olson/Getty Images and Ed Zurga/Getty Images.\n\nOn Monday, if you were paying attention, you caught a glimpse of our ultrapolarized future.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nSpecifically, you saw two speeches from two candidates on opposite ends of the ideological divide. First was Hillary Clinton\u2019s marquee speech on the economy, in which after months of silence, she addressed a major question of her candidacy: Was she committed to the neoliberal path of her husband\u2019s administration and her first campaign, or would she follow the progressive economic zeitgeist of the present-day Democratic Party?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe answer, in short, is that she\u2019ll follow the zeitgeist. \u201cThe defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country.\u201d At the same time, said Clinton\u2014distancing herself from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2014\u201cToday is not 1993 or 2009. We need solutions for the big challenges we face now.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Clinton wants a constellation of interventionist policies that directly use government to raise incomes, regulate financial firms, shape the pre-distribution of wealth, and secure middle-class families. Among her proposals are tax reform to encourage long-term business investment instead of short-term spending (like higher CEO pay); comprehensive immigration reform to bring undocumented workers into the formal economy; new federal investments in renewable energy and medical research; paid family leave, earned sick days, and subsidized child care; higher minimum wages and protection against wage theft; enhancements for Social Security and the Affordable Care Act; middle-class tax relief and greater support for young, contract, and low-income workers; and finally, new measures to strengthen and expand Dodd-Frank financial reform.\n\nThere is no middle ground or overlap between Walker\u2019s America and Clinton\u2019s coalition of blacks, Latinos, women, and young people.\n\nEven with the missing details and unanswered questions\u2014where does Clinton stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, does she support a Bernie Sanders\u2013style financial transactions tax\u2014this is a progressive vision, informed by the last five years of liberal populist activism, from Occupy Wall Street to the rise of Elizabeth Warren. Once a Democratic Leadership Council Democrat who cut her teeth in the age of Reagan, Clinton is now near the helm of a party that\u2019s turned left from its 1990s centrism toward a neo\u2013New Deal liberalism.*\n\nMirroring this nod to the left of the Democratic Party was Scott Walker\u2019s wave to the right wing of the Republican Party. On Monday evening, in his home state, the conservative Wisconsin governor announced his campaign for the White House. \u201cAmericans deserve a president who will fight and win for them. Someone who will stand up for the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Someone who will stand up for our religious rights and all of our other constitutional rights. Someone who will stand up for America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf Clinton gave an agenda for liberal America, Walker sketched a wish list for its conservative counterpart. As president, Walker wants to devolve Medicaid to the states; repeal the Affordable Care Act in full; drill for oil, including completing the Keystone pipeline; cut taxes on \u201cjob creators\u201d; and reduce regulations across the board.\n\nLikewise, he wants to bring key Wisconsin policies to the country writ large. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been governor,\u201d said Walker, touting his record, \u201cwe passed lawsuit reform and regulatory reform. We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed Castle Doctrine and concealed-carry. And we now require a photo ID to vote in the state of Wisconsin.\u201d He continued: \u201cIf our reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America.\u201d\n\nBeyond concrete policy ideas, Walker stuffed his speech with red meat. He blasted public assistance\u2014\u201cThe people I\u2019ve met tell me that they didn\u2019t come here to become dependent on the government\u201d\u2014and touted America as a place where \u201cthe opportunity is equal for all, but the outcome is up to each and every one of us,\u201d as if the poor are poor because of their effort (they earned it) and not their circumstances. He praised supply-side economics and promised that tax cuts would \u201cgrow the economy,\u201d despite the poor results in Wisconsin. He touted mandatory drug tests for welfare recipients, and denounced Common Core as a \u201cnationwide school board.\u201d\n\nWalker is a top-tier contender for the GOP nomination. If he wins, he won\u2019t just bring a conservative agenda; he\u2019ll bring one from the hard right that aims for the vulnerable (cuts to services), plays to resentments (voter identification and drug tests), and appeals to his base of working- and middle-class white men.\n\nThese dueling speeches are clear: There is no middle ground or overlap between Walker\u2019s America and Clinton\u2019s coalition of blacks, Latinos, women, and young people. Which means that there\u2019s no amount of \u201cleadership\u201d\u2014of rhetorical restraint, of triangulation, of closed-door maneuvering\u2014that would yield a \u201cgoverning majority\u201d that\u2019s capable of serious progress. Indeed, there\u2019s no national\u2014or at least, no bipartisan\u2014agreement on what \u201cprogress\u201d means.\n\nLike Obama in 2008, Clinton has promised to bring the country together, but this divide is solid. If she\u2019s elected president, she\u2019ll face the same entrenched opposition as her predecessor. Which, in a way, makes Walker a bit of fresh air. He has no pretenses. \u201cFor years, the conventional wisdom was that Americans want divided government,\u201d said Walker in 2013. \u201cI think they\u2019ve seen in the last few years that that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing.\u201d What works, he said? Unified, one-party control. And that\u2019s what he promises. He says he\u2019ll fight for conservatives, and he\u2019ll win.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Hillary Clinton and Scott Walker have utterly different visions for our future.", "fb-share": "There is no middle ground or overlap between Walker\u2019s America and Clinton\u2019s coalition of blacks, Latinos, women, and young people.", "sailthru.author": "Jamelle Bouie", "description": "On Monday, if you were paying attention, you caught a glimpse of our ultrapolarized future.
