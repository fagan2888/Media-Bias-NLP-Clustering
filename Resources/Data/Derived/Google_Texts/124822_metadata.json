Thomas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRepublican senator from Kentucky and presidential hopeful, Rand Paul, shares 25 surprising facts about himself with Us Weekly. Spoiler alert: He likes root beer floats and cutting his own hair!\n\n1. My wife [Kelley, 51] and I met at an outdoor oyster roast in Atlanta. At first, she thought I was much younger than I actually was and she gave me the cold shoulder. Eventually she realized that I was 26 years old, and we hit it off!\n\n2. As a child, I loved to collect old coins with my grandmother.\n\n3. The same grandmother inspired me to become an ophthalmologist. As her vision began to fade, I became her eyes when we inspected mint marks on coins.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebs' political affiliations\n\n4. I am the father of three: William, 22, Duncan, 19, and Robert, 16. When they were little kids, I loved coaching their soccer, baseball, and basketball leagues.\n\n5. My son turned me on to Sundy Best, a country duo from Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Check them out!\n\n6. As you have probably heard by now, I am my own barber. In fact, I cut my own hair on my wedding day, which is evident in our wedding photos.\n\n7. Mostly I watch the news, but I do like reruns of The Twilight Zone.\n\n8. I grew up swimming and, as a teenager, I taught swim lessons to make extra spending money.\n\n9. I was a collegiate swimmer at Baylor University. I still enjoy swimming as a way to keep in shape.\n\nPHOTOS: See celebs vote!\n\n10. I studied hard and scored high enough on the MCATs to be admitted to Duke University\u2019s medical school without a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n11. Some would say I have a green thumb. I love working in the yard on my days off. Mowing the lawn is very therapeutic for me.\n\n12. Each summer, members of Congress host a congressional baseball game to raise money for charity. I have played on the Republican team every year since I have been in office. My position: outfield!\n\n13. I\u2019m not an expert stargazer, but I can recognize many of the constellations and am always interested to see the next eclipse.\n\nPHOTOS: Stars who've played presidents\n\n14. I planted a cherry tree in our front yard in Bowling Green, Kentucky, from seeds that came from the cherry trees along the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C.\n\n15. Before I ran for office, I was an ophthalmologist in Bowling Green. I still conduct pro bono surgeries in Kentucky and abroad. Last year, I went to Guatemala. This year, I\u2019ll travel to Haiti.\n\n16. My given name is Randal. Kelley started calling me Rand, and it stuck!\n\n17. My favorite drink? Root beer float.\n\n18. I am responsible for cooking the Thanksgiving Day turkey. I have a special recipe that involves placing fresh herbs under the skin, covering the turkey in cheesecloth, and basting it in Madeira wine and butter. It\u2019s a labor of love.\n\n19. I love biking. On a weeknight, you can find me biking around our neighborhood. It\u2019s a great way to unwind.\n\n20. There\u2019s a bald eagle that lives in a high nest across the pond from my backyard.\n\n21. A rare hobby of mine: composting! Because of my composting, I guess I qualify as a \u201ccrunchy-con.\u201d\n\n22. I am the author of three books: The Tea Party Comes to Washington, Government Bullies, and Taking a Stand.\n\n23. My favorite book is The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\n24. Growing up, my parents did not enforce a curfew. They believed excessive rules can have unintended consequences.\n\n25. One thing I never travel without: my Ray-Ban sunglasses. It\u2019s important to protect your eyes from the sun.\n\nPHOTOS: Obama's A-list pals\n\nPaul announced his candidacy for the 2016 election on April 7, and the GOP candidate tells Us his stance:\n\nFOR:\n\nTerm limits and a Read the Bills Act\n\nCriminal-justice reform\n\nA balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution\n\nAGAINST:\n\nThe National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance program\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nThe current $18 trillion U.S. national debt.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.wennermedia.com/usweekly/static/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Republican senator from Kentucky (and presidential hopeful!), Rand Paul, tells Us Weekly that he cuts his own hair and much more.
