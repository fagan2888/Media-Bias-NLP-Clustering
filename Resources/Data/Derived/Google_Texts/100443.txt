Fireworks and barbecues are popular ways to celebrate Independence Day. But they can also be dangerous.

Doctors say burns are a big reason people end up in the hospital on the 4th of July.

Fireworks tend to cause the most injuries on this holiday. Sparklers - which burn at about 2,000 degrees - typically handled by kids are high on the list. Researchers says firecrackers, roman candles and reloadable shells also cause a lot of injuries.

Hands and fingers top the list of body parts that are most often hurt, followed by injuries to the head, face, and ears.

Burns are common, as are injuries caused by projectiles or hearing loss caused by explosions.

Any large injury or burn to the hand, significant blistering, redness, and certainly if you have any black or charred areas, have to be evaluated.
