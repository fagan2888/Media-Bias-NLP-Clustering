2015 BMW i3

This petite, fully electric two-seater plug-in hybrid intended to be an urban commuter car previously showcased at the Los Angeles Auto Show last December, and as a concept vehicle in previous shows, will hit the marketplace in the second quarter of this year. It can go 80 to 100 miles on a charge.
