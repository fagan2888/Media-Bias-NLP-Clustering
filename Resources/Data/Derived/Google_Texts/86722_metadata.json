Some pot smokers swear that they have never become addicted to weed, while others believe some components of marijuana can be classified as addictive substances.\n\nIt\u2019s the active ingredient in weed \u2014 THC \u2014 that\u2019s addictive, Dr. Samuel Ball of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia Universiaty says. And it turns out that the potency of marijuana\u2019s THC has actually increased in recent times, making it more addictive than before. \u201cI think what\u2019s changed a bit over the years is \u2014 over time, the concentration of the active ingredient, THC, has increased dramatically in the marijuana that is available for people to smoke,\u201d Ball said in a video.\n\nAdvocates of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana use may argue that addictive or not, marijuana is still safer than other addictive substances that are legal and on the market, such as cigarettes and alcohol. And these people might have President Barrack Obama on their side, too, as he told New Yorker editor David Remnick: \u201cAs has been well-documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life.\u201d\n\nOf course, whether or not you get addicted to marijuana is really a personal experience: It may not have the same addictive effects on certain people than it does on others. But Ball believes that things have changed, and marijuana is indeed more addictive now than before: \u201cYou\u2019ll frequently hear people saying, the marijuana they smoke today is not the marijuana we smoked when we were kids,\u201d he said.
