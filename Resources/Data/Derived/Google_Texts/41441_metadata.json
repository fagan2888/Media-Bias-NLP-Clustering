The blonde is named Boy Novak, and she may look like Grace Kelly, but her personality is closer to that of the old film noir goddess Veronica Lake \u2014 skeptical, street smart and tough. She got that way on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where she grew up motherless and regularly beaten by her father, an ogre with the strangely storybook profession of rat catcher. When Boy\u2019s father\u2019s violence verges on the life threatening, she hops a bus for the furthest affordable point north: a town called Flax Hill in some unnamed New England state.\n\nOyeyemi, a Nigerian-British prodigy who published her first novel, \u201cIcarus Girl,\u201d at age 18, is the literary heir of the late, great Angela Carter, a writer whose fiction glides from swirling archetype and folklore to the wised-up observations of a thoroughly modern womanhood. Fairy tales are often Oyeyemi\u2019s primary source, but \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d also drinks deeply from the well of mid-20th-century Hollywood movies \u2014 and really, is there that much difference between the two?\n\nThe 1950s Flax Hill that Boy flees to is a glossy, gritless setting populated by snooty society ladies and the boarding-house girls who try to land their sons while making ends meet by working coat check. There\u2019s even a swank cocktail party, staffed entirely by blondes (including the blas\u00e9 Boy), held on a yacht. Boy\u2019s best friend is a brash reporter who could be played by Rosalind Russell. In time, Boy marries Arturo Whitman, a widowed history professor-turned-jeweler and scion of a prominent family, but only at the end of one of those long jousting courtships perfected in the screwball comedies of the 1930s. \u201cYou feel you\u2019ve seen a hundred of me,\u201d Boy zings Arturo, channeling Ginger Rogers. \u201cYou know how my tiny mind works. But maybe it goes both ways.\u201d\n\nThe film that \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d most strongly evokes, however, is the 1959 Douglas Sirk movie, \u201cImitation of Life,\u201d probably the most unsettling Hollywood movie ever made about race before the 1970s. With their rich visual sheen and stylized melodrama, Sirk\u2019s films are, almost deliriously, about surfaces, and so is Oyeyemi\u2019s novel \u2014 except for the deliriously part. She prefers the prowling, bloody imagination of myth. Some reviewers have tried to withhold a mid-book revelation from \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird,\u201d but the novel only really coalesces once you know it, and besides, the book\u2019s publisher prints the \u201cspoiler\u201d right in the flap copy. If you\u2019ve seen \u201cImitation of Life\u201d you\u2019ve already guessed what it is, but if not, I promise that the novel is far more enjoyable if you know from the start that Arturo\u2019s family are light-skinned African-Americans who came to Flax Hill aiming to pass as white.\n\nBoy doesn\u2019t find this out, however, until she gives birth to Bird, a daughter who is unquestionably (to use the language of the novel\u2019s characters) \u201ccolored.\u201d Boy\u2019s response brings another allusion into play: Snow White. Boy sends Arturo\u2019s daughter by his first wife, Snow, off to live with her aunt, a woman who was herself sent to live with relatives as a child because her skin color betrayed the Whitman family\u2019s secret. So Boy, like the wicked queen of the fairy tale, exiles her stepdaughter for being too fair; the twist is that she does it not out of personal vanity (Boy doesn\u2019t seem to care much about her looks), but to protect Bird, who will, by comparison, always seem the inferior, less-lovable child in her in-laws\u2019 eyes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Helen Oyeyemi's new novel transposes the classic tale to the racially charged world of 1950s New England", "title": "\u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d: The (much) darker side of Snow White", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Helen Oyeyemi's new novel transposes the classic tale to the racially charged world of 1950s New England", "title": "\u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d: The (much) darker side of Snow White", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/02/boy_snow_bird_the_much_darker_side_of_snow_white/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/boy_snow_bird.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Helen Oyeyemi's new novel transposes the classic tale to the racially charged world of 1950s New England", "title": "\u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d: The (much) darker side of Snow White", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/boy_snow_bird.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Boy Snow Bird, Editor's Picks, Fairy tales, Fiction, Helen Oyeyemi, Must-Do, Snow White, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8b1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Boy Snow Bird, Editor's Picks, Fairy tales, Fiction, Helen Oyeyemi, Must-Do, Snow White, What to Read, Entertainment NewsHelen Oyeyemi\u2019s new novel, \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird,\u201d begins with a cool blonde arriving in a small town.\nFairy tales are often Oyeyemi\u2019s primary source, but \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d also drinks deeply from the well of mid-20th-century Hollywood movies \u2014 and really, is there that much difference between the two?\nBut maybe it goes both ways.\u201dThe film that \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird\u201d most strongly evokes, however, is the 1959 Douglas Sirk movie, \u201cImitation of Life,\u201d probably the most unsettling Hollywood movie ever made about race before the 1970s.\nWith their rich visual sheen and stylized melodrama, Sirk\u2019s films are, almost deliriously, about surfaces, and so is Oyeyemi\u2019s novel \u2014 except for the deliriously part.\nSome reviewers have tried to withhold a mid-book revelation from \u201cBoy, Snow, Bird,\u201d but the novel only really coalesces once you know it, and besides, the book\u2019s publisher prints the \u201cspoiler\u201d right in the flap copy."}
