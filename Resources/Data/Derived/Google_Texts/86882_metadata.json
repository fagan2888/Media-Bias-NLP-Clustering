As an answer to this, we offer the below labor of love \u2013 \"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\" \u2013 dedicated and designed to getting you caught up and connected to the conversation.\n\nLiving the American Dream\n\nIs The American Dream still alive and well in 2014? On Monday, Piers Morgan kicked off the new year with two young guests \u2013 brothers Johnny and George Huynh \u2013 who have taken social media by storm, demonstrating that happiness may still be achievable even in the face of extreme adversity.\n\nThe sons of Vietnamese immigrants, the Huynh brothers didn't have an easy start; while growing up in the suburbs of Boston amidst high crime rate and low income, the boys were raised solely by their disabled mother after their father committed suicide.\n\nBut the brothers determinedly used education as a means of rising above their seemingly hopeless circumstances. And their story has hit a chord with audiences in the US and around the world, thanks to the reporting and ongoing twitter updates of Boston Globe reporter Billy Baker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream thing, you know. You\u2019re a journalist. You hope to find this sort of magical story and I walked into this.\u201d Baker told Morgan on Monday\u2019s broadcast.\n\nWith the mentoring and encouragement of Emmett Folgert \u2013 the founder of the Dorchester Youth Collaborative \u2013 Johnny and George have excelled in high school and are now taking on the collegiate world. Johnny is currently attending UMass Amherst, and George has been accepted to Yale University.\n\nYet for all their accomplishments, these two independent teens give much credit to the father who was absent for much of their adolescence.\n\nGeorge reminisced about his childhood, saying \u201cWhen I was in elementary school, he would always check my homework to make sure I was doing it well.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very smart for someone who didn't have that much of an education,\u201d added Johnny. \u201cHe didn't have the opportunities we had. But he was still very \u2013 he was a very smart man.\u201d\n\nTo learn more on how to contribute to the Dorchester Youth Collaborative please visit:\n\nhttp://dorchesteryouthcollaborative.org/contribute/\n\nTempers run high in pot debate\n\nAs things cooled down across much of the United States, things heated up in the \"Piers Morgan Live\" LA studio Monday night, as Piers Morgan debated the controversy surrounding Colorado\u2019s newly legalized pot industry with guests Howard Samuels, CEO and founder of The Hills Treatment Center, and Ethan Nadelmann, founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\nHoward pushed in favor for maintaining the prevalent prohibition on marijuana. But when asked by the host if alcohol and tobacco should also be outlawed, Howard exclaimed that it is \u201ctoo late!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I add a third industry that is a dangerous industry that gets your children and my children even more exposure to marijuana.\u201d\n\nNadelmann saw less trouble for changing marijuana policies, and more possibility for economic improvement:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re transforming it from an illegal industry, where conflicts are resolved with violence where you empower organized criminals ... into a legal industry.\u201d\n\nTempers certainly ran high as Nadelmann and Samuels battled the hot-button issue.
