REDDING, Calif. -

CVS officials announced last week they are making Naloxone, or Narcan, available to everyone without a prescription.

The medication has been widely used to counteract an opiate overdose from heroin or pain medications.

Dr. Andrew Deckert, with Shasta County Public Health, said the change is beneficial because it will help save lives.

"Over 44,000 people die from accidental drug overdoses every year in the United States and most of those deaths are from opioids, including controlled substance pain medication and illegal drugs such as heroin," said Tom Davis, vice president of pharmacy professional practices at CVS.

"Naloxone is a safe and effective antidote to opioid overdoses and by providing access to this medication in our pharmacies without a prescription in more states, we can help save lives," he explained.

Sharon Smedley with the Serenity House in Redding also believes the easy access to Narcan will save lives.

"We have a huge heroin epidemic and you can't possibly get the people to the hospital in time. It's impossible," Smedley.

Deckert said Narcan is safe but without a prescription, he's concerned people won't know how to use it properly.

"Of course, if they are knocked out from an overdose, they can't really give it to themselves," Deckert shared.

He doesn't think people will abuse the drug and neither does Smedley. She hopes it will help people seek treatment to end the cycle of addiction.

"For some people that is their choice and you can't make somebody quit that doesn't want to quit. You can offer them opportunities, which is what we do and that's all you can do," Smedley said.

The change will affect pharmacies in California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Arkansas.
