What's fascinating about the CPI story is how it steps back and describes what the IRS is supposed to do.\n\nOr was, anyway. According to CPI, the division has:\n\n- Scaled back inquiries, as the number of nonprofit group tax returns investigated recently fell by 10 percent, from 11,699 in 2011 to 10,575 last year. Applications for \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit status jumped 27 percent from 1,777 to 2,253 during the same time.\n\n- Reduced the number of denials for exempt status for social welfare nonprofits from nearly 4 percent during the early 1980s to less than a quarter-percent in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt's frozen, basically, because what would have been a normal round of questions for a new, political-looking nonprofit in 2012 is now a hot ticket for scandal and congressional investigation. CPI reports that the conservative campaign to explode the IRS's new proposed rule tightening nonprofit requirements (the current language allows groups to burn through political ad money as long as it's classified as \"education\") was a complete success, cowing the agency.\n\nThis is a good time to bring in a Wednesday op-ed from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nWhen we downloaded the F.E.C. files on May 21, we believed that virtually all reports from 2014 House candidates submitted by April 15 would be included. We were shocked to find, however, that information for 347 of the 703 active House candidates for the first quarter of the year was missing.\n\nWe asked the F.E.C. if something unusual \u2014 an information technology crisis, perhaps \u2014 had occurred. The response was much more disturbing: The agency told us it simply hadn\u2019t finished processing the filings.
