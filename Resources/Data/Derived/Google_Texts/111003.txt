Lakewood police found a charred body in a wrecked vehicle early Sunday morning.

The driver hit a power pole at North Harlan Street and the West 6th Avenue Frontage Road before colliding with a concrete post in a nearby yard, at about 4:15 a.m., according to Lakewood Police Department Det. Ty Countryman.

West Metro firefighters doused the flames and then found the badly burned body.

“We’re still working on identifying the body and what took place in the crash,”Countryman said.

Fewer than 20 Xcel Energy customers lost power as a result of the crash, Countryman said.
