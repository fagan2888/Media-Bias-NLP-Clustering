(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nEDITOR: Remember when spring\u2019s splendor was marked by the flowering hopa trees? Many of us on the Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification miss this spectacular spring show, so last year we decided to hold a community tree sale to replace them with spring-blooming crab apple trees. We had such an overwhelming interest in the trees that we are once again offering these beauties for sale. You can purchase these trees for your own yard or for designated areas in our city. These are 6-foot, bare-root trees that cost $55 each. They include Red Splendor, Donald Wyman and Purple Prince crab apple.\n\nIf you want to order a tree for yourself or for the community, contact Sue Winch at swinch9@gmail.com or 715-213-1747. There are a limited number of trees available, so order yours now. All orders must be received by April 30 and will be available for pickup the first week in May. Trees make a wonderful living memorial to people we have loved and lost or to celebrate the birth of a new baby.\n\nSue Winch and Gloria Kubisiak,\n\nmembers of the Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1ScUO6K", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification is once again selling crab apple trees.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "The Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification is once again selling crab apple trees.", "title": "Blooming trees bring beauty to city", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/14/blooming-trees-bring-beauty-city/83039534/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification is once again selling crab apple trees.", "title": "Blooming trees bring beauty to city", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6aaa1d28091af92c15b516643976ba0c7c03fd7/c=328-0-1967-1639&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/14/WisconsinRapids/B9321759993Z.1_20160414151929_000_GMSE2MOL1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wrtribune", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "hopa tree, crab apple, sale, wisconsin rapids, beautification"}, "article_summary": "Sue Winch and Gloria Kubisiak,members of the Mayor\u2019s Council on BeautificationRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1ScUO6K\nYou can purchase these trees for your own yard or for designated areas in our city.\nMany of us on the Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification miss this spectacular spring show, so last year we decided to hold a community tree sale to replace them with spring-blooming crab apple trees.\nWe had such an overwhelming interest in the trees that we are once again offering these beauties for sale.\nTrees make a wonderful living memorial to people we have loved and lost or to celebrate the birth of a new baby."}
