John Badman | The Telegraph\n\nALTON \u2014 The new owners of State Street Market are settling into their new full-time jobs, and say they have brought their passion and drive to the popular downtown lunch spot.\n\n\u201cWe have a love of food and a passion for service. As soon as we discovered that passion, we decided we should have a restaurant,\u201d Terri Beaubien said.\n\nEarlier this month, Glenn \u201cBeau\u201d and Terri Beaubien took over ownership of State Street Market in Alton. Kary Lockwood previously owned the restaurant for six years. She started the restaurant and market with the idea of offering homemade, organic food and specialty products.\n\nThe new owners have maintained Lockwood\u2019s idea while implementing a few new ideas. Since taking over the restaurant, the Beaubiens have opened up and cleared the back deck, updated the menu with new items and introduced brunch on Saturdays with quiches, sandwiches and specialty items.\n\nThe Beaubiens had been looking for a restaurant in St. Louis, but locations were either out of their price range or required too much work to fix up. Just as they were about to give up their search, they a series of uncanny events helped the couple find State Street Market.\n\nOne evening in St. Louis when the couple was out at Hammerstone\u2019s bar in Soulard, Terri said she noticed a man she thought looked very familiar. He turned out to be the fiance of Nikki Myers, an employee at State Street Market. It turned out the Terri did not know the couple after all, but they continued to run into each other.\n\nThe next weekend, the two couples ran into each other again at The Loading Dock in Grafton. The week after that, Terri met Nikki\u2019s fiance once again in St. Louis.\n\nFinally, Terri\u2019s path lead her to State Street Market, not knowing her new friend, Myers, worked there.\n\n\u201cI stopped because it looked cute, even though I had just eaten lunch. Nikki saw me and came over and said, \u2018Terri, how did you know I worked here?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d\n\nMyers, who still works at the restaurant, eventually told Terri about Lockwood potentially closing the restaurant to spend more time with her daughter.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Oh no, this place is so charming! She can\u2019t close,\u2019\u201d Terri said. A day after speaking with Lockwood, Lockwood sent a proposal, and the Beaubiens accepted.\n\nA month after taking over the restaurant, the Beaubiens continue to use their previous experience and business know-how to develop it into a chic and comfortable brunch, lunch and party spot.\n\nTerri at one time owned a large restaurant with 38 employees in the small southern Illinois city of Herrin, and Glenn worked for many years in upper-level management, training and food inspection for chain restaurants like Pizza Hut, Hardee\u2019s and Burger King.\n\nThe couple said their background in restaurants helps them run their small business efficiently. They listen carefully to customer reviews and base their menu on feedback. Because their food is so fresh, they also order products carefully. Everything counts in a small business, Terri said, and the most important thing is attentiveness to the customer and flexibility.\n\n\u201cNobody should be in this business if they\u2019re not going to be accommodating. I think that\u2019s something that sets up apart. We definitely care, and we realize we are here to serve our guests,\u201d Terri said.\n\nBetween the Beaubiens, who do the cooking, Myers and Myers\u2019 daughter, Casey, the small staff keeps the restaurant running 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. They also rent out and staff the restaurant for special occasions.\n\nState Street Market is located at 208 State St. in Alton. They can be reached at 618-462-8800 and found on Facebook under the name State Street Market of Alton.\n\nReporter Kelsey Landis can be reached at 618-208-6460, Ext. 1396 or on Twitter @kelseylandis.\n\nReporter Kelsey Landis can be reached at 618-208-6460, Ext. 1396 or on Twitter @kelseylandis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-IL", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Alton", "og": {"site_name": "The Telegraph", "description": "By Kelsey Landisklandis@civitasmedia.com .neFileBlock { margin-bottom: 20px; } .neFileBlock p { margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; } .neFileBlock .neFile { border-bottom: 1px dotted #aaa; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; } .neFileBlock .neCaption { font-size: 85%; } Glenn and Terri Beaubien are the new owners of State Street Market at 208 State Street in downtown Alton.
