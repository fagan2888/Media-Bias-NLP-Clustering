Policymakers will likely debate the possibility of easing monetary policy further at this meeting, sources familiar with their thinking told Reuters earlier this month.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has indicated that expanding purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be one option to lower risk premiums and try to ignite inflation.\n\nIwata, however, said it is not \"favorable\" for central banks to buy ETFs when stock market prices are relatively good.\n\nUnder the current program introduced in April 2013, the BOJ buys 3.3 trillion yen of ETFs annually, much smaller than the 80-trillion-yen per year in purchases of government bonds.\n\nThe central bank added negative interest rates to its quantitative and qualitative easing program in January as inflation remains distant from its 2 percent price target.\n\nSome economists say negative interest rates have backfired, because it reinforces the perception that the BOJ does not have much leeway to expand government debt purchases further.\n\n(Editing by Chris Gallagher & Shri Navaratnam)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must lower its minus 0.1 percent interest rate to", "title": "Ex-BOJ Iwata: BOJ must cut key rate to -1.0 percent to beat deflation", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Ex-BOJ-Iwata-BOJ-must-cut-key-rate-10-percent-beat-deflation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-boj_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Ex-BOJ-Iwata-BOJ-must-cut-key-rate-10-percent-beat-deflation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-boj_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must lower its minus 0.1 percent interest rate to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The central bank added negative interest rates to its quantitative and qualitative easing program in January as inflation remains distant from its 2 percent price target.\nSome economists say negative interest rates have backfired, because it reinforces the perception that the BOJ does not have much leeway to expand government debt purchases further.\nThe BOJ should make negative interest rates its main policy tool because it is difficult to further expand government debt purchases due to losses the BOJ is incurring on these investments, former BOJ Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata told reporters.\nHouseholds and commercial banks have criticized the BOJ's negative rate policy for placing an excessive burden on savers and the financial system, underscoring the daunting challenge faced by the central bank in its quest to cast off deflation.\nTOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must lower its minus 0.1 percent interest rate to about minus 1.0 percent for the country to conquer deflation, a former deputy governor at the central bank said on Thursday."}
