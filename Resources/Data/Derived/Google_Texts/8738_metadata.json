A website was launched this week, a 13-member board has been established and the group is planning a conference by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re alive,\u201d said board member Mario Gutierrez, \u201cWe stuck together over this past year, throughout debts and our lease obligation and everything else, and I feel we have proven our credibility.\u201d He hopes the association will have a director and office by next year.\n\nCSRHA was forced to close its Sacramento office and lay off staff last year after nearly two decades of service in California. Grants, donations and member fees could not keep the organization afloat, and it was no longer able to afford staff. CSRHA also faced considerable debt in the form of unpaid rent, which required legal assistance and lease negotiation.\n\nThe trade association, formed in the 1990s as an informal gathering of regional groups, officially incorporated in 1995. It didn\u2019t start having real issues with funding until about 2009, members say. That led to operational disagreements between board and staff members for the next several years, and the board had to cancel staff contracts, lay off the executive director and conduct an investigation into how it could survive.\n\n\u201cIt kind of took some of us by surprise,\u201d board member Will Ross said. \u201cIt looked like we were taking in money from grants, but that didn\u2019t begin to address our lease agreement and payroll and office expenses. It just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nThe association voted to disband in 2013, but was still able to hold its 13th annual conference thanks to a donation from a former staff member. At the time, CSRHA still had $60,000 in unpaid rent to grapple with and much of the past year was devoted to negotiating lease terms and settling the debt.\n\nAfter disbanding, several board members set out to secure funding and were able to get grants from the California Wellness Foundation, the National Rural Health Association, and a few private donors to get the organization solvent by July.\n\n\u201cThe short version is we had a near-fiscal-death experience,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe persevered and negotiated and volunteered and received a few very generous donations, and now we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nRoss, project manager for Redwood MedNet health information exchange in Northern California, spearheaded the effort to build CSRHA\u2019s new website.\n\nRoss said now that the first, young phase of being an organization with staff in a lot of offices effectively across the street from the state capitol is over, it\u2019s time to rebuild and function on a shoestring budget. The 13-member board has two committees \u2014 conference and bylaws \u2014 and is working to return governance to members and re-normalize the annual schedule of the board.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re in a phase of being a volunteer board with no staff, and we\u2019ll keep running that way until there is a big change in funding,\u201d Ross said.\n\nUnifying Rural Health Communities\n\nBoard members said this incarnation of CSRHA will not immediately have paid staff members or a brick-and-mortar office, but will maintain the original mission: a unifying network of clinics, hospitals, social services and technology participating in ongoing conversations about rural health.\n\n\u201cI like to think of us as a phoenix rising from the ashes,\u201d said board member Gail Nickerson, who is also the director of the California Association of Rural Health Clinics. \u201cIt is really important for those of us in rural areas to be able to come together in this way, because when you are in rural areas you don\u2019t always get to network.\u201d\n\nNickerson, who is also a member of the National Rural Health Association and expert on the aging rural population, said the large swaths of rural California \u2014 44 of the state\u2019s 58 counties are considered rural \u2014 are often overlooked when people think about coordinating services.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about California as rural; they only think about the urban areas,\u201d she said. \u201cBut about 5.5 million Californians live in a rural area, accounting for 14% of the state\u2019s total population. That\u2019s a lot of people who need good, preventive health care just like those in the cities.\u201d\n\nMost rural health care organizations already belong to one statewide association or another. For example, rural hospitals often belong to the California Hospital Association, or a health officer at a rural county public health department will belong to the state health officers group. But those affiliations don\u2019t always work in the most effective way in rural communities, experts say.\n\n\u201cA lot of these existing associations are vertical,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThe purpose of the California State Rural Health Association is for those in the rural health community to share cross-cutting experiences. Instead of networking with the hospital that is an hour away, how about networking with the primary clinic across the street?\u201d\n\nRoss said a lot of useful conversations can start when different types of health care providers are all engaged, from policy interactions and talking with legislators to figuring out what benefits can come from telehealth delivery.\n\n\u201cThere is a pretty healthy set of dialogues that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cSay for instance, you are a community hospital, owned by the district, with 25 beds. You don\u2019t have any money for IT. But if you are actively talking with a group that specializes in telemedicine, you can bring in the right groups of people to make things happen.\u201d\n\nIncreased connectivity between rural clinics and agencies will be a key part of measuring success for this revived association. Lee Barron, administrator at Southern Inyo Healthcare District and current president of the association, said technological advances in the past few years will help CSRHA maintain functionality in ways it couldn\u2019t before.\n\n\u201cEven in California, technology can be a challenge,\u201d said Barron, who will serve as president until president-elect Judith Shaplin moves into the role in the next few months. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the past year that we have really had the level of connectivity to sustain these networks.\u201d\n\nOn top of enhanced technology, Barron said each board members\u2019 individual experience with rural health was paramount to reconvening the association.\n\n\u201cEverything in rural health is a struggle and a challenge, and we know that from our daily lives working as physicians or directors or any other role in these rural communities,\u201d Barron said. \u201cWe are used to these challenges, which was why getting the association back together was very near and dear to all of us.\u201d\n\nRural communities tend to approach public health in a different way than their urban counterparts, experts point out. Other agencies not necessarily dealing with health care \u2014 such as social services or police departments \u2014 play an active role in public health in many rural areas.\n\n\u201cServices not necessarily in health care are important in building rural communities and rural health care,\u201d said Gutierrez.\n\nLike all board members in the rural health association, Gutierrez wears two hats. His day job is executive director of the Center for Connected Health Policy, a statewide organization working to promote and expand telehealth in California. The center was created in 2008 by the California HealthCare Foundation, which publishes California Healthline.\n\n\u201cWe have a really tall order to ensure those Californians in vast rural areas are going to be reached,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make advancements in telehealth to allow hospitals and clinics in these areas to stay alive.\u201d\n\nMany rural inhabitants are low-income and also tend to be older than city dwellers, according to a 2012 study from the Department of Health Care Services. Medi-Cal expansion has been helpful to the rural population, but getting services in rural areas is still difficult.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act has some things that lend themselves very nicely into an urban setting, but not a rural one,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have a Medi-Cal card. You have to have the services in place to deliver it.\u201d\n\nGetting rural clinics and hospitals running in a manner as sophisticated and modern as their urban counterparts is a major goal of the CSRHA, Gutierrez said.\n\nWords of Warning\n\nWhile bringing together health care providers, physicians, hospitals and IT groups into one cohesive group may have been a good policy strategy for decades, some aren\u2019t so sure it\u2019s the best strategy for today\u2019s rural health care landscape.\n\nSteve Barrow, executive director of CSRHA when it closed in 2013, cautioned that putting all efforts into one group falls short of achieving a truly comprehensive rural health care strategy.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge, huge state, and there\u2019s actually three or four different variations on rural health,\u201d said Barrow, now president and CEO of Ahead California, a health policy advocacy group. \u201cThere are these silos of organizations \u2014 hospitals, clinics, IT, administration \u2014 and we need to have a mix of three or four groups like CRSHA to bridge these silos, not just one.\u201d\n\nBarrow, who is not involved with the revival of CSRHA, pointed to a number of reasons the group disbanded last year. Allowing funders to be part of the leadership, for example, was a mistake he believed the association should be warned not to make again.\n\n\u201cLeadership is insular \u2014 they tend to punish those who don\u2019t want to be in their camp,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have 5.5 million people spread across thousands of miles, there is no way a small organization can effectively build one group that speaks for everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile he supports the new efforts to bring CSRHA back together, he urged the group to make even more departures from previous practices. For example, Barrow suggested hand-selecting board members based on their area of expertise, organizations they are affiliated with and their geographic location. Previously, board members were elected by 40 individuals given a vote around the state\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really good thing that someone is bringing it back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they really need to think about how leadership is put together. To build a rural health association that has geographic, ethnic, gender and safety net diversity, you are going to need a big board, and it\u2019s difficult to accomplish that if you are running it from a clinical administrative framework.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>After a year in the dark, the familiar voice of policy and advocacy for California's rural health communities is coming back.
