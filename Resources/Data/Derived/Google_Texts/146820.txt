History is being made at the Summit of the Americas.

President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro are holding the first substantive meeting between leaders of their countries in more than five decades.

The face-to-face exchange is the latest step in the effort the leaders announced in December to move past years of suspicion and hostility and restore diplomatic relations between the American superpower and the communist island nation situated less than 100 miles off the U.S. southern coast.

Obama and Castro shook hands and exchanged pleasantries before the summit's opening ceremony Friday night.

They also spoke by telephone on Wednesday before Obama departed the White House.
