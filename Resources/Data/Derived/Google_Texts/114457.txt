In a new ruling from the Department of Education, a Chicago-area school district must allow a transgender student who was born male to shower with other members of the girls’ soccer team.

Township High School District 211 had set up a compromise where they had set up “privacy curtains” in the girl’s locker room and required the then eighth-grade student to use the cordoned area. But after a two-year investigation, the DoE found that the arrangement represented discrimination on the basis of sex.

“All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities — this is a basic civil right,” Assistant U.S. Secretary Catherine Lhamon said in a statement.

“This decision makes me extremely happy — because of what it means for me, personally, and for countless others,” the student told CNN. “The district’s policy stigmatized me, often making me feel like I was not a ‘normal person.'”
