Phoenix police are investigating a driver accused in series of crashes that left several people injured.

Officers said a driver of a Chevrolet pickup truck rear-ended one car near 19th and Desert Cove avenues at around midnight.

The Chevy took off heading north on 19th Avenue and rear-ended a second vehicle, which crashed into a pole, Phoenix Police Sgt. Vince Lewis said. One witness said the Chevy rolled over three times.

The driver of the pickup was taken to the hospital.

"His survival is questionable at this time," Lewis said.

Lewis said alcohol may have played a role in the collisions.
