(The rollout of new Affordable Care Act regulations in 2014 won\u2019t directly affect the choices available to Medicare members.)\n\nWithin Medicare, individuals must choose one of two paths: the original fee-for-service Medicare plan, or a federally subsidized Medicare Advantage plan, which typically operates like a health-maintenance or preferred-provider organization. Many who opt for traditional Medicare also purchase a \u201cMedigap\u201d (also known as a \u201cMedicare Supplement\u201d) policy, as well as a separate \u201cPart D\u201d prescription-drug policy, to patch holes in their coverage. Those new to the program face the same choices upon qualifying, an event that, for most, occurs upon turning 65.\n\nSpouses who have different medical conditions\u2014who take different medicines and see different doctors\u2014may be better off in different prescription drug or Medicare Advantage plans, says Walters. Moreover, she adds, some couples make the mistake of assuming that plans that charge the highest premiums deliver the most generous benefits; that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n\nGiven that women tend to live longer than men, it\u2019s especially important for couples to plan so that the dollars available to the survivor stretch further. (Choosing the right Medicare plan is just one factor to consider; for others, see my article, \u201cPlan Finances for Surviving Spouse.\u201d)\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think of health-care costs as part of financial planning, but your planner needs to understand your decisions on Medicare to make sure he or she is allocating money from your portfolio to be able to cover future medical costs,\u201d says Walters. According to Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring this year is estimated to need $220,000 to cover medical expenses throughout retirement.\n\nAccording to a survey Allsup recently conducted among 1,000 individuals ages 65 and older, women are especially concerned about covering retiree medical expenses. Only 55% of women are confident that they have saved enough for health-care costs in retirement, vs. 70% of men. What\u2019s more, only 26% of women and 30% of men have budgeted for health-care cost increases and very few of either sex have saved more than $200,000 for health care in retirement.", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-10-08T13:35:38-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Due to big differences among Medicare\u2019s drug plans, sharing the same insurance is often the wrong move for retirees.", "title": "Why spouses should \u2018split up\u2019 for Medicare", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/10/08/why-spouses-should-split-up-for-medicare/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Anne Tergesen", "article.section": "Retirement", "keywords": "health care,Medicare,prescription drugs", "article.headline": "Why spouses should \u2018split up\u2019 for Medicare", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "health care,Medicare,prescription drugs", "author": "Anne Tergesen", "article.page": "Encore Blog", "description": "Due to big differences among Medicare\u2019s drug plans, sharing the same insurance is often the wrong move for retirees.", "article.published": "2013-10-08T13:35:38-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/10/08/why-spouses-should-split-up-for-medicare/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Due to big differences among Medicare\u2019s drug plans, sharing the same insurance is often the wrong move for retirees.", "title": "Why spouses should \u2018split up\u2019 for Medicare", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/10/08/why-spouses-should-split-up-for-medicare/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Encore", "article.id": "BL-235B-1607", "article.updated": "2013-10-08T13:35:38-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Within Medicare, individuals must choose one of two paths: the original fee-for-service Medicare plan, or a federally subsidized Medicare Advantage plan, which typically operates like a health-maintenance or preferred-provider organization.\nIn fact, spouses \u201cmay be better served by having different Medicare plans \u2026 because their healthcare needs \u2013 and costs \u2013 are going to be different,\u201d says Mary Dale Walters, senior vice president at Allsup Medicare Advisor, a fee-based service that aims to help people pick from among Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and Medicare \u201cPart D\u201d prescription drug plans.\nSpouses who have different medical conditions\u2014who take different medicines and see different doctors\u2014may be better off in different prescription drug or Medicare Advantage plans, says Walters.\nOnly 55% of women are confident that they have saved enough for health-care costs in retirement, vs. 70% of men.\n(The rollout of new Affordable Care Act regulations in 2014 won\u2019t directly affect the choices available to Medicare members.)"}
