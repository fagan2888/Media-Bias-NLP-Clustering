Former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson on Thursday revealed that her former employer quickly lost “interest” in the Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal and Benghazi attacks. Though she felt they were just scratching the surface, the “people that are responsible for deciding what goes on the news” allegedly indirectly encouraged her to stop pursuing the stories.

Attkisson also told host Bill O’Reilly that she heard through “other routes” that she was labeled as “kind of a troublemaker” for continuing to dig into the stories.

“It kind of goes from hot to cold in one day sometimes, where they’re asking you to pursue something heavily then it’s almost as if a light switch goes off and they look at you all of a sudden as if, ‘Why are you bringing me this story?’” the journalist said.

When O’Reilly asked if it’s possible that CBS News is just trying to do stories that will result in the most viewers because they are “third in the ratings,” Attkisson there are likely “larger things at play in the industry.”

“Broadly, there are overarching concerns about, I would say just fear over original investigative reporting,” she said. “There is unprecedented, I believe, influence on media, not just the news, but the images you see everywhere, by well-orchestrated and well-financed campaigns of special interests, political interests and corporations… I think all of that comes into play.”

On the topic of Obamacare, Attkisson said CBS News initially broke several stories about some of the problems with transparency, security and elusive figures, but again media coverage as a whole died down after a couple of weeks of critical reporting.
