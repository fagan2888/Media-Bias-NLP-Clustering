CLEVELAND (AP) — New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson has pledged $11 million in donations to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

The Hall announced Benson’s two gifts Monday, saying the contributions are the largest by any individual in the institution’s 51-year history.

Benson says it’s important to “recognize the origins of our game and embrace the future.”

The Hall says $10 million will be earmarked to the immediate renovation of adjacent Fawcett Stadium, which will be renamed Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

Benson made a $1 million donation after learning of plans for a Hall of Fame Village. It includes a residence for Hall of Famers and former NFL players, a sports and entertainment complex, hotel and conference center, a youth center and playing fields.
