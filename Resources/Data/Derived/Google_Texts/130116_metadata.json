Senate Democrats weren\u2019t the only ones questioning McConnell\u2019s strategy of repeated roll call votes. As Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) quipped to the New York Times earlier this week, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the definition of insanity? Voting for the same bill over and over again?\u201d\n\nWhat is McConnell thinking? The majority leader reportedly holds his cards close to his vest. But my hunch is that there\u2019s more method to his madness than it would appear, even as it exposes the GOP to charges that it can\u2019t govern.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s repeated votes tactic might be designed to send a signal to House and Senate GOP conservatives that Democrats are resolute in their opposition to the immigration riders. Repeated votes might be intended to demonstrate to Republicans that coupling Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and immigration riders is a dead-end strategy, given that Democrats have rallied around their party\u2019s position. As an opening move toward moderating the GOP\u2019s position, repeated votes might simply be a signal to conservatives to move on to the as-yet-undefined \u201cPlan B.\u201d\n\nMy hunch is that the \u201csend the message\u201d strategy underestimates McConnell\u2019s incentives as Senate leader. Rather than using votes to encourage conservatives to back down from the House-passed bill, McConnell might simply be playing a bicameral partisan blame game: Make clear to Speaker John A. Boehner that the House GOP has to back down first \u2014 given Senate rules that undermine the power of Senate majorities. Why would McConnell try to force the House to go first? Such a move would allow McConnell to (try to) avoid blame for buckling to Democrats, allowing him to claim to conservatives in his conference that he fought the good fight and had no choice but to adopt the House\u2019s concessions. Of course, Boehner has already signaled publicly that he\u2019s not ready to take the bait: \u201cHe\u2019s got a tough job over there,\u201d Boehner said this week. \u201cI\u2019ve got a tough job over here. God bless him and good luck.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, McConnell\u2019s strategy might just be delay, hoping that repeated votes give the GOP a chance to turn public opinion to its side. As Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) noted this week, \u201cI\u2019m hoping public opinion starts to recognize that it\u2019s not Republicans who are objecting or obstructing.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s just a different blame game. Rather than blame the speaker and the House, McConnell seeks to blame Democrats, encouraging them to move closer to the House conservatives\u2019 position.\n\nIt would not be complete insanity to use repeated cloture votes on motions to proceed to a bill to secure minority party concessions. Although three or more cloture votes on such motions are not common, we do have ample precedents from the Senate\u2019s recent past that suggest the tactic does sometimes help to break down minority resistance. Then-Senate majority leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in 1996 filed eight cloture motions on a motion to proceed to a resolution that would indefinitely extend the chamber\u2019s Whitewater investigation. One month of cloture votes later, Democrats conceded to a two-month extension.\n\nOf course, majorities also sometimes find themselves compelled to compromise after repeated cloture votes to get a bill on the Senate floor. Senate Democrats conceded a major plank of the \u201cmotor voter\u201d bill (with McConnell leading the filibustering Republicans in 1993 against his fellow Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford) to secure votes for cloture. Senate Democrats in 2010 also amended the bill that would become Dodd-Frank to secure GOP votes for cloture after repeated cloture votes on motions to proceed to the bill. And those concessions came even as Republicans weathered headlines suggesting overwhelming public support for financial regulatory reform.\n\nThe bottom line is that both parties today are playing a blame game \u2014 seeking to win the messaging battle over the GOP\u2019s effort to rescind the president\u2019s immigration orders. Neither party at this point has an incentive to fold. And of course Democrats in October 2013 believed that Republicans paid a reputational price for shutting down the government over defunding Obamacare. (Although some House conservatives claim that shutting down the government produced a larger House GOP in the 2014 elections, the more immediate outcome was that the GOP brand name plummeted and Democrats secured a clean spending bill and raised the debt limit.)\n\nWith a veto promised from the White House, Democrats today have every incentive to wait out McConnell\u2019s voting strategy until the GOP offers a clean spending bill. In the meantime, the rest of us can sit back and watch a bicameral GOP figure out how to resolve an impasse of its own making and to move on to other governing challenges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A closer look at the legislative impasse inside the Republican party.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A closer look at the legislative impasse inside the Republican party.", "title": "The McConnell-Boehner bicameral blame game", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/06/the-mcconnell-boehner-bicameral-blame-game/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/novemberAP101103114977-3005.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/02/06/the-mcconnell-boehner-bicameral-blame-game/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ppinclude, Congress, Senate, Republicans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "ppinclude, Congress, Senate, Republicans"}, "article_summary": "Rather than blame the speaker and the House, McConnell seeks to blame Democrats, encouraging them to move closer to the House conservatives\u2019 position.\nIt would not be complete insanity to use repeated cloture votes on motions to proceed to a bill to secure minority party concessions.\nOf course, majorities also sometimes find themselves compelled to compromise after repeated cloture votes to get a bill on the Senate floor.\nSenate Democrats in 2010 also amended the bill that would become Dodd-Frank to secure GOP votes for cloture after repeated cloture votes on motions to proceed to the bill.\nOne month of cloture votes later, Democrats conceded to a two-month extension."}
