They will learn basic engineering practices to create solutions to brainteasers presented to them. In this five-day camp, students will design a new project each day and learn how it relates to everyday and real-world experiences.

It is open to students in grades nine through 12.\n\nIn the Do-It-Yourself Camp, students will experiment with different areas of manufacturing and engage in hands-on projects.

Harris Campus June 15-19.\n\nEach camp is one week in duration and lasts from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The cost is $105 per camper and includes a T-shirt and snacks.
