In the same way you do not need to be in poor physical shape before scheduling routine exams with a physician, you also do not need to have poor mental health to see a therapist or counselor.\n\nIn fact, you should not shy away at all from seeing a professional for your mental health, and there are U.S. laws in place to protect your right to mental health care! More specifically, the Affordable Care Act cites mental health care as an essential benefit for all. From personal growth to providing support through a difficult time, counseling can provide a wealth of positive benefits for your emotional wellbeing.\n\nTherapy gives you a new viewpoint. Say you\u2019re stuck in a tough situation at work or at home that you can\u2019t get off your mind. Maybe your co-workers are driving you crazy or you\u2019re having relationship problems with your partner. Friends can offer you advice and a compassionate ear. But therapists have an outsider\u2019s view, are trained to help you and are more apt to tell you what you need to hear versus what you want to hear. Therapy brings meaning back into your life. We often go about our busy, daily lives feeling unfulfilled. Maybe everything is going relatively well, but you still feel like something\u2019s missing. Counselors offer direction and guidance, and will hold you accountable to your life goals. Therapy helps you grow as a person. Talking with a therapist provides an opportunity to reflect on how you envision your life. Therapists and counselors encourage their clients to reflect on their thoughts, behaviors and actions, challenging old and ineffective ways of thinking. That deeper understanding of who you are and what matters most to you in the world will inevitably lead to self-growth. Therapy boosts your self-confidence. Maybe your greatest challenge has little to do with external problems or your health. Maybe the biggest problem you have is how you feel about yourself. If negative thoughts are preventing you from seeking what truly makes you happy in life, therapy might be what you need. A therapist can teach you how to transform negative thoughts into more positive ones and feeling heard and understood can go a long way in increasing your sense of self-worth and confidence. Therapy can help you make a decision. Perhaps you\u2019re stuck in a rut because you\u2019re unable to move forward with a decision of some kind. Therapists can teach you skills, coping techniques and an objective way of seeing things to help you make the best decision for you.\n\nCounseling offers new insights about the world that can dramatically improve your relationships as well as your emotional health. Almost everybody has something to gain from it.\n\nIn fact, research shows expressing your feelings can minimize difficult emotions such as anger, pain and grief. There is, however, one requirement needed to reap the benefits of therapy or counseling. Psychotherapist Jeffrey Sumber, MA, states in this article, \u201cThere are clearly some clients who are 99 percent against changing their behaviors or thoughts, but it takes one percent, some thread of interest or hope, for the process to be successful.\u201d\n\nThe good news? If you have an ounce of interest, desire or openness to receiving support, you\u2019ll be on your way to not only prevent illness, but improve your overall emotional wellness and wellbeing.\n\nPhoto Credit: Teeejayy\n\nMegan Dottermusch is the community manager for Counseling@Northwestern, the masters in counseling program offered by The Family Institute at Northwestern, online.
