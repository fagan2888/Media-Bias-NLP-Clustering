An Egyptian navy ship in the Mediterranean Sea was allegedly targeted and hit by an Islamic State-affiliated missile attack.

State of Sinai claimed responsibility for attacking a military ship near Rafah, on the border with Gaza, CNN reported Friday. The group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in 2014.

Several photos were released by the terrorist group to back up its claim. Although unauthenticated by CNN, Egyptian army spokesman Gen. Mohammad Samir said in a statement that an incident took place during a patrol for “terrorist elements.” He said no one was injured.

State of Sinai also claimed responsibility for the July 1 terrorist attacks in the region that killed 17 members of Egypt’s security forces. The group lost 100 fighters during those clashes.
