To hold onto their illegal Obamacare subsidy that no other American earning $174,000 could get, members of Congress are trying to silence the subsidy\u2019s chief critic, Sen. David Vitters, by dredging up a 2007 unproven accusation that Vitters patronized a prostitute before being elected to the Senate.\n\nShockingly, the cabal also proposes that any member of Congress who votes for Vitter\u2019s proposal would be ineligible for the subsidy if Vitter fails and the subsidy stays. Has anyone in Congress read the Constitution? You can\u2019t make a lawmaker\u2019s future remuneration dependent on how he votes.\n\nAt the center of this tawdry cabal are none other than the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, Barbara Boxer and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D. Nevada).\n\nHere are the facts behind the stench:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act Sect. 1312(d) requires that members of Congress and their staffs enroll in the health plans offered on the exchanges. The thinking behind that provision is that what\u2019s good enough for the public ought to be good enough for Congress. It sounded good in 2010, when the law was enacted, but now politicians are getting cold feet.\n\nUntil now, members of Congress received a 75 percent subsidy funded by taxpayers to enroll in the Federal Health Benefits Program. Signing up for Obamacare will cost them thousands of dollars because the law does not entitle anyone earning $174,000 (base salary for Congress) to get a subsidy. Yikes! Congress doesn\u2019t think the Affordable Care Act is affordable for them.\n\nJust before Congress\u2019 August recess, Republican and Democratic leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, pressed President Obama to do something. Ignoring the fact that the president has no constitutional authority to change the law and arrange for a subsidy that will cost taxpayers at least $55 million a year, members of Congress put their self-interest first.\n\nThe president complied and weaseled an illegal arrangement with the Office of Personnel Management to award members of Congress and their staff a 75 percent subsidy to pay for their own Obamacare health plans. It\u2019s in a new official OPM ruling.\n\nShockingly, there\u2019s still a handful of lawmakers with scruples. Vitters, along with Sens. Mike Enzi, Ron Johnson Jim Inhofe and Mike Lee held up a Senate vote last week on an unrelated energy bill by trying to attach an amendment eliminating Congress\u2019s Obamacare subsidy. In the House, Rep. Ron DeSantis offered the same measure.\n\n\u201cThis legislation blows the whistle on this all-too-familiar Washington game of putting the ruling class first,\u201d said DeSantis.\n\nDon\u2019t depend on the subsidy\u2019s supporters to defend it on the merits. There are none. Instead, according to draft legislation obtained by Politico, Democrats are weighing whether to eliminate health care subsidies for lawmakers for whom there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d that they patronized prostitutes, or to deny the subsidy to lawmakers who vote for Vitter\u2019s amendment.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid is acting like an old-time Vegas mafia thug, and a desperate one at that,\u201d Vitter said in a statement. \u201cThis just shows how far Washington insiders will go to protect their special Obamacare exemption.\u201d\n\nThese goings-on help to explain why Congress\u2019s job approval rating is 11 percent approve, versus 75 percent disapprove (Fox 9/6 to 9/8).\n\nCongress already lavishes itself with perks most Americans would find disgusting: private elevators, private gyms, free parking at airports and large office budgets. When a member or former member dies, even of old age, the family is awarded the member\u2019s salary for a year. But when a member of our armed services dies in battle, that family gets far less.\n\nThe lesson: Congress looks out for itself, not for us. It\u2019s time to clean the Augean stables. The Election Day 2014 is coming none too soon.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former Lt. governor of New York and the author of \u201cBeating Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Congress looks out for itself, not for us.", "title": "Sex and subsidies in the nation's capital", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/zumawireworldphotosfour8097-480x319.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/18/sex-and-subsidies-in-the-nations-capital/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Congress looks out for itself, not for us.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/zumawireworldphotosfour8097-480x319.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Congress looks out for itself, not for us."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2cd\"", "article_summary": "1312(d) requires that members of Congress and their staffs enroll in the health plans offered on the exchanges.\nUntil now, members of Congress received a 75 percent subsidy funded by taxpayers to enroll in the Federal Health Benefits Program.\nWhen a member or former member dies, even of old age, the family is awarded the member\u2019s salary for a year.\nThe thinking behind that provision is that what\u2019s good enough for the public ought to be good enough for Congress.\nMike Enzi, Ron Johnson Jim Inhofe and Mike Lee held up a Senate vote last week on an unrelated energy bill by trying to attach an amendment eliminating Congress\u2019s Obamacare subsidy."}
