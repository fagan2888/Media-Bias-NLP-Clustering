Rick Scott.\n\nThis year lawmakers approved $15.5 million to finally begin stitching together a patchwork of trails into one continuous path from St. Petersburg to Merritt Island.\n\nThat network includes the Fred Marquis Pinellas Trail, a popular segment running along an old rail line from downtown St. Petersburg to Tarpon Springs.\n\nScott vetoed $50 million set aside last year. But the project is a favorite of incoming Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, a triathlete who\u2019s been trying to persuade Scott to approve it this year.\n\nTrail advocates say the completed connector will prove a boon to the state economy, creating jobs and boosting tourism and outdoor activities, which will bring dollars to local communities.\n\nAnd when the whole thing is completed, bicyclists and others will have an uninterrupted shot from Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt a news conference last year, Scott said, \u201cI love to bike,\u201d but added that he considered it more appropriate to fund such projects through the state Department of Transportation rather than individual bills.\n\nScott spokesman John Tupps didn\u2019t hint at what might happen this time.\n\n\u201cOur office will work within the June 4 deadline to produce the best state budget that invests in Florida\u2019s future and puts the state on a path toward continued job growth and opportunity for every family,\u201d Tupps said.\n\nGardiner said he recently attended a groundbreaking ceremony in Titusville with Scott, who \u201cindicated he was a strong supporter\u201d of the trail.\n\nThe $50 million vetoed last year was intended to be spent over five years, and Scott told him he preferred the money be similarly spread out over consecutive budgets, he said.\n\n\u201cSo history tells me we\u2019re going in the right direction,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\nThe $15.5 million toward the trail is included in a $216.5 million line item in the 2014-15 state budget, said Florida Senate spokeswoman Katie Betta. That entry is for \u201carterial highway construction\u201d out of the State Transportation Trust Fund.\n\nAnother $11.4 million is earmarked for the connector in the Transportation Department\u2019s tentative work plan, she added, for a total of nearly $27 million.\n\nA separate bill (SB 2514) passed this year authorizes the department to \u201cuse appropriated funds to support the establishment of a statewide system of interconnected multiuse trails.\u201d\n\nThe connector isn\u2019t mentioned by name in that bill, but it does give specific priority to \u201can interconnected system of trails by completing gaps between existing trails.\u201d\n\nAn economic impact study done last year for the Florida Greenways and Trails Foundation estimated that areas adjoining the trail \u201cwill realize an annual economic benefit of $120 million.\u201d\n\nThe study said the Pinellas trail \u201cis already regarded as an important engine for economic growth\u201d and noted that a survey of Florida trail users showed each visitor spends about $20 per visit. More than 1 million people yearly use trails in the central part of the state.\n\nRoughly three-quarters of the cross-state byway \u2014 a little more than 200 miles \u2014 is built and open to the public. That\u2019s because they first were independent trails.\n\nTo make one unified trail, there are eight gaps to fill. The longest is a nearly 20-mile stretch in south Sumter County. All in all, the gaps account for about 66 miles.\n\nCurrent estimates range from $42 million to $74 million to complete the trail. Those figures use information from local governments and planning organizations.\n\nThe uncertainty stems in part from not knowing which right-of-way land the state will need to buy to fill the gaps, said Dale Allen, Florida Greenways and Trails Foundation president.\n\nAllen hopes future Legislatures continue to fund the connector to completion; the finished trail is sure to stoke even more ecotourism, including running and bird-watching, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat tourist interested in doing something other than playing golf won\u2019t be interested in active, outdoor recreation?\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe bicyclists get all the credit, but most users are just walking these corridors.\u201d\n\nHolly Parker, a vice president of the Florida Trails Association, also touts the trail as a connector for two of the state\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas \u2014 Tampa Bay and Orlando.\n\n\u201cAnd being able to go from coast to coast,\u201d Parker said, \u201cis going to be spectacular.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 24 May 2014 18:10:32 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 The future of the Coast to Coast Connector, a planned 275-mile bike and pedestrian trail across Florida, is again in the hands of Gov.
