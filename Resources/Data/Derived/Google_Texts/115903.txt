Providers of prescription drug discount cards are increasing their efforts to reach out to employers, even as the Affordable Care Act is expected to decrease the ranks of those most likely to use the cards Â– those without health insurance.

The FamilyWize Community Service Partnership, which seeks to reduce the cost of prescription medicine for children, families and individuals by $1 billion by the end of 2015, is one provider looking to educate more employers about its discount card program.
