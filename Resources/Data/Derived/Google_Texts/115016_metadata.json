(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nROCHESTER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paychex, Inc., a leading provider of payroll, human resource, insurance, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses, today released the results of its latest Paychex Small Business Snapshot, which asked business owners if they have started tracking employees\u2019 hours in preparation for the Employer Shared Responsibility (ESR) provisions outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nESR provisions, which require IRS year-end reporting from subject business owners, are in place to determine if full-time employees are offered adequate and affordable health care coverage. Beginning in January 2016 for the tax year 2015, businesses with 100+ full-time employees, including full-time equivalents, may be subject to ESR penalty assessments. Businesses with 50-99 full-time employees in 2014, including full-time equivalents, may be eligible for relief from ESR penalties for the year 2015, but only if they meet specific qualifications. Such employers must still complete IRS year-end reporting requirements in order to certify their eligibility for such exemption.\n\nAccording to the Paychex Small Business Survey, of the more than 300 business owners surveyed, roughly 4 in every 5 (81 percent) with 100-500 employees reported they have begun tracking employees\u2019 hours. Of those business owners with 20-99 employees, more than 70 percent reported they are already tracking employee hours in anticipation of ESR provisions.\n\n\u201cThe results of this survey indicate that most business owners are aware of the need to act on healthcare reform and the provisions laid out by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Martin Mucci, Paychex president and CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s an even more positive sign to see the majority of business owners with less than 100 employees have already begun tracking hours, given that if they qualify for transition relief, they won\u2019t be at immediate risk this year like those with 100+ employees.\n\n\u201cPaychex is committed to helping businesses understand and comply with the regulations associated with ACA and will continue to provide them with the answers, information, and solutions they need,\u201d Mucci added.\n\nTo view the Paychex Small Business Snapshot, click here.
