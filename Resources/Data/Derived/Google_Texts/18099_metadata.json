Fortunately, this report points to a large number of options for reducing emissions.\u201d\n\nThe global transportation sector contributes about 25 percent of the world\u2019s energy-related carbon emissions, and those emissions could double to 50 percent if countries and businesses don\u2019t act soon to slash emissions, the report says.\n\nIf those emissions aren\u2019t slashed, the report paints a bleak picture of how roads, rails, bridges, shipping and aviation could be affected.More than half of global production of crude oil is used for transportation, and 94 percent of the energy used to fuel trains, airplanes, highway vehicles and ships is supplied by crude oil, according to the report.\n\nRoadways could be impacted in a variety of ways: Asphalt pavement could be softened in heat waves, requiring resurfacing with more durable materials. Flooding in low-lying areas is likely to force highway departments to improve drainage on roads and maintain them more frequently. Bridges may need to be retrofitted to withstand greater flooding, costing $250 billion in the U.S. through 2065.\n\nRailroads could be affected in similar ways, the report says, but high temperatures during heat waves could buckle tracks, and urban subway systems could be more exposed to flooding in the same way Hurricane Sandy severely damaged the New York City subway and New Jersey\u2019s PATH train tunnels in 2012, paralyzing the city.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new IPCC report details the myriad ways CO2 emissions threaten roads, ports and planes", "author": "Bobby Magill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new IPCC report details the myriad ways CO2 emissions threaten roads, ports and planes", "title": "Climate change could make cheap travel a thing of the past", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/climate_change_could_make_cheap_travel_a_thing_of_the_past_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_129132983.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new IPCC report details the myriad ways CO2 emissions threaten roads, ports and planes", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_129132983.jpg", "title": "Climate change could make cheap travel a thing of the past", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Climate change could make cheap travel a thing of the past", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Central, Climate Change, Energy, Greenhouse gases, Travel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5d4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Climate Central, Climate Change, Energy, Greenhouse gases, Travel, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on Climate CentralThe transportation sector is a major contributor to climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions, and, worldwide, it\u2019s also one of the most vulnerable sectors to the effects of climate change, according to a new report.\nTransportation could be both a cause and a casualty of climate change, according to the Cambridge-BSR report.\nRoadways could be impacted in a variety of ways: Asphalt pavement could be softened in heat waves, requiring resurfacing with more durable materials.\nThose are the findings of a new report, \u201cClimate Change: Implications for Transport,\u201d released Monday by Cambridge University and sustainable business advocacy group Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) outlining what the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report mean for global transportation.\nFlooding in low-lying areas is likely to force highway departments to improve drainage on roads and maintain them more frequently."}
