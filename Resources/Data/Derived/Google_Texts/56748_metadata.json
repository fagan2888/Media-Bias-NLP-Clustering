The $400 million, eight-story museum is set to open near the National Mall in 2017.\n\nThe specific artifacts to be displayed in Washington haven\u2019t been settled, officials said, though they will be related to the Bible. Plans call for both a permanent exhibition and rotating special exhibits. In 1993, the Israel Antiquities Authority exhibited the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Library of Congress in Washington.\n\nResearchers and curators from the Israeli authority will write the exhibition text based on their research from numerous excavations in the field, and the museum will design the exhibit, said Jacob Fisch, the executive director of the New York-based Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority.\n\n\u201cWe share one mission, and that\u2019s telling the story that is based on the archaeological material,\u201d Fisch said of the museum partnership. \u201cWe\u2019re very scientifically based, research based.\u201d\n\nThis handout photo provided by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) shows pottery ... more >\n\nWhile the Israeli group has a long-term loan arrangement with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to display about 30 objects, the Bible museum exhibit will include hundreds or even thousands of objects from Israel\u2019s 2 million artifacts.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of exhibits that travel around the world. We have a long-term exhibit at the Met,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have our own gallery in which we can keep material for a whole number of years on a long-term loan basis.\u201d\n\nThe Museum of the Bible already holds a collection of about 40,000 objects from its founder, Hobby Lobby President Steve Green. The Green Collection includes rare biblical texts and artifacts, such as cuneiform tablets dating to the time of Abraham, Torah scrolls and rare printed Bibles.\n\n\u201cWhen we set out to build the best new museum in the world, we knew the museum would be even better if we joined forces with some of the greatest collections anywhere,\u201d said Museum President Cary Summers in announcing the Israeli agreement.\n\nThe museum also is beginning its own archaeological dig at Tel-Shimron, a historic site in Israel.\n\nGreen, the museum\u2019s chairman, is known for funding conservative and evangelical causes. He provided seed money to begin building the $400 million Bible museum.
