Toby Cosgrove, Cleveland Clinic CEO, discusses ways to reform the health care system the in U.S and make it more affordable. We are really concerned about the epidemic of obesity which now accounts for 10 percent of the health care costs in the United States, Cosgrove says.

Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove told CNBC on Friday he's not seeing an influx of newly insured Americans whose Obamacare coverage began with the new year.

"We can't really detect a noticeable change in the number of people coming. But it's way too early to tell," Cosgrove said in a "Squawk Box" interview. "I don't think a week or two makes a season."

About 2.1 million people enrolled in Obamacare as of Jan. 1â€”buying private health plans on the federally operated marketplace, HealthCare.gov, or one of the state-run exchanges. Coverage began in the new year for those who had signed up by Dec. 24.

There's been some anecdotal evidence from around the nation that people with Obamacare plans are still using emergency rooms as their primary means of getting treatment.

"I wouldn't be surprised if people continue to do this," acknowledged Cosgrove, a supporter of Obamacare. "It's going to take a long time before we see the effects of this law moving people in a different direction."

House Republicans are expected to hold votes Friday on two measures aimed at requiring more disclosures about security and performance issues on the federal exchange, which got off to a rocky start after launching on Oct. 1.
