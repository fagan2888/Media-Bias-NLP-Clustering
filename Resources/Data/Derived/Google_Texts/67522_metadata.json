During part of her time at the State Department, Abedin was reclassified as an SGE, which allowed her to enter into employment with both the Clinton Foundation and with Teneo Holdings, a consulting firm whose president is Douglas Band, a close associate of the Clintons.\n\nAbedin\u2019s close relationship with Hillary Clinton has led to calls for her testimony in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Her Pakistani heritage and the fact that she is a Muslim have even led some members of the GOP to allege that she is a foreign agent working against U.S. interests.\n\nBut the issues apparently being looked at by the Office of the Inspector General are, according to Grassley, far more mundane, involving potential \u201ctheft of public money through time and attendance fraud\u201d as well as potential conflicts of interest resulting from her multiple jobs at the State Department, Teneo and the Clinton Foundation.\n\nRelated: As Planned Parenthood Spending Brawl Rages on, Dems See an Edge\n\nSpecifically, the Inspector General is looking into $33,000 that Abedin was paid as compensation for vacation time that went unused during her time at the State Department. According to Grassley, there is evidence to suggest that Abedin, who was pregnant and gave birth during her tenure there, actually did use at least some of the time for which she later requested to get paid.\n\nAdditionally, the letter suggests that Abedin might have used her position with State to benefit Teneo or Band, its president. Band was apparently a party to thousands of emails to and from Abedin during her time at State. The emails, said Grassley raise \u201cseveral troubling allegations of Ms. Abedin being solicited for and delivering favors for preferred individuals.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know whether Abedin actually used her position at State improperly, or whether she received compensation to which she wasn\u2019t entitled. But it\u2019s not too soon at all to predict that between now and the 2016 elections, Abedin will be a major talking point for Republicans trying to derail Clinton in her effort to win the Oval Office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s too soon to know whether Hillary Clinton\u2019s aide Huma Abedin actually used her position at the Department of State improperly, or whether she received compensation to which she wasn\u2019t entitled.
