Filling in for John Fox during the most difficult stretch of the Broncos\u2019 schedule, Del Rio posted an impressive 3-1 record as interim head coach.\n\nWhen the team plane landed back in Denver on Sunday night, Del Rio\u2019s job as boss was done. Fox will be back Monday morning as head coach while Del Rio returns to his full-time role as defensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cHe has great command in team meetings, addressing the team and you can tell he has been an experienced head coach,\u201d Manning said of Del Rio.\n\nAfter the Broncos defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-28, Sunday, team front office boss John Elway presented Del Rio with the game ball.\n\n\u201cIt was special to have John Elway recognize the things I did, but I basically want to say that is just a representation of what we all did,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about me. It was a collective effort.\u201d\n\nLike most teams, the Broncos have encountered their share of devastating injuries, suspensions and controversies. But losing a head coach in midseason was an extraordinary predicament. Fox had been on four-week medical leave after undergoing heart-valve replacement surgery.\n\n\u201cOur team has faced a lot of adversity in just a short time,\u201d Manning said. \u201cYou never expect your head coach not to be with you the entire time. But coach Del Rio has done a great job keeping us together. It was a pretty tough four-game stretch he had to endure and the team responded. But we are certainly glad to have coach Fox back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jack Del Rio goes 3-1 as Broncos coach, impresses John Elway", "title": "Jack Del Rio goes 3-1 as Broncos coach, impresses John Elway", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/jack-del-rio-goes-3-1-as-broncos-coach-impresses-john-elway/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131201__jack-del-rio-broncosp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131201__jack-del-rio-broncosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-01T20:15:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:57:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3085\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Jack Del Rio tried to succeed as an NFL head coach while his team played against Peyton Manning twice a year.\nFilling in for John Fox during the most difficult stretch of the Broncos\u2019 schedule, Del Rio posted an impressive 3-1 record as interim head coach.\nBut coach Del Rio has done a great job keeping us together.\nFox will be back Monday morning as head coach while Del Rio returns to his full-time role as defensive coordinator.\nAfter the Broncos defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-28, Sunday, team front office boss John Elway presented Del Rio with the game ball."}
