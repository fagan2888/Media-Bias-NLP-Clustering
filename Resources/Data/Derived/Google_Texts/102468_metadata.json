Not much remains of the Left\u2019s panicked efforts to somehow pin the blame on Republicans by the time the corpse of Detroit is sewed up and passed along to the undertakers of history:\n\nDetroit is broke, but it didn\u2019t have to be. An in-depth Free Press analysis of the city\u2019s financial history back to the 1950s shows that its elected officials and others charged with managing its finances repeatedly failed \u2014 or refused \u2014 to make the tough economic and political decisions that might have saved the city from financial ruin. Instead, amid a huge exodus of residents, plummeting tax revenues and skyrocketing home abandonment, Detroit\u2019s leaders engaged in a billion-dollar borrowing binge, created new taxes and failed to cut expenses when they needed to. Simultaneously, they gifted workers and retirees with generous bonuses. And under pressure from unions and, sometimes, arbitrators, they failed to cut health care benefits \u2014 saddling the city with staggering costs that today threaten the safety and quality of life of people who live here.\n\nAfter observing that divisive Mayor Coleman Young wasn\u2019t really that bad of a money manager, while supposedly technocratic Kwame Kilpatrick was even worse than conventional wisdom holds, the Free Press gets down to the bottom line: it was decades of tax-and-spend liberalism, mixed with political corruption, that killed the city.\n\nDecades of mismanagement added to Detroit\u2019s fiscal woes. The city notoriously bungled multiple federal aid programs and overpaid outrageously to incentivize projects such as the Chrysler Jefferson North plant. Bureaucracy bogged down even the simplest deals and contracts. In a city that needed urgency, major city functions often seemed rudderless. When all the numbers are crunched, one fact is crystal clear: Yes, a disaster was looming for Detroit. But there were ample opportunities when decisive action by city leaders might have fended off bankruptcy. If Mayors Jerome Cavanagh and Roman Gribbs had cut the workforce in the 1960s and early 1970s as the population and property values dropped. If Mayor Dennis Archer hadn\u2019t added more than 1,100 employees in the 1990s when the city was flush but still losing population. If Kilpatrick had shown more fiscal discipline and not launched a borrowing spree to cover operating expenses that continued into Mayor Dave Bing\u2019s tenure. Over five decades, there were many \u2018if only\u2019 moments. \u201cDetroit got into a trap of doing a lot of borrowing for cash flow purposes and then trying to figure out how to push costs (out) as much as possible,\u201d said Bettie Buss, a former city budget staffer who spent years analyzing city finances for the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan. \u201cThat was the whole culture \u2014 how do we get what we want and not pay for it until tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThat might serve as a fitting epitaph for the entire United States in a couple of years. There\u2019s nothing sadder than watching the Left systematically loot and pillage young people, cashing out the future to finance today\u2019s vote-buying schemes, picking their pockets with crazy boondoggles like ObamaCare\u2026 and still racking up the lion\u2019s share of the vote from their victims, using celebrity endorsements and the rhetoric of fashionable libertine abandon. (In reality, the foot soldiers of Big Government are marching right into your bedroom, clipboards at the ready.)\n\nTo those who pile up maddening amounts of debt while assuring us tomorrow will never come: tomorrow has been delivered to Detroit, and the rusted UPS truck of History is now bumping and creaking along to its next destination, a skeletal hand firm upon the steering wheel. The Congressional Budget Office just released a new long-term debt study that concluded federal public debt will surpass our national GDP in just 25 years\u2026 if you make a lot of absurdly rosy assumptions and completely ignore the \u201charm that growing debt would cause to the economy,\u201d something the CBO admits it cannot reliably estimate. So 2038 is sort of an absolute maximum best-case date for the entire American system to go the way of Detroit.\n\nEverything Barack Obama and his allies say today, the corrupt Democrats who destroyed Detroit were saying yesterday. Spending restraint was delayed until it was far too late to make a difference\u2026 a point that was reached some years before outright collapse. Benefit entitlements accumulated until there was no way for the private sector to keep its public overlords in the style to which they had become accustomed. Do you like those special ObamaCare subsidies handed out to rich Congressional representatives and their six-figure staffers? Detroit politicians have been looting the city\u2019s treasury like that for decades. Games were played with the growing mass of Detroit\u2019s debt until Kwame Kilpatrick rolled snake eyes.\n\nCertainly the fortunes of the auto industry played a role in all this, but one of the big problems was the general acceptance of the Left\u2019s mythology about postwar prosperity. It wasn\u2019t the New Deal that put American industry on top of the world; it was the saturation-bombing destruction of all other industry. The rest of the world was going to rebuild eventually. No one seemed ready to meet the challenges of that day. The fruit of the boom was treated like an endlessly renewable resource, and devoured by ravenous government. Any government \u2013 or, for that matter, private entity \u2013 is liable to get in deep trouble once its financial commitments leave it without flexibility to meet new crisis. Once everything is mortgaged to the hilt, and the inheritance of all children has been spent, the next crisis becomes an unstoppable catastrophe.\n\nThen you\u2019ve got the process the Detroit Free Press sums up elegantly as \u201cCause and effect: People leave, taxes go up, more people leave.\u201d\n\nAs population declined, the city instituted new taxes or raised existing ones to try and keep up with falling revenues. The total property tax burden for city homeowners, including county and school taxes, rose from 44.79 mills per thousand dollars of value in the mid-\u201960s to 88.178 per thousand by 1991. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like every decade we got a new source of income to keep our ass on the ground,\u201d said Ed Rago, Young\u2019s budget director. But the problem with using taxes to raise revenue was that it made the city a more expensive \u2014 and less attractive \u2014 place to live and do business. People and corporations kept leaving.\n\nThat will happen to America as a whole. It\u2019s happening now, of course \u2013 who in their right minds would move a major business venture into the United States, placing capital and profits within the grasp of a predatory ruling class backed up by legions of dependents? And it\u2019s possible to drop out of the private sector economy without physically leaving American soil \u2013 just ask the entrepreneurs who have closed up shop, or the people dropping completely out of the workforce. Eventually a significant mass exodus of human and financial capital will hit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s pointless to compute the precise date of fiscal Armageddon. Doomsday will come shortly after the smart, rich people conclude doomsday is at hand, and leave.\n\nOne of the excellent animated charts prepared by the Detroit Free Press pinpoints the year in which the number of people collecting pensions exceeded the number of active workers paying for them. That happened in 1991. It\u2019s now almost a 2 to 1 ratio. All that talk of what people \u201cdeserve,\u201d what they were \u201cpromised,\u201d what they\u2019re \u201centitled\u201d to\u2026 eventually none of that matters any more, because there just aren\u2019t enough horses willing to pull the government cart any more, no matter how urgently the ruling class cracks its whips and screams about \u201cobligations.\u201d It might not be too late for the rest of America to learn a few lessons from Detroit, but the point of no return rapidly approaches, well in advance of the cliff\u2019s edge.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "It's not too late to learn the lessons of Detroit, but the point of no return rapidly approaches.", "title": "How taxes and spending killed Detroit | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/detroit_debt-480x265.png", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/17/how-taxes-and-spending-killed-detroit/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "It's not too late to learn the lessons of Detroit, but the point of no return rapidly approaches.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/detroit_debt-480x265.png", "creator": "@@Doc_0", "description": "It's not too late to learn the lessons of Detroit, but the point of no return rapidly approaches.", "card": "summary", "site": "@humanevents"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b10\"", "article_summary": "PoliticsThe Detroit Free Press has an extensive autopsy on the failure of that tormented city, complete with charts and figures.\nOne of the excellent animated charts prepared by the Detroit Free Press pinpoints the year in which the number of people collecting pensions exceeded the number of active workers paying for them.\nThen you\u2019ve got the process the Detroit Free Press sums up elegantly as \u201cCause and effect: People leave, taxes go up, more people leave.\u201dAs population declined, the city instituted new taxes or raised existing ones to try and keep up with falling revenues.\nWhen all the numbers are crunched, one fact is crystal clear: Yes, a disaster was looming for Detroit.\nSo 2038 is sort of an absolute maximum best-case date for the entire American system to go the way of Detroit."}
