(Photo: Thinkstock.com)\n\nKentucky has awarded new contracts to the five private companies that manage its rapidly expanding Medicaid program, its growth fueled by hundreds of thousands of new members under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe growth has been a windfall for some of the companies over the past year, but the new contracts are designed to limit potential profits and address complaints about slow payments and excessively complicated forms and procedures.\n\nCompanies awarded the contracts Wednesday were Passport Health Plan, Anthem, Coventry Cares, Humana and Wellcare.\n\nLast year, four of the companies hired to manage Medicaid \u2014 the government health plan for low-income citizens \u2014 cleared more than $500 million in income above expenses, according to statements companies must file with the Kentucky Department of Insurance. Only Humana posted a loss.\n\nSome of the profits ranged from 7 percent to nearly 18 percent in 2014. The new contracts limit income to about 6 percent and spell out new standards for claims payments and penalties for companies that don't comply.\n\nAdditionally, the state plans to create an \"incentive pool\" to reward companies that show improved health outcomes for members.\n\nAnd it sets requirements for standardizing forms and procedures as well as increased oversight of companies from the state.\n\nAudrey Tayse Haynes, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said officials have learned from four years' experience with Medicaid managed care. The goal of the new contracts is to improve efficiency as well as the health and well-being of more than 1.1 million Kentuckians on Medicaid, she said.\n\nThe new contracts \"will translate into more options and improved services from our managed care companies,\" Haynes said.\n\nState Sen. Ralph Alvarado, a Winchester Republican and family physician who has criticized the state's Medicaid managed care system, said he hopes the new contracts will clear up the problems, including slow payment and non-payment of claims.\n\nAlvarado, co-chairman of the joint House-Senate Medicaid oversight committee, said he knows from personal experience as well as from numerous complaints by hospitals, doctors and other health care providers.\n\n\"That's why I get so hot under the collar,\" Alvarado said. \"While I'm taking care of folks, I'm getting denials like crazy.\"\n\nHe said he also hopes the state succeeds in controlling profits of the managed care companies, calling it an outrage that some companies are reaping millions off the program while denying care or delaying payments.\n\nMike Rust, president of the Kentucky Hospital Association, said his members are pleased to see more standardization built into the contracts for the five companies that previously used separate systems for claims processing, payment and other services.\n\n\"We do like some of the conditions for more standardization,\" he said.\n\nAll of the companies will operate statewide under the one-year contract that began July 1, with the option for four annual renewals.\n\nLouisville-based Passport, the only nonprofit company among the five, said it wants to build on its 20 years of experience providing Medicaid care in Kentucky.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to serve as Kentucky's only nonprofit, provider-sponsored Medicaid health plan for many more years,\" CEO Mark B. Carter said.\n\nLaunched in 2011 primarily as a way to control costs, managed care has saved the state some $1.3 billion in state and federal funds, according to state officials.\n\nThe program expanded rapidly last year under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, transforming Medicaid from a program for the disabled and impoverished women and children to one that offers coverage to anyone under 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThat would cover an individual making less than $16,000 a year or $36,000 a year in household income for a family of four.\n\nAfter Kentucky launched the federal health care expansion through kynect, its health exchange, about 400,000 additional people enrolled in Medicaid and about another 150,000 obtained health plans through the private market.\n\nThat has helped Kentucky dramatically cut its number of citizens without health insurance and with lack of access to care.\n\nState officials say they want to use managed care as a way to ensure more Kentuckians get medical care in hopes of improving the state's overall poor health.\n\nState Medicaid Commissioner Lisa Lee, in a recent interview, called the growth in Medicaid and overall health coverage in Kentucky an \"exciting time.\"\n\n\"I've been in Medicaid for 16 years,\" she said. \"And I keep seeing it get better and better.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1ItYMVg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Program's growth under Obamacare has been a windfall for some of the companies", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Program's growth under Obamacare has been a windfall for some of the companies", "title": "5 Medicaid providers get new Ky. contracts", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/companies/2015/07/01/medicaid-providers-get-new-ky-contracts/29589085/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Program's growth under Obamacare has been a windfall for some of the companies", "title": "5 Medicaid providers get new Ky. contracts", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3591f5539a9dfc4be48235e680b4f0ec7acb95cc/c=812-0-3260-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health insurance", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health insurance", "title": "5 Medicaid providers get new Ky. contracts", "author": "Debby Yetter", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/companies", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/75675e10f95404fb35661a2c4c4ef213269c1f51/c=1118-0-2954-2448/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a50ef8a6b26c47d274b712c11f0b1952229bba55/c=812-0-3260-2448/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21dbdaccdde02ab9e3d3c7e245dbc58ec37f37ca/c=404-0-3668-2448/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4724e77034170e2da3fb8b9fa27a8a65ea49fa8e/c=0-79-4072-2369&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-01T23:27:00.660000-04:00", "shorthed": "Medicaid providers' new Ky contracts", "articleid": 29589085, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7e96889d06702b05f949b137f913c8c02cb2d15/c=0-79-4072-2369/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2705d4a961f593d987d518649c84727ca4643e47/c=1348-0-2725-2448/local/-/media/2015/07/01/Louisville/B9317932184Z.1_20150701183017_000_GOHB815LF.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Medicaid, Kentucky, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Humana, Passport, Medicaid contracts, Anthem, Coventry Cares, Wellcare, Debby Yetter, Kentucky Medicaid providers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36ee\"", "article_summary": "State Medicaid Commissioner Lisa Lee, in a recent interview, called the growth in Medicaid and overall health coverage in Kentucky an \"exciting time.\"\nThe new contracts \"will translate into more options and improved services from our managed care companies,\" Haynes said.\n\"We look forward to continuing to serve as Kentucky's only nonprofit, provider-sponsored Medicaid health plan for many more years,\" CEO Mark B.
