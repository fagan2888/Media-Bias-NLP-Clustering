It would launch a series of actions, from website proposals to contractor hires, that continues to affect the family today.\n\nThe effects of that meeting continue to plague the state. The latest version of the exchange, launched Nov. 15 via the federal healthcare.gov site, works well, but hundreds of residents still lack insurance they paid for, and a lawsuit looms in early 2015.\n\nPlanning for the exchange\u2019s online marketplace, Nevada Health Link, went awry in myriad places. But observers point to bungling in three key areas: a pie-in-the-sky request for proposals for the system; limited project resources; and unusual premium-payment policies.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for someone to blame, that\u2019s a tougher call. There was a state agency with decision-making authority and a contractor who promised experience and expertise. Both were somewhat bound by rigid federal rules.\n\nStill, there are lessons in this story.\n\nTROUBLE AHEAD\n\nBy March 2012, things were clicking for both Linda Rolain and Nevada Health Link.\n\nRolain was mostly recovered from her lung cancer and back at work on the Eastside Cannery casino floor. She was able to enjoy time with her grandchildren and meals out.\n\nExchange officials, meanwhile, had issued a request for proposals \u2014 commonly called an RFP \u2014 seeking contractors to build Nevada Health Link\u2019s website and call center.\n\nYet there were ominous signs in both camps.\n\nRolain was feeling tired, which her family attributed to lingering side effects of radiation and chemotherapy, said her daughter-in-law, Erin Scull.\n\nThe state\u2019s RFP, meanwhile, was unrealistically ambitious, considering its timeline.\n\nA request for proposals is a \u201ccritical document\u201d that establishes the relationship, expectations, imperatives and rewards for an agency and its contractor, said Len Ashby, an information-technology consultant and expert trial witness with the Montreal-based firm Ashby-Bachmann.\n\nGet it wrong, Ashby explained, and the whole project suffers.\n\nThere was a lot wrong with the proposal, Ashby said.\n\nFor starters, it asked for way too much \u2014 one contractor would build the website and launch a customer-service call center. Other state exchanges planned call centers but as separate projects. Connecticut, now considered one of the best state exchanges, did it that way.\n\nNevada would add in premium aggregation, with the contractor collecting payments to forward to insurers, rather than letting insurers bill members directly. No other state tried premium aggregation as a one-stop shop for consumers buying multiple policies.\n\nAlso unusual to Nevada\u2019s exchange were its standalone dental plan and the scope of its small-business marketplace.\n\nA project so ambitious might have worked, with time. But the contractor would have just 15 months. The federal deadline of Oct. 1, 2013, was unmovable \u2014 a schedule \u201cdictated by politics and legislation rather than an objective analysis of what needed to be done,\u201d said Ashby, who reviewed the state\u2019s RFP at the Review-Journal\u2019s request.\n\nThe timeline also was unreasonable based on the number of public and private parties involved and the volume of systems interfaces, some of which had yet to be developed.\n\nNevada wanted a \u201cmiracle,\u201d Ashby said.\n\nThe state\u2019s RFP also showed \u201ca lack of collaboration and shared responsibility implied between (the exchange) and the vendor,\u201d and a \u201crange and nature of items within and out of scope\u201d that \u201cadded complexity and removed control from the vendor,\u201d Ashby said.\n\nWorse still, bidders might not have had time to fully understand the project. The state\u2019s purchasing division issued the RFP on March 26, 2012, and asked for responses by April 27, 2012.\n\n\u201cSimply put, a 30-day response time is way too short for a project like this and probably helped doom the project from the start,\u201d said Larry Allen of Allen Federal Business Partners, a Virginia-based firm that consults and testifies on government contracting and procurement. No contractor \u201ccould possibly have understood the scope and made a reasonable response in this time period.\u201d\n\nThe hard federal deadline was crucial to the system\u2019s failure. But someone had to write the request for proposals. And someone else had to bid, assuring they could handle the job.\n\nBruce Gilbert, executive director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, wasn\u2019t with the agency when the RFP went out. But he said available paperwork shows no one person was responsible for writing it \u2014 exchange staff, outside consultants and staff from other state agencies helped craft the request. The state\u2019s purchasing division, run at the time by Director Jeff Mohlenkamp, was responsible for publishing the request.\n\nRather than intimidating potential vendors, the request drew four competitors: Xerox, Choice Administrators, KPMG and Deloitte Consulting. The purchasing division scored the companies on financial stability, demonstrated competence, experience and performance on comparable contracts, expertise and availability of key personnel and cost. State law requires contracts to go to the highest-scoring company. Xerox edged out Deloitte \u2014 builder of Connecticut\u2019s exchange \u2014 by four points.\n\nThe exchange board awarded Xerox a $72 million contract in July 2012 \u2014 nine months after Linda Rolain\u2019s lung surgery and just weeks before she would start to notice symptoms of a more troubling problem.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Xerox officials knew when they landed the contract that they couldn\u2019t handle the job.\n\nFORESEEABLE ERRORS\n\nXerox has said it underestimated the resources and effort needed to build Nevada Health Link but declined an interview for this article. The company provided only a statement: \u201cUltimately, everyone\u2019s goal has been to provide Nevadans with access to affordable health care. We are proud of the work we have done to that end, and the Xerox team will continue to provide services to Nevada Health Link with the highest level of professionalism and teamwork for the 2014 policy year.\u201d\n\nBut Ashby said any experienced contractor should have seen the risk. Xerox is a Fortune 500 company that won the job based in part on decades of experience with private exchanges and state Medicaid programs.\n\n\u201cIt is reasonable to assume \u2026 they already had extensive resources dedicated to other projects of a similar nature,\u201d Ashby said. \u201cThis can be both an advantage and a liability. While they may not have known at the time that other, similar projects were in jeopardy, they must have realized that there was significant risk of resource scarcity, and project failure, if any of the projects began to slip.\u201d\n\nEven so, vendors are loath to turn away government work, Ashby said, and Nevada\u2019s relatively quick turnaround and a competitive bidding market might have made Xerox overly optimistic. Contractors often \u201chope and expect that client change requests will provide ample opportunity to increase the fees, and exempt them from project delays,\u201d he said.\n\nExchange board Chair Barbara Smith Campbell raised that concern at a board meeting in December 2011, asking if the agency was \u201csetting itself up for change orders because the (RFP) does not reflect policy decisions that the board has not addressed.\u201d\n\nThe exchange did modify the contract in 2013 to accommodate mounting project delays and missed milestones, but with no additional money for Xerox. The company has received about $15 million from its $72 million deal.\n\nSo how much of a problem was the RFP?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pin all of the exchange\u2019s problems on it, Gilbert said, because marketplaces struggled even in states with a smaller scope of work. From Hawaii to Maryland, at least a half-dozen states had major website problems. Xerox wasn\u2019t the exchange contractor for any of them.\n\n\u201cA number of states \u2014 not just Nevada \u2014 bit off more than they could chew,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThere were an awful lot of really smart people who have been successful but who experienced many of the same issues and problems you saw here. And they were using different vendors, consultants and state staffs. It was a widespread issue.\u201d\n\nBut Nevada was alone in how little it would spend on its exchange.\n\nSHORT-CHANGED\n\nJon Hager, the exchange\u2019s first director, boasted in a July 2012 board meeting that the federal government saw Nevada\u2019s contract as a \u201clow-cost example for other states.\u201d\n\nWhile demanding a more complicated build than other exchanges, Nevada Health Link had fewer dollars to make it happen.\n\nIndividual state exchanges requested federal start-up grants for what they estimated as their need. Nevada received $90.8 million in grants. Connecticut, with far fewer system functions, got $164.5 million. Rhode Island claimed $105.3 million. Massachusetts collected $180.1 million. Maryland, $171.1 million.\n\nStaffing disparities have been even starker. Nevada Health Link has 13 employees. Connecticut\u2019s exchange lists 46 staffers on its website; Rhode Island has about 40 employees, Gilbert said.\n\nNevada\u2019s exchange staff is likely the nation\u2019s smallest, he said. That\u2019s partly because the exchange put Xerox in charge of functions such as the call center, which it might otherwise have staffed itself.\n\nStaffing decisions were \u201cbased on attempting to be fiscally responsible, with an understanding that we didn\u2019t want to build a bureaucracy,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWould it have helped to have additional boots on the ground? Maybe. But we don\u2019t think it would have changed the experience. The initial goals for the exchange were extraordinarily ambitious. We wanted to bring 118,000 people into qualified health plans. I think it was misunderstanding the market, not really understanding the demographics and not really recognizing the way this would play out.\u201d\n\nIt made sense for Nevada\u2019s exchange to run leaner than marketplaces in other states because of its small population, Gilbert said. But a more apt measure might be the number of uninsured \u2014 the population the exchanges serve.\n\nNevada in 2013 had roughly 600,000 uninsured residents, or more than 20 percent of its population. Linda Rolain would come to rank among them and would need the exchange\u2019s services.\n\nConnecticut, in contrast, had about 345,000 uninsured residents, according to a 2013 state analysis. Rhode Island had 140,000 uninsured residents in 2010, showed numbers from the Rhode Island Health Care Association. Massachusetts had 242,000 uncovered citizens before 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that better-funded and better-staffed exchanges also failed. Technical glitches forced Massachusetts to change vendors, and Rhode Island\u2019s difficulties had officials weighing a move to the federal healthcare.gov.\n\nBut Nevada Health Link\u2019s own policies contributed to its failure.\n\nNICKELS AND DIMES\n\nInsurance brokers say carriers typically give consumers leeway when a premium payment falls short. If your premium is $100 and you send in $90, they\u2019ll post the payment and send a bill for $110 the next month, said Lou Cila, a broker with Best Nevada Insurance Agency in Las Vegas.\n\nBut Xerox wouldn\u2019t post payments that were as little as a nickel short.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any company that would hold up a payment for 5 cents,\u201d Cila said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Nevadans saw coverage ensnared in the refusal to post short premiums, but the exchange\u2019s premium-aggregation system was generally behind 75 percent of its problems, said Las Vegas broker Pat Casale.\n\nAt the peak of its troubles last winter, the exchange reported more than 30,000 cases where consumers couldn\u2019t sign up for or pay for a plan. It\u2019s unclear from exchange meeting minutes who decided on the payment-posting policy.\n\nCila said it likely wasn\u2019t Xerox.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not the contractor that makes that decision. It\u2019s the exchange or management itself,\u201d he said. \u201cI could never imagine why these things existed. Some of this stuff was so wacky.\n\n\u201cIt would normally be a management decision,\u201d Cila said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even something you would bring to a board meeting.\u201d\n\nGilbert, an experienced private insurance exchange consultant, said it\u2019s difficult to \u201cquestion the judgment\u201d of the agency\u2019s initial decisions.\n\n\u201cThere may have been perfectly good reasons why they did what they did,\u201d said Gilbert, who joined the exchange in August.\n\n\u201cMy preferred way is that money comes in and money goes out, and whether you\u2019re off a nickel, a dollar or $100, ultimately, the insurance company has to decide what to do with people who short-pay.\u201d\n\nNow, the exchange, using healthcare.gov, bills consumers directly, ending premium holdups at the state level.\n\nThat\u2019s because the exchange board decided in May to fire Xerox and move onto the federal system for 2015 enrollments. Xerox will be out once the company finishes administering 2014 plans.\n\nWhile many of the issues that hurt the exchange have been fixed, many Nevadans still feel the pain.\n\nFATAL DELAY\n\nIn January 2013, Linda Rolain was experiencing dizzy spells. She became forgetful and began having vivid dreams of a 19-year-old granddaughter who had recently died.\n\nHer husband, Robert, picked her up from work one afternoon and took her to the doctor. After imaging tests came the diagnosis: A brain tumor. Her symptoms soon forced her onto temporary disability.\n\nIn June 2013 \u2014 as Xerox was starting to miss key deadlines for exchange system testing \u2014 Linda Rolain no longer could work. After her company insurance ran out in July, the family tried to enroll her in Medicaid, but she and Robert had too much income to qualify.\n\nSo in October 2013, the Rolains visited the new nevadahealthlink.com, along with hundreds of thousands of other Nevadans, to enroll in a private, federally subsidized plan. And like thousands of others, they ran into a thicket of technical glitches and red tape.\n\nThey picked a plan, made a payment in November for coverage to begin Jan. 1, and waited for a confirmation letter and membership cards. January came. So did February and March. They paid the $136 premiums every month, but no paperwork arrived.\n\nThe Rolain family\u2019s attorney, Matthew Callister, said Linda\u2019s coverage was ensnared in a series of administrative problems, including ascribing two separate accounts to her.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line was a complete failure to do anything correctly, except take her payments,\u201d Callister said.\n\nApproval for treatment finally came in May, but Linda Rolain\u2019s May 15 surgery came too late. She died in hospice June 30.\n\nCallister said the surgeon told him Rolain\u2019s life \u2014 and quality of life \u2014 could have \u201cat least been extended\u201d by faster treatment.\n\nThe Rolains are now part of a lawsuit over botched exchange policies. Callister said 400 to 500 people have joined the lawsuit since April, and 30 to 50 of them experienced delayed medical treatment. He said 8,000 to 10,000 Nevadans might have paid for plans they never received. If his firm, Callister, Immerman &Associates, wins class-action certification in late January, he said he will investigate the request-for-proposal process and payment-posting practices.\n\n\u201cI served in the Legislature,\u201d said Callister, a Nevada assemblyman and senator in the 1980s and \u201990s. \u201cI\u2019m aware of how easy it is to have a skilled, well-oiled lobbyist approach you and say, \u2018This is Xerox, they\u2019re a good company, they can build this,\u2019 despite whatever the state requirements for bidding were at the time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the exchange said in early December that its list of problem cases was down to around 700.\n\nBut the Rolains still have issues with the exchange.\n\nScull said Robert Rolain, who paid premiums from January until his wife\u2019s death in June, received an October letter warning that if he didn\u2019t catch up on the premiums, Linda would lose her coverage.\n\nHARD LESSONS LEARNED\n\nThe exchange\u2019s initial turmoil doesn\u2019t have to be a total loss if state officials learn from it, observers said.\n\nInvesting 5 percent or less of the contract cost in a \u201cproject health check\u201d could have identified red flags early, Ashby said.\n\nNor is it a bad idea for public employees who deal with RFPs to learn contract management, he added.\n\nFor Gilbert, the message is that the exchange \u201creally fell short in two areas.\u201d Its technology wasn\u2019t \u201crobust\u201d enough, and its customer service wasn\u2019t strong enough.\n\n\u201cSome of that (service) relates back to the technology issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the boat starts to sink, everybody is trying to figure out what to do. Aside from improvements in our technology, one of the things we have made certain of this year is that we can\u2019t be like the proverbial DMV, where you have people wait in line and get to where they think they want to go, only to be told, \u2018No, you belong over there.\u2019 To some degree, that happened last year. So we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about being advocates for consumers, assisting them, and adopting not a bureaucratic mindset but a service mindset.\u201d\n\nThe exchange\u2019s first chapter will soon close. Xerox\u2019s Silver State Health Insurance Exchange contract ends in March, when the company is to wrap work on 2014 enrollments.\n\nThat\u2019s also when Linda Rolain would have turned 65 and become eligible for Medicare, the guaranteed federal insurance program for seniors.\n\nThe irony is not lost on her daughter-in-law, Erin Scull.\n\n\u201cI blame them all. Not only Xerox, but the state exchange, too,\u201d Scull said. \u201cThey tried to slam together a full Thanksgiving meal at 1 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. It\u2019s not gonna happen. You can\u2019t do that much stuff in that little time. You can\u2019t open a website that\u2019s not ready.\u201d\n\nContact Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
