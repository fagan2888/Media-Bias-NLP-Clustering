The Fenway Institute recommends that electronic health records include information about patient sexual orientation and gender identity, including the patient's sex at birth and his or her preferred name and pronoun.\n\nHospitals also must ensure they don't discriminate by sexual orientation, gender identity or sexual gender expression, and that providers and staff understand the health needs of LGBT patients, according to the article.\n\nAn example from the Mayo Clinic illustrated why education is so important. Some staff \"didn't know what LGBT stood for,\" said John Knudsen, M.D., medical director of the Clinical Practice Office of Health Equity and Inclusion.\n\nHe said key lessons at Mayo Clinic included identifying an executive champion for LGBT inclusion issues, aligning LGBT inclusion issues with other efforts to eliminate disparities and aligning healthcare equity with strategic business priorities.\n\nThe potential problems are widespread. One recent study found that few U.S. academic faculty practices have procedures to identify LGBT-competent physicians, or provide comprehensive LGBT-competency training. Another study found that straight providers are unconsciously biased against LGBT patients, although it was unclear whether that bias affected the care they provided.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the H&HN article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLGBT-competent doctors few and far between\n\nStraight healthcare providers unconsciously biased against LGBT patients\n\nTransgender patients form their own health referral networks\n\nHealthcare stereotyping can negatively affect patient outcomes\n\nNurses need cultural competency education to meet needs of diverse patients\n\nACHE 2015: Healthcare must focus on vulnerable populations\n\n4 ways to tackle healthcare disparities", "article_metadata": {"description": "`Hospitals need to understand more about LGBT patients and communicate what they've learned to one another and to patients in order to ensure better treatment of and access for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0published by\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "`Hospitals need to understand more about LGBT patients and communicate what they've learned to one another and to patients in order to ensure better treatment of and access for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0published by\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.", "title": "How hospitals can ensure they better serve LGBT patients", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-hospitals-can-ensure-they-better-serve-lgbt-patients/2015-10-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Fenway Institute,Healthcare Disparities,HR & Workforce Management,LGBT patients,May Clinic,Patient Engagement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Engagement"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals need to understand more about LGBT patients and communicate what they've learned to one another and to patients in order to ensure better treatment of and access for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients, according to an article published by Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.\nHe said the primary challenges in equitably treating LGBT patients are data collection, clinical education, consumer education and patient-centered care.\nHospitals also must ensure they don't discriminate by sexual orientation, gender identity or sexual gender expression, and that providers and staff understand the health needs of LGBT patients, according to the article.\nAnother study found that straight providers are unconsciously biased against LGBT patients, although it was unclear whether that bias affected the care they provided.\nHospital systems devote too little training and attention to LGBT issues, according to Harvey Makadon, M.D., a Harvard Medical School professor and program director at the National LGBT Health Education Center at the Fenway Institute, who spoke at a recent webinar, HHN reports."}
