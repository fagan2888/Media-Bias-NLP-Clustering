He had chided Rubio for campaigning against \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants during his 2010 senate run, but then reversing course when he co-sponsored the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate, but never reached a vote in the House.\n\nImmediately after the town hall ended, Merola discussed Rubio and immigration. He was asked whether he thinks the immigration issue will hurt Rubio\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good-looking young man,\u201dMerola said. \u201cHe\u2019s cute. The women love him. He does a great job, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a good person. There\u2019s no doubts in my mind, and he probably has good intentions, but I\u2019m afraid his political ambitions somehow cloud him at times, that\u2019s my concern. I\u2019m sure he does it with all of them. They\u2019re all opportunists, they wouldn\u2019t be running for this office if they didn\u2019t have big egos, OK?\u201d\n\nMerola says he\u2019s leaning toward the other Cuban-American contender in the race, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cUnlike what Marco just said (in the town hall), he wasn\u2019t the only one to (try to) get rid of Obamacare. The strongest one campaigning to get rid of Obamacare was Cruz, and he got crucified by the establishment of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nMerola says immigration affects all aspects of Americans lives, which is why Rubio\u2019s stance on the issue disturbs him. He also says Rubio\u2019s stance on the issue in Florida is also problematic.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in the Florida Legislature, he supported free tuition for illegal immigrants. So why should I believe all these things coming out of his mouth now? I want to, believe me I want to.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, Rubio co-sponsored a state bill that would provide in-state tuition undocumented immigrants. Last month on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d he said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d stands by the proposal, which was ultimately passed by Rick Scott and the Legislature in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "People attending New Hampshire town-hall meetings this week, especially if they\u2019re undecided, are being besieged by reporters, .
