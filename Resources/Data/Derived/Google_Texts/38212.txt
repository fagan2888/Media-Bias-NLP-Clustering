HAGATNA, Guam (AP) — Guam residents are cleaning up after a powerful Pacific typhoon hammered the U.S. territory with high winds, rain and large waves.

Workers in Mongmong, Toto and Maite villages used a pickup to tow away downed coconut trees on Saturday.

One person was injured in the storm and taken to the hospital.

A 57-year-old homeless man says he rode out the storm on the grounds of a strip mall in the capital of Hagatna. Frank Reyes says the storm was the worst he’s experienced since becoming homeless two years ago.

The typhoon was 165 miles northwest of Guam as of 7 a.m. local time. It had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph.

It’s traveling west-northwest but is expected to curve and start heading northeast.
