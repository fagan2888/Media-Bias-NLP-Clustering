Faced with a last-minute stage switch, Hill\u2019s starting time of 9 p.m. came and went with the sets and backline less than halfway constructed. The crowd stayed positive, with on-and-off chants of \u201cLauryn Hill!\u201d soundtracking the assembly. By 9:30 p.m., Hill and company were ready to go.\n\n\n\nThe 39-year-old was in top form for the set\u2019s first half, as Hill got the crowd bouncing and hand-waving along with striking renditions of (mostly) \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\u201d cuts interjected with reggae, jam-heavy rock and virtuosic, rapid-fire rapping. Sidestage, a rotating cast of interpreters somehow kept up with Hill, conveying every word in sign language. After dominating with tracks like \u201cTo Zion,\u201d \u201cEx-Factor\u201d and \u201cLost Ones,\u201d the set hit a temporary lull as Hill switched to acoustic for a rendition of \u201cMr. Intentional.\u201d\n\n\n\nFortunately for Hill, she still had another hip-hop classic in her back pocket. \"Bonnaroo, do we have Fugees fans in the building?\u201d she screamed, before jumping into a sweep that included \u201cZealots,\u201d \u201cHow Many Mics,\u201d \u201cFu-Gee-La,\u201d \u201cReady Or Not\u201d and \u201cKilling Me Softly,\u201d complete with Wyclef Jean and Pras\u2019 verses. To cap off the set, Hill returned to her Grammy-winning 1998 solo classic with \u201cDoo Wop (That Thing),\u201d sending the crowd into one final frenzy.\n\n\n\nFor those who have followed Hill since the 90s, it\u2019s certainly frustrating to see her tour with no flicker of a new album. But for those too young to remember the days when neo-soul was all the rage (and for those who can, but still love the classics), Hill\u2019s recent live resurgence is certainly welcome -- and especially on a night like this, when she and her band were in top form.\n\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Lauryn Hill\u2019s sets may still be based in old songs, but songs Hill and her ace backing band burned through at Bonnaroo sounded anything but familiar.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Lauryn Hill Jams to \u2018Miseducation\u2019 & Fugees Favorites", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121396/bonnaroo-2014-lauryn-hill-fugees-set-video", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/lauryn-hill-rock-the-bells-650-430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lauryn Hill\u2019s sets may still be based in old songs, but songs Hill and her ace backing band burned through at Bonnaroo sounded anything but familiar.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Lauryn Hill Jams to \u2018Miseducation\u2019 & Fugees Favorites", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121396/bonnaroo-2014-lauryn-hill-fugees-set-video", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/lauryn-hill-rock-the-bells-650-430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Lauryn Hill\u2019s sets may still be based in old songs, but songs Hill and her ace backing band burned through at Bonnaroo sounded anything but familiar.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Lauryn Hill's Bonnaroo 2014 Performance: 'Miseducation' Hits & Fugees Favorites | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0283\"", "article_summary": "Bonnaroo 2014 Full Coverage: Photos, Video & MoreFor a live act known for her inconsistency, the Bonnaroo performance from Hill (billed as Ms. Lauryn Hill) began ominously.\nThe crowd stayed positive, with on-and-off chants of \u201cLauryn Hill!\u201d soundtracking the assembly.\nLauryn Hill's sets may still be based in old songs, but the songs that the hip-hop legend and her ace backing band burned through at Bonnaroo on Saturday night (June 14) sounded anything but familiar.\nTo cap off the set, Hill returned to her Grammy-winning 1998 solo classic with \u201cDoo Wop (That Thing),\u201d sending the crowd into one final frenzy.\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video"}
