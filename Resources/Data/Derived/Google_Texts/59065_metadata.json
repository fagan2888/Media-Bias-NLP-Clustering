We should seize it.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani also praised its completion, saying the deal opens a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in Tehran\u2019s relations with the world.\n\nThe accord capped off 18 days of consecutive negotiations in Vienna with Iran and the P5+1\u2014the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.\n\nUnder the agreement, Iran will be required to reduce its centrifuges\u2014machines that enrich uranium used in nuclear bombs\u2014by two-thirds. Iran must additionally reduce its current stockpile of uranium by 98 percent for 15 years. Limits will also be placed on its research and development capabilities for advanced centrifuges.\n\nTogether, these provisions extend the \u201cbreakout\u201d time it would take Iran to race toward a nuclear weapon once the deal expires or if Iran decides to violate the accord. Obama said the deal extends this breakout time to at least a year, far longer than the two to three months it would take Iran to assemble a bomb without the accord.\n\nIran must also allow inspectors from the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency to access certain sites to ensure Iran is complying with the deal. Obama said this provision asserts the deal is \u201cnot built on trust, it is built on verification.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, U.S. and international economic sanctions against Iran will be lifted, along with the European Union\u2019s oil embargo, unfreezing $100 billion in Iranian assets and allowing Tehran to begin selling its oil on the international market again.\n\nThese sanctions may immediately be reimposed with a majority vote on a U.N. panel if the International Atomic Energy Agency judges that Iran is violating the deal.\n\nWhile negotiators lauded its completion, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not as optimistic. He denounced the agreement as a \u201chistoric mistake,\u201d firing at the U.S. and its negotiating partners for making \u201cfar-reaching concessions\u201d that would lead to a \u201cterror nuclear superpower.\u201d\n\nCongress will have 60 days to review the deal before legislators will vote to accept or reject it\u2014or do nothing. But under terms set by Congress, the president can veto any resolution of disapproval. Congress needs a two-thirds majority in each house to override the veto.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six world powers secured a historic diplomatic deal with Iran Tuesday, concluding 20 months of arduous negotiations to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Six world powers secured a historic diplomatic deal with Iran Tuesday, concluding 20 months of arduous negotiations to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.", "title": "Obama Inked \u2018Historic\u2019 Iran Nuclear Deal.
