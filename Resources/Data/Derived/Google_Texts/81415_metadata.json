This month, she\u2019s moving her studio from her home in Baden, Beaver County, to the Diamond Building at 100 Fifth Ave. By June 1, she hopes to be open for business.\n\nIn the new space, clients will be able to have consultations and fittings with Ms. Mazzotta for custom requests, plus try on other styles she\u2019s designed. Typically, Ms. Mazzotta would meet with clients at their homes, but due to her expanding clientele base, juggling all of the travel was getting tricky, she says.\n\nShe channels her background in visual merchandising in her work. After college, she worked in New York for Dolce & Gabbana before moving back to Pittsburgh to take a job with Saks Fifth Avenue. She combined her eye for style with what she learned from Ohio-based milliner Amy Hamilton \u2014 and Gina Mazzotta Millinery was born.\n\nCollaborations with several high-profile events in the city have helped her young business gain traction in a short period. Last year, she designed headwear for the Steelers Style charity runway show, and this year she created exotic floral headdresses to complement apparel by Pittsburgh-based designer Diana Misetic for the FashionAFRICANA runway show.\n\nSpring is a particularly busy season for her because of Kentucky Derby parties. At the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy\u2019s annual hat luncheon this weekend, she designed six hats for the event (plus one for herself). In 2014, she created one of the luncheon\u2019s most talked about toppers \u2014 a tall beehive hat adorned with (faux) bumblebees and drizzled honey for another Pittsburgh-based designer, Kiya Tomlin. She also has clients in other cities, including New York and Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe inspiration just kind of grows out of the [collaboration] that you have with the client,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what\u2019s going to come out of it.\u201d\n\nCustom orders take about three weeks, on average, to complete and tend to start at about $175. In addition to women, she does pieces for men and children, and she usually has a ready-made collection of classic styles for sale.\n\nWhile her name is becoming synonymous with hats here in Pittsburgh, looking ahead she hopes to expand her brand\u2019s presence even more across the country. In the coming months she plans to focus on building her ready-to-wear collection with the goal of marketing it to stores beyond Pittsburgh by this time next year.\n\nTo learn more about Gina Mazzotta Millinery, visit www.ginamazzotta.com.
