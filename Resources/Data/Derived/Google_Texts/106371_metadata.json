Doc Hastings. \u201cIt appears this administration will use whatever authorities \u2014 real or made-up \u2014 to close our ocean and coastal areas with blatant disregard for possible economic consequences.\u201d\n\nAs of October 2014, Obama used executive orders to designate 260 million acres of federal lands and waters as part of 13 national monuments, more than any other president since 1906. Obama\u2019s national monument designations are equal to the size of California and Texas combined.\n\nMost is water, granted, but if we are concerned about having things in the future, one cannot rule out the bodies of water. He\u2019s already saying we can\u2019t use those areas if technology makes possible the use of the offshore resources.\n\nObama\u2019s designations includes the 22,000 acre stretch of land called Browns Canyon, located along the Colorado River. Obama will also be designating Honouliuli camp, the longest and biggest operating internment camp during WWII, and Chicago\u2019s Pullman district where labor and civil rights protests took place.\n\nThese designations, however, come after the Obama administration asked Congress to declare all of ANWR a wilderness, putting it off-limits to development, and designating huge swaths of Alaska\u2019s coastline as a critical habitat for Arctic ringed seals.\n\n\u201cThis administration is determined to shut down oil and gas production in Alaska\u2019s federal areas \u2013 and this offshore plan is yet another example of their short-sighted thinking,\u201d said Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n\nObama isn\u2019t the first president to use his executive powers to designate national monuments. The Antiquities Act, passed under Teddy Roosevelt, gives presidents this power and has been used under 16 presidents \u2014 eight Republicans and eight Democrats.\n\nThe three presidents who did not designate national monuments: Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Congress can also designate national monuments, but has only done so 30 times in the past.\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
