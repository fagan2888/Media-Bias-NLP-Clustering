I mean, if we measured your BMI and you clocked in at obese, or let\u2019s say morbidly obese just to give plenty of room for the term, would it be acceptable for me to write a story in which I described you as fat? Or to point you out across the room at a party as \u201cthe fat one in the white shirt\u201d? What about if you call yourself fat \u2014 am I allowed to? Would be I accurate, or just a jerk?\n\nI\u2019m asking because I don\u2019t know anymore. I thought I did. I write regularly about body image and fat-shaming, but conspicuously avoid directly referring to individuals as fat. Last week, for instance, I wrote a story about Gabourey Sidibe, and her amazing response to the Twitter trolls who snarked on her Golden Globes look. In it I called her \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cnot thin.\u201d But while I made the general observation that Sidibe\u2019s success is \u201cinfuriating for those who believe fat equals misery,\u201d I didn\u2019t come out and call Sidibe herself fat.\n\nSoon after, I heard from a self-described \u201cfat woman.\u201d In her email she said, \u201cYou\u2019re writing about how awful body snarking is, but is being so fat so awful and so terrible that the label can\u2019t be used with the same neutrality as the word \u2018thin\u2019?\u2026 It\u2019s hard when as a society we\u2019re hammered with programming to fear and hate fat, to get them to even recognize simple fatphobia. But I hope pointing out the lack of what should be a simple descriptor because it\u2019s so fully villainized by our society might be something easier to get\u2026 If you think fat shaming is wrong, perhaps you could start by making the word fat less shameful\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can end fat bashing if we can\u2019t even say fat. Until fat is reclaimed as a neutral descriptor, the assumption built into our language is that fat is bad/gross and fat people are ugly/lazy/unhealthy.\u201d\n\nIt was an eye-opening perspective. I understood where she was coming from \u2013 we\u2019ve created so much stigma around the word, maybe tiptoeing around it isn\u2019t helping. But I\u2019ve long believed that as an average-sized person living on a planet in which the word \u201cfat\u201d is often hurled so meanly, I need to be careful \u2014 and sensitive \u2014 in how I talk about other people. I hadn\u2019t avoided using the word \u201cfat\u201d in connection with Gabourey Sidibe to make the word \u201cfat\u201d shameful, but perhaps I\u2019d been part of a problem anyway.\n\nSo I asked around \u2013 and I didn\u2019t get anything close to consensus. When I inquired about the word on Twitter, I got a gamut of responses. \u201cThe term is unambiguously pejorative, even if accurate,\u201d replied one person. \u201cI prefer any one of the various synonyms in the Queen\u2019s English.\u201d Another said, \u201cI call myself fat bc I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an insult, but I\u2019m hesitant to call others fat bc others take it as insult.\u201d \u201cOlder sister is/was obese,\u201d wrote one woman. \u201cKids & adults alike called her \u2018fat\u2019 in derogatory way.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s a descriptor they\u2019ve used about themselves then I\u2019m more likely to use it but still unlikely,\u201d said writer Isaac Butler. Another person said, \u201cIn my mind it is an insult, rather like using words such as \u2018retarded\u2019 or \u2018cripple\u2019 to describe a disabled person, like myself.\u201d And a woman whose tweets regularly entertain and enlighten me added, \u201cThe word doesn\u2019t bother me; the way that it marks someone as lazy, bad, sloppy, lesser does. Like you cannot be fat & fully human. Nobody\u2019s ever had to call me fat to make it clear that my body is not acceptably attractive in the eyes of our culture.\u201d\n\nAmong my friends, there was a similar variety of reactions. Journalist Celeste Headlee said, \u201cI don\u2019t use it. I don\u2019t think we can deny that the term has been used to insult and degrade for so often and so long that it\u2019s nearly impossible to use it without negative overtones. Some people are obese and, strictly speaking, fat. I will use the first term and not the latter.\u201d An opera singer pal said, \u201c\u2018Fat\u2019 by itself just seems like lazy English to me.\u201d My writer friend Amy Keyishian admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t use this word. I\u2019m totally triggered by it because of my upbringing.\u201d And journalist and author Steve Silberman observed, \u201cI\u2019m fat. Very. I know I\u2019m fat. I\u2019d have to be in the worst denial ever not to know. But it\u2019s all about the spin on the word. As a statement of fact, it\u2019s factual. If it comes along with an automatic assumption of bumbling, hedonistic, bullying, dumb etc. it\u2019s not good, because skinny people are all of those things too. It\u2019s about the \u2018loading\u2019 of the word.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Writing about Gabourey Sidibe \u2013 and a reader's comment \u2013 made me examine how we use the \"f\" word", "title": "Is it OK to call someone fat?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Writing about Gabourey Sidibe \u2013 and a reader's comment \u2013 made me examine how we use the \"f\" word", "title": "Is it OK to call someone fat?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/is_it_ok_to_call_someone_fat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/gabourey_sidibe2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Writing about Gabourey Sidibe \u2013 and a reader's comment \u2013 made me examine how we use the \"f\" word", "title": "Is it OK to call someone fat?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/gabourey_sidibe2.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Body Wars, fat-shaming, Gabourey Sidibe, Kate Harding", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1286\"", "article_summary": "I hadn\u2019t avoided using the word \u201cfat\u201d in connection with Gabourey Sidibe to make the word \u201cfat\u201d shameful, but perhaps I\u2019d been part of a problem anyway.\nBut I hope pointing out the lack of what should be a simple descriptor because it\u2019s so fully villainized by our society might be something easier to get\u2026 If you think fat shaming is wrong, perhaps you could start by making the word fat less shameful\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can end fat bashing if we can\u2019t even say fat.\nUntil fat is reclaimed as a neutral descriptor, the assumption built into our language is that fat is bad/gross and fat people are ugly/lazy/unhealthy.\u201dIt was an eye-opening perspective.\nI\u2019m totally triggered by it because of my upbringing.\u201d And journalist and author Steve Silberman observed, \u201cI\u2019m fat.\nI know I\u2019m fat."}
