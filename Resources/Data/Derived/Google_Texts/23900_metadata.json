(AP) \u2014 Lured by the promise of carrots, American Pharoah was led out of the barn to face a throng of cameras.\n\nReluctant at first, the Kentucky Derby winner perked up when trainer Bob Baffert offered the colt\u2019s favorite snack. American Pharoah pricked his ears upon hearing the click of cameras and struck a regal pose.\n\n\u201cThe good ones,\u201d Baffert said Sunday, \u201cthey love the clicks.\u201d\n\nAnd the white-haired trainer has got himself a good one.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just so good and so special,\u201d a clearly biased Baffert said. \u201cHe was born with that talent.\u201d\n\nNow he and his fourth Derby winner are likely headed to Baltimore for the Preakness in two weeks, the next stop on the Triple Crown trail. Baffert has won that race five times, most recently in 2010.\n\nThird-place finisher Dortmund, who led much of the way, is probable to run in the 1 3/16-mile race on May 16, too.\n\n\u201cThe way he was traveling down the backside, I thought maybe he was going to win it,\u201d Baffert said.\n\nHe will decide Dortmund\u2019s next race for sure after talking with owner Kaleem Shah.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to want a little revenge,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cHis horse ran a really good race.\u201d\n\nThe trainer has no mixed emotions about possibly running American Pharoah, owned by Ahmed Zayat, and Dortmund against each other a second time.\n\n\u201cMy job is to get my people there if the horse is doing well,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cThey understand that sometimes I\u2019ll beat them with another horse. If Dortmund turns the table on him, so be it.\u201d\n\nHe plans to keep American Pharoah and third-place finisher Dortmund at Churchill Downs before sending them to Baltimore, likely on May 13.\n\nA record crowd of 170,513 packed Churchill Downs under sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s Saturday to watch a favorite win for the third straight year.
