RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Ghana’s football association says it called in police after being linked to match-fixing in a British media undercover sting.

The football body asked Ghana police to “investigate two persons for misrepresenting the GFA with an attempt to defraud.”

Broadcaster Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph reported the allegations one day after Ghana drew 2-2 with Germany at the World Cup.

They allege a FIFA-licensed match agent and Ghana club chief executive offered to organize national team friendlies to be fixed.

The men were “allegedly filmed claiming that they would bribe GFA officials to ensure that the contract is signed,” the federation says in a statement.

The Ghana federation says no contract was signed and “the two gentlemen did not make such corrupt offers.”

FIFA has been informed.
