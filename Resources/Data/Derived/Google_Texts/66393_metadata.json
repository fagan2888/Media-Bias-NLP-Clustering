What will happen then is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nThe Senate is expected to approve a \u201cclean\u201d $1.02 trillion continuing resolution within the next day that keeps the government open until December 11. The bill will go to the House where, barring some unforeseen catastrophe, it will pass with considerable Democratic support.\n\nRelated: Boehner Resignation Increases the Prospects for a Government Shutdown\n\nBut after President Obama signs the stopgap funding measure and Washington successfully avoids a shutdown on Oct. 1, all bets are off about how lawmakers will deal with the new holiday season deadline.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) said, \u201cI think it\u2019s unknown what happens between now and December. Some of my House friends tell me it depends on the brand of leadership\u201d that a new House speaker, likely Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), puts forward and if he and his team can bring together a fractious GOP conference.\n\nDecember \u201ccould be uglier because I think we could come closer to a government shutdown,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell, it depends on what do between now and then,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC). \u201cWe may have a surprising fall\u201d with \u201clots of activity.\u201d\n\nRelated: GOP Leadership Getting an Overhaul, but Its Policies Sound Familiar\n\nAnother deadline \u201cprobably won\u2019t be any harder than it\u2019s been in the past. You can\u2019t predict what will happen but I figure that between now and December \u2026 we\u2019ll fund the government,\u201d according to Senate Banking Committee chair Richard Shelby (R-AL).\n\nRosy predictions aren\u2019t worth much in the face of reality and the political landscape for December looks downright treacherous, regardless of a change in House leadership.\n\nPart of what drove the government to the brink this time around is outrage among hardline conservatives over sting videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The far right wanted the government shuttered in a dispute over $500 million in federal funds for the health organization.\n\nOn Friday, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) shocked Washington when he announced he would resign on October 30. The move seems to have appeased conservatives for now, but they could feel emboldened to force another showdown in December,.\n\nRelated: The Top Five Policy Challenges Facing the Next House Speaker\n\n\u201cThere are some who would have you believe that what we\u2019re doing with the continuing resolution is the end of the pro-life agenda ... that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said Tuesday during a press conference.\n\nAnother factor that could influence the way forward is possible budget talks between GOP leaders and the administration.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said he and Boehner will begin talks with the president \u201cvery soon\u201d that might cover spending levels for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to settle the top line (spending level) for both years so that next year we can have a regular appropriations process,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cThe president and Speaker Boehner and I spoke about getting started in the discussions last week and I would expect them to start very soon.\u201d\n\nShould a budget deal keeps spending caps in place for the Defense Department, McConnell could see a revolt among defense hawks. Some, like McCain, have long argued the spending levels for the military must be raised to reverse years of underfunding. If their wishes are not met, they could vote against a long-term spending bill or bottle it up.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats have double-downed on their calls for the GOP to come to the negotiating table to work out a budget blueprint that increases both DOD and domestic spending.\n\nUntil those talks start, they intend to rake Republicans over the coals for setting up another spending showdown two weeks before Christmas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a holiday gift for America; the prospect of shutting down the government again,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The GOP-controlled Congress looks to be on track to pass legislation that would fund the government for a few more months.
