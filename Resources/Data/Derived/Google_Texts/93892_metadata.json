Obama's cousin may primary Roberts\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s second cousin once removed, is laying the groundwork for a potential Republican primary challenge against Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts next year.\n\nMilton Wolf has been gauging support, sources told POLITICO, sending an email to GOP activists the last week of August asking them to get in touch if they want more senators like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWolf, a 42-year-old practicing radiologist, accused Roberts of raising the debt ceiling, bailing out Wall Street and supporting earmarks. He noted that Roberts said recently that he does not see a way out of using military force in Syria and endorsed former Kansas Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever asked yourself what you can do and you\u2019re ready to fight for America \u2026 email me,\u201d he wrote in his email. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the patriots to save America from our failed political class.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Creekmore McCurry, is Wolf\u2019s great-grandfather. His mother was five years older than Obama\u2019s mother, and he writes on his Website that the two were childhood friends in Wichita.\n\nWolf\u2019s potential candidacy comes as several Republican senators now face primary challenges, the latest sign that the tea party versus establishment battles are still dividing the GOP. But unlike past years, Republican senators say they won\u2019t be caught off guard: They are pumping big bucks into their war chests and wooing conservative activists and lawmakers in their states.\n\n( WATCH: Michelle Obama launches #drinkH20 initiative)\n\nDemocrats lack a deep bench in the state and would probably not be able to capitalize even if Roberts lost; Mitt Romney carried Kansas by 22 points last year. Wolf could use that to argue to voters that supporting him wouldn\u2019t risk jeopardizing the seat. But tea party-backed Indiana candidate Richard Mourdock made that case against Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) last year \u2014 before the challenger went on to blow the general election.\n\nRoberts, 77, said in an interview at the Capitol on Thursday that he takes every race seriously but expressed confidence that he would prevail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not vulnerable,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019m in a very strong position. But I\u2019m not taking anything lightly. Marines don\u2019t do that. They take the hill.\u201d\n\nRoberts said he knows Wolf \u2014 even bought him dinner at one point \u2014 but was not aware that he was seriously considering a bid and has not had direct contact with him about the race. He said he assumes Wolf would phone him if he gets in.\n\n( PHOTOS: Governors\u2019 offices up for grabs in 2014)\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a cousin of some sort to the president, but he\u2019s very conservative,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cI have called him on occasion and congratulated him on some of his Facebook or blogs or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously the water is fine: Anybody can enter a primary \u2014 for that matter, an election,\u201d he added. \u201cI take every race seriously. There isn\u2019t an election that goes by that I haven\u2019t taken seriously.\u201d\n\nRoberts, in Congress since 1981, voted against the comprehensive immigration bill this year and joined the controversial conservative push to defund Obamacare last month, even if it risks a government shutdown.\n\nWolf has nonetheless been a frequent antagonist, attacking Roberts for backing the fiscal cliff deal at the end of last year and assailing him as a career politician. Wolf did not respond to emails and a phone message seeking comment for this story.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The Big Apple goes small)\n\nRoberts had $1.5 million cash on hand at the end of June, after raising $560,000 in the latest fundraising quarter. He has a campaign website up and announced the co-chairs for his reelection committee in June. Several prominent conservative leaders, including Gov. Sam Brownback and Secretary of State Kris Kobach, are honorary members. Former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole endorsed Roberts in April.\n\nA knowledgeable Republican estimated Wolf could start off with support of 25 percent to 30 percent of Republican voters, given how conservative Kansas is. But the source expressed confidence that Roberts could fend off Wolf if the senator is aggressive and fights back early.\n\nCapitalizing on his indirect link to Obama, Wolf has appeared on Fox News as well as Rush Limbaugh\u2019s and Sean Hannity\u2019s radio programs. He has written columns for the Washington Times and contributed to the Daily Caller.\n\nAfter Lugar lost a primary challenge to Mourdock in May 2012, a POLITICO blog post asked whether Roberts was \u201cin danger of getting Lugared in 2014.\u201d The executive director of the Kansas Republican Party commented on the \u201csubstantial differences\u201d between Lugar and Roberts, noting the latter voted more often against Obama, stays in close touch with the GOP grass roots and has a top-notch campaign team.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obama\u2019s second term)\n\nWolf responded with a comment on the post, \u201cHow many decades in Washington is too much?\u201d\n\nA big X factor is whether Wolf or another challenger would get help from outside groups.\n\nSenate Conservative Fund Executive Director Matt Hoskins said every incumbent Republican could face a primary challenge.\n\n\u201cAmericans have had it with Republicans in Washington who say one thing and then do another,\u201d Hoskins wrote in an email. \u201cPat Roberts is no different. He voted to raise the debt limit and to raise taxes on 80 percent of American families. That\u2019s a tough pill to swallow. He also voted to confirm Kathleen Sebelius who was picked to push Obamacare through Congress and to implement the law. That could be a very big problem for the senator if he faces a conservative challenger.\u201d\n\nBarney Keller, a Club for Growth spokesman, would say only that the Club is \u201cwatching\u201d the race and pointed to Roberts\u2019s lifetime 73 percent rating on the group\u2019s congressional scorecard.\n\nThe title of Wolf\u2019s speech at Erick Erickson\u2019s RedState gathering in New Orleans last month was \u201c Shaking the moss off the GOP.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to clean house,\u201d he wrote in an accompanying column for the Washington Times. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take a page out of Sarah Palin\u2019s playbook. It\u2019s time to take on the establishment. For the sake of our party and the republic, it\u2019s time to lock and load.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Milton Wolf, a Republican relative, might run against the incumbent Kansas senator.", "title": "Obama's cousin may primary Roberts", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/barack-obama-gop-cousin-pat-roberts-kansas-96737.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/12/130912_pat_roberts_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Elections,Republicans,2014 Elections,Pat Roberts,Kansas", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Milton Wolf, a Republican relative, might run against the incumbent Kansas senator.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d8f\"", "article_summary": "Obama's cousin may primary RobertsBarack Obama\u2019s second cousin once removed, is laying the groundwork for a potential Republican primary challenge against Kansas Sen.
