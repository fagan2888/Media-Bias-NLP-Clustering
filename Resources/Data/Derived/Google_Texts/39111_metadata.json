(Daniel Ibanez, CNA)\n\nWashington D.C. (CNA/EWTN News) \u2014 Christians in the U.S. must stop their apathy to the bloody persecution of religious minorities in Iraq and Syria, said a religious freedom advocate who proposed an \u201cexamination of conscience\u201d for faith communities.\n\n\u201cI am struck by the widespread apathy and indifference and ignorance concerning this issue among Christians, let alone others,\u201d said Timothy Samuel Shah, associate director of the Religious Freedom Project at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\nShah spoke at a Dec. 4 Heritage Foundation panel on \u201cChristian martyrs today.\u201d The panel said they would welcome a designation of genocide by the U.S. for Christians, Yazidis, and other ethno-religious minorities targeted by ISIS in Iraq in Syria, but Shah added that much more must be done by U.S. Christians to aid these persecuted groups.\n\n\u201cJust as a basic matter of our experiencing the suffering of our brothers and sisters in some kind of way, experiencing some kind of solidarity, we are failing the test,\u201d he said, calling his own Catholic parish \u201cpretty indifferent\u201d to the plight of persecuted religious minorities in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot of real outrage from Christian leaders about this issue, on a regular, consistent basis,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWhere are the widespread demonstrations? Where are letters by thousands and thousands of pastors to appropriate leaders to do more about this? Where are the spontaneous grassroots campaigns? I don\u2019t see them.\u201d\n\nISIS, also known as ISIL, the Islamic State, and Daesh, has inflicted countless atrocities \u2013 including murder, torture, rape, slavery, and displacement \u2013 upon religious and ethnic minorities of Iraq and Syria, as well as upon Sunni Muslims who oppose their caliphate.\n\nMore than 100,000 Christians have been displaced in the Nineveh Plain in Iraq alone. ISIS has also desecrated, looted, and destroyed shrines, churches, and ancient artifacts that some have called an effort to destroy an entire culture.\n\nHowever, Christians cannot wait for political leaders to act, Shah insisted, adding that Christian mobilization will bring about policy action.\n\n\u201cIt is supremely ridiculous, if I may say, to ask the Obama administration to bear the moral weight of this issue when we don\u2019t bear any of the moral weight of this issue ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe proposed a sort of examination of conscience for Christians and parishes, asking questions like:\n\n\u201cDo our congregational prayers reflect a deep concern about what\u2019s happening to our brothers and sisters, patriarchs from Syria and Iraq?\n\n\u201cDo our Sunday schools feature any kind of discussion or teaching about what\u2019s happening to our Christian brothers and sisters?\n\n\u201cDoes our catechetical instruction feature a discussion about these kinds of issues, both the basis of religious freedom as well as empirically what\u2019s happening to the Body of Christ around the world?\u201d\n\nThe answer to the questions is pretty clearly \u201cno,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no intellectual, emotional, empirical, spiritual connection to what is happening to our brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nReligious freedom for people of all faiths must be a priority, the panel insisted, and Christians cannot just deplore Christian persecution while ignoring persecution of other religious minorities.\n\nThe papacy, beginning with Pope Pius XI and culminating in the reign of Pope St. Paul VI and the issuance of the Vatican II document Dignitatis Humanae, began preaching religious freedom as part of fundamental human dignity after the rights of Christians were under assault from fascist and totalitarian regimes in the early 20th century, Shah explained.\n\nThe popes clearly saw that religious freedom is \u201crooted in the dignity of the human person,\u201d he said, and yet Christians even today are unwilling to advocate that people of all faiths enjoy such freedom.\n\n\u201cWe just have to admit that even some of the advocacy for persecuted Christians has a tone and has a quality that isn\u2019t really concerned about the religious freedom of other people,\u201d he said, pointing to the \u201crise of nativist rhetoric\u201d after the Paris terror attacks as an example.\n\nThe call for religious freedom is stronger if members of all faiths are involved, insisted Roger Severino, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nStatements from various faith leaders carry lots of weight, he said, adding that there need to be Jewish, Muslim, Yazidi, and Druze voices speaking out against persecution of all religious minorities by ISIS. \u201cAll faiths are under attack\u201d when members of one faith are attacked for not believing, he said.\n\n\u2014 Written by Matt Hadro\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/09/religious-freedom-advocates-cite-persecution-of-religious-minorities-in-iraq-and-syria/", "article_author_name": "Catholic News Agency", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Refugee_at_the_Sharia_Al_Haman_Hope_Refugee_Camp_in_Duhok_Iraq_on_March_28_2015_Credit_Daniel_Ibanez_CNA_4_1_15-e1453916228216.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "catholicism, Christianity, faith, Iraq, religious freedom, religious minorities, Syria, united states"}, "description": "Christians in the U.S. must stop their apathy to the bloody persecution of religious minorities in Iraq and Syria, said a religious freedom advocate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Refugee_at_the_Sharia_Al_Haman_Hope_Refugee_Camp_in_Duhok_Iraq_on_March_28_2015_Credit_Daniel_Ibanez_CNA_4_1_15-e1453916228216.jpg"}, "keywords": "religious freedom,united states,iraq,syria,religious minorities,christianity,catholicism,faith", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Religious freedom advocates cite persecution of religious minorities in Iraq and SyriaPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/09/religious-freedom-advocates-cite-persecution-of-religious-minorities-in-iraq-and-syria/Refugee at the Sharia Al Haman Hope Refugee Camp in Duhok, Iraq on March 28, 2015.\n(Daniel Ibanez, CNA)Washington D.C.
