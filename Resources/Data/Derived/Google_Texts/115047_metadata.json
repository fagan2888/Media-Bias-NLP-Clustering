The guide, which purports to help UNH students and faculty purge their vocabulary of dozens of offensive words and phrases\u2014really hateful stuff, like \u201cobese\u201d and \u201cmidgets\u201d and \u201celders\u201d\u2014was removed by the university\u2019s president late last week after all corners of the internet expressed universal outrage at such an over-the-top display of political correctness.\n\nThe Bias-Free Language Guide is indeed nauseating. But, as I argue in a recent column for The Daily Beast, people should be more outraged about the countless examples of overt censorship on American (sorry, I meant, North American\u2014please don\u2019t report me to the language police) college campuses:\n\nIt\u2019s good that these public universities aren\u2019t explicitly requiring the use of inoffensive language, because that would be both illegal and impossible. It would violate the First Amendment rights of students and faculty while failing to protect everyone\u2019s delicate ears from words that hurt them. Everything is offensive to someone, and some things that are offensive to some people aren\u2019t offensive to others. One man\u2019s \u201cfat\u201d is another man\u2019s \u201cperson of size.\u201d The great war on hurt-feelings at American university campuses is unwinnable, and the causalities are significant. In any case, universities should be careful not to confuse students about their right to speak their minds. They should also take better care to ensure that friendly speech reminders don\u2019t become unfriendly speech mandates over time. Censorship-creep is all too real a phenomenon at universities all over the country. In just the last month, I have covered cases where students were formally disciplined for engaging in political activism, calling another student a \u201cpsycho,\u201dand making idiotic statements on Facebook. Each of these students should have enjoyed a right to free speech, and yet each met with suspension or expulsion for speaking out of line. That\u2019s just crazy.\n\nRead the full article here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It doesn't end with the Bias-Free Language Guide.", "title": "Speech Police Back Down at University of New Hampshire, But War on Words Is Not Over", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/02/speech-police-back-down-at-university-of", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14385353665786.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It doesn't end with the Bias-Free Language Guide.", "title": "Speech Police Back Down at University of New Hampshire, But War on Words Is Not Over", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14385353665786.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-08-02T17:23:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3110\"", "article_summary": "The University of New Hampshire\u2019s outrageous Bias-Free Language Guide seems to have struck a nerve.\nThey should also take better care to ensure that friendly speech reminders don\u2019t become unfriendly speech mandates over time.\nThe Bias-Free Language Guide is indeed nauseating.\nOne man\u2019s \u201cfat\u201d is another man\u2019s \u201cperson of size.\u201d The great war on hurt-feelings at American university campuses is unwinnable, and the causalities are significant.\nIt would violate the First Amendment rights of students and faculty while failing to protect everyone\u2019s delicate ears from words that hurt them."}
