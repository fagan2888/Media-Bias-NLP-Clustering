The ruling ended a legal fight of nearly four years between the city and Central Radio.\n\nThe legal troubles of the business began after Norfolk\u2019s land developer attempted to seize its building through eminent domain, which enables the government to take private property for public use as long as it provides just compensation.\n\nBob Wilson, one of the owners of Central Radio, told The Daily Signal he was compelled to protest Norfolk\u2019s property grab after losing an initial attempt in trial court to keep his building:\n\nOut of frustration I decided it was time to let the people of Norfolk, the city of Norfolk, and the state for that matter, know what was going on. The simplest way I knew how to do that was to hang up a sign.\n\nFounded in 1934, Central Radio installs, maintains, repairs, and overhauls marine and industrial electrical or electronic equipment.\n\nWilson and Kelly Dickinson, Central Radio\u2019s vice president, hung a big banner on the side of their building in May 2012. It reads: \u201c50 years on this street. 78 years in Norfolk. 100 workers. Threatened by eminent domain!\u201d\n\nSoon after, Norfolk officials ordered Wilson and Dickinson to take down the banner, citing them for violating the sign ordinance.\n\nWilson said the city successfully forced them to cover up the banner after threatening Central Radio with a $1,000 fine each day the owners left the sign up.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty obvious to almost everybody that the city was attempting to stifle our speech by not letting us speak out, not letting us protest and not letting us get the message out to the general public about what was actually happening,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nAlthough the Virginia Supreme Court ultimately decided Norfolk could not seize Central Radio\u2019s building, the owners had become entangled in a separate free speech lawsuit.\n\nThe nonprofit law firm Institute for Justice backed the owners of Central Radio Co., arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court made clear the government cannot legally discriminate against subject matter or viewpoints when regulating signs.\n\nErica Smith, an Institute for Justice lawyer who represented Central Radio, told The Daily Signal:\n\nA lot of these sign codes are atrocious and they are hurting everyday people, ranging from business owners who just want to be able to advertise their products to people who have serious grievances with the political system and are not able to fully express themselves because of these burdensome sign codes.\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court initially ruled against Central Radio. But last June, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in a similar case that the First Amendment\u2019s free speech protections do not allow discrimination against certain signs.\n\nIn light of Reed v. Town of Gilbert, the justices vacated and remanded the lower court\u2019s decision, ordering the 4th Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\n\u201cThey basically said to the 4th Circuit, \u2018You did this wrong; do it again,\u2019\u201d Smith told The Daily Signal.\n\nAfter giving the case a second look, the 4th Circuit judges overturned their initial decision, deciding last week that Norfolk\u2019s sign ordinance did in fact violate the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment gives us the right to protest\u2014in fact, we believe that it\u2019s every citizen\u2019s duty to protest when they think that their government has done something wrong,\u201d Central Radio\u2019s Wilson said. \u201cIf citizens were not allowed to protest their government, then we would turn back into a monarchy in no time at all.\u201d\n\nHundreds of local sign ordinances studied by Institute for Justice attorneys are unconstitutional, Smith said. The court decision should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to cities across the United States that officials must reform their sign codes so they aren\u2019t violating free speech rights, she said.\n\n\u201cThe 4th Circuit issued a wonderful opinion, and that opinion will help protect speech across the country now and hopefully for decades to come,\u201d Smith said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If citizens were not allowed to protest their government, we would turn back into a monarchy in no time at all,\" co-owner Bob Wilson says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"If citizens were not allowed to protest their government, we would turn back into a monarchy in no time at all,\" co-owner Bob Wilson says.", "title": "Small Business Scores Victory in Protest of Property Seizure", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160201_EminentDomain_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T14:09:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WYmcqv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"If citizens were not allowed to protest their government, we would turn back into a monarchy in no time at all,\" co-owner Bob Wilson says.", "title": "Small Business Scores Victory in Protest of Property Seizure", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160201_EminentDomain_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "constitution", "published_time": "2016-02-01T22:08:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T14:09:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Central Radio Company, Bob Wilson, eminent domain, Institute for Justice, free speech, sign ordinance, Constitution"}, "article_summary": "In light of Reed v.
