But it\u2019s the more direct comparison. It, too, was a polarizing national law that suffered from a terrible rollout. At launch, it was less popular even than Obamacare. In May 2006 \u2014 so, five months after its launch \u2014 a CBS/New York Times poll found 48 percent of seniors said they didn\u2019t plan to join and 81 percent said the George W. Bush administration should extend the deadlines. A Gallup poll from about the same time showed 53 percent of seniors thought the law flatly wasn\u2019t working. But the program didn\u2019t fail. Mark McClellan, who led the rollout effort, recalls that \u201cby the spring of 2006 most seniors signed up. Every senior had heard about this program or knew people in it. And everyone was familiar with the delayed enrollment penalty. Those things together led to a big bump before open enrollment ended.\u201d Today Medicare Part D is widely considered a success. Over 90 percent of seniors say they\u2019re happy with it.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Medicare Part D analogy gets cited by Obamacare defenders more often than by the new health care law\u2019s skeptics. Sometimes Part D\u2019s example is invoked to criticize Republicans for their continued obstructionism (because after all Democrats mostly voted against the prescription drug benefit, but didn\u2019t throw up endless roadblocks to its implementation), and sometimes, as in this instance, to cite a happy case where a health care law with a faulty website and flawed rollout ended up becoming pretty popular. But both comparisons have always seemed flawed to me, for the following interrelated reasons:\n\n1) Medicare Part D faced political opposition, but not intense ideological resistance. The bill wasn\u2019t a conservative pet project or the fulfillment of a long-running right-wing dream; rather it was an attempt at centrist co-option by the Bush administration, which his base swallowed because it seemed politically necessary. Meanwhile, Democrats who opposed the legislation mostly did so not not because they hated the concept, but because they wanted a more generous, more socialized bill \u2014 which is to say, they were taking the position vis-a-vis Part D that their party\u2019s leftward fringe took vis-a-vis Obamacare \u2014 and because they didn\u2019t want to let Bush get the credit on an issue they felt they owned. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that even when the law was unpopular it didn\u2019t generate resistance and create high ideological drama \u2014 that there was no \u201crepeal Part D\u201d movement on the left in 2004 or 2006 or 2008, no liberal equivalent of Ted Cruz trying to leverage the issue for his own ambitions, no talk about how the entire conservative project was on the line when the website wasn\u2019t working. Whatever their objections to the form it took, Democrats explicitly wanted something like Part D, which meant that even during its flawed rollout there was an implicit bipartisan, pan-ideological consensus around the program that has never existed around Obamacare.\n\n2) Medicare Part D did not depend on the same kind of mandate-regulate-subsidize model as Romneycare and Obamacare \u2014 not least because it was a more narrowly-focused program than either \u2014 which meant that its architects had less reason to fear a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d during the initial period of bureaucratic chaos. Yes, Part D imposed a \u201cdelayed enrollment penalty,\u201d as Klein notes, on seniors who signed up for Medicare when they turned 65 but then waited for years to sign up for the prescription drug benefit. But there was no requirement that seniors sign up, no annual penalty for waiting, and neither the premiums nor the fine were nearly as central to the law\u2019s design as the individual mandate is to Obamacare. What\u2019s more \u2026\n\n3) Signing up for Medicare Part D was vastly cheaper than signing up for Obamacare. Was, and is: Today the average Part D monthly premium is just $31, while the average premium for a health insurance plan on the national exchange is about ten times that much. If the average Obamacare plan cost just a few hundred dollars a year to enroll, the short-term financial case for signing up would be much stronger, and the dangers of adverse selection much lower. It\u2019s because the new law\u2019s plans cost thousands of dollars, potentially, that there\u2019s a serious risk that precisely the people the law needs to sign up will choose to remain uninsured. And because of that price differential, the example of Medicare Part D\u2019s eventual enrollment success doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us all that much about what the Obamacare pool will look like a year or five years hence.\n\nThe point of elaborating these three differences, incidentally, is not to argue that Part D was brilliant legislation, and Obamacare is necessarily doomed. The two programs do have significant elements in common, some of their differences redound to Obamacare\u2019s credit (Part D rather famously didn\u2019t even try to be deficit neutral, a standard the new health care law at least attempts to meet), and some of their similarities could be folded into a case that Obamacare could work out better than its doubters expect. (There were reasons to think that Part D would also come in way over budget; instead, it beat expectations, and the slowdown in health care costs that liberals are now suddenly crediting to Obamacare actually kicked off around the time Part D passed.)\n\nBut when it comes to the specific question of whether Obamacare is going to have trouble meeting its young-and-healthy quota, I\u2019m just not sure Medicare Part D has that much to teach us. That program was less polarizing and less furiously opposed, it cost far less to join, and it wasn\u2019t built around the same kind of cross-subsidization model as the Affordable Care Act. It had a rocky rollout, just as Obamacare has had a rocky rollout. But what it needed to recover was not identical to what the new law needs now, and over the next few years, to be reasonably considered a success.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131210141729, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 10, 2013", "keywords": "Bush George W,Elderly,Medicare,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Massachusetts,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/The Medicare Part D Analogy ( 20131210 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Bush, George W", "twitter": {"description": "Is the prescription drug law\u2019s recovery from a rocky early rollout a model for how Obamacare will work?", "title": "The Medicare Part D Analogy", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/the-medicare-part-d-analogy/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "description": "Is the prescription drug law\u2019s recovery from a rocky early rollout a model for how Obamacare will work?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 10, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1386703049, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-12-10T19:18:58-05:00"}, "geo": "Massachusetts", "utime": 20131210191858, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131210, "pdate": 20131210, "des": "Elderly;Medicare;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Is the prescription drug law\u2019s recovery from a rocky early rollout a model for how Obamacare will work?", "title": "The Medicare Part D Analogy", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/the-medicare-part-d-analogy/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/the-medicare-part-d-analogy/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Medicare Part D Analogy", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9d5\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s true that the Medicare Part D analogy gets cited by Obamacare defenders more often than by the new health care law\u2019s skeptics.\nThose things together led to a big bump before open enrollment ended.\u201d Today Medicare Part D is widely considered a success.\nWhat\u2019s more \u20263) Signing up for Medicare Part D was vastly cheaper than signing up for Obamacare.\nBut both comparisons have always seemed flawed to me, for the following interrelated reasons:1) Medicare Part D faced political opposition, but not intense ideological resistance.\nBut when it comes to the specific question of whether Obamacare is going to have trouble meeting its young-and-healthy quota, I\u2019m just not sure Medicare Part D has that much to teach us."}
