Air National Guard Base at Pease.\n\nLately, they\u2019ve disagreed on certain issues. One example is how to address increasing rates of sexual assaults within military ranks. Shaheen wants reporting these assaults taken out of the chain of command; Ayotte wants the reporting to stay within the command structure but with the help of a specialized advocate for the victim. See a Live Free or Die Alliance post on the issue here.\n\nThis week the issue is a political one - the use of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate.\n\nShaheen supports Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s decision to drop the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d that changes the rules on filibusters. Ayotte opposes it.\n\nFilibuster has been used over the years by the minority party in the Senate to hold up consideration of an issue, most typically a presidential nomination. Senate rules required a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and proceed to an up-or-down majority vote to confirm or reject the nomination. In a chamber that has a slim party majority, the 60-vote super majority can be hard to come by.\n\nReid\u2019s maneuver on Thursday - approved by the Senate 52-48 - requires only a simple-majority vote to end a filibuster. And it opens the door to the approval of three appointments to Washington, D.C.\u2019s appeal court, nominations that had been held up by the mere threat of a GOP filibuster.\n\nShaheen has long been an advocate of filibuster reform. See an LFDA story here.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic today that Reid over the years has opposed a change to the rules but found himself compelled to do so now by the partisan gridlock that has come to characterize the U.S. Congress..For her part, Ayotte called the rules change \u201ca raw abuse of power.\u201d\n\nShe said (in a Washington Post story reprinted by the Union Leader): \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 vote to invoke the \u2018nuclear option\u2019 and fundamentally change the rules of the Senate is a raw power grab which is deeply disappointing. Like the manner in which they rammed through Obamacare on party line votes, they have now broken the rules of the Senate to allow them to do the same for the President\u2019s executive and judicial nominees.At a time when Americans want members of both parties to be working together, this partisan power play will only further inflame the partisan divide in Washington.\"\n\nTheir like-mindedness will be on display Monday, when the New Hampshire congressional delegation is scheduled to dedicate the new Squadron Operations building at the Air National Guard base at Pease.\n\nShaheen and Ayotte will join Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01), Congresswoman Annie Kuster (NH-02), N.H. Gov. Maggie Hassan will help Air Force personnel formally dedicate the new operations facility that improves communications and efficiency. All four members of New Hampshire\u2019s congressional delegation toured the building during construction.\n\nPaul Briand is an editor for the Live Free or Die Alliance, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that encourages the discussion and analysis of New Hampshire politics and policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the state\u2019s two U.S.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/shaheen-and-ayotte-agreeing-and-disagreeing", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/5a/92/5a92d0dcc3cc2dc0a4d2a762369f11a4.jpg?itok=T5I7Of2U", "type": "article", "title": "Shaheen and Ayotte: Agreeing and disagreeing"}, "twitter": {"site": "@examinercom", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/5a/92/5a92d0dcc3cc2dc0a4d2a762369f11a4.jpg?itok=T5I7Of2U", "description": "As the state\u2019s two U.S.", "card": "summary", "title": "Shaheen and Ayotte: Agreeing and disagreeing"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-11-23T07:22:07-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government Topics, New Hampshire, Shaheen, Ayotte, filibuster, Military Sexual Assault", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T07:22"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27f5\"", "article_summary": "In a chamber that has a slim party majority, the 60-vote super majority can be hard to come by.\nShaheen and Ayotte will join Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01), Congresswoman Annie Kuster (NH-02), N.H.
