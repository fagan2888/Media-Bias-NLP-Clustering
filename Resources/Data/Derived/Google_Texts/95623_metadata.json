House Study Bill 566 would require training about dementia for new employees and would require that they demonstrate they understand the training. Supporters of the bill said the second part would be its main change.\n\nMany good facilities already are providing solid training to their employees, said Noah Tabor, a lobbyist for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. \u201cWhat\u2019s not happening, though, is the skills being proven,\u201d Tabor told the legislators.\n\n\u201cCurrent dementia training isn\u2019t working in this state. It\u2019s not the fault of facilities, it\u2019s not the fault of workers, it\u2019s just not working,\u201d Tabor said. He then provided copies of state inspectors\u2019 reports showing problems with nursing homes in the legislators\u2019 districts. For example, he gave Rep. Dave Heaton, the subcommittee chairman, reports about the Donnellson Health Center. Problems there included a dementia patient who was able to wander away from the facility because of insufficient safeguards, according to the state inspectors.\n\nRELATED:Transfer trauma 'can be awful' when elderly are moved\n\nRepresentatives of the nursing home industry countered that the bill would impose new, costly training requirements on top of ones that are being imposed by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe support proper and good training,\u201d said Susan Cameron, a lobbyist for the Iowa Health Care Association. But she said if the government continues to pile on redundant regulations, care providers could become discouraged. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a situation where our facilities won\u2019t take dementia patients,\u201d she said.\n\nHeaton, a Mount Pleasant Republican, said other states are adopting rules similar to the ones in the bill, which came out of a task force on the issue. He expressed puzzlement at the nursing-home industry\u2019s opposition to the training proposal. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it, what\u2019s the difference between this and what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked, his upturned hands held out in a questioning gesture.\n\nThe bill also would affect staff members of home-care agencies. It was moved along to the House Human Resources Committee by Heaton and the subcommittee\u2019s other two members, Reps. Dave Dawson, D-Sioux City, and Tom Moore, R-Griswold.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1TmrXzd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The nursing home industry says new state rules would duplicate what federal regulations already will require.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The nursing home industry says new state rules would duplicate what federal regulations already will require.", "title": "Nursing-home staff training on dementia debated", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2016/02/15/nursing-home-staff-training-dementia-debated/80422794/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nursing home industry says new state rules would duplicate what federal regulations already will require.", "title": "Nursing-home staff training on dementia debated", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e04014730e7fc3e55640647d31233e570d60f11b/c=0-0-840-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Iowa", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Iowa", "title": "Nursing-home staff training on dementia debated", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c02d5aab1fbba12a194bbdf5949b8050246a4223/c=0-0-840-840/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ede35f7e509d9b4cfab1ff03b3252c3ea9f41a66/c=0-0-1117-840/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37e25c85ebb4a9aa76ad4c0c76f2c03844368c35/c=0-13-1440-827&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-02-15T17:25:20.790000-06:00", "shorthed": "Dementia training rules might tighten", "articleid": 80422794, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/893ec56c5fcc284c23f68b2b44f772707ee26dc5/c=0-13-1440-827/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70104a7add6c5d012c9ddc8779265161d544fc3a/c=504-0-974-840/local/-/media/2016/02/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635911532136921730-Iowa-news.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Iowa nursing homes, Iowa dementia, Iowa nursing homes,"}, "article_summary": "House Study Bill 566 would require training about dementia for new employees and would require that they demonstrate they understand the training.\n\u201cCurrent dementia training isn\u2019t working in this state.\nMany good facilities already are providing solid training to their employees, said Noah Tabor, a lobbyist for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a situation where our facilities won\u2019t take dementia patients,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe support proper and good training,\u201d said Susan Cameron, a lobbyist for the Iowa Health Care Association."}
