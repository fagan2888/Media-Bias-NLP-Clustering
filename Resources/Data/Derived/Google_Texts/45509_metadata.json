In other cases, the state paid more because people were in the wrong program.\n\nThe audit looked at a sample of 193 people who enrolled in the programs between October 2013 and April 2014, and found that nearly 17 percent received wrong answers about the benefits they should receive.\n\nThe report stoked partisan debate during a hearing near the State Capitol, where MNsure officials reported progress in preparing the health exchange website for open enrollment that starts Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe certainly found evidence that these errors were costing taxpayers money,\u201d Cecile Ferkul, the deputy legislative auditor, said in an interview.\n\nJust how much money is unclear, since the report includes no tally and it\u2019s not known how widespread the errors are beyond the cases reviewed by auditors.\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure health exchange in 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act. People can use the exchange to purchase commercial insurance policies, but the audit released Wednesday dealt with its other primary function \u2014 determining eligibility for public health insurance programs.\n\nHuman Services faulted\n\nMNsure started processing new applications for the programs on Oct. 1, 2013. Through June, the state paid $376 million in benefits for people MNsure enrolled in the state\u2019s public health care programs.\n\nThe report from Legislative Auditor James Nobles faulted the state\u2019s Department of Human Services (DHS), which is using MNsure for eligibility determinations in Medical Assistance, MinnesotaCare and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nWhen the report was presented during a meeting of the MNsure Legislative Oversight Committee, one Republican said the results are the latest example of how MNsure isn\u2019t working for Minnesotans. Her party opposed DFL-backed legislation passed in 2013 to create the exchange.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just fallen woefully short when it comes to making sure that we\u2019re delivering on promises to Minnesotans who are depending on these programs and to taxpayers who are footing the bill,\u201d said state Rep. Tara Mack of Apple Valley.\n\nDFLers said that while the report points to problems that must be solved, accurate eligibility determinations in the public health insurance programs have been challenging for years. \u201cThis problem has lasted a lot longer than MNsure,\u201d said state Sen. Kathy Sheran, DFL-Mankato.\n\nNobles agreed that creating a system for eligibility determinations is \u201cextraordinarily complicated,\u201d but he added: \u201cWe decided to build our own Minnesota insurance exchange, so it\u2019s the challenge that we have to meet.\u201d\n\n\u2018In a very different place\u2019\n\nMore than 300,000 people have used the MNsure system to determine eligibility for public programs. But it\u2019s unclear whether the problems identified in the audit apply to all those recipients.\n\nThe audit looked at cases through April 2014 \u2014 at which point about 167,000 people had used MNsure to enroll in public programs \u2014 and problems in the system at that point have since been fixed, said Lucinda Jesson, the state Human Services commissioner.\n\nIn June, a consultant hired by the state to guide fixes to the troubled MNsure website reported that the system was making accurate eligibility determinations, Jesson said.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very different place with the MNsure IT system today than we were at the end of April,\u201d she said. \u201cA large number of the eligibility problems identified in this report \u2014 we identified, we fixed, and I believe the IT system is doing a much better job of making correct eligibility determinations today.\u201d\n\nEven so, Jesson wrote in a letter to Nobles that\u2019s included in the report: \u201cThese findings are serious, and we are working to improve compliance as we move forward with technology improvements.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, the audit looked beyond the 193-person sample and found issues. In one such case, the DHS paid $44,993 for health care benefits because 24 people were able to create duplicate accounts through MNsure. In those cases, health insurance companies that are hired by the state to manage care for people in public programs got multiple payments for managing the care of just one beneficiary.\n\nThe department is recovering funds in those cases, Jesson said.\n\nThe audit did not tally how much public money was spent buying coverage that people didn\u2019t qualify for, said Ferkul, the deputy auditor. Nor did the report estimate an overall budget impact across the 167,000 people who were enrolled in public programs through MNsure as of April.\n\nBut some examples are particularly troubling, Ferkul said, pointing to one situation where a child received Medical Assistance coverage even though the family\u2019s household income was about $95,000. In that case, the child would have been eligible for Medical Assistance if the household income were below $53,708.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear how many people went without benefits they should have received, Ferkul said, because the audit focused on those deemed eligible for the programs \u2014 not those who weren\u2019t allowed in.\n\nOverpayments\n\nMedical Assistance is the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, which provides zero-premium coverage for those with the lowest incomes. MinnesotaCare provides coverage for a slightly higher-income group, and in most cases charges a monthly premium ranging from $4 to $50, depending on a recipient\u2019s income.\n\nThe audit found several cases where the DHS provided Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare benefits for people whose incomes exceeded federal and state program limits. Out of 137 people in Medical Assistance cases reviewed by the auditor, 11 were found to have too much income to qualify for the program. On MinnesotaCare, one of 41 recipients had income that exceeded the program\u2019s limits.\n\n\u201cWe also found one Medical Assistance recipient who received benefits before the eligibility worker verified his income,\u201d the report states. \u201cAs a result, DHS overpaid $17,421 in health care costs for these 13 recipients.\u201d\n\nOnce people are enrolled in public health insurance programs, recipients are supposed to report income changes that could make them ineligible. In the past, the DHS made quarterly checks of income data, but stopped doing so in 2014 when the regulation was repealed by the federal Affordable Care Act, according to the audit report. If the DHS had continued making the checks, \u201cit would likely have detected the errors we found in our sample test,\u201d the report states.\n\nEligibility can vary depending on a recipient\u2019s household size, and the DHS decided to not verify household size or family relationships, the audit noted. As a result, the department likely overpaid health care costs for four of 100 households tested, according to the report.\n\nMedical Assistance provides coverage to individuals with incomes below $15,516 per year, although pregnant women and children can qualify at higher income levels. MinnesotaCare covers individuals with incomes between $15,516 and $22,980. Income limits change with household size.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s committee hearing, MNsure Chief Executive Scott Leitz said last-minute fixes to the MNsure website are going well. Last week, state officials described efforts to fix about 10 issues affecting website performance; Leitz said the problems have been resolved, although testing continues.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t identified any issues at this point in time that would block us from going live,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working 24/7 \u2014 and I mean that quite literally \u2014 and all hands are on deck.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new audit report finds the state did not make sure people who used MNsure to enroll in public health insurance programs were eligible for the benefits.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A new audit report finds the state did not make sure people who used MNsure to enroll in public health insurance programs were eligible for the benefits.", "title": "Audit: Lax screening of MNsure enrollees cost taxpayers money", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/audit-lax-screening-of-mnsure-enrollees-cost-taxpayers-money/282425691/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1MNSURESTART100213.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1MNSURESTART100213.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new audit report finds the state did not make sure people who used MNsure to enroll in public health insurance programs were eligible for the benefits.", "title": "Audit: Lax screening of MNsure enrollees cost taxpayers money", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/audit-lax-screening-of-mnsure-enrollees-cost-taxpayers-money/282425691/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1MNSURESTART100213.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1MNSURESTART100213.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "audit"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Minnesota,MNsure,audit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcceed\"", "article_summary": "Minnesota launched the MNsure health exchange in 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act.\nThrough June, the state paid $376 million in benefits for people MNsure enrolled in the state\u2019s public health care programs.\nNor did the report estimate an overall budget impact across the 167,000 people who were enrolled in public programs through MNsure as of April.\nA new audit report finds that the state did not make sure people who used MNsure to enroll in public health insurance programs were eligible for the benefits they received.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s committee hearing, MNsure Chief Executive Scott Leitz said last-minute fixes to the MNsure website are going well."}
