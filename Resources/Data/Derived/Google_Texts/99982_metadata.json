The word choice is part marketing spin and part aspiration, as bike-share supporters seek to cast systems like Citi Bike and Capital Bikeshare as a public good worthy of public dollars rather than private businesses for tourists.\n\n\u201cWhen cities are able to get bike-share up to scale relative to their population and have a really generous number of origin-destination combos it becomes transit,\u201d says Nicole Freedman, North American Bikeshare Association (NABSA) president and Seattle DOT active transportation director. \u201cPeople can get to work, their home, the store. It really gets embedded in the transportation infrastructure.\u201d\n\nBut despite the fact that many bike-share projects have received federal transit funding, the U.S. Department of Transportation does not officially recognize bike-share as transit.\n\nRepresentatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Vern Buchanan (R-FL) are hoping to change that with the Bikeshare Transit Act. The Congressional Bike Caucus co-chairs introduced the bill earlier this month to codify bike-share with an official definition as transit in federal transportation law. That, in turn, will make it easier for cities and towns to access federal funding to pay for bike-share construction and equipment.\n\n\u201cDifferent NABSA members have heard different things from their local metropolitan planning organizations about whether CMAQ (Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program) can be used for bike-share and how it can be used,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cIt will help a lot of cities to have a really clear statement that bike-share is eligible.\u201d\n\nIf the bill passes, bike-share will be listed specifically as an eligible project for CMAQ and it will make bike-share eligible for Transportation Alternatives Program funding and other money.\n\nCaron Whitaker, League of American Bicyclists vice president of government relations, says that giving bike-share an official definition will help protect funding in the future.\n\n\u201cThis is really a proactive bill,\u201d Whitaker says. \u201cBike-share has gotten federal funding because of how the bill has been interpreted by the current U.S. DOT. There\u2019s concern, depending on the next administration, that they could come in and interpret transportation law differently.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, the bill could help broaden a piece of the federal transit definition that specifies transit funding cannot be used for single occupancy vehicles.\n\n\u201cCurrently, transit funding can pay for stations, but not the bikes \u2026 unless we provide a bunch of tandems,\u201d Whitaker says with a laugh.\n\nThe Bikeshare Transit Act comes on the heels of another federal bill aimed at bolstering funding for bike-share. In November, Reps. Joe Crowley (D-NY) and Erik Paulsen (R-MN) reintroduced their Bike to Work Act. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow workers to use their pre-tax commuter benefits for bike-share the same way they can for parking or commuter rail.\n\nWhitaker isn\u2019t holding her breath for either bill to pass anytime soon. The IRS only just raised transit commuter benefits to match the $255 per month parking benefits as of Jan. 1, 2016, so she thinks it will take a while before Congress is ready to further expand benefits.\n\nAs for the Bikeshare Transit Act, Whitaker says it will likely get attached to the next transportation package in five years. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance it could get attached to something else, but Congress just doesn\u2019t do little bills anymore.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, she\u2019s optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been introducing complete streets legislation since 2006 and [FAST Act] is the first time we got something into the transportation bill,\u201d Whitaker says. \u201cIt often takes several goes. This is a building year for the Bikeshare Transit Act.\u201d\n\nWhether the bill moves forward or not, it\u2019s clear some people in the federal government are starting to think about bike-share the way advocates, city transportation agencies and bike-share companies do.\n\n\u201cEven if the bill doesn\u2019t pass, if we get a good number of co-sponsors then when the new administration comes in, we can use it as an education tool to show that there is support for bike-share,\u201d says Whitaker.\n\nSign-up for our newsletters Sign Up Daily Weekly", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inside the Bikeshare Transit Act.", "og": {"url": "https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/federal-bill-redefine-bike-share-us", "image": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/NYC_BikeShareHelmetless.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Inside the Bikeshare Transit Act.", "title": "These U.S. Reps Want to Redefine Bike-Share"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nextcity.org", "description": "Inside the Bikeshare Transit Act.", "creator": "@NextCityOrg", "image": {"src": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/NYC_BikeShareHelmetless.jpg"}, "title": "These U.S. Reps Want to Redefine Bike-Share", "site": "@NextCityOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310796842303514}, "thumbnail": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/NYC_BikeShareHelmetless.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Bikeshare Transit Act comes on the heels of another federal bill aimed at bolstering funding for bike-share.\nRepresentatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Vern Buchanan (R-FL) are hoping to change that with the Bikeshare Transit Act.\nAs for the Bikeshare Transit Act, Whitaker says it will likely get attached to the next transportation package in five years.\nThis is a building year for the Bikeshare Transit Act.\u201dWhether the bill moves forward or not, it\u2019s clear some people in the federal government are starting to think about bike-share the way advocates, city transportation agencies and bike-share companies do.\nIt really gets embedded in the transportation infrastructure.\u201dBut despite the fact that many bike-share projects have received federal transit funding, the U.S. Department of Transportation does not officially recognize bike-share as transit."}
