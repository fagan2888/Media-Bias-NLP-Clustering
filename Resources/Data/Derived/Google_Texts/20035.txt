Oklahoma County Sheriff's deputies were set up near W. Reno Ave. and S. MacArthur Blvd., checking for drunk drivers or those driving without a driver's license or insurance.

"We are trying to do some proactive work to combat the impaired driving problem that the state of Oklahoma has," said Jason Yingling with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. "These checkpoints are a good way to get involved in the community to try to catch those people before we have bad collisions or crashes out on the public."

Yingling said the Sheriff's Office launches a DUI Checkpoint once a month during the summer months.

"We're just trying to be proactive and keep those streets safe, so people can get from point A to point B safely," Yingling added.

Deputies live tweeted throughout the night using the hashtag OkDUICheckpoint.

Official numbers of Saturday night's DUI Checkpoint have not been reported, but at the time of this interview, Yingling said the checkpoint had impounded over 20 vehicles for no insurance or driver's license and had around seven or eight DUIs.
