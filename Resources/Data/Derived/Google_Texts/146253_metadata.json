The two-year, $34 million deal would save the city $2 million and make it the largest urban district in the nation to outsource subs \u2014 a decision affecting approximately 130,000 students and 8,443 full-time teachers.\n\nThe learning curve would be steeper than anyone anticipated.\n\nWhy Schools Use Staffing Services\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just under five percent of substitute teachers worked directly for a staffing service as of May 2014. Though more current figures are not yet available, anecdotal evidence suggests that the reach of companies like Kelly Educational Staffing (KES) and Source4Teachers is growing.\n\nThe practice is not a new one \u2014 educational staffing companies have placed substitutes in classrooms for more than a decade \u2014 but it has drawn increasing attention in the wake of the Affordable Care Act. Instead of providing benefits for employees who work 35 hours or more a week, school districts can save on expenses by hiring outside agencies to employ substitutes.\n\nScott Apsey, a vice president and spokesperson for KES, says that the \u201cgrowth of the industry is showing that districts are finding value in it.\u201d KES, part of Kelly Services, a temporary-help agency that has been in business since 1946, has contracted with schools since 1997; currently, it has relationships with more than 6,100 schools across 35 states.\n\nHow Staffing Services Work\n\nApsey says that supplying teachers is only part of a service that also involves \u201crecruitment, training, scheduling, payroll, disciplinary action, and data analytics.\u201d To attract teachers, KES uses district-specific data to formulate \u201ca very targeted recruiting plan.\u201d The company\u2019s plans differ based upon locale because qualifications vary from state to state: Pennsylvania, for example, requires potential subs to hold a college degree and teaching certificate; Virginia requires a high school diploma.\n\nWhen Services Fall Short\n\nBut simply amassing a pool of teachers doesn\u2019t guarantee that a staffing agency will be able to meet a district\u2019s needs. In a district of 10,000 teachers (one slightly larger than Philadelphia\u2019s), 10 percent might be absent on any given day, says Apsey. Ten percent may seem like a small proportion, but in real numbers, it translates to a thousand absent teachers \u2014 and the need for alternate instructors for all of their classes. While KES\u2019s goal would be to have 500\u20131,000 substitutes ready to go, subs themselves might not show up for work for any number of reasons.\n\n\u201cHaving enough folks is part of the issue. Participation is more important,\u201d Apsey reflects. To troubleshoot substitute shortages, KES analyzes absentee patterns in participating districts, offers incentives to its employees, and uses an online training program to cover \u201cthings like understanding responsibilities, qualities for reliability, the ethics of teaching, and responsibilities around mandated reporting.\u201d\n\nHow Problems Arise in Practice\n\nLast year, the School District of Philadelphia filled 64 percent of teacher absences with its in-house pool of substitutes, paying certified teachers $75 a day for their first 22 days of work and $160 beyond that. Retired teachers could make even more \u2014 up to $242.83 a day.\n\nStill, there were three key problems that emerged.\n\n1. Staffing services may not pay teachers as much as school districts.\n\nSource4Teachers, based in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said it could increase the fill rate from 64 to 75 percent by the start of the school year and 90 percent by January of 2016. It would pay certified teachers (including retired ones) between $90 and $110 a day, a fee considered the market rate for substitutes.\n\nOn the first day of school in 2015, however, Source4Teachers filled just 11 percent of all of its open absentee positions \u2014 leaving 477 classrooms without substitutes. Staffing services like Source4Teachers are thus in an uncomfortable position: They have to be cost-effective (or else districts wouldn\u2019t engage them), but not to such an extent that they can\u2019t fill absentee positions (or, again, districts wouldn\u2019t engage them).\n\n2. Many substitutes aren\u2019t specialized.\n\nLisa Blum, a veteran horticulture teacher at W.B. Saul High School, an agricultural magnet school in northwest Philadelphia, volunteers to coordinate coverage when absent teachers do not have substitutes \u2014 either because subs are unavailable or because they are underqualified.\n\n\u201cIn October and November,\u201d she says, \u201cwe were giving people so many coverages a week that they couldn\u2019t do a lot of what they have to get done.\u201d In addition to performing their academic duties, teachers at Saul, a vocational high school also have to run facilities like greenhouses. This is something not many subs are trained to do.\n\n3. Staffing services may not coordinate well with school districts.\n\nOwen Murphy, vice president of marketing at Source4Teachers, says the group \u201cacknowledges that we had a slow start.\u201d This staffing service is smaller than KES; founded in 2000, it works in four states \u2014 Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Virginia \u2014 and supplies substitutes to 200 districts, Philadelphia\u2019s being the largest.\n\nWhen Source4Teachers took responsibility for Philadelphia\u2019s subs, the district handed over a list of instructors it had worked with, which the agency calls \u201cdistrict originals.\u201d The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that of the 1,100 names on the list, only 600 re-entered the pool run by Source4Teachers.\n\nKaren Thomas, a principal at Bodine High School for International Affairs, has worked in education for 21 years. \u201cAs administrators, we want the jobs to be filled with competent people,\u201d she says. For much of her career, she has relied on retired teachers to return to the classroom as substitutes: \u201cWe have people who love to come here.\u201d\n\nThe problem with Source4Teachers, she says, was that \u201cthey didn\u2019t recruit enough,\u201d and they didn\u2019t pay enough. Many retirees didn\u2019t want to re-enter a new system that cut their daily pay by half.\n\nMurphy, of Source4Teachers, says the problem is that Philadelphia has \u201ca tremendous amount of teacher absences\u201d that offer a series of challenges that \u201canyone would have inherited.\u201d\n\nAnd, as noted, had Source4Teachers not offered an economical solution to Philadelphia\u2019s substitute-teacher problem, the city likely would not have worked with the staffing service in the first place.\n\nGood Signs for the Future\n\nBlum and Thomas say that the situation has improved in recent weeks, as Source4Teachers has processed hundreds of additional applications and agreed to raise pay for subs. In November, the district amended its contract with the agency, reassuming the responsibility of hiring long-term substitute teachers.\n\nSince mid-December 2015, Blum says about half of her school\u2019s absentee needs have been more regularly met. She disagrees, though, that teachers are to blame for the problem.\n\nAt her school, she says, most absences \u201care school-related,\u201d such as when classes take college trips, set up for the Philadelphia Flower Show, or participate in a national agricultural fair in State College, Pennsylvania.\n\nFor Thomas, the problem is larger than whether more jobs will become filled. \u201cThe bigger concern is that no matter what happens now, what\u2019s the long-term harm?\u201d she asks. \u201cWho is going to want to teach in Philadelphia?\u201d\n\nBlum agrees. \u201cThis whole thing has such a ripple effect. Are kids getting consistent anything when there are so many different teachers in their classrooms?\u201d\n\nAs magnets, Bodine and Saul High Schools have solid reputations. Although they have struggled to get subs into their classrooms, they have had much more success in attracting these short-term teachers than public schools in less desirable neighborhoods.\n\nPhiladelphia Superintendent Dr. William Hite has said that a large piece of the problem has been the unwillingness of substitutes to take jobs in certain schools and neighborhoods where they fear for their safety.\n\nOwen Murphy is confident that more employees will help Source4Teachers come closer to their goals in Philadelphia. Both he and Scott Apsey of KES say that working for companies like theirs offers new teachers a host of opportunities \u2014 and as many hours of work as they like.\n\n\u201cMany of our subs will end up taking full-time jobs with districts,\u201d says Murphy. After leaving college, candidates can use these agencies to \u201cget to know local principals, get to know what they look for in a district, what grade levels they prefer, and be in a better position when jobs open up.\u201d\n\nBoth KES and Source4Teachers are in the process of expanding their service areas; Source4Teachers hopes to launch in the Carolinas and Florida, and KES, largely based on the eastern seaboard, plans to expand into additional states, as well.\n\nRead the latest updates and opinions on education-related news, and find great schools near you with the Noodle school search tool.\n\nQuestions or feedback?
