(Bob) Bethell Joint Committee on Home and Community Based Services and KanCare Oversight last week that KDHE will begin sending notifications to case managers when their clients are placed in health homes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the process we\u2019re working on now, so that we can hopefully alleviate some of these issues and concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nKanCare, the state\u2019s privatized Medicaid program, began implementing health homes for 36,000 patients with severe and persistent mental illnesses in August 2014.\n\nThe program was meant to better coordinate the physical and behavioral health treatments of people with mental illness by pulling together their care providers under the three private managed care organizations who administer KanCare.\n\nAs part of the federal Affordable Care Act, the U.S. government is promoting health homes for some high-cost patients by offering to increase the federal Medicaid match for their services from the traditional 60 percent to 90 percent for two years.\n\nSusan Mosier, secretary of KDHE, said data on the first year of the program in Kansas should be available by the next KanCare oversight committee meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have a process that we\u2019re going through now to analyze the financial outcomes of health homes, because the idea behind health homes was that they would have better coordination of care, better integration,\u201d Mosier said. \u201cWe\u2019d have the better care and the lower cost. \u2026 We have seen that in other states.\u201d\n\nBenefits \u2018not delivered\u2019\n\nRandol said he and other state officials recently completed a \u201clistening tour\u201d of 22 cities in which health home partners discussed success stories, including reduced emergency room visits.\n\nBut Roxanne Hidaka, co-owner of Case Management Services Inc. in Overland Park, said she does not think the program is working.\n\n\u201cAll the fanfare about the benefits of people being in a mental health home are not being seen or delivered,\u201d she said.\n\nHidaka and other case managers who testified at Friday\u2019s committee meeting said they would welcome new notification procedures, but their concerns about the health home initiative go deeper.\n\nMarylin Kubler, director of a Johnson County case management company called Jenian, said she wanted the new notification procedures in writing and the state to notify parents of people being placed in health homes as well.\n\nHidaka agreed, saying the Medicaid clients themselves often don\u2019t understand the notification letters sent to them, especially if they have an intellectual or developmental disability (I/DD).\n\nHidaka said her clients often don\u2019t know the benefits or drawbacks of a health home and don\u2019t know that they need to opt out if they don\u2019t want to participate. As a result, they take no action, are enrolled automatically and aren\u2019t aware they should tell their case managers.\n\n\u201cThis program is not ready and not working and is causing a lot of confusion in the I/DD community,\" she said.\n\nOpt-out an issue\n\nSen. Laura Kelly, a Topeka Democrat, asked Randol what more could be done to notify parents about the health home enrollment as well.\n\nRandol said there were some limitations, due to medical privacy laws.\n\n\u201cWe can provide notification to the guardian or the responsible party that\u2019s listed in that particular member\u2019s file,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we would be able to provide that info to a member\u2019s parent or friend if the individual is not listed as a guardian or responsible party.\u201d\n\nKubler later gave Kelly a copy of a health home notification letter.\n\nAfter confirming with Randol that was the form sent to people being enrolled, Kelly shared additional concerns.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember who\u2019s getting this information,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even that obvious to me what this means, and the people who are getting this, some of them are lacking some of the cognitive skills to decipher what this means. I think we really need to do something about this whole process.\u201d\n\nKelly asked Randol if the state had considered making health home enrollment an opt-in program rather than requiring them to opt out.\n\nRandol said that was \u201ccertainly something we could discuss,\u201d but when Kansas began forming its program two years ago no other states were doing it that way.\n\n\u201cI think we were very concerned about the participation rate of members having to opt in,\u201d Randol said.\n\nSen. Jim Denning, a Republican from Overland Park, called the state\u2019s first attempt at health homes \u201ca false start.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opt-out was a major flaw,\u201d Denning told Mosier. \u201cIt should have been an opt in.\u201d\n\nState officials had hoped to expand the health homes program this year to include other eligible Medicaid patient groups, like people with chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes.\n\nBut Denning gathered enough Republican support to place a proviso in the budget delaying any such expansion for two years.\n\nOn Friday he seemed to foresee the health homes initiative being scrapped altogether, asking Mosier if there was a way to provide for a \u201csoft landing\u201d so the program can wind down gradually before the 90 percent federal match ends.\n\n\u201cIf a decision is made by the Legislature that you desire us to wind it down, then yes we would go through the process to do that,\u201d Mosier said.\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Following complaints by legislators and case managers, state officials say they are changing how they notify people on Medicaid that they\u2019ve been placed in", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/case-managers-raise-concerns-about-kansas-health-homes-program", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201508/case_managers__1_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Following complaints by legislators and case managers, state officials say they are changing how they notify people on Medicaid that they\u2019ve been placed in", "title": "Case Managers Raise Concerns About Kansas \u2018Health Homes\u2019 Program"}, "story_id": 434376384, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Andy Marso", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Case Managers Raise Concerns About Kansas \u2018Health Homes\u2019 Program"}, "nid": 77991, "datePublished": "2015-08-24", "wordCount": 1085, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc01\"", "article_summary": "KanCare, the state\u2019s privatized Medicaid program, began implementing health homes for 36,000 patients with severe and persistent mental illnesses in August 2014.\n\u201cWe have a process that we\u2019re going through now to analyze the financial outcomes of health homes, because the idea behind health homes was that they would have better coordination of care, better integration,\u201d Mosier said.\nSen.
