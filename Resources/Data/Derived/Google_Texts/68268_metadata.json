He is advising trade groups like the International Franchise Association and American Gaming Association on long-term strategy and how to sell their message not just to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, but to the public.\n\nMurray sees his role as more a strategist than a traditional lobbyist, and says that being part of Cantor\u2019s staff prepared him for the juggling act of interacting with the media, other lawmakers and outside groups to form a cohesive message.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one part legislative, one part communications\u2026how do you construct the worldview in which you\u2019re able to bring all those pieces together in a coherent way? That\u2019s the essence of the kind of work we\u2019re doing now and seek to do more of,\u201d he said.\n\nHave more staff moves or lobbying tips?

Meanwhile, her campaign has been relying on a team of strategists and fundraisers, many of whom have spent years as consultants or lobbyists for business interests working to obstruct the health care law, reports Lee Fang in The Intercept.\n\nAirline lobbyists and consumer advocates poised to duke it out over FAA bill: The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee this week is expected to consider the FAA reauthorization bill, and various special interests will be pushing to include their amendments, reports Christopher Elliott in The Post. A trade group for online travel agencies and reservations systems is lobbying for a congressional commission to study the state of air competition, contenting that recent airline mergers have left consumers with only four large domestic carriers. And airlines are looking to modernize air traffic control, favoring reform over privatization.\n\nLobbying\u2019s top 50: A group of 50 companies and trade groups spent a quarter of all money spent on federal advocacy in 2015, about $714 million, reports Megan Wilson in The Hill. They include Amazon, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Lockheed Martin. Amazon and the Grocery Manufacturers Association reported the biggest percentage increases in lobbying spending in 2015: Amazon by 91 percent and the trade group by 83 percent. Amazon declined to elaborate on its advocacy but the company has been lobbying the FAA as the agency looks to regulate drones. The Grocery Manufacturers Association has been taking more aggressive stances on the labeling of genetically modified food.\n\nDeparting lawmakers leave few clues on job prospects: Twenty-two House members have announced they will be leaving office at the end of the session, and many are now getting calls about potential jobs on K Street, reports Billy House in Bloomberg.
