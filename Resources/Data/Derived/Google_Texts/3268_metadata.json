But Republicans say they want changes in the program to reduce fraud and to encourage disabled workers to re-enter the work force.\n\nThe trustees said the retirement fund has enough money to pay full benefits until 2035, a year later than last year's reports.\n\nMedicare's giant hospital trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2030.\n\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
