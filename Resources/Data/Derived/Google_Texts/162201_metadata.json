Louie Gohmert saying that default is an impeachable offense:\n\nThe problem is who Gohmert wants to impeach for this.\n\nLauren Windsor, a reporter for The Young Turks asked Rep. Gohmert if he would support any deal to raise the debt ceiling. He answered, \u201cIt just depends on what it is,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe word \u2018deal\u2019 concerns me\u2026 if it\u2019s good for America.\u201d She followed up by asking, \u201cWould you allow us to default on our debt?\u201d Gohmert replied, \u201cNo, that would be an impeachable offense by the president.\u201d\n\nRepublicans failed to win the presidency in 2012. All of their legislative efforts to repeal the ACA have failed. The Supreme Court upheld the ACA as constitutional. Their attempts to destroy the healthcare reform law through a government shutdown and threats of default have crashed and burned, so some House Republicans have moved towards the pushing the big red button of impeachment.\n\nRepublicans have wanted to impeach this president since the moment that he took office. They have claimed that everything that this president has done is an impeachable offense, but even the most basic understanding of the constitutional separation of powers makes it clear that President Obama can\u2019t be impeached for default. Article I Sec.8 of the Constitution gives the power of the purse to Congress. This means if Congress does not pay our bills, that will be violating the Constitution.\n\nIf President Obama tried to raise taxes or borrow money on his own to pay our debts, he would be violating the Constitution. Congress has to pay the bills. What Rep. Gohmert is suggesting is that President Obama should be impeached because House Republicans have violated the Constitution.\n\nAs Lloyd Carter wrote, House Republicans are trying to pull a backdoor impeachment, \u201cThe dance over the debt ceiling and the fight over the government shutdown are nothing less than impeachment on the cheap: a chance to negate the will of the majority by ostensibly placating the letter of the law. Unable to win the last two presidential elections or to persuade a Supreme Court majority that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional, House Republicans have arrived at a point where default and closure are the next best things. This combustible brew of race, class, and economic anxieties bubbles all too closely to the surface.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are repeating all of their mistakes of the 1990s. They have already shutdown the government, and now they are threatening to impeach the president. Let\u2019s call any effort to impeach this president over a default what it really would be. A Republican impeachment attempt would be the ultimate publicity move in order to try to blame President Obama for their own crimes.\n\nThe only thing left that could make this situation politically worse for Republicans is if they tried to impeach Obama. The current version of the Republican Party appears to be in its death throes, and it\u2019s fitting that their last act may be to illogical attempt to impeach President Barack Obama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With their backs against the wall, House Republicans are threatening to impeach President Obama if the nation falls victim to the default that they caused.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "With their backs against the wall, House Republicans are threatening to impeach President Obama if the nation falls victim to the default that they caused.", "title": "House Republicans Want To Use Default As a Reason to Impeach President Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/14/house-republicans-default-reason-impeach-president-obama.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Obama-Confused-copy.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-14T12:28:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,default,default impeach obama,gohmert impeach obama,impeach barack obama,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-14T11:56:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-14T12:28:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "default, default impeach obama, gohmert impeach obama, impeach barack obama"}, "article_summary": "With their backs against the wall, House Republicans are threatening to impeach President Obama if the nation falls victim to the default that they caused.\nWhat Rep.
