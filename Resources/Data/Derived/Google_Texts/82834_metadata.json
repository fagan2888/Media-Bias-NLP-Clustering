While the draft itself wasn\u2019t provided to the public, hospital CFO Mike Metts presented a future with an improved bottom line, if lower reserves.\n\nThe hospital has faced financial impacts in the last year from recent investment in major projects, like the Meditech 6 overhaul of their medical records network. This, along with cuts from state government, left the hospital $1.5 million to $2 million in the red, according to hospital CEO Brian Cunningham.\n\nIn the coming year, Metts expects that hit to be alleviated somewhat. The proposed draft budget projects a net revenue of $77 million for fiscal year 2017, which Metts said is a $2.2 million improvement over the current fiscal year. After expenses, he said that should leave the hospital with a bottom line of around $37,000.\n\nWhile that is good news, it came alongside a surprising bite out of the hospital\u2019s cash-in-hand reserves.\n\nGila Regional\u2019s daily cash reserve has been a point of pride for the hospital for years now. As of the end of April, for instance, the hospital had enough cash in the reserve to cover operations for 132 days \u2014 with days of operation being the way hospitals measure their reserves. That April number is on track with the hospital\u2019s recent yearly average.\n\nIn 2017, Metts said that reserve number would likely decrease to an average of 106 days, based on two large projected expenditures.\n\nAt the board\u2019s March 25 meeting, Metts reported that following the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act, the hospital has lost payments from the uncompensated safety net care pool, adding up to a $200,000 monthly loss. He said that in 2017, the hospital plans to spend $2.6 million for that pool, which takes away 14 days\u2019 worth of funding from their cash reserves.\n\nThe cash for another 10 days is projected to go to capital expenditures.\n\nMetts also announced projected growth in both inpatient and outpatient care by 2 percent each. For inpatient care, that 2 percent would equal about 47 admissions per year. Broken down, that means the daily expected population will increase by one, to a total of 25.\n\nThe Gila Regional board of trustees voiced their confidence in the proposed budget, if not joy in its diagnoses.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be a tight year, a tight budget,\u201d said board member Jeremiah Garcia.\n\nStill, board Chair Charles Kelly said the budget represents the best effort to be as fiscally responsible as possible.\n\n\u201cIt appears to be a conservative budget,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s ready to go to state, but we do have until July 1 to change anything.\u201d\n\nKelly explained that the budget will now be sent to the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration for review. \u201cIf they find a large flaw they\u2019ll contact you, but if not it is usually approved,\u201d he said.\n\nCunningham said the DFA will also review the end-of-year financials. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the check in the system.\u201d\n\nMetts said the slight financial improvement fits the hospital\u2019s overall mission.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still wanting to see year-over-year improvement, and will continue to focus on controlling our costs,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a conservative standpoint, we\u2019re in line to be able to manage our operations and projects.\u201d\n\n\u2014BENJAMIN FISHER", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "This, along with cuts from state government, left the hospital $1.5 million to $2 million in the red, according to hospital CEO Brian Cunningham.\nIn 2017, Metts said that reserve number would likely decrease to an average of 106 days, based on two large projected expenditures.\nGila Regional\u2019s daily cash reserve has been a point of pride for the hospital for years now.\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be a tight year, a tight budget,\u201d said board member Jeremiah Garcia.\nWhile the draft itself wasn\u2019t provided to the public, hospital CFO Mike Metts presented a future with an improved bottom line, if lower reserves."}
