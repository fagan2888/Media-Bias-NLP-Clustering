The company, run by Bob Arum, has been a pioneer in legal live streaming of boxing events, with several already under its belt, and planned to continue the effort with what certainly would have been the biggest live streamed boxing match ever.\n\nBut, according to a Bloomberg Business News, report, the Top Rank plan was kayoed by the two cable networks cooperating to produce the pay-per-view broadcast, who put the kibosh on the whole idea.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a decision I was in favor of,\u201d Top Rank President, and son-in-law of Bob Arum, Todd duBeof said. \u201cBut I understood why they wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nTop Rank has entered into a deal with MLB Advanced Media, the company that produces the MLB.TV online service, which provides live streams of almost every Major League Baseball game, and has each season since 2003, for a subscription fee.\n\nTop Rank struck that deal in 2012, and has since put several fights online, including the controversial bout between Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley that same year, which Pacquiao lost by a highly questionable judge\u2019s decision.\n\nShowtime and HBO have been aggressive in shutting down illegal live streams on the fight before they have a chance to actually go online \u2014 though new sites seem to pop up as soon as the sites targeted by lawsuits shut down \u2014 but have no interest in streaming the fight legally on their own.\n\nPresumably, a legal online stream would cost about the same as the approximately $100 fee for the pay-per-view broadcast.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on terrestrial TV and a secure method to deliver the Mayweather-Pacquiao event to the masses,\u201d an HBO spokesperson told Bloomberg. The news service also reached out to Showtime, but that network was so uninterested in live streaming, it didn\u2019t bother to provide a response.\n\nOddly enough, the $100 fight will be broadcast for free in several countries around the world.\n\nThose countries include Mexico, China, Colombia, South Africa, Thailand, and France.\n\nViewers in the United Kingdom will pay just \u00a319.95 \u2014 which is about 30 bucks in American money.\n\nBut even in those countries, there will be no legal, live online streaming of the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao megafight.\n\n[Image: HBO Boxing]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight was supposed to be webcast via live online streaming, but cable networks HBO and Showtime vetoed the plan.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight was supposed to be webcast via live online streaming, but cable networks HBO and Showtime vetoed the plan.", "title": "Mayweather Vs.
