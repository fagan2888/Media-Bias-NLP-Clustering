Muir is also a generation younger than the 55-year-old Williams and 57-year-old Pelley.\n\nMuir is already known well to \u201cWorld News\u201d viewers as Sawyer\u2019s chief sub, and, since the start of the year, he has anchored half as many weeknights (46) as Sawyer (92), according to news consultant Andrew Tyndall. Muir has groomed himself for the job since he was a child.\n\nAs a latchkey child of divorced parents growing up near Syracuse, Muir took comfort from the news \u201cfamily\u201d that appeared on his television each evening. He watched ABC\u2019s Peter Jennings, trying to guess who would be named \u201cperson of the week.\u201d At 12, he wrote to Syracuse anchorman Ron Curtis for advice on how to get into the business and had an internship at WTVH-TV by the next summer.\n\nMuir became so familiar that the newsroom had a spot on the wall to mark how much he\u2019d grown each year. When he was still at nearby Ithaca College, WTVH hired Muir to anchor the weekend news.\n\nAfter five years at WTVH, he moved on to Boston and, in 2003, came to ABC News. Hurricane Katrina was one of the first places his work attracted attention.\n\n\u201cAll of the elements of being a news anchor he does superbly,\u201d said David Westin, the ABC News president who hired Muir. He shows versatility in reporting, interviewing and working in the studio, he said.\n\nNetwork anchors traveling to stories used to be more commonplace, and when Westin appointed Bob Woodruff and Elizabeth Vargas to replace Jennings a decade ago, it was on the theory that at least one would be on the road regularly. It has become less frequent, in part because of costs. Muir considers the reporting an important part of his identity and, he believes, what viewers expect of him.\n\n\u201cThe evening news is evolving rapidly, and I think we have to be extraordinarily nimble,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dinnertime newscasts have been shadowed by predictions of their demise for about as long as Muir has been working. But each has seen its viewership increase over the past year. Muir, who frequently tweets during commercial breaks, said the programs\u2019 abilities to sum up the day\u2019s most important stories is valuable at a time people are bombarded with information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Muir takes over at ABC\u2019s \u2018World News\u2019", "title": "David Muir takes over at ABC\u2019s \u2018World News\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "David Muir takes over at ABC\u2019s \u2018World News\u2019", "title": "David Muir takes over at ABC\u2019s \u2018World News\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/01/david_muir_takes_over_at_abcs_world_news/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/tv-abc-david-muir.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Muir takes over at ABC\u2019s \u2018World News\u2019", "title": "David Muir takes over at ABC\u2019s \u2018World News\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/tv-abc-david-muir.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Bauder", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll of the elements of being a news anchor he does superbly,\u201d said David Westin, the ABC News president who hired Muir.\nThe dinnertime newscasts have been shadowed by predictions of their demise for about as long as Muir has been working.\nWhen he was still at nearby Ithaca College, WTVH hired Muir to anchor the weekend news.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Among the stories David Muir will introduce during his first week as ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News\u201d anchor is one he reported about a generation of Syrian refugees missing out on an education.\nMuir considers the reporting an important part of his identity and, he believes, what viewers expect of him."}
