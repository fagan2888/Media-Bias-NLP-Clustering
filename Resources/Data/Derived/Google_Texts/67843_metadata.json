From 2001 to 2006, the Bush administration issued 75 major regulations. From 2009 to 2014, the Obama Administration issued 184 major rules, which is145 percent more than Bush.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a Democrat, Republican issue. This is a bureaucracy issue,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) at the Heritage Foundation event to release the report on Tuesday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a growing problem for a long time and continues to accelerate. I remind people often that the regulatory scheme is ground zero of the fight that we\u2019ll have with government for the coming days.\n\n\u201cOriginally we were a government by the people, for the people, of the people,\u201d said the senator. \u201cWhen the people have to come to someone else to seek permission for everything they do, it\u2019s shifted, and we\u2019ve seen that shift.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany more regulations are on the way, with another 126 economically significant rules on the Administration\u2019s agenda, such as directives to farmers for growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables; strict limits on credit access for service members; and, yet another redesign of light bulbs,\u201d stated the report.\n\n\u201cIn many respects, the need for reform of the regulatory system has never been greater. The White House, Congress, and federal agencies routinely ignore regulatory costs, exaggerate benefits, and breach legislative and constitutional boundaries. They also increasingly dictate lifestyle choices rather than focusing on public health and safety,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cImmediate reforms should include requiring legislation to undergo an analysis of regulatory impacts before a floor vote in Congress, and requiring every major regulation to obtain congressional approval before taking effect,\u201d stated the Heritage Foundation. \u201cSunset deadlines should be set in law for all major rules, and independent agencies should be subject\u2014as are executive branch agencies\u2014to the White House regulatory review process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "During the six years that President Obama has held office, the number and cost of regulations has continued to climb, with the issuance of 184 major rules estimated to cost $80 billion annually, according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Red Tape Rising report.", "title": "Obama Administration Issues 184 Major Rules Costing $80 Billion Annually", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/obama-administration-issues-184-major-rules-costing-80-billion-annually", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/obama_prez.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-19T15:14:00-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-19T15:14:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-19T15:14:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "During the six years that President Obama has held office, the number and cost of regulations has continued to climb, with the issuance of 184 major rules estimated to cost $80 billion annually, according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Red Tape Rising report.", "title": "Obama Administration Issues 184 Major Rules Costing $80 Billion Annually", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/obama-administration-issues-184-major-rules-costing-80-billion-annually", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/obama_prez.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "During the six years that President Obama has held office, the number and cost of regulations has continued to climb, with the issuance of 184 major rules estimated to cost $80 billion annually, according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Red Tape Rising report.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "From 2009 to 2014, the Obama Administration issued 184 major rules, which is145 percent more than Bush.\n\u201cThe addition of 27 new major rules last year pushed the tally for the Obama Administration\u2019s first six years to 184, with scores of other rules in the pipeline.\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the Bush administration issued 75 major regulations.\n\u201cSunset deadlines should be set in law for all major rules, and independent agencies should be subject\u2014as are executive branch agencies\u2014to the White House regulatory review process.\u201d\nPresident Barack Obama (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) - During the six years that President Obama has held office, the number and cost of regulations has continued to climb, with the issuance of 184 major rules estimated to cost $80 billion annually, according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Red Tape Rising report."}
