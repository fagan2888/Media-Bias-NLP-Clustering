But this week, speaking from a Michigan nursing home bed where he\u2019s recovering from a December 17 stroke, Breyfogle told Paste that his left hand\u2019s heroic act that day was managing to lift a glass of water.\n\nAnd yet, he says, \u201cI\u2019m crying tears of joy every day. It\u2019s almost like my stroke has been a blessing.\u201d\n\nLike many comic book artists before him, Breyfogle is experiencing the brutal reality behind the superhero glamour, where freelance artists with marginal or no insurance can find themselves crushed under medical bills from career-altering illness or injury. Even in the Affordable Care Act era, health-care security eludes many artists, including ones with histories as extensive and reputable as Breyfogle: the creator teamed with writer Alan Grant on notable Batman and Detective Comics runs, as well as co-created the character Prime, who played a key role in both the Ultraforce comic and cartoon for publisher Malibu.\n\nYet, he\u2019s also basking in the love of the tight-knit comics industry that passionately protects its own. Thousands of fans have donated more than $89,000 (and rising) to an online fundraiser to help address $200,000 in medical bills. The Hero Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to helping comic book creators in need, is also extending a helping hand along with Batman publisher DC Comics, which announced the publication of a hardcover anthology of Breyfogle\u2019s Batman work due for July.\n\nBreyfogle finds a weird irony in the fact that such a devastating crisis has reconnected him with so many fans \u2014 and provided him the chance to attract new ones. He has no idea whether he will regain full use of his left hand that\u2019s drawn hundreds of capes and cowls throughout his years. But he has vowed to learn to draw with his right, and to expand on his fiction-writing via voice-transcription software.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that it appears my comics career has been cut off for at least a while \u2014 maybe for good. But my creativity hasn\u2019t,\u201d Breyfogle says. \u201cI made a career out of drawing company-owned characters written by other people. I always thought that I had a writer inside me. Now I\u2019m being forced to take a chance on something nearer to my heart.\u201d\n\nBut first the 54-year-old faces \u201cgrueling\u201d recovery from a stroke that numbed his entire left side; luckily, his vision and intellectual faculties were not affected. But he must re-learn such basic motions as walking, and work to regain use of his hand. That therapy will take at least half a year and comes with a six-figure price tag.\n\n\u201cThe medical bills were insurmountable,\u201d says Wendy Wiegert, Breyfogle\u2019s sister-in-law, who runs the online fundraiser along with Norm\u2019s brother, Kevin. They\u2019ve had to \u201cexhaust Norm\u2019s life savings\u201d to cover current bills. Even the generous fan donations will cover only a \u201cmonth or so\u201d of the rehab he needs, and that\u2019s not counting his living expenses. Wiegert \u2014 who\u2019s in recovery herself from throat surgery \u2014 admits all the work is \u201ccrippling\u201d to her own organic-plant business, too.\n\nBreyfogle, who wears his left-wing politics on his sleeve \u2014 or his Facebook page, anyhow\u2014 is a fan of Obamacare, but was uninsured at the time of his stroke. \u201cStupidly, I did not sign up for Obamacare,\u201d he says. \u201cI just never got around to it. I was on the hamster wheel of meeting deadlines. I was in denial.\u201d\n\nBut comics fans shouldn\u2019t be lulled into thinking their favorite artists have an immediate safety net in the Obamacare era, says Jim McLauchlin, president of the Hero Initiative. Today\u2019s insurance benefits often only provide a drop in the bucket to help satiate medical bills like Breyfogle\u2019s, he said.\n\nMcLauchlin, who does have insurance, said he recently had surgery himself. \u201cI\u2019m still out-of-pocket about 3,500 bucks, even with quote-unquote name-brand insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Affordable Care Act was an amazingly positive step in the right direction,\u201d but there are still plenty of cracks to fall through.\n\nThat\u2019s where The Hero Initiative comes in. McLauchlin co-founded the organization 15 years ago, inspired by a similar Major League Baseball program to help ex-ballplayers from the days before multi-million-dollar contracts. Since then, the Initiative has aided about 70 comics artist and writers with approximately $750,000 in emergency funding.\n\nPeter David is one such creator who received aid from The Hero Initiative. The well-known author of Marvel\u2019s The Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man 2099 suffered a stroke similar to Breyfogle\u2019s in 2012. He told Paste that although he had insurance, he still needed a patchwork of help to cover his bills. Marvel offered help within an hour of when news of David\u2019s stroke broke.\n\n\u201cIf not for Marvel, I would have had to file for bankruptcy,\u201d David says. He also received help from The Hero Initiative, from fans, and from other authors \u2014 including Stephen King, who formed a Hero-like nonprofit of his own called The Haven Foundation.\n\nMcLauchlin says fans often assume that major comic-book corporations are heartless money-grubbers that don\u2019t care about the artists who helped build them, but that assumption is far from the truth. \u201cThe greatest supporter of The Hero Initiative from Day One is Marvel Comics,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDC Comics has called Norm to personally talk to him\u201d about his needs after the stroke, and pledged a donation, says Wiegert. DC did not respond to Paste questions, but it just announced a July publication of Legends of The Dark Knight: Norm Breyfogle Vol. 1, a hardcover collection of his and Grant\u2019s classic Batman work.\n\nFans still remain a crucial part of the equation as well, whether through direct donations or through purchasing such works. Breyfogle chokes up when he speaks of the \u201cimmense financial response from my fans. I\u2019m just overwhelmed by it\u2026I love every one of them.\u201d\n\nMcLauchlin says the best long-term assistance \u2014 and something Hero also helps with \u2014 is getting a comic artist back in the business. Once-famed artists falling out of work belies much of the financial trouble seen in these situations, McLauchlin says, noting, \u201cUnless you\u2019re Stan Lee\u2026your career is on the sine wave. It\u2019s up and it\u2019s down.\u201d That\u2019s been the case for Breyfogle, who moved back to northern Michigan 15 years ago for lower-cost living. He\u2019s had recent comics assignments, including a stint on Archie, but the jobs have dwindled.\n\nBreyfogle says the renewed attention to his work is one of the blessings disguised by his plight. He sees it as an opportunity to expand his writing of fiction and poetry, which he has experimented with online in recent years. A thoughtful speaker with a penchant for complex words and big ideas, he describes how his college studies moved him away from born-again Christianity into an interest in metaphysics and philosophy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something to say. I\u2019ve got a philosophical outlook,\u201d he says. In fact, while awaiting his voice-transcription tech, he\u2019s already writing in the most ancient of ways \u2014 in his own head, memorizing his own works by retelling them to friends and family. He shared one such piece with Paste, a \u201cparable\u201d about his stroke experience:\n\n\u201cIt was like I was in a pitch-black room and didn\u2019t know anything else\u2026but there was a spark of imagination in me that could see a paradise, and hope was paradise outside that room. For all I knew, the pitch-black walls stretched to infinity. I felt like there was no reason to live in just a pitch-black room. The main purpose I could find in life was to dig through the wall and see if paradise was out there. I had no idea how far I had to dig\u2026I was willing to dig until I died, or forever, for that matter. [I made a tiny hole and] I was so exhausted. My fingers were bloody stumps. I couldn\u2019t dig anymore. The only thing I could do was appeal to any benevolent beings that might help \u2014 pray, in other words. I\u2019m not a religious man. My prayers, quote-unquote, were answered by that pinhole.\u201d And that pinhole, he concluded, indeed expanded and enabled him to step into a paradise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a symbol of my state,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was shock and it was pain. But it blew my heart wide open.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Norm Breyfogle\u2019s left hand has drawn many a superhero, including an acclaimed run of Batman comics in the \u201980s and \u201990s.
