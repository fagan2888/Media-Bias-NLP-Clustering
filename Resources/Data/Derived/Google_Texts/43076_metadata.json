More people deserve phone calls from me. I just didn\u2019t have time to call all the people who helped me on this road.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old left-hander, a 2010 graduate of Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins, will have a sizable fan base welcoming him back to Colorado.\n\n\u201cMy guess is there\u2019s going to be over 300 to 400 coming out to watch him pitch,\u201d said Frank Gonzales, Marco\u2019s father.\n\nThe buzz surrounding Marco\u2019s debut has been big in Fort Collins.\n\nWATCH: Marco Gonzales talks about calling his mom to tell her he\u2019d make his big-league debut for the Cardinals in Colorado.\n\n\u201cMy phone has been absolutely blowing up,\u201d Rocky Mountain baseball coach Scott Bullock said. \u201cWithin the Rocky Mountain High School community, our small baseball community, there is a lot of excitement. No question.\u201d\n\nBullock was glowing with pride when Gonzales called Monday and told him he was being called up.\n\n\u201cSo many good high school baseball coaches never get to have that phone call,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cI\u2019m just humbled that I get to watch a kid that I coached in high school pitch in the big leagues. That\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nGonzales\u2019 father is the pitching coach for the Tri-City Dust Devils, a short-season Single-A affiliate of the Rockies based in Pasco, Wash. He said he was able to get time off from the Rockies in order to make it to Wednesday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cI got a call saying they would like to take care of the expenses of me going out,\u201d Frank Gonzales said. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal. It\u2019s a classy organization.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s excited to see his son\u2019s big- league debut but admitted, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have an initial nervous twitch.\u201d\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Marco Gonzales ready for his major-league debut against the Rockies", "title": "Marco Gonzales ready for his major-league debut against the Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/24/marco-gonzales-ready-for-his-major-league-debut-against-the-rockies/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140623__Marco-Gonzalesp1-1.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140623__Marco-Gonzalesp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-24T19:20:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:14:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4995\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWithin the Rocky Mountain High School community, our small baseball community, there is a lot of excitement.\n\u201cI\u2019m just humbled that I get to watch a kid that I coached in high school pitch in the big leagues.\nWhen St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Marco Gonzales makes his major-league debut against the Rockies on Wednesday at Coors Field, it probably will feel like a home game.\nWATCH: Marco Gonzales talks about calling his mom to tell her he\u2019d make his big-league debut for the Cardinals in Colorado.\n\u201cSo many good high school baseball coaches never get to have that phone call,\u201d Bullock said."}
