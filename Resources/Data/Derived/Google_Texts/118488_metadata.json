Jeb Bush, but he'd sure 'make a great president.' He also told 'Tonight Show' host Jay Leno why he went along with the government shutdown last fall.\n\nWho\u2019s got the tougher job: President Obama or the speaker of the House, Republican John Boehner of Ohio?\n\nIt\u2019s clear from his interview with Jay Leno, aired Thursday on \"The Tonight Show,\" that Speaker Boehner sees the White House as the worst of the two places to be. Asked if he\u2019d ever run for president, Boehner immediately answered no.\n\nIt\u2019d just be too tough on his personal habits. \u201cListen, I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass,\u201d he explained. Both activities contribute to his famous tan \u2013 also a topic of discussion. \u201cYou know, I do drink red wine. I smoke cigarettes. And I'm not giving that up to be the president of the United States.\"\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about bipartisanship? Take our quiz.\n\nThe studio audience applauded.\n\nBut Boehner had a suggestion for who might occupy the Oval Office in 2016. How about Jeb Bush? Not that he\u2019s endorsing the former Republican governor of Florida. (Who would want to cross the Bush matriarch, Barbara, who has laid down the line: No more Bushes in the White House?) \"I'm not endorsing anyone,\u201d Boehner told Mr. Leno, adding, \u201cJeb Bush is my friend and I frankly think he'd make a great president.\"\n\nChris Christie and his problems with Bridge-gate? It doesn\u2019t appear that the New Jersey governor, a GOP presidential favorite up until now, knew anything about it, the speaker said. Then he added: \u201cThis is not going to go away anytime soon.\u201d\n\nAs for the job of speaker, Boehner made it out to be no picnic, either. Leno asked him about Republican infighting \u2013 whether it\u2019s the worst he\u2019s ever seen on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cOh no, it\u2019s \u2013 well, maybe it is,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably. Yeah, probably.\u201d As the audience laughed, Boehner added, \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d But, he qualified, \u201cthe funny thing about the so-called infighting is that we agree on all the goals. We think Obamacare is bad for the country. We think we shouldn\u2019t spend more than we bring in. We think the president is ignoring the law.\u201d The fight is over tactics, he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that, \u201cyep,\u201d the Republicans were to blame for the partial government shutdown in October over the Affordable Care Act. He candidly laid out that this wasn\u2019t his idea. In the end, though, he felt he had to go along with it.\n\n\u201cI told my colleagues in July I didn\u2019t think shutting down the government over Obamacare would work because the president said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to negotiate,\u2019 \u201d Boehner said. But other Republicans insisted on going ahead. \u201cWhen I looked up, I saw my colleagues going this way. And you learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk.\u2026 So I said, \u2018You want to fight this fight? I\u2019ll go fight the fight with you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s not easy being John Boehner. The speaker joked about how tough it is to be a public figure with a name no one knows how to pronounce. \u201cIt's hard running for office when people can't say your name. You know, my name looks like Beener, Bonner, Boner.\u201d\n\nFor the record. It\u2019s BAY-ner.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "feb12d7ee23975f4e36a3f04e4c9a87d", "sailthru.author": "Francine Kiefer", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner (R) said he isn't endorsing former Florida Gov.
