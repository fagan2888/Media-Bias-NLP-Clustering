Gavin, deputy executive director of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, told The Associated Press.\n\nThat\u2019s less than 10 percent of the nearly 34 billion gallons of water the electric power industry - predominantly nuclear and coal power plants - drew in the region during 2011, according to data from the SRBC, whose coverage area includes much of central and northeastern Pennsylvania. The data is based on SRBC permits drillers are required to get.\n\nWhile overall drilling-related water withdrawals are declining in some regions, the Department of Environmental Protection relies on industry-supplied data, not monitoring of the amount of water taken. And the state doesn\u2019t publish complete records on how much fresh water each company uses and where they get it from.\n\n\u201cThe agency has no real way of knowing\u201d whether a company is complying with permits, said George Jugovic, a former top DEP official who is now with the environmental group Penn Future.\n\nDEP provided a report that estimated the 2013 total statewide water withdrawals by the oil and gas industry at about 4.2 billion gallons, but that doesn\u2019t include water that is purchased from water suppliers. DEP estimates that statewide the electric power industry uses almost that much freshwater in a single day.\n\nGavin said that while there has been \u201ca huge increase\u201d in drilling industry water recycling, the timing and location of water withdrawals is still a concern. That\u2019s because water taken from small mountain streams or during a drought has far more ecological impact than withdrawals from large rivers.\n\nThere, too, there has been some progress by drillers, Gavin believes.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say there\u2019s been more movement to the larger streams and rivers,\u201d Gavin said.\n\nMarcellus Shale Coalition spokesman Travis Windle said in an email that the SRBC data \u201creflects our industry\u2019s deep commitment to continuous innovation and operational efficiencies aimed at protecting and enhancing our environment.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists say the whole issue is part of the continuing challenge of updating record-keeping in a state that is suddenly home to the nation\u2019s biggest natural gas field, the Marcellus Shale. The drilling boom has been driven by the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process that uses large amounts of water and sand along with chemicals to break rock apart and free the gas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no statewide authority that identifies one agency as being responsible for tracking water usage,\u201d Jugovic said.\n\nDEP spokesman John Poister said there are some technical challenges to tracking water use.\n\n\u201cFreshwater has different connotations in the drilling industry,\u201d Poister said in an email, since it can actually be recycled water. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing so we do not track it that way.\u201d Poister added that drilling companies \u201care required to keep records for up to five years\u201d and that DEP sometimes requires them to submit monthly totals every quarter.\n\nJugovic agreed that DEP faces \u201ca really difficult challenge\u201d in monitoring fresh water withdrawals, but said it would be better if drillers were required to submit water withdrawals to an online, public database, as they do for gas production and wastewater.\n\nJugovic notes that in southwestern Pennsylvania DEP devotes significant resources to reviewing water withdrawal permits - but industry notice of actual withdrawals isn\u2019t required.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania is recycling more and more water and one river basin commission now reports drillers there are drawing less freshwater than in the past.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania is recycling more and more water and one river basin commission now reports drillers there are drawing less freshwater than in the past.", "title": "Gas drillers draw less water, but concerns linger", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/27/gas-drillers-draw-less-water-but-concerns-linger/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/20/gas-drilling-public-landsjpeg-0eee4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/20/gas-drilling-public-landsjpeg-0eee4.jpg", "description": "The gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania is recycling more and more water and one river basin commission now reports drillers there are drawing less freshwater than in the past.", "card": "summary", "title": "Gas drillers draw less water, but concerns linger"}, "Author": "KEVIN BEGOS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Environment, Department Of Environmental Protection, Dep, George Jugovic"}, "article_summary": "Gavin said that while there has been \u201ca huge increase\u201d in drilling industry water recycling, the timing and location of water withdrawals is still a concern.\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The gas drilling industry in Pennsylvania is recycling more and more water and one river basin commission now reports drillers there are drawing less freshwater than in the past.\nDEP provided a report that estimated the 2013 total statewide water withdrawals by the oil and gas industry at about 4.2 billion gallons, but that doesn\u2019t include water that is purchased from water suppliers.\nWhile overall drilling-related water withdrawals are declining in some regions, the Department of Environmental Protection relies on industry-supplied data, not monitoring of the amount of water taken.\n\u201cFreshwater has different connotations in the drilling industry,\u201d Poister said in an email, since it can actually be recycled water."}
