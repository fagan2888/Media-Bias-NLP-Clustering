The North Dakota Housing Finance Agency recognized several lending partners and housing advocates as Champions of Affordable Housing at the 23rd Annual Statewide Housing Conference held recently.

Among the lending institutions and individuals recognized was First Community Credit Union and loan officer Clayton Lilleby of Fargo, who received the 2015 Champion of Affordable Housing Individual Lender Award.

“The Champion awards recognize and celebrate the work of individuals, non-profit organizations, public agencies, and private sector businesses that make exceptional affordable housing contributions in North Dakota.” said Jolene Kline, NDHFA executive director.

NDHFA’s lender awards are based on participation in its homeownership programs and involvement in locally sponsored affordable housing projects and events. In addition to honoring lending institutions that originated the loans, mortgage loan officers that actively promoted the agency’s programs were also recognized.
