(AP) \u2014 A hefty fundraising shortfall has dashed plans to send a replica of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s funeral train car to trace the journey that brought the assassinated president\u2019s body back to Springfield, Illinois, from Washington.\n\nThe 2015 Lincoln Funeral Train organization had planned to recreate the trip as part of commemorations in April of the 150th anniversary of the president\u2019s death. But fundraising efforts fell $100,000 short of the $250,000 needed.\n\nMaster mechanic David Kloke in Elgin, Illinois, has spent about six years building the replica. The train car is still scheduled to be displayed at a May fundraising gala at a Springfield hotel, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will have a place in the official commemorative events in the state capital, the (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald reported (http://bit.ly/1MU8eRR ).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed, for sure,\u201d said Shannon Brown, spokeswoman for The 2015 Lincoln Funeral Train, which has backed Kloke in the project. \u201cWe wanted to be in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe replica is made from steel and wood and is 48 feet long and 13 feet tall. Kloke studied drawings and photos to build it with the help of volunteers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lincoln funeral train replica won\u2019t recreate historic trip", "title": "Lincoln funeral train replica won\u2019t recreate historic trip", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lincoln funeral train replica won\u2019t recreate historic trip", "title": "Lincoln funeral train replica won\u2019t recreate historic trip", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/lincoln_funeral_train_replica_wont_recreate_historic_trip/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/lincoln-funeral-train.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lincoln funeral train replica won\u2019t recreate historic trip", "title": "Lincoln funeral train replica won\u2019t recreate historic trip", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/lincoln-funeral-train.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ded\"", "article_summary": "The 2015 Lincoln Funeral Train organization had planned to recreate the trip as part of commemorations in April of the 150th anniversary of the president\u2019s death.\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed, for sure,\u201d said Shannon Brown, spokeswoman for The 2015 Lincoln Funeral Train, which has backed Kloke in the project.\n\u201cWe wanted to be in Washington.\u201dThe replica is made from steel and wood and is 48 feet long and 13 feet tall.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsELGIN, Ill.
