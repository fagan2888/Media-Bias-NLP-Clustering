Pete Dugan, a TPD spokesman.\n\nDugan said TPD received a welfare-check call at around 4:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 13. He said the caller reported a man in his late 20s \"acting erratically\" inside a home.\n\nThe TPD officer who responded to the call saw the man in front of the home armed with a knife.\n\n\"He immediately began giving commands to that person to drop the knife,\" Dugan said. \"During that altercation, while he was trying to get him to drop the knife, shots were fired.\"\n\nThe officer involved was not injured. Dugan said the officer who fired his weapon has advanced training in crisis intervention.\n\nThe man's condition was not immediately available, only that it had been stabilized.\n\nDugan said more details will be released as the investigation continues and information becomes available.\n\n\"The homicide unit will look into the criminal investigation of the incident to find out exactly what happened,\" Dugan said. \"Our office of internal affairs will also conduct a parallel administrative investigation to determine the acts of department personnel, which is standard protocol in all officer-involved shootings.\"\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
