Ellen Jones Elementary School gymnasium, where a new police substation begins operations today. By Harold J. Adams,The Courier-Journal (Photo: HAROLD ADAMS)\n\nNew Albany Police Sgt. Todd Bailey will serve as Chief of Police after former Chief Sherri Knight stepped down earlier this week.\n\nMayor Jeff Gahan also appointed chief of detectives Kenneth Fudge to Deputy Chief, according to a news release from the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nBailey is a 17 year veteran of the department and previously served as chief. He attended New Albany High School before receiving his Bachelor of Science in from the University of Maryland. Bailey also served in the United States Air Force from 1986-1991.\n\n\u201cI intend to focus on assisting the men and women of the New Albany Police Department in whatever manner necessary for them to effectively and professionally perform their duties,\u201d Bailey said in the release.\n\nThere was no mention earlier this week of what prompted Knight to step down, but city Police Merit Commission President Edward Hodges previously told the Courier-Journal that rank-and-file officers had complained loudly about Knight to city leaders. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of officers. They weren\u2019t happy with her. I heard it every day,\u201d Hodges said, adding that Knight \u201chad a tough job.\u201d\n\nAssistant New Albany Police Chief Greg Pennell also requested reassignment Tuesday, according to city spokesman Michael Hall.\n\nGahan said earlier this week that Knight informed him that it would be in the best interests of her family and herself to transition out of her position, allowing her to spend more time with her family.\n\nShe rose rapidly through the department of 65 officers after joining the force 18 years ago, moving from patrol officer to canine handler and then detective. Knight was appointed in December 2011 as Gahan took office for his first term. She\u2019s been a high-profile chief, running a popular gun buyback event, and was at the helm in several investigations, including the case of a mother dying a year ago with her two young children in a New Albany creek.\n\nCity Councilman Dan Coffey said a few dozen police officers met last week and voted on sending a letter to Gahan asking for Knight\u2019s removal, adding that a group of them have \u201cnever, ever been happy working under anybody. I hope they spend as much time policing as they have tearing down a really good police department.\u201d\n\nGahan said in the release he is confident Bailey and Fudge \u201cwill handle operations within the New Albany Police Department with professionalism and integrity.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1k4T1Mz", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Albany Police Sgt.
