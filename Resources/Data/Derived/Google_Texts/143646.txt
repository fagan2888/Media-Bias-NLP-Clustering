Gen. David Petraeus, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Gen. James Mattis, Gen Jack Keane and Lt. Gen Michael Flynn. All of them, Carly Fiorina claimed during last night’s fifth GOP presidential debate, were unduly forced out of their distinguished military careers for daring to express dissent in the Obama administration.

“Every single one of these generals I know, every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn’t want to hear,” Fiorina said on the Venetian debate stage in Las Vegas, Nevada Tuesday evening, promising to “bring back the warrior class” if elected president.

On his show, “Varney & Co,” this morning, for some unknown reason — and to his credit — Fox Business News host Stuart Varney asked one of the aforementioned “warrior class” generals if Fiorina’s description of a closed off president is accurate.

“Did you in fact, general, give advice to President Obama, which he didn’t want to hear and didn’t take?” Varney directly asked Fox News military analyst Gen. Jack Keane.
