Well, two examples come to mind from recent weeks. The first was Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) going after Tom Cotton.\n\nThere\u2019s a disgusting pattern emerging of Democrats attacking Republican candidates\u2019 records of service to the nation. Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) recently complained that Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR), his general election opponent, has a \u201csense of entitlement\u201d because of his military service. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in the Senate that didn\u2019t serve in the military,\u201d Pryor, who never served and is the son of a politician, told NBC News. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of this sense of entitlement that he gives off is that almost as like \u2018I served my country, therefore elect me to the Senate.\u2019 That\u2019s not how it works in Arkansas.\u201d\n\nA \u201csense of entitlement\u201d for mentioning your service record? That takes some serious chutzpah. It had the Morning Joe crew shaking their heads in disbelief.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only case to feature. Another advertisement from a group backing Mark Begich (D-AK) went after Dan Sullivan, ostensibly for not being a \u201creal Alaskan\u201d because he lived in Maryland for a while. And what nefarious activity was Mr. Sullivan up to when the Democrats feel he should have been back home on the frontier?\n\nSullivan moved to Washington in 2002, not long after the 9/11 attacks, to work in an advisory role for the National Security Council and the State Department from 2006 to 2009. During this time, he and his family lived in Bethesda, Maryland, but still maintained their residency in Alaska. It\u2019s worth noting that Sullivan has served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 1993 and has been recalled to active duty on three separate occasions, the most recent of which was in July 2013, when he was deployed to Afghanistan. He also spent 17 months in working in Africa working as a strategic advisor to Gen. John Abizaid.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see that the GOP isn\u2019t going to let this one sail over the plate. The NRSC is out with a new ad called \u201cUnacceptable\u201d pointing out the disgusting nature of these attacks. Check it out:\n\nI hope this is already on the air in the states in question. Let us know if you see it in your area.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Unacceptable", "title": "Video: Democrats still criticizing GOP Senate candidates for military service.", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/22/video-democrats-still-criticizing-gop-senate-candidates-for-military-service/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-22T15:31:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-22T13:18:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "Alaska, Arkansas, Dan Sullivan, Democrats, Mark Pryor, Senate 2014, Tom Cotton,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf425\"", "article_summary": "Video: Democrats still criticizing GOP Senate candidates for military service.\nSen.
