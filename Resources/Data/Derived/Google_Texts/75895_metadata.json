In addition, in February 2014, the White House Office of Science and Technology issued guidance for agencies to update their 2014 transparency plans, addressing such issues as whistleblower protections, records management and implementing the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\"Our community has repeatedly expressed concern over the failure of OMB to meet its open government obligations,\" said Patrice McDermott, executive director of OpenTheGovernment.org. \"It is now time for the president to direct OMB to take immediate steps to comply with the Open Government Directive and update its Open Government Plan in line with the 2014 guidance.\"\n\nRelated: Running Out of Patience, Obama Rebuffs Attacks on His ISIS Strategy\n\nThe purpose behind all the guidance, the groups stress, is to encourage agencies to link openness with their missions and address public concerns. \u201cOMB\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements is particularly troubling because OMB plays a central oversight role on information policy, and often serves as the right hand of the president,\u201d the letter said. Nearly all agencies have complied, but OMB\u2019s last update was in 2010.\n\nThe administration has been working with international groups on a third \u201cNational Action Plan\u201d to promote open government. The letter to Obama\u2014signed by library groups and the American Civil Liberties Union among others\u2014was also copied to Howard Shelanski, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n\nOMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Governemt Executive.
