The event, which continues Sunday and Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, is free with regular zoo admission. It offers more than 25 trick-or-treat stations, creepy-crawly animal demonstrations and pumpkin carving demonstrations.\n\nFor traditionalists who prefer things that go bump in the night, the zoo also offers Boo After Dark, an after-hours event for $17 for adults and $12 for children from 6:30-9 p.m. Oct. 30 and 31.
