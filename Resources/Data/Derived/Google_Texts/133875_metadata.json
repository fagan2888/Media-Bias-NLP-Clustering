American Principles Project communications director Jon Schweppe notes that 62% of all hospitals in the United States are nonprofit, and therefore \u201csimply can\u2019t function without [Medicaid] funding.\u201d On the other hand, Dr. Orient theorizes that rejecting federal funding may have the opposite effect: \u201cThis will also free them from a suffocating burden of costly regulations, enabling them to offer superior care at a fraction of today\u2019s prices\u2013and to preserve patient privacy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS says the purpose is to prohibit sex discrimination in healthcare and interprets it to include abortion.
