Police in New York shot and killed a man inside a synagogue after he reportedly asked for a Bible, stabbed a man and then lunged at police.

The incident took place inside one of Brooklyn’s most prominent Jewish places of worship, the New York Post reported.

The suspect, Calvin Peters, 50, was believed to be homeless, CNN reported.

Authorities and witnesses said he simply walked into the basement of the synagogue to a group of praying people, asked for the Bible and left. He returned shortly later and stabbed an Israeli student in the head, the New York Post reported.

“He’s a very serious student — he’d been studying all day,” witness Levi Deutsch told the New York Post. “He was stabbed in the side of the head. He was conscious, but he was bleeding a lot.”

Witnesses flagged down police, who confronted Mr. Peters — all captured on a dramatic video on the New York Post.

The suspect brandished his knife, and after shortly after, police shot him.
