Topics will include access to health care, diet, exercise, tobacco use and neighborhood environment, according to the release.\n\nThe neighborhoods that will be surveyed are Dixwell, West River/Dwight, Fair Haven, Hill North, New\u00adhallville and West Rock.\n\n\u201cIt is important to hear directly from residents so that we can develop programs and policies to continue improving health in New Haven. Every voice is crucial to this effort,\u201d said Jeannette Ickovics, director of CARE, in the release. \u201cTo transform New Haven, we must address the stark health disparities we experience as a city. If we can combat this, I believe that New Haven can be a model for the nation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIckovics is also a professor at the School of Public Health.\n\nCity residents have been hired and trained to conduct the surveys, which also were done in 2009 and 2012. Those surveys found high rates of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and asthma, the release said.\n\nOther findings included: 40 percent of residents were hungry, 30 percent smoked daily, a third felt unsafe during the day and two-thirds did at night.\n\nCARE has worked with neighborhood groups and others to build community gardens, bring farmers markets into neighborhoods and create other health-related programs.\n\nThe Partnership for a Healthier Greater New Haven, which includes CARE, the city Health Department and Yale-New Haven Hospital, is developing a health-improvement plan for the region, the release said. The survey also helps fulfill a requirement of the Affordable Care Act that requires hospitals to conduct such assessments.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "title": "New Haven survey to ask residents about health and lifestyle", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150818/NEWS/150819509", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.nhregister.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/nhregister.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New Haven survey to ask residents about health and lifestyle"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Residents of six  city neighborhoods will be asked about their health and lifestyle as a step to turn around rates of chronic disease, according to a release by the Yale School of Public Healt", "title": "New Haven survey to ask residents about health and lifestyle", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150818/NEWS/150819509", "image": {"src": "http://local.nhregister.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/nhregister.png?052016"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Residents of six  city neighborhoods will be asked about their health and lifestyle as a step to turn around rates of chronic disease, according to a release by the Yale School of Public Healt"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba16\"", "article_summary": "NEW HAVEN >> Residents of six city neighborhoods will be asked about their health and lifestyle as a step to turn around rates of chronic disease, according to a release by the Yale School of Public Health.\nTopics will include access to health care, diet, exercise, tobacco use and neighborhood environment, according to the release.\nThe Partnership for a Healthier Greater New Haven, which includes CARE, the city Health Department and Yale-New Haven Hospital, is developing a health-improvement plan for the region, the release said.\nCity residents have been hired and trained to conduct the surveys, which also were done in 2009 and 2012.\n\u201cIt is important to hear directly from residents so that we can develop programs and policies to continue improving health in New Haven."}
