Horror movies were referenced in comparison to Obamacare by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) during his lengthy speech-a-thon between Tuesday and Wednesday. On Wednesday at 7:00 AM, Cruz described remembering the eerie music from the films The Shining and Psycho.

“And it occurred to me that perhaps one of the great philosophical conundrums with which we must all wrestle is whether Obamacare is more like (Friday the 13th’s) Jason or (A Nightmare on Elm Street’s) Freddy,” said Cruz.

Cruz stated:

Argument for Jason, because Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country. When Jason put on his hockey mask and swung that machete, boy there was carnage like nothing else. On the other hand, You could make a powerful argument for Freddy, because as James Hoffa, the President of The Teamsters, said, ‘Obamacare is a nightmare. It’s a nightmare for the men and women of America. While the Senate slept, the men and women didn’t get their respite from the nightmare causing them to lose their jobs, never get hired, be reduced to 29 hours a week, driving up their health insurance premiums and jeopardizing their health care.’

Cruz even brought up the horror film Freddy vs. Jason, forgetting precisely what happened in the film other than the title character’s fight, he explained how he he thought Obamacare should be stopped.

“But the only way to stop Jason and Freddy is if the American people rise up in such overwhelming numbers that the members of this Senate listen to the people, and we step forward and avert this train wreck. We step forward and avert this nightmare,” said Cruz.
