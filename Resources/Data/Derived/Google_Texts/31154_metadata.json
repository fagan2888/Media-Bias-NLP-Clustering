The main messages are: \u201cBecause of Obamacare, I Lost My Insurance\u201d, \u201cObamacare Increases Health Care Costs\u201d and \u201cThe Exchanges May Not Be Secure, Putting Personal Information at Risk\u201d.\n\nThey order their troops to \u201cContinue Collecting Constituent Stories\u201d \u2014 aka, provide anecdotal backup to the claims they are making so the media has someone to parade in front of the public.\n\nThese instructions read exactly like a script for an ad campaign, except the difference is that our media is passing the script off as news. We\u2019ve already seen the news pick up on all three of the Republican ObamaCare narratives, and this is after they got taken in by Republican media plants concern trolling about the website, when it turned out they never even tried to use the website.\n\nRepublicans are doing anything they can to sabotage ObamaCare. They\u2019ve sabotaged the website rollout and the website itself by refusing to run the state exchanges and then refusing to fund the federal exchange to handle the added burden. Then they spread instructions on how to DDOS the website, while decrying its lack of safety and instability.\n\nSteve Benen rounded up the Republicans\u2019 scary movie talking points designed to sabotage a law and all of these fit right in with the script:\n\nThe quotes from House GOP leaders are rather remarkable. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said health care reform may lead to identity theft; Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) falsely claimed \u201cpremiums are going right through the roof\u201d; Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) warned that consumers who visit healthcare.gov may become victims of fraud; and Caucus Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) said vulnerable constituents may be put \u201con the casualty list.\u201d\n\nAll they need to make this a news story is a person willing to say that this happened to them. They have plenty of those, and the media doesn\u2019t bother to vet them to see if they even tried to use the website or if they can get a cheaper plan via the exchanges.\n\nThe media hops from one outrage to the next while never turning on the GOP to ask a question about why these stories feed their political agenda and so consistently turn out to be lacking in credibility. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t problems with the rollout \u2014 but there is no need to waste space discussing something that was already repeating what any sane person would have expected.\n\nThis is a coordinated effort to sabotage a law. Republicans aren\u2019t hiding their efforts, but why should they? Instead of fact-checking Republicans or even showing an ounce of skepticism no matter how many times they are burned by Republican aides leaking a false story to them, the media laps up the GOP\u2019s drama-filled tales.\n\nEach one of these talking points has been a news narrative.\n\nWhile I can understand why they fell for the IRS and Benghazi fictions, to fall for sabotaging a law is different. And this is a law, not an event or a bill. It\u2019s already been debated, vetted, and double vetted.\n\nThe nasty contempt with which the media reports on the alleged failures of this law has been stunning. The sneering reports of failure, the craven jumping from one talking point to another as soon as the first collapses with no accountability while declaring themselves to be the arbiters of accountability reveals just how closely the media falls in line with Republican talking points.\n\nAll they need is an actor to get a few quotes from and they\u2019re off to round out the edges of their GOP narrative. That is the formula \u2014 the GOP slips them a \u201cstory\u201d and an anecdotal actor \u2014 with the IRS story, the anecdotal actor turned out to have been a group already found guilty of illegally helping Republicans \u2014 but the media still ran with them as the example of Tea Party groups being targeted.\n\nTake that formula and apply it to an already confusing change (all big change is confusing, by the way \u2014 see Medicare Part D, which wasn\u2019t nearly so big a change). Groups that wanted to help explain the law to the public were threatened by the Republicans not to get involved or they\u2019d be investigated. The media is totally uninterested in investigating this abuse of power, as they sift through ObamaCare crumbs to see if what stray piece of negativity might have been missed.\n\nNot to worry, media, you\u2019ve only to wait for Republicans to craft your next story and hand it to you on a silver platter so you can feed it to the masses as proof that you really didn\u2019t fail us under Bush. You are very, very important people who take pushing back on a law designed to help protect the people from corporate greed very seriously. We know.\n\nWe don\u2019t need the media anymore. Why not just go straight to the source and pass out GOP talking points every morning as the news.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A perfect example of just how closely the media falls in line with GOP talking points can be seen in a Republican memo outlining their attacks on ObamaCare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A perfect example of just how closely the media falls in line with GOP talking points can be seen in a Republican memo outlining their attacks on ObamaCare.", "title": "Here's How the Media Helps Republicans with Their Sabotage of ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/21/republican-document-shows-quickly-gop-talking-points-turn-news-headlines.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-21-at-9.13.10-AM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-21T10:26:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-21T10:19:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T10:26:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb989\"", "article_summary": "Why not just go straight to the source and pass out GOP talking points every morning as the news.\nThe media follows Republican direction, even after they\u2019ve been lied to repeatedly by Republicans (Benghazi emails, IRS Tea Party targeting, etc).\nEach one of these talking points has been a news narrative.\nRepublicans are doing anything they can to sabotage ObamaCare.\nA perfect example of just how closely they fall in line with GOP talking points can be seen in a Republican memo outlining their attacks on ObamaCare, via the New York Times."}
