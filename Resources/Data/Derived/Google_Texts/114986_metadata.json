( Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park )\n\nThe Civil Conservation Corps was created in 1933 to employ young men during the Great Depression and was part of the Emergency Conservation Work Act.\n\nThe men that volunteered for the CCC were sent to camps and paid a dollar a day. Of their pay, $25 per month was sent back to their families. Character building, education and job trailing were part of the benefits.\n\nIn Colorado, 170 CCC camps were established with five camps in Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nIn Hollowell Park along Mill Creek were two camps sitting side by side. Today, the area is a large meadow with few hints of its past activity.\n\nIn 1933, a CCC camp was established in Little Horseshoe Park near the Ashton homestead site.\n\nNothing remains today at this 1933 CCC camp in Little Horseshoe Park. The site is located to the east of the Ashton homestead. (Courtesy of Rocky Mountain National Park)\n\nThe United States Army was in charge of structures, starting with tents following by standardized prefabricated frame buildings.\n\nFor the Hollowell Park camps, the intent was to have the young men work throughout the year. The multi-use frame structures of modular design were heated by stoves and could be erected or dismantled quickly.\n\nThe buildings were virtually identical and were defined by function rather than appearance. The most common buildings were dormitories. There was a mess hall combination kitchen. There was also a lavatory and bathhouse with one building was used as an infirmary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first camp in Hollowell Park was designated as NC-4-C and was established in 1934. The second camp, NC-11-C, sat beside the first camp and was established six years later. A water line was installed to bring Mill Creek water to the camps, and they were eventually landscaped. A partially paved service road curved around from today's parking lot through camp ending up on the hillside.\n\nAs World War II approached, it was clear that most of the young men would be drafted into the service. The United States was also coming out of the Depression.\n\nThe memorial plaque to Robert E. Fechner, director the Civil Conservation Corps form 1933 to 1939, is mounted to a small boulder at the edge of the tree line in Hollowell Park. (Kenneth Jessen / Special to the Reporter-Herald)\n\nThe first camp was closed in 1941 followed by the second camp a year later. The buildings were dismantled and removed, but the site was not completely cleared until the 1960s.\n\nSo little evidence exists today that it shows the care taken by the National Park Service to remove all debris, fill in the outhouse pits, take up concrete foundations and obliterate the paved road. Most of the material was buried.\n\nIn 1940, a plaque to Robert E. Fechner, director the Civil Conservation Corps from 1933 to 1939, was placed on top of a small boulder at the edge of the tree line.\n\nThere were numerous jobs performed by the CCC including pine beetle control in the ponderosa stands. Thousands of old stumps were removed and the CCC helped raze the buildings in Moraine Park that had been purchased by the National Park Service.\n\nVisitors today enjoy the fruits of CCC trail improvements and new trail construction.\n\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965.
