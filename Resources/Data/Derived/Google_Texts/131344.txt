It's Breast Cancer Awareness Month and one local barber shop is helping the community go "Bald for Boobies".

The barbers at Gentlemen's Corner in New Hartford call Thursday their slow day, but today the shop was far from empty.

"We are doing Bald for Boobies a big benefit for Making Strides Against Breast Cancer. We've teamed up with KISS FM and we are really excited about it." Paul Diamond, owner and master barber at the shop = said.

The shop buzzed heads all day with proceeds donated toward cancer research and for those-getting the courage to get in the chair is a small way the community hopes to show those fighting this disease, they have our support.

"They are nervous about what they are going to look like after, you know once they shave their head. Some of them have never shaved their head before. " Diamond said.

"My hair is thinning anyway!" said just one of the many who decided to shave their whole head today.

"It's a good feeling. Everybody is taking pictures with their shirts and putting money in the barber pole and yeah everyone is excited." Diamond said.

An excitement for Paulie that grows with each head he shaves- in memory of his mother and in hopes of making a change.

" Cancer has touched a lot of peoples lives and its a big benefit we are really pumped to be apart of it." Diamond said.
