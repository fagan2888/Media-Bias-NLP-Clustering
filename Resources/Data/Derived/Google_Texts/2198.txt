Welcome to our feature highlighting the numerous Colorado tech companies that make cool stuff. These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.

Email on Acid

A company that sends out wonky e-mails that look terrible has no excuse today. Email on Acid will run e-mails before they are sent to recipients through its extensive test system to quickly show how an e-mail looks on 44 different types of e-mail services , including mobile devices and Outlook 2003. And it’ll show how to fix it. But of course, the company isn’t just about good-looking e-mail — it’s on acid! It’ll also textify images that are otherwise blocked by the user, de-spam messages to prevent them from heading straight to spam folders, and offer analytics so companies know who opened an e-mail and what happened next.5670 Greenwood Plaza Blvd. in Greenwood Village2009Siblings John Thies and Michelle “Miki” Klann18Celebrated its sixth birthday in July(720) 242-7633
