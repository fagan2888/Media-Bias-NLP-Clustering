Assess your Medicare options and review your plan\n\nContrary to a common misperception, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, does not affect Medicare beneficiaries. But what many beneficiaries don\u2019t realize is that signing up for Medicare can be a fairly time-consuming process \u2014 you have to choose among a variety of plans, and making the wrong decision can lead to substantially higher costs. You need to choose which plan is the most cost-effective for you, given your particular health and prescription-drug needs.\n\nAlso read: 5 best money moves for boomers in 2014.\n\nThe good news is you can change your plan each year during Medicare\u2019s open enrollment period. Read more about Medicare\u2019s open-enrollment season.\n\n\u201cMedicare has complex rules, and you should do homework to find out how they apply specifically to your enrollment needs and options, including whether it makes sense to enter the program at 65,\u201d said Debra Whitman, AARP\u2019s executive vice president for policy, strategy and international affairs, in a recent blog post.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already claimed Social Security, you\u2019ll be automatically enrolled for Medicare Parts A and B, Whitman said. If you\u2019re delaying Social Security, then you\u2019ll need to initiate your Medicare on your own.\n\n\u201cIf you are beyond 65 and getting health insurance from your own or your spouse\u2019s employer, you can probably delay Medicare enrollment until that employment ends, without risking late penalties,\u201d Whitman said. If you\u2019re unsure about when to enroll, try calling Social Security at 800-772-1213.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve been a Medicare beneficiary for years, you should take time once a year to review your plan. Whitman said she goes online every Thanksgiving to check that her father-in-law\u2019s plan is still the best deal for him; she saved him $400 this year by switching to a lower-cost plan.\n\n\u201cI type in all of my father-in-law\u2019s drugs and his favorite pharmacy to make sure there aren\u2019t really any changes from his perspective, and then I just do a plain cost comparison,\u201d she said. \u201cI really encourage people to check each year. The price increase can go up substantially over time.\u201d\n\nCheck out this Medicare.gov page if you\u2019re just getting started with Medicare.\n\n2. Revisit your retirement plan\n\nAre your finances on track? The only way to find out is to review your written retirement plan (and, if you don\u2019t have one, to create one).\n\nOne common problem for retirees who don\u2019t have an up-to-date plan: they\u2019re so worried about running out of money that they fail to enjoy their retirement.\n\n\u201cA lot of people retire and they\u2019re afraid of spending their money, so they hoard it,\u201d Jeff Gorton, a CPA and certified financial planner in Oklahoma City, told me when I spoke with him about written retirement plans in October. Read more: Write it down: Plan for retirement success.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need to visit a financial planner to come up with a plan, though the right expert can make the process easier, particularly when it comes to choosing which accounts to pull income from first.\n\nAt its simplest, your plan simply details your income and expenses. And don\u2019t worry so much about income that you ignore your expenses. Check out this story on a cheapskate\u2019s guide to retirement saving \u2014 a useful read for retirees as well as those still saving for retirement.\n\n3. Evaluate your distribution method\n\nWhile you\u2019re taking a look at your written retirement plan, consider the method by which you\u2019re pulling money from your retirement accounts. One common rule of thumb is the 4% rule \u2014 you pull out 4% a year, every year \u2014 but there\u2019s plenty of debate about how appropriate that rule really is.\n\nRead more: 4% solution for retirement doesn\u2019t fit all.\n\nOne alternative: a method that entails adjusting based on your portfolio\u2019s performance. \u201cWe advocate a dynamic distribution method,\u201d said John Nersesian, managing director for Nuveen Investments, in Chicago.\n\n\u201cDynamic distribution means you don\u2019t just pick a number, close your eyes and stick with it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be willing to make adjustments along the way, adjustments that reflect the change in market environment.\u201d\n\nWhy is this so important? \u201cWhen you take out more money from a portfolio that has declined sharply in value, that\u2019s what destroys retirement portfolios,\u201d Nersesian said.\n\n\u201cIf your portfolio value has declined, you have to come up with some rules, guidelines, sacrifices that reflect that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a plan. Don\u2019t just take out money randomly, and be willing to modify [your plan] to reflect a change in market environment.\u201d\n\n4. Create and review your estate plan\n\nHave you made plans for divvying up your estate after your death? In addition, you need to prepare for the possibility of becoming incapacitated and unable to handle your financial affairs.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a will, possibly one or more trusts, a durable power of attorney so that a trusted friend or family member can take care of your finances should you become incapacitated, a durable health-care power of attorney for medical situations, and a living will for your end-of-life wishes.

These items may not have much monetary value, but if you don\u2019t make plans for sharing keepsakes, you risk your family devolving into conflict over these items. Read more: Your heirs want this even more than your money.\n\nAnother keepsake to consider: your family\u2019s history. Whether it\u2019s embodied in stories or photographs, make a point of talking with your family about your history and your values \u2014 before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAlso, some people create \u201cethical wills\u201d \u2014 documents that aren\u2019t legally binding but that convey a sense of your hopes and dreams for your family. Read the story linked above for more information.\n\n5. Don\u2019t neglect your tax planning\n\nEstate planning is closely linked to tax planning. For example, consider a gifting strategy to reduce your estate\u2019s tax hit. You can give up to $14,000 a year to an unlimited number of people, without a tax hit.\n\n\u201cA grandparent may decide to put $14,000 each into their grandson or granddaughter\u2019s 529 [college-saving] plan,\u201d Nersesian said. \u201cThere\u2019s no gift tax, no reduction in their estate tax exemption, it\u2019s a freebie and they\u2019re funding a 529 plan that will grow tax-free for their grandkids.\u201d Read more about the gift tax on this IRS.gov page.\n\nAnother tax strategy to consider: Managing how and when you receive income. That can affect the taxation of your Social Security benefits and, potentially, the size of your Medicare premium. Also, read this Medicare.gov page for information on what income level will trigger higher Part B premiums.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nHow to take the pulse of your nest egg.\n\nTax tips for retirees and pre-retirees\n\nPeople 70-1/2 or older must consider their required minimum distributions.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Some people say they\u2019ll never retire, but whether you plan to retire at 62, 72 or never, age 65 remains an important milestone for several reasons \u2014 especially Medicare.", "creator": "@andreacoombes", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR943_Retire_MG_20140105124548.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Andrea Coombes", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Retirement", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Some people say they\u2019ll never retire, but whether you plan to retire at 62, 72 or never, age 65 remains an important milestone for several reasons \u2014 especially Medicare.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-best-money-strategies-for-those-65-and-up-2014-01-06", "author": "Andrea Coombes", "parsely-title": "5 best money strategies for those 65 and up", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-06T06:01:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Retirement", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Some people say they\u2019ll never retire, but whether you plan to retire at 62, 72 or never, age 65 remains an important milestone for several reasons \u2014 especially Medicare.", "title": "5 best money strategies for those 65 and up", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-best-money-strategies-for-those-65-and-up-2014-01-06", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR943_Retire_MG_20140105124548.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BR943_Retire_MG_20140105124548.jpg"}, "article.id": "F1BC3104-7413-11E3-A8F2-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7d7\"", "article_summary": "Evaluate your distribution methodWhile you\u2019re taking a look at your written retirement plan, consider the method by which you\u2019re pulling money from your retirement accounts.\nAlso read: 5 best money moves for boomers in 2014.\nThe only way to find out is to review your written retirement plan (and, if you don\u2019t have one, to create one).\nDon\u2019t just take out money randomly, and be willing to modify [your plan] to reflect a change in market environment.\u201d4.\n\u201cWhen you take out more money from a portfolio that has declined sharply in value, that\u2019s what destroys retirement portfolios,\u201d Nersesian said."}
