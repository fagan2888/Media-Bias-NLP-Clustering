Again, for the 25th consecutive time over a nine-game span. And just 29 seconds after the Jets tied it 1-1 2:04 into the second period by taking advantage of two defensive miscues, Colorado went back on the power play. Make it 26 straight failed power plays, at 5-on-4, 4-on-3 or 5-on-3, that is.\n\nThe Avs are money at 6-on-5 with goalie Semyon Varlamov pulled, having taken their 1-0 lead on Tyson Barrie\u2019s wrist shot during a delayed penalty 10:57 into the game, and late in the third period while in desperation mode. Those were their fifth and sixth 6-on-5 goals of the season. At the rarest and most desperate of times, they are money.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nBut the Avs\u2019 power play is bankrupt, not constructive and costly. After going 0-of-2 with the advantage with Varlamov in net, the Jets struck for two power-play goals in their dominating four-goal period that blew the game open.\n\n\u201cI actually thought we were playing a pretty good hockey game up to that point,\u201d said Barrie, who returned after missing the last two games with a hip injury. \u201cBut 0-for-26 is pitiful. The power play can be the difference in a game. You look at theirs, it was good. They got two on the power play. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe Avs previously lost 6-2 at Winnipeg in a similar situation, completing a back-to-back trip against the Jets. But weary travel legs aside, Colorado was simply not playoff material in Saturday\u2019s 18-shot, 1-0 loss at Minnesota and against the struggling Jets.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we actually got a goal on the power play,\u201dsaid the Avs\u2019 Ryan O\u2019Reilly, who had three shots in 20:51, tops among forwards. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that has been addressed, and we have to find a solution to it soon to get into the playoffs.\u201d\n\nMatt Duchene and Alex Tanguay scored goals at 7:07 and 17:40 of the third period, the latter with Varlamov on the bench for a sixth attacker. Mathiew Perreault, Dustin Byfuglien (power play), Ben Chiarot and Bryan Little (power play) scored to give Winnipeg a 4-1 lead, and Jacob Trouba struck between the Duchene and Tanguay goals.\n\n\u201cIt was our second game in less than 22 hours, and I was very pleased with our first period, the way we came out,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cWe could have had a 2-0 lead. \u2026 I would say the rest of the game, in the second and third, we had too many turnovers and giveaways, and they scored on their power play.\u201d\n\nThe Avs (22-21-11), who fell six points behind the final wild-card playoff berth and third to last in the 14-team Western Conference, begin a four-game homestand Thursday against the New York Rangers.\n\n\u201cNow we have a lot of games at home coming up,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be sharp, and we\u2019re going to have to play some solid hockey.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Avalanche fails on power play, falls 5-3 to Winnipeg Jets", "title": "Colorado Avalanche fails on power play, falls 5-3 to Winnipeg Jets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/08/colorado-avalanche-fails-on-power-play-falls-5-3-to-winnipeg-jets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150208__avs-jetsp1.jpg", "height": 389}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150208__avs-jetsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-08T18:52:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T23:00:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Avs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike ChambersBut the Avs\u2019 power play is bankrupt, not constructive and costly.\nMathiew Perreault, Dustin Byfuglien (power play), Ben Chiarot and Bryan Little (power play) scored to give Winnipeg a 4-1 lead, and Jacob Trouba struck between the Duchene and Tanguay goals.\nAnd just 29 seconds after the Jets tied it 1-1 2:04 into the second period by taking advantage of two defensive miscues, Colorado went back on the power play.\nThey got two on the power play.\nThe power play can be the difference in a game."}
