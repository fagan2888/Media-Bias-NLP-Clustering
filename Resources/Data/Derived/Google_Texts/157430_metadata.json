Aside from personality, a man\u2019s health also predicted whether couples would achieve a happy long-lasting marriage through the decades.\n\n\u201cWives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health, Iveniuk said in a statement. \u201cIf the wife is in poor health, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband.\u201d Interestingly, the wife\u2019s positive attitude or good health failed to affect the marital outcomes of 953 cohabiting heterosexual couples, married and unmarried. The couples had stayed together an average length of 39 years, and ranged in age from 63 to 90.\n\nWhat mattered most were personality traits among men including open-mindedness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and anxiety. And the overwhelming desire to be seen by others in a positive light was a quality the researchers measured as \u201cpositivity.\u201d The original survey had recorded perceptions from men and women about themselves and their spouses. \u201cWives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict,\u201d Iveniuk said. \u201cHowever, the wives\u2019 positivity had no association with their husbands\u2019 reports of conflict.\u201d\n\nThis new study might best be summarized as \u201cHow much does your spouse bother you?\u201d said co-researcher Linda J. Waite, a professor of aging at the university, in the statement. \u201cThe clashes are not primarily about fighting and violence, but rather whether one spouse criticizes the other, makes too many demands, or generally gets on the other person\u2019s nerves.\u201d Men who described themselves as neurotics or extroverts drew the most complaints from their wives. Yet, husbands were less bothered by wives self-described as neurotic.\n\nWith women, things tended to balance out. Whereas wives complained at higher rates about marriage than men, they also offered greater levels of emotional support. \u201cSeveral previous studies have been about the implications of marital status on health,\u201d Waite said. \u201cThis research allows us to examine individual marriages and not \u2018married people.\u2019 We have the reports on the quality of the marriage from each person, about their own personality and their own health.\u201d Yet, future examinations of the long-term marriage might go beyond the present study, the researchers said. By removing negative personality traits and health as factors, it might be possible to more closely examine the emotional balance between husbands and wives, everything else being equal.\n\nSource: Iveniuk, James, Waite, Linda J., Laumann, Edward, McClintock, Martha K., Tiedt, Andrew D.
