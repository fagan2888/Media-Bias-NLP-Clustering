(AP) \u2014 Kathy Bates calls herself \u201can old lion.\u201d\n\nThe actress says she also plays one in the big-screen comedy \u201cTammy,\u201d in theaters this weekend. Bates portrays Lenore, a successful entrepreneur who figuratively slaps sense into the film\u2019s lovable loser of a titular character (Melissa McCarthy).\n\nThe 66-year-old \u201cMisery\u201d Oscar winner tells us more:\n\n___\n\nAP: I must admit I\u2019m surprised to find you in this movie. You\u2019ve done a few light comedies, such as Adam Sandler\u2019s \u201cThe Waterboy.\u201d But we\u2019re used to seeing you in dramas.\n\nBates: I\u2019d heard they (the creative team of McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone) wanted me for a part. I didn\u2019t know what part. I told my agent, \u201cI will play a giraffe with green spots, whatever they say.\u201d (Laughs.)\n\nAP: What was the appeal of McCarthy?\n\nBates: Even when she gets outrageous, when she gets on the most ridiculous jaunts and puts a bag on her head and all of that, you go with it, because it\u2019s real. It\u2019s grounded in reality. You almost believe, \u201cHey! I\u2019d do that, too.\u201d\n\nAP: As Tammy and her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) careen out of control on their road trip, and in life, Lenore sets them both straight. She\u2019s a role model.\n\nBates: I think of Lenore as an old lion. It\u2019s taken her many years to create her business, to have a life for herself and (partner) Susanne (Sandra Oh). They met in college and I think they came out when it was very difficult for lesbians to be accepted.\n\nAP: (The gay-cinema historian) Vito Russo would have loved that Lenore is incidentally gay. Her sexuality isn\u2019t the point of the character.\n\nBates: What I love about the way we are portrayed in the film is that Susanne and Lenore are a normal, healthy couple, which says, \u201cYou can\u2019t legislate who you love.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With \u2018Tammy,\u2019 \u2018Freak Show,\u2019 Bates keeps roaring", "title": "With \u2018Tammy,\u2019 \u2018Freak Show,\u2019 Bates keeps roaring", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With \u2018Tammy,\u2019 \u2018Freak Show,\u2019 Bates keeps roaring", "title": "With \u2018Tammy,\u2019 \u2018Freak Show,\u2019 Bates keeps roaring", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/04/with_tammy_freak_show_bates_keeps_roaring/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/film-q-and-a-kathy-bates.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With \u2018Tammy,\u2019 \u2018Freak Show,\u2019 Bates keeps roaring", "title": "With \u2018Tammy,\u2019 \u2018Freak Show,\u2019 Bates keeps roaring", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/film-q-and-a-kathy-bates.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Cidoni Lennox", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bates: I\u2019d heard they (the creative team of McCarthy and husband Ben Falcone) wanted me for a part.\nBates portrays Lenore, a successful entrepreneur who figuratively slaps sense into the film\u2019s lovable loser of a titular character (Melissa McCarthy).\nI\u2019d do that, too.\u201dAP: As Tammy and her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) careen out of control on their road trip, and in life, Lenore sets them both straight.\nBates: I think of Lenore as an old lion.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
