The New York Times is taking it easy on President Barack Obama once again, this time saying Obama made an “incorrect promise” when saying Americans could keep their health plans.

The newspaper evolved from saying the President “misspoke” when he said Americans could keep their current plans under the Affordable Care Act to writing Obama made an “incorrect promise.” Appearing in an article Tuesday in the Times’ national section — as opposed to the editorial pages — reporters Michael Shear and Robert Pear once again fail to recognize Obama’s broken promise for what it is: a lie.

“The split between lawmakers and the White House reflects the dilemma the president finds himself in as he seeks to follow through on last week’s acknowledgment about his incorrect promise on health care coverage,” the article, titled “Obama in Bind Trying to Keep Health Law Vow,” states.

President Obama repeatedly said Americans would be able to keep their current health plans under his signature healthcare law, but failed to follow through. Just days after Obamacare’s rollout, thousands reported receiving cancellation notices, and as the administration attempts to cover its tracks on the broken promise, more than 5 million have been told they are losing their plans.

The Times was criticized after a Nov. 2 editorial stated the President “clearly misspoke.” Many fired back against the newspaper was going too easy on the President and giving him a free pass.

Obama did apologize for his “incorrect promise” in an interview with NBC News’ Chuck Todd last week, saying he was sorry Americans “are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me…”
