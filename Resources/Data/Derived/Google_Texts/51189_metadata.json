Sixty-one percent of Delawareans live in Census tracts where there is no grocery store, according to a report by the Institute for Public Administration, a unit of the University of Delaware\u2019s School of Public Policy and Administration. Twenty-seven percent of the state\u2019s population live in census tracts, usually consisting of 1,200 to 8,000 people, that only have one grocery store.\n\nThese numbers were released after New Jersey-based Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company Inc. said in July that they were shuttering the Pathmark located at 3901 Lancaster Pike near Wilmington and a SuperFresh at 2105 Philadelphia Pike near Claymont.\n\nThe closures come as the Montvale, New Jersey, company filed for bankruptcy protection. In a statement, the company, better known as A&P, said it was closing the stores \u201cin the near-term due to lack of interest and significant ongoing store operating losses.\u201d\n\nSome shoppers of the Pathmark, which sits near a low-income community of apartments, told The News Journal in July that they felt unsafe and stopped going there at night. Others were concerned that they would soon have to drive an extra 10 minutes to the Pathmark along Kirkwood Highway.\n\nThe chain announced it was selling 120 of its stores to three grocery chains, including Acme Markets Inc., for $600 million. A&P officials could not be reached for comment as to what would happen to the store buildings in the Wilmington area.\n\nThe stores\u2019 fixtures and equipment were auctioned off last week. And at least one commercial real estate broker doesn\u2019t believe either building will be occupied by another grocery store.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if another grocery store came in,\u201d said Bill Ganc, owner of Ganc Commercial Realty in Brandywine Hundred.\n\nThere is already a saturation of grocery stores, he said. And with Target, Walmart and Dollar General stores also selling food it makes it challenging to open new supermarkets.\n\n\u201cAs these Dollar General and Family Dollar [stores] crop up, I think they keep taking a slice out of the grocery stores,\u201d Ganc said.\n\nBuy Photo Fixtures and equipment from the Pathmark on Lancaster Pike were auctioned off last week.

They also have the Kenny Family Foundation, which supports more than 1,100 local organizations.\n\nThis involvement with the community helps them know what their customers want to see on the shelves.\n\n\u201cOne of our signature items that people told us they wanted and we developed is sweet potato products, and they have been wildly successful at the riverfront,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re available at all locations, but then again you tailor how much you have and when you have what people want.\n\n\u201cThat enables you to operate efficiently and sustainably.\u201d\n\nAs it becomes more difficult for some Delawareans to access grocery stores, alternatives are springing up to give people an ability to purchase healthy foods.\n\nThese alternatives include farmers markets, community gardens and even a new initiative to bring healthy food to the corner store.\n\nBuy Photo Konrad Kmetz, in the Duffy\u2019s Hope garden, is the project leader for Wilmington Healthy Corner Store Network, which encourages shops to offer healthy foods. (Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL)\n\nAccess to a private vehicle plays a large role in determining the ease of obtaining sufficient, healthy and affordable food. Konrad Kmetz, who started a program to bring healthy food to corner stores, said the closing of the two grocery stores leaves an immediate impact in nearby communities, especially people in the Lancaster Apartments that have little or no transportation to get to another grocery store. Access to a private vehicle plays a large role in determining the ease of obtaining sufficient, healthy and affordable food.\n\n\u201cWhere do they go? They\u2019re not going to go to Janssen\u2019s [Market],\u201d said Kmetz, referring to the upscale grocery store about 2.5 miles away in Greenville. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking really,\u201d he said\n\nBecause many of the larger chains are watching their bottom line, Kmetz said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if another store closes.\n\nThat\u2019s where he hopes a project he is leading, the Wilmington Healthy Corner Store Network, can fill the voids.\n\nAfter studying the problem for two years, the DuPont Co. retiree teamed up with the Food Trust of Philadelphia to help educate corner store owners on the importance of selling healthy foods. This would also include training in becoming profitable by selling these foods.\n\nThe program started this year in 12 stores in Wilmington \u2013 where there is greatest need, Kmetz said. He hopes to add eight more stores to the program before the end of the year and double the number of participants by next year.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change it overnight, but if you come around with us to some of the places where the changes are happening, it\u2019s pretty dramatic,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Kmetz said he wasn\u2019t sure what would happen immediately in locations where the stores closed.\n\n\u201cSomething is going to have to replace the loss of these stores,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1UPEZ4C", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sixty-one percent of Delawareans live in Census tracts where there is no grocery store", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "Sixty-one percent of Delawareans live in Census tracts where there is no grocery store", "title": "Delaware\u2019s food deserts grow", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/09/13/delawares-food-deserts-grow/72213132/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sixty-one percent of Delawareans live in Census tracts where there is no grocery store", "title": "Delaware\u2019s food deserts grow", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df98413a770709437c6466f022d986ab80df0232/c=864-0-4320-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/13/Wilmington/B9318695909Z.1_20150913233714_000_GH7BT3KH2.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/EstebanParraIII"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc096\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if another grocery store came in,\u201d said Bill Ganc, owner of Ganc Commercial Realty in Brandywine Hundred.\nTwenty-seven percent of the state\u2019s population live in census tracts, usually consisting of 1,200 to 8,000 people, that only have one grocery store.\nThese alternatives include farmers markets, community gardens and even a new initiative to bring healthy food to the corner store.\nAnd at least one commercial real estate broker doesn\u2019t believe either building will be occupied by another grocery store.\n\u201cAs these Dollar General and Family Dollar [stores] crop up, I think they keep taking a slice out of the grocery stores,\u201d Ganc said."}
