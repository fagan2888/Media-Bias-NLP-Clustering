They attached an oxygen-carrying protein, myoglobin, to the cartilage stem cells to provide oxygen for cells to access when levels get too low in the scaffold.\n\nProfessor Anthony Hollander from the University of Liverpool said the ability to grow larger pieces of cartilage will allow doctors to repair hip and knee injuries injuries that have \"the worst kind of damage,\" and that the new method of growing tissue will pave the way for further advancements.\n\n\"We have already shown that stem cells can help create parts of the body that can be successfully transplanted into patients, but we have now found a way of making their success even better,\" Hollander said. \"Growing large organs remains a huge challenge, but with this technology we have overcome one of the major hurdles.\"\n\nThe study is published in Nature Communications.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers have created a new form of \"scaffolding\" technology that will allow doctors to grow larger pieces of tissue for transplant patients.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Researchers have created a new form of \"scaffolding\" technology that will allow doctors to grow larger pieces of tissue for transplant patients.", "title": "'Scaffold' technology could help scientists grow organs", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/06/17/Scaffold-technology-could-help-scientists-grow-organs/2931434554502/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/2931434554502/2015/1/14345585237307/v2.1/Scaffold-technology-could-help-scientists-grow-organs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2931434554502/2015/i/14345585237307/v2.1/Scaffold-technology-could-help-scientists-grow-organs.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Researchers have created a new form of \"scaffolding\" technology that will allow doctors to grow larger pieces of tissue for transplant patients.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Scaffold' technology could help scientists grow organs"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabb6\"", "article_summary": "They attached an oxygen-carrying protein, myoglobin, to the cartilage stem cells to provide oxygen for cells to access when levels get too low in the scaffold.\nBRISTOL, England, June 17 (UPI) -- Researchers have engineered a type of \"scaffold\" technology that allows them to grow larger pieces of tissue in the lab and may lead to growing entire organs for transplant patients.\nTesting their theory with cartilage tissue, researchers synthesized a new class of artificial membrane-binding proteins that can be attached to stems cells.\n\"Growing large organs remains a huge challenge, but with this technology we have overcome one of the major hurdles.\"\nPreviously, only small pieces of tissue could be grown because of oxygen not reaching cells at the center of the tissue as it grew larger."}
