Now, a judge is demanding extensive changes.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by a non-profit agency which advocates for New Mexico\u2019s poor, HSD is in violation of a 1998 legal agreement.\n\nGail Evans with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty said more than 20,000 people have lost their food stamp benefits in the state since September.\n\n\u201cThis is really just about people not being able to get food and feed their children and that\u2019s how the judge saw it,\u201d said Evans.\n\nThursday, a federal judge ordered HSD to quickly process the massive backlog of applications by New Mexico\u2019s poor seeking benefits such as food stamps.\n\nEvans said she partially blames a flawed computer system the state implemented state-wide this year. \u201cIt\u2019s led to people not being able to submit their applications, but it\u2019s no excuse,\u201d she said, adding the computer system automatically drops applicants off the program in some cases, before they can be processed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly due to the poor implementation of Obamacare at the federal level,\u201d said Matt Kennicott, with the state\u2019s Human Services Department.\n\nKennicott said since the Affordable Care Act, the feds are transferring applications to the state in large batches monthly, instead of sending small batches weekly.\n\n\u201cFor example, last September we received about 19,000 applications for Medicaid, through March, we\u2019ve received over 60,000 applications for Medicaid,\u201d Kennicott explained.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with that, and in other states they\u2019ve been able to roll out the Affordable Care Act and not have it result in tens of thousands of people being thrown off of the food stamps program,\u201d said Evans.\n\nEither way, with hundreds of thousands of people on federally-funded food stamps, Evans said the problem runs deep.\n\nShe said thousands of families have been wrongly denied federal assistance, applications are not being processed in a timely manner and families are going hungry.\n\n\u201cThere definitely are backlogs, we\u2019ve also implemented a number of solutions to make sure we\u2019re dealing with these backlogs,\u201d explained Kennicott.\n\n\u201cIf they need the assistance, we\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re processing the applications to make sure they get the assistance,\u201d said Kennicott. \u201cOur job is to help provide resources for those New Mexicans who are most in need, and we remain committed to doing that.\u201d\n\nHSD said some of the changes it has added include a 24-7 website, a customer service hotline and they\u2019ve hired more staff.\n\nA judge ruled they also must prioritize and expedite certain applications and suspend automatic denials. Kennicott said HSD will follow the judge\u2019s orders and expects to have the backlog of applicants cleared soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"276049\" /] ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) -\u00a0Thousands of New Mexicans have lost out on food stamp benefits because of what a lawsuit claims is a state blunder.
