The Senate initially voted 25\u201310 to fund Arkansas Works, two votes short of the funding threshold.\n\nLack of funding would have essentially ended the country\u2019s first hybrid Medicaid expansion program, termed the \u201cprivate option,\u201d established in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act. The program uses federal money to purchase private health insurance plans for approximately 268,000 recipients\u2014a combination of newly eligible able-bodied Medicaid enrollees with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level and previously eligible individuals who enrolled after Arkansas expanded Medicaid.\n\nArkansas Works, which includes cost-sharing requirements for program participants with incomes above 100 percent of the federal poverty level, will replace the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, pending approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u2018Work Suggestions\u2019\n\nDan Greenberg, president of the Advance Arkansas Institute, says the requirement for federal approval of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program limits the possibility of true reform.\n\n\u201cGov. [Asa] Hutchinson has proposed Arkansas Works to reform the Medicaid expansion program, but conservatives are skeptical, as work requirements usually get shot down from the feds and become more of work suggestions,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard to get any approval from the feds in the past.\u201d\n\nUnenforceable Copayments\n\nGreenberg says Arkansas Works will do little to enforce copayments or reduce the national debt.\n\n\u201cCopay problems include no penalties if a beneficiary refuses to pay the fees, as care has already been provided, and there are almost no incentives to collect payment,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThe program is being sold as a way to save taxpayers a little bit in the short term as the feds absorb costs. The neediest people are put on the private option, but the debt will just be added on at the federal level.\u201d\n\nThe federal share of Medicaid expansion in Arkansas will cost $9 billion, stated the Stephen Group, the legislature\u2019s research consultant, in an October 2015 report to the Arkansas Health Reform Task Force.\n\nMarcus Rech (mr308512@ohio.edu) writes from Centerville, Ohio.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nMatthew Glans, \u201cArkansas Private Option Should Serve as Warning to Other States,\u201d Research & Commentary, The Heartland Institute, November 11, 2015: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/research-commentary-arkansas-private-option-should-serve-warning-other-states\n\nVolume 1, Findings Report, Stephen Group, October 1, 2015: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/stephen-group-findings-arkansas-health-reform-task-force-volume-1\n\nImage via Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "After initially falling short of the required votes, the Arkansas Senate approved funding for Arkansas Works, which Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) signed into law in 2013 as a hybrid \u201cprivate option\u201d Medicaid expansion program.\nLack of funding would have essentially ended the country\u2019s first hybrid Medicaid expansion program, termed the \u201cprivate option,\u201d established in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u2018Work Suggestions\u2019Dan Greenberg, president of the Advance Arkansas Institute, says the requirement for federal approval of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program limits the possibility of true reform.\nThe Senate initially voted 25\u201310 to fund Arkansas Works, two votes short of the funding threshold.\nArkansas Works, which includes cost-sharing requirements for program participants with incomes above 100 percent of the federal poverty level, will replace the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, pending approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."}
