My partner and I were considering having children, and anyway, I was curious. So I signed up for 23andMe, which offers genetic testing by mail. All I had to do was spit into a vial, and a few weeks later I learned that I am as Ashkenazi Jewish as they come: a 99% purebred.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t learn, because of a recent FDA crackdown on 23andMe, was whether I was a carrier for genetic diseases. Although determining this information is a relatively simple process, the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 heavily lobbied, as always, by the health-care industry \u2014 had decided that determination of this required a special medical license. Not because of the procedure, but, per the FDA, because I was not enough of an adult to learn about my own genetic makeup without the hand-holding of an expert.\n\nSo instead, I ventured into the wilds of the Bronx, where the excellent staff of the Montefiore Medical Center, working as part of Einstein\u2019s Program for Jewish Genetic Health, gave me the test, plus counseling, plus a lot of high-quality attention.\n\nThe Montefiore/Einstein staff was, indeed, professional and capable. But the test did require several hours of travel, and would have cost hundreds of dollars had my insurance not covered it. It was, in my opinion, a needless expenditure of time and resources, given that the same information could be obtained by spit and mail.\n\nThis is life in what libertarians call the \u201cnanny state,\u201d in which American citizens are routinely denied the liberty to make their own decisions about their own lives. And while critics of the nanny state are usually conservative, liberals better wake up if they want to preserve (or pursue) a progressive agenda.\n\nThe trouble with our polarized discourse on government paternalism is that each side gets it half right. Conservatives don\u2019t like any regulation at all, and liberals want to regulate everything. The result is often a \u201csplit the baby\u201d solution somewhere in the middle, negotiated by lobbyists and legislatures.\n\nBut half right is all wrong. Some things should be heavily regulated: guns, consumer products, pollutants. Other things should not be regulated at all: drugs that do not harm others, residential rent for those above the poverty line, renting out your apartment on Airbnb. The answer isn\u2019t \u201csome regulation for everything,\u201d but a clearer understanding of when a protector-state is necessary \u2014 and when it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe answer should be simple: When one person can harm another, the state should intervene. That is true for mentally ill 22-year-olds with vendettas against women, and it is true for multinational food manufacturers replacing beef with \u201cpink slime.\u201d Both recent events, if you recall.\n\nBut when there is no harm to another, there should be no foul. Regulation is not simply social engineering; it is, as libertarians endlessly remind us, social engineering with the force of law. Disobey the law, and you go to jail. Law is law because of its power to deprive people of their liberty. And for that reason, it should be used as sparingly as possible.\n\nMoreover, we all know that the deck is stacked. The company Uber, for example, is swiftly revolutionizing the taxi industry by linking people who need rides to people willing to drive them. No more waiting for a taxi that never comes, or a car service that doesn\u2019t answer the phone. No more despair during shift-change hours. Uber is a mechayeh \u2014 sometimes literally, like the time we called one to take my mother home from the hospital.\n\nOf course, the taxi companies don\u2019t like being rendered obsolete, and with the Taxi & Limousine Commission in their pocket, they\u2019ve fought Uber every step of the way. Mayor Bill de Blasio, the supposed outer-borough populist, even announced that he\u2019s scaling back New York City\u2019s \u201cGreen Cab\u201d program meant to provide more taxis outside of Manhattan \u2014 an obvious, cynical and hypocritical sell-out to the taxi drivers and taxi companies.\n\nIn other words, Uber isn\u2019t fighting against regulation per se. It\u2019s fighting against sweetheart insider deals.\n\nSame with 23andMe. The FDA\u2019s enforcement letter against the company warns that false-positive or false-negative results could have disastrous consequences. True. But that could be cured with a simple warning label. This isn\u2019t consumer protection; it\u2019s industry protection.\n\nAnd same with Airbnb. Sure, there are horror stories of apartments being rented out for sex parties, or being substandard housing. But each one of these has been handled by Airbnb (often at significant cost) without the need for government intervention. And there are smoking guns all over the place: The hotel industry has said, flat out, that it\u2019s going to fight Airbnb to the death. Apparently no one should be able to sleep in New York for less than $300 a night.\n\nProgressives ignore such stories at their peril. People are getting fed up with the nanny state, and they\u2019re expressing that frustration at the polls. The trouble is, because they\u2019re voting for anti-government extremists (i.e., the present mainstream of the Republican Party), they threaten to throw out the good with the bad: environmental regulations, the Affordable Care Act, gun control. The Republican mainstream hates all these, and would return us to the days of robber-baron capitalism and the Gilded Age of inequality, only this time with toxic waste and M-16s.\n\nTogether with the surveillance state, which now tracks every click of the mouse, the nanny state is a nightmare that liberals could do something about \u2014 if we\u2019re willing to defy our own orthodoxy. Liberty is not just for libertarians. These encroachments upon our personal autonomy should make all of us mad as hell. And more and more people are not going to take it anymore.\n\nJay Michaelson is a contributing editor to the Forward.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/128x79/uber-articles-061914-1423591629.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Jay Michaelson", "twitter": {"description": "We usually think of opposing big government as a conservative precept.
