Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) together are promoting new legislation to reform the H-1B visa program, after scores of abuses by companies including Disney, Southern California Edison and more.\n\nThe bill, the American Jobs First Act of 2015, is essentially an antidote to the woes of the H-1B program. The bill, which represents a crackdown on immigration program abuses by special interests, has several components.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFirst, it requires companies that use H-1B workers to pay such visa holders \u201ceither what an American worker who did identical or similar work made two years prior to the recruiting effort, or $110,000,\u201d whichever is higher. What that does is it takes the incentive to pay foreigners less than Americans away from corporations, thereby ending the ability for the program to be abused in that regard.\n\nSecond, the bill requires that within 730 days\u2014two years\u2014of \u201can employee strike, an employer lockout, layoffs, furloughs, or other types of involuntary employee terminations other than for-cause dismissals,\u201d a company cannot bring aboard any H-1B labor. That means it wouldn\u2019t be able to replace Americans with foreigners. The bill also has more transparency requirements throughout.\n\nCruz, in an appearance on Breitbart News Daily with Stephen K. Bannon on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on Friday morning, laid out the importance of the bill.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions and I together we launched a major reform bill on the H-1B visa program. As you know, the H-1B visa program was designed to bring in high-skilled workers,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nI have long been a supporter of bringing in high-skilled workers because I think that benefits economic growth. But unfortunately what we\u2019ve seen in recent months is report after report after report of large companies abusing the program and bringing in workers who are not high-skilled, who tend to be mid-level or even low-level IT workers and bringing them and then laying off American workers\u2014and to add insult to injury, forcing the American workers to train their foreign replacements before they leave. That is not only directly contrary to what the program was meant to do, it is an absolute abuse and is unacceptable. And so Jeff Sessions and I together have assembled reform legislation to fix the H-1B program to require among other things that anyone coming in on an H-1B visa have an advanced degree, to require certification from university and academic standards, to prohibit companies if you\u2019re bringing in H-1B visas from laying off workers\u2014you can\u2019t do both\u2014and to ensure that they cannot be paying foreign workers materially less than they are paying U.S. workers. We designed this together really to work in concert with what I have announced which is if I\u2019m elected president I intend to impose a moratorium on the H-1B program and audit every company that has received this visas to determine whether they\u2019re abusing the program. And if they\u2019re abusing the program, they will be suspended from the program\u2014and if they\u2019ve violated the law, they will be prosecuted.\n\nCruz, as he mentioned here in this interview, has rolled out a plan for a moratorium on H-1B visas he\u2019ll implement if elected president. He\u2019s walked through that plan on his website, and in multiple interviews since he introduced it\u2014and it represents one of if not the strongest plans in the entire 2016 GOP field on this issue.\n\nWhat\u2019s most interesting, perhaps, is that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)\u2014Cruz\u2019s 2016 GOP presidential rival\u2014has a diametrically opposite view on H-1B visas. Rubio\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) would have massively increased H-1B visas, as would legislation Rubio is currently pushing in this Congress\u2014the I-Squared bill.\n\nIn fact, the contrast is so clear that even Sessions noted the significant differences between this Cruz-Sessions legislation and the Rubio-backed I-Squared bill that would hurt American workers in his statement accompanying the release of this new legislation.\n\n\u201cThe mass layoff of American workers at Disney, Southern California Edison, and many other companies \u2013 who were then forced to train their foreign replacements \u2013 underscores that our political system has failed in its duty to protect our own people,\u201d Sessions said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sens.
