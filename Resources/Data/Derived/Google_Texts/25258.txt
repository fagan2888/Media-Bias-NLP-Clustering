It's a cold and cloudy morning with much of the state starting the day off in the 30s and 40s.

Winds are light and Northerly until a second cold front pushes into the region. Then the North winds pick up 15-25 mph.

The afternoon high will only make it up to 47 degrees. So take a coat with you. Later today we will have a chance for light rain, and NW Oklahoma could see some light snow.

Overnight, rain and snow chances increase to 40 percent but it will be light.

Looking ahead to Christmas day, it still looks mild and dry.
