A group of Maury County youth and junior youth came together at the Maury County Animal Shelter on May 3 to offer an afternoon of service to the four-legged inhabitants. Dogs were walked, played with and petted and cats were loved, cuddled and taken to the special play room.

This is the first service project that this junior youth group has undertaken. Its goal is to empower youth to make a difference in Maury County and contribute to the betterment of the community. After the service project, hot dogs and s’mores were cooked over a firepit, while the youth discussed the day. They noticed that the animals didn’t avoid each other because of color, size or breed.

Some talked about being victims of prejudice and how hurtful it is. They noticed the unconditional love that the animals will offer to any visitor and concluded that people have a lot to learn from their friends in the animal kingdom. The youth consulted on future service projects.

They will help organize a Unity Picnic from 1-6 p.m. June 8 at the Eastern Redbud Shelter at Evans Park. The public is invited. If you are interested in your youth (10-18-year-olds) being a part of this group, please contact Honna St. John at honna77@yahoo.com.
