She could also face as much as $2,000 in potential out-of-pocket costs for hospital care and prescription drugs, if she needs those things.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having [a policy] if I can\u2019t afford to use it?\u201d asks the 47-year-old librarian in upstate Franklinville, New York, referring to the co-pays and deductibles that she might incur if she sought treatment.\n\nHow consumers judge the affordability of the new health plans remains one of the biggest unknowns on the eve of the rollout of the health law\u2019s insurance marketplaces. Those marketplaces, aimed at people without group coverage, are predicted to sign up 7 million enrollees by the end of next March. Will shoppers regard the plans as a good value? Will they be able to afford the monthly premiums and other out-of-pocket costs built into most plans?\n\nThe answers are likely to depend on factors such as their age, income, health issues -- and perhaps most important, whether they qualify for free or low-cost care through a government program, or for a substantial subsidy to buy private coverage.\n\nSome may also weigh whether it is simply cheaper to pay the penalty for not having insurance, which is $95 or 1 percent of household income, whichever is greater, rather than buying coverage.\n\n\u2018Not Much Left Over for Extras\u2019\n\nExperts say that moderate-income Americans like La Voie, who will be eligible for subsidized coverage but who must still pay between 6 to 9.5 percent of their income toward monthly premiums, are likely to have the hardest time affording the policies.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Some Say Obamacare\u2019s  \u2018Affordable\u2019 Coverage Isn\u2019t Affordable For Them", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Some Say Obamacare\u2019s \u2018Affordable\u2019 Coverage Isn\u2019t Affordable For Them", "title": "For Some, Affordable Care Act Costs Still Out of Reach", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20130924/some-say-obamacares--affordable-coverage-isnt-affordable-for-them", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "Some Say Obamacare\u2019s  \u2018Affordable\u2019 Coverage Isn\u2019t Affordable For Them", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "She could also face as much as $2,000 in potential out-of-pocket costs for hospital care and prescription drugs, if she needs those things.\nWill they be able to afford the monthly premiums and other out-of-pocket costs built into most plans?\nHow consumers judge the affordability of the new health plans remains one of the biggest unknowns on the eve of the rollout of the health law\u2019s insurance marketplaces.\nThose marketplaces, aimed at people without group coverage, are predicted to sign up 7 million enrollees by the end of next March.\nMichelle La Voie wants health insurance, but as a single mom making $38,000 a year and supporting two teenagers, she's not sure she can afford it -- even with a subsidy through the federal health law known as Obamacare."}
