Speaking to the Commonwealth Club of California while promoting Texas business in the Golden State, Gov. Rick Perry answered a question about whether homosexuality is a disorder by comparing being gay to being an alcoholic.

“Whether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that,” Perry answered, reiterating a longtime favorite argument of the anti-LGBT right that sexual orientation is a choice.

“I may have the genetic coding that I’m inclined to be an alcoholic,” Perry went on to say, “but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.”

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Perry was also asked at one point to weigh in on gay “conversion” therapy, a controversial practice that’s already been banned for licensed professionals in New Jersey and California and is being considered by the New York Assembly.
