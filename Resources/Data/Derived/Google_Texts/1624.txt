The movie maker who once released a film trashing America’s health care system has been relying upon it for the past week as he battles pneumonia.

Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose movie “Sicko” attacked America’s health care system, tweeted Thursday that he was ill with pneumonia and in the intensive care unit of a New York City hospital.

“The truth is, I’ve actually been in the ICU since Sunday night. Let’s just say things didn’t look good Sunday night,” he posted on Facebook. “But thanks to a combination of good doctors, decent hospital food and 2nd term Obamacare, I’m doing much better.”

Moore said he was scheduled to be discharged Friday, but it was not clear Saturday whether he had been released. In his postings form the hospital, Moore asked supprters to help promote his new movie because he had to cancel his scheduled appearances.

Moore has said the U.S. health care system is broken.

“We have to work toward Medicare for all, so that everyone’s covered, a single-payer system, all these things,” he has said. “In the end, we can’t allow private insurance — people making a profit off of people getting sick. Private insurance is not the way to go.”

In light of those comments, there was no information released on how Moore paid for his treatment.

Moore’s newest film Where to Invade Next, is scheduled to be released Friday. The film consists of Moore visiting other nations to learn how the U.S. could improve itself, according to the movie’s website.
