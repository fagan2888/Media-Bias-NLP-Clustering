NewsAbortion, Politics - U.S.

The House of Representatives will not vote on a bill that would restrict abortion to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy during the next month, according to a memo released by the leadership today.

Hundreds of thousands of pro-life marchers were stunned to learn that the bill had been pulled on the day of the annual March for Life after back-room objections from a handful of legislators led by Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-NC. House leaders instead voted on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act – but reassured pro-life leaders the ban on abortions due to fetal pain will come to the floor for a vote this year.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, just released the communique with the House leadership's agenda for the month of February. Voting on the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not listed on it.

Major national pro-life organizations consistently rank the bill, introduced by Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona, as their top legislative goal.

Instead, the memo begins by congratulating members for passing 27 bills so far, including a measure “prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortions.”

McCarthy lays out each week's priority and messaging opportunity during the shortest month of the year.

Congress will instead vote on repealing ObamaCare and halting the controversial educational curriculum Common Core.

“We will stop the President from coercing states to adopt Common Core standards and we will consider proposals to replicate high-performing charter schools,” McCarthy wrote.

Members also pledge to vote against any plan to tax 529 educational savings plans, reinforce tax benefits for small businesses, and discuss “the best way to continue to challenge the President’s unconstitutional amnesty.”
