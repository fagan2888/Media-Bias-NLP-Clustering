Namotka of North Carolina include attempted murder and threatening to commit murder.\n\n. (Photo: ~File) Story Highlights Jessica Namotka of Allentown, Pennsylvania, told police her cousin took her against her will.\n\nJessica jumped from her Jeep, which her cousin was driving on Route 1.\n\nA chase by police ensued and Jesse Namotka was arrested.\n\nTwo handguns were discovered in the Jeep.\n\nEDISON - Multiple criminal charges have been filed against a North Carolina man in connection with an alleged attempt to kidnap his cousin and a police chase during which he tried to fire a handgun at pursuing patrol cars but ended up shooting his own backseat, according to a statement from police.\n\nJesse D. Namotka, 20, of Sylva, North Carolina, has been charged with attempted murder; threatening to commit murder, carjacking, criminal restraint, four firearms possession charges, theft, possession and intent to distribute heroin and cocaine, leaving an accident scene and eluding police, the statement said.\n\nAt 12:45 p.m. Saturday, Namotka's cousin, Jessica Namotka, 37, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, leaped from the passenger-side door of a gray Jeep Cherokee while the vehicle slowed in traffic on Route 1 near Wooding Avenue.\n\nJessica Namotka later told police she was trying to flee from Namotka after he allegedly commandeered her Jeep and took her with him against her will.\n\nStartled by her sudden escape, police said, Jesse Namotka collided with another vehicle that was stopped in Route 1 traffic and then sped away from the accident scene.\n\nMoments later, Officer Nicholas Bayne saw the damaged Jeep \u2014 with a flat rear tire \u2014 heading north on Route 1 and tried to stop it, touching off a chase that ended when Jesse Namotka lost control of the Jeep along Amboy Avenue near Franklin Avenue.\n\nOnce the Jeep stopped, Jesse Namotka surrendered to Officers Nicholas Bayne and Brian Castles, and several other patrolmen who had joined the pursuit. During the arrest, police said, they found a dozen packets of heroin, small bags of rock cocaine and a packet of cocaine powder in his trouser pockets, police said.\n\nMeanwhile, Officer Erwin Enriquez found two handguns \u2014 a revolver and a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun \u2014 inside the damaged Jeep.\n\nOfficers also found several bullet holes and slugs from the revolver in the vehicle's backseat indicating that Jesse Namotka apparently tried to shoot \u2014 without success \u2014 at pursuing patrol cars during the chase, police said.\n\nIn addition to Edison's charges, police said, Jesse Namotka was wanted for a parole violation in connection with a robbery in another jurisdiction. Other charges may be filed against him pending the outcome of Edison's investigation into Saturday's incident.\n\nHis cousin, Jessica, was treated at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick for minor injuries suffered when she jumped from the Jeep and fell onto the pavement along Route 1, police said.\n\nJesse Namotka is being held at the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick on $250,000 bail.\n\nStaff Writer Susan Loyer: 732-565-7243; sloyer@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1jgU579", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Jesse Namotka of North Carolina is facing criminal charges that stem from an alleged attempt to kidnap his cousin and a police chase.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Jesse Namotka of North Carolina is facing criminal charges that stem from an alleged attempt to kidnap his cousin and a police chase.", "title": "Alleged kidnapping leads to multiple charges in Edison", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/11/23/jesse-d-namotka-20-sylva-north-carolina-has-been-charged-attempted-murder-threatening-commit-murder-carjacking-criminal-restraint-four-firearms-possession-charges-theft-possession-and-intent-distribute-heroin-and-cocaine-leaving-accident-scene-and-eluding/76275912/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jesse Namotka of North Carolina is facing criminal charges that stem from an alleged attempt to kidnap his cousin and a police chase.", "title": "Alleged kidnapping leads to multiple charges in Edison", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/392c835fafebd397c9b32ff0c3ef5e1c07efe213/c=9-0-141-132&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/23/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635838936326599155-handcuff-2.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Jesse Namotka, Edison Police, arrest, attempted murder, carjacking"}, "article_summary": "In addition to Edison's charges, police said, Jesse Namotka was wanted for a parole violation in connection with a robbery in another jurisdiction.\nThe charges against Jesse D.
