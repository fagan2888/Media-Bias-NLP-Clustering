To address expenses, Americans are reaching out, usually online, for small contributions from friends, friends of friends and strangers touched by a chance to help.\n\nBut even the most successful fundraising campaign is a short-term fix. What\u2019s sorely needed is a sturdy social safety net \u2013 one that should be provided by policymakers, not sick people and generous private donors.\n\nAs the popularity of medical crowdfunding has grown, so has the burden of expenses not covered by health insurance. The average cancer patient, for example, faces up to $8,500 a year in costs that insurance won\u2019t pay for.

Another site, GoFundMe, has found that \u201cMedical, Illness & Healing\u201d projects attract more donations than any others; the number of projects in that category soared from 8,000 in 2011 to 600,000 in 2014.\n\nAnd as medical crowdfunding has grown, so has the burden of out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as co-pays and deductibles \u2013 a problem even for those with top-flight insurance, like Sheila Kennett of Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nThough her family was covered by a federal employee policy through her U.S. Senate job, they still needed to turn to GiveForward to defray the steep costs for her husband\u2019s cancer treatment, including thousands of dollars for deductibles and co-pays and about $500 a month for a single medication, they told The Washington Post in 2013. (Researchers have found that the average cancer patient faces up to $8,500 a year in expenses that insurance doesn\u2019t cover.)\n\nCloser to home, Meghan Morgan \u2013 a single mom from Falmouth who\u2019s taking time off work to care for her seriously ill son \u2013 has also benefited from crowdfunding. A GoFundMe campaign set up by Morgan\u2019s friends and family has raised more than $40,000, which is over twice the original goal, MPBN recently reported.\n\nThe boom in medical crowdfunding, however, points to major weaknesses in our safety net. Many other industrialized countries, for example, offer paid family and medical leave, as well as single-payer health insurance. The former allows people to look after their loved ones without worrying about their lost income. The latter allows people to get significant health care needs addressed without turning to charity to pay their bills.\n\nAnd although the Kennett and Morgan families\u2019 stories are stirring ones, sick people and their loved ones shouldn\u2019t have to go online to get extra financial support. It\u2019s a lot of work. To stand out among others on the medical crowdfunding sites, families have to present appealing photos and personalized stories and leverage social media \u2013 all at an already-stressful time.\n\nPolicymakers have a duty to ensure that the people they serve have access to affordable care, instead of delegating that task to the market. Charitable giving, whether via a crowdfunding site or in other forms, is laudable \u2013 but it won\u2019t ensure the systematic change that\u2019s really needed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Policymakers should create systemic change to help prevent sick people and their families from turning to fundraising.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Policymakers should create systemic change to help prevent sick people and their families from turning to fundraising.", "title": "Our View: Social safety net needed to cover large medical bills - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/659373_shutterstock_88602571.jpg", "height": 669}, "updated_time": "2015-10-06T15:26:48-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/17/our-view-social-safety-net-needed-to-cover-large-medical-bills/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Policymakers should create systemic change to help prevent sick people and their families from turning to fundraising.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/659373_shutterstock_88602571.jpg", "title": "Our View: Social safety net needed to cover large medical bills - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Editorials", "tag": "Our View", "published_time": "2015-06-17T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T15:26:48-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb426\"", "article_summary": "The boom in medical crowdfunding, however, points to major weaknesses in our safety net.\nTo address expenses, Americans are reaching out, usually online, for small contributions from friends, friends of friends and strangers touched by a chance to help.\nThe latter allows people to get significant health care needs addressed without turning to charity to pay their bills.\nAs the popularity of medical crowdfunding has grown, so has the burden of expenses not covered by health insurance.\nTo stand out among others on the medical crowdfunding sites, families have to present appealing photos and personalized stories and leverage social media \u2013 all at an already-stressful time."}
