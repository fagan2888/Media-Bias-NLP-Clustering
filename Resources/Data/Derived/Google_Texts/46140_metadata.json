There should be \u201cno taxpayer funding for abortion.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Pro-lifers blast Kay Hagan in TV attack\n\nThe lunch-hour protest, held outside the Planned Parenthood offices on 16th Street Northwest, drew one male heckler: \u201cThis is a ridiculous protest against a totally legal procedure,\u201d said a young man who stopped near Ms. Rose as she was speaking. \u201cStop messing with women\u2019s lives,\u201d he said before walking off.\n\nA requested comment from Planned Parenthood was not immediately available. However, Planned Parenthood Action Fund cites research showing that \u201cpublicly supported family planning programs\u201d has saved the nation $13.6 billion \u2014 and for every taxpayer dollar spent on its disease testing, pregnancy prevention and vaccine programs, the country reaps $7.09.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s political action arm and its pro-choice allies are also fighting hard to keep the Senate in Democrat hands: They specifically urge voters, and women in particular, to oppose the \u201cextreme six\u201d Republican candidates in Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire and North Carolina.\n\nOther speakers at the Tuesday pro-life protest included Alison Howard of Concerned Women for America, Joshua Duggar of the Family Research Council, Missy Martinez of Students for Life, Ryan Bomberger of the Radiance Foundation and pro-life activist Jill Stanek.\n\nMany of them decried the Sept. 16 report from the Government Accountability Office, which found that more than 1,000 health plans offered in 28 states under the Affordable Care Act included coverage of elective abortions. In at least five states, all health plans included such coverage.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it would seek to ensure that states and insurers comply with the new health care law, which says consumers who don\u2019t want to be associated with abortion must have at least two health insurance plan options.\n\nThe GAO\u2019s findings are important: Pro-life Democrats almost sunk the law during the 2009 and 2010 debates when they refused to vote for a bill that permitted taxpayer subsidies for elective abortions.\n\nPresident Obama promised \u2014 and did issue \u2014 an executive order that, like the Hyde amendment, prohibits federal funding for abortion in the new health insurance exchanges. \u201cUnder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, Rep. Christopher H. Smith, New Jersey Republican and lead sponsor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, responded to the new GAO report, saying it revealed \u201cmassive new public funding of abortion in the president\u2019s health care law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgree or disagree with public funding of abortion \u2014 a significant majority of Americans oppose it \u2014 but no one likes to be misled or deceived,\u201d Mr. Smith said of the GAO report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With three weeks to go before the midterm elections, representatives of pro-life groups gathered outside a Planned Parenthood office to denounce the abortion-providing giant and urge people to vote \"for life.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With three weeks to go before the midterm elections, representatives of pro-life groups gathered outside a Planned Parenthood office to denounce the abortion-providing giant and urge people to vote \u201cfor life.\u201d", "title": "Pro-life groups protest government funded abortions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/14/pro-life-groups-protest-government-funded-abortion/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/14/protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/14/protest.jpg", "description": "With three weeks to go before the midterm elections, representatives of pro-life groups gathered outside a Planned Parenthood office to denounce the abortion-providing giant and urge people to vote \"f", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Pro-life groups protest government funded abortions"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Senate, Mary Drury, Lila Rose"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfd5\"", "article_summary": "A requested comment from Planned Parenthood was not immediately available.\nPresident Obama promised \u2014 and did issue \u2014 an executive order that, like the Hyde amendment, prohibits federal funding for abortion in the new health insurance exchanges.\n\u201cUnder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Affordable Care Act.\nAlso, a recent government-watchdog report found that hundreds of health insurance plans under Obamacare offer coverage of elective abortions, despite Democratic assurances during the Affordable Care Act debates that it didn\u2019t do that, she said.\nThe GAO\u2019s findings are important: Pro-life Democrats almost sunk the law during the 2009 and 2010 debates when they refused to vote for a bill that permitted taxpayer subsidies for elective abortions."}
