The. Beard. Somehow, James Harden has flown under the radar \u2014 as much as a superstar can, anyway \u2014 early this season. But his play over the last week has not escaped our notice, and he\u2019s this week\u2019s Denver Post player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games, all wins for the Rockets, Harden was as efficient and effective as you\u2019ll see. He averaged 31.0 points on just 14.0 shots per game. Harden knocked down 61.9 percent of those attempts and shot 60 percent from 3-point range. He was a plus-14 for the evaluation period of Nov. 29-Dec. 5 and added 5.7 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 2.3 steals per night.\n\nBackground: While the bulk of the attention in the early season has been paid to Cleveland, Golden State and Memphis, Houston has quietly rolled along. Harden has been terrific on offense, as he normally is, carving up defenses and making a steady march to the free-throw line. He averaged an incredible 11.7 free-throw attempts per game in the evaluation period.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Harden takes hits for his lack of defense \u2014 he has even taken a humorous shot at himself in a recent commercial for his shortcomings on that end of the court. But there isn\u2019t a team in the league that wouldn\u2019t take him. His ability to get to the rim and get fouled might be the best in the NBA. Harden scores from the 3-point line to the paint, puts immense pressure on opposing defenses and will be the reason for any big-time success the Rockets experience this season.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "James Harden,NBA,spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Fear.
