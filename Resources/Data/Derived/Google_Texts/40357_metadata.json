The first article looked at the science and policy on this topic and highlights a few women\u2019s stories.\n\nToday\u2019s article is about my sister, Cindy Wachenheim, who took her own life in March of 2013 after struggling for six months with postpartum mood disorders. I say mood disorders because it was not just depression (and the fact that there are other postpartum mood disorders in addition to postpartum depression was something about which I was previously completely unaware). She had extreme anxiety about, and obsession with, her baby\u2019s health and she was depressed because she believed she caused him to have serious health problems. Also, according to what I have been told by experts, she may have been psychotic: she was so convinced that something was seriously wrong with her baby \u2014 despite doctors telling her otherwise \u2014 that she strapped him to her chest when she jumped out of her apartment window, believing, I can only assume, that this was what was best for him. Thank goodness, he survived and is thriving.\n\nBeyond what is written in the article, I think it is important to give more detail and information on some resources and policy activities in Massachusetts, in the hope that this could possibly help others who are facing similar struggles. As is mentioned in the article, I reached out to Cindy\u2019s son\u2019s pediatrician after Cindy had gone to see her multiple times about her concerns.\n\nPediatricians are key to screening for postpartum mood disorders and making referrals for needed treatment. Most women see their OB a few weeks after giving birth and if everything seems okay at that point then they are sent on their way until the following year\u2019s annual exam.\n\nHowever, woman bring their infants to see the pediatrician many times over that first year. It is pediatricians who could notice if something seems to not be right with the mother. There are efforts to have pediatricians more involved in regular screening and referral. I want to mention in particular the MCPAP for Moms program in Massachusetts. This is a terrific resource for pediatricians who need information about referrals and ways to assist moms who they believe are struggling. Also, the state Department of Public Health is currently accepting testimony on its draft regulations to implement a law on health care provider reporting on screening for postpartum depression. You can read the draft regulations and learn how to submit comments on the DPH website.\n\nThere are so many more aspects of Cindy\u2019s story that I could talk about \u2014 the isolation that must have impacted her mental health (both with no family living nearby and, eventually, the isolation that came with her deep depression); the dangers of falling into the \u201cblack hole\u201d of Internet \u201chealth\u201d research; the difficulty of trying to find a mental health care provider who is the \u201cright fit\u201d when you are in the midst of a mental health crisis; the societal belief that women should be naturally wonderful mothers and should be supermoms who can handle everything. And, with that, there\u2019s the shame and guilt that comes when you realize you can\u2019t handle everything the way you thought you should.\n\nMy family and I will always have a deep hole in our hearts because of the loss of Cindy. In her memory and honor, we are speaking up and telling my sister\u2019s story so we can raise awareness, reduce stigma and help others who are struggling with postpartum mood disorders or who have a loved one who is struggling.\n\nDeb Wachenheim is the Health Quality Manager for the Boston-based consumer advocacy group Health Care For All.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My family and I hope that by telling my sister's story we can raise awareness, reduce stigma and help others who are struggling with postpartum mood disorders or who have a loved one who is struggling.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "My family and I hope that by telling my sister's story we can raise awareness, reduce stigma and help others who are struggling with postpartum mood disorders or who have a loved one who is struggling.", "title": "Falling Into The Postpartum Mood Disorder Abyss: A Personal Story", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/06/postpartum-mood-disorder-abyss", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-1.20.04-PM-620x394.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/06/postpartum-mood-disorder-abyss", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-1.20.04-PM-620x394.png", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Falling Into The Postpartum Mood Disorder Abyss: A Personal Story"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-17", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 13:27:06 -0400"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc706\"", "article_summary": "Falling Into The Postpartum Mood Disorder Abyss: A Personal StoryBy Deb WachenheimGuest ContributorOver the past two days, The New York Times published a series of articles about postpartum depression and other related mood disorders.\nI say mood disorders because it was not just depression (and the fact that there are other postpartum mood disorders in addition to postpartum depression was something about which I was previously completely unaware).\nPediatricians are key to screening for postpartum mood disorders and making referrals for needed treatment.\nToday\u2019s article is about my sister, Cindy Wachenheim, who took her own life in March of 2013 after struggling for six months with postpartum mood disorders.\nIn her memory and honor, we are speaking up and telling my sister\u2019s story so we can raise awareness, reduce stigma and help others who are struggling with postpartum mood disorders or who have a loved one who is struggling."}
