The AFP officials called to duty for these discussions included AFP's president Tim Phillips, chief operating officer Luke Hilgemann, vice president for state operations Teresa Oelke, and vice president for development Chris Fink (Richard Fink's son).\"\n\nThe common thread between Story A and Story B? Paranoid yet shoddily protected secrecy. \"Chimera Incorporated\" was a red flag to interested journalists\u2014hey, guys, there's some money behind this thing. The master document listing important meanings with possible donors is the sort of thing that should have been shared on Dropbox, not printed out. (Not that I want organizations to stop printing out useful documents then leaving them in hotels! Please keep doing that.)\n\nBut why were they secret? That's obvious\u2014too much heat on the Kochs. Moody and I both remember a time when the Kochs could make it rain on libertarian institutions and the media didn't care. (He worked at the Cato Institute, I worked at Reason.) Now, being \"Koch-connected\" is a recipe for being denounced by Democrats. Wealthy Republican donors fear, more than ever, being targeted by the IRS.\n\nThat's how you get something like the secrecy of the Kochs courting Robert Rowling, co-founder of TRT Holdings (which owns Gold's Gym), even though Rowling \"directed $3.5 million to American Crossroads, the super-PAC spearheaded by Karl Rove, and he cut a $100,000 check to the pro-Romney super-PAC Restore Our Future.\" We can safely assume that he's going to give to more Republicans. Right? \"Papa\" John Schnatter was at Palm Springs, probably because the Kochs noticed him donating to Mitt Romney and criticizing Obamacare. (Romney's appearance at fundraiser hosted by Schnatter gave us one of 2012's less remembered yuk-yuks: \"Don\u2019t you love this country? What a home this is, what grounds these are, the pool, the golf course. Republicans come here and say everyone should live like this.\")\n\nThe Koch network is massive\u2014we knew that\u2014but it's also becoming an unalloyed good for Republicans. Americans for Prosperity has spent $23 million this cycle on TV ads attacking Democrats in swing states, on Obamacare. This week it annouced that it would join the Club for Growth on the air in Arkansas, to soften up Sen. Mark Pryor.\n\nOver the weekend, Nick Confessore ran a long, A1 New York Times story about how \"GOP rebels\" were outpacing the more traditionally connected groups. Karl Rove's American Crossroads had suffered massively from its 2012 losses, and its promised plan to defeat unelectable candidates in primaries raised basically no money. How Confessore put it:\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Republican leaders counted on Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, the nonprofit arm of Mr. Rove\u2019s group, to soften up Democratic candidates by financing issue ads in the early campaign season. Now that job is falling largely to Americans for Prosperity, which has been critical of Republican leaders\u2019 strategy on issues like the debt ceiling.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "The Wonderful World of Koch, and the Good It Does for Republicans", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Within a couple hours of each other, Chris Moody, Andy Kroll, and Daniel Schulman published a trove of new info about the Koch donor network.
