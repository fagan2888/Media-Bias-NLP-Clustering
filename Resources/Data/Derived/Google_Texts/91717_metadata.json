Video: Andre Mauger\n\nANDREW RULE: THE LAST GERMAN WAR SECRET\n\n\"Despite that, Grunenthal still will not pay a cent to its Australian and New Zealand victims.\n\n\"Fifty years on, Grunenthal will still not 'fess up to its shameful behaviour in relation to that drug.\"\n\nLawyer Peter Gordon said the amount reached in the settlement was adequate without Grunenthal being included.\n\n\"The result we have achieved today is a vindication of their courage and it is a vindication of the proposition that right around the world there are people like them who have missed out and whose time has come,\" he said.\n\nIN PICTURES: LIFE WITH THALIDOMIDE\n\nMr Magazanik said in some ways he regretted that the settlement meant they could take no further action against Grunenthal in this country but voiced hopes it will pay its dues elsewhere in the world.\n\n\"We think time is running out on Grunenthal and before too long its sorry secrets and its embarrassing and shameful conduct in relation to the drug will be exposed,\" he said.\n\nThe settlement comes after Diageo last year reached a multi-million dollar settlement with prominent thalidomide victim Lynette Rowe.\n\nSAVING LYNETTE- THE ULTIMATE LOVE STORY\n\nMs Rowe, who was born with no limbs, was in court for Monday's announcement.\n\nThalidomide, a drug to counter morning sickness, was withdrawn from sale in 1961.\n\nThe drug was distributed in Australia and New Zealand around 1960 and 1961 by Distillers, which became part of Diageo in 1997.\n\nGrunenthal apologised for thalidomide for the first time in August last year.\n\nThe settlement is subject to final court approval in February, with victims likely to receive payments as early as March.\n\nROWE'S PARENTS HIT OUT AT DRUG COMPANY'S APOLOGY\n\nMeanwhile Mr Gordon said he had put retirement on hold to spend five years helping Australia's thalidomide victims get justice.\n\nAfter leaving law firm Slater and Gordon in August 2009 he gave pro-bono help to Ken Youdale, a World War II veteran from Sydney whose daughter was a thalidomider.\n\nThrough that he met a man with two arms and one deformed leg, plus evidence his pregnant mother had taken the non-prescription morning sickness drug.\n\nBut \"experts\" said he was not a thalidomide victim because he still had one good leg.\n\n\"It was crazy, it was nonsense,\" Mr Gordon told reporters today.\n\nInvestigating further with his son Patrick, a recent law graduate, he realised the scale of the injustice.\n\nSo he set up a new law firm, Gordon Legal, to work solely for thalidomide victims in fighting a \"tremendous injustice\".\n\nThis was no straightforward case, he explained.\n\n\"It was 50 years, a lot of the evidence was gone, a lot of the people we wanted to help had trust issues, not just with us but with mums and dads who had never been able to talk about the whole thing.\n\n\"Most of the records about what Grunenthal had done had, following a (failed) criminal trial in Germany, been stored away in the Dusseldorf archive.\n\n\"They had never been translated.\"\n\nBut the documents were copied into English for the first time and more and more Australian and New Zealand victims were traced.\n\nMore than 100 were eventually involved in the class action, which has reached a settlement with the drug's distributor Diageo.\n\nMr Gordon said he would now take a break but would like to use the translated documents to help other English-speaking litigants.\n\n\"I think we would like to be a resource for other firms around the world.\"\n\nLYNETTE'S HOUSE -
