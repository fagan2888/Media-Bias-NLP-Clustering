LAS VEGAS (AP) — A wax figure of rapper Nicki Minaj at a Las Vegas museum is getting more security to keep away inappropriate visitors.

Madame Tussauds Las Vegas said in a statement Friday that employees will closely monitor the figure after images of visitors in sexual poses with the statue began appearing on social media.

The set around the statue will also undergo a redesign so similar pictures can’t be taken.

The museum says it became aware Tuesday of at least one image online.

The statue depicts Minaj in a pose from her “Anaconda” music video.

The Madame Tussauds museum chain is known for life-size wax replicas of celebrities that guests can interact with.

Minaj has not commented, but she recently shared Instagram photos of fans posing suggestively with the figure.
