She says most of her neighborhood was out setting off fireworks in the street.\n\nWhile Vera was walking from her car to her friend's house, she says one of those large, mortar-style fireworks tipped over and, instead of firing into the sky, shot right at her.\n\nVera says she has a blanket draped over her shoulders that she had taken with her to the fireworks in Memorial Park. When the illegal firework flew toward her, she pulled the blanket over head while she ran for cover.\n\nA piece of the firework melted through two layer of the blanket and burned her hair and scalp underneath.\n\nVera's sister immediately drove her to the hospital where she was treated for minor burns. Doctors told her that if she didn't have the blanket, she likely would have suffered chemical burns to her scalp and face.\n\nVera says that she did not call law enforcement, and it not seeking justice for her injuries. She just wants to make sure that people are more careful so that this doesn't happen to someone else in the future.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Widefield woman was struck by an illegal firework while walking through her neighborhood Saturday night.", "language": "english", "author": "Dustin Cuzick", "og": {"description": "A Widefield woman was struck by an illegal firework while walking through her neighborhood Saturday night.", "title": "Woman Burned By Neighbors' Illegal Firework", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Woman-Burned-By-Neighbors-Illegal-Firework-311707241.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3ED/2B8/3ED2B8C5C5D446C5ADEC6A05769E96DC", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/2A4/250/2A42507B68D54BBEB57B90A5482411DE.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "A Widefield woman was struck by an illegal firework while walking through her neighborhood Saturday night.", "title": "Woman Burned By Neighbors' Illegal Firework", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Woman-Burned-By-Neighbors-Illegal-Firework-311707241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/firework+burn.JPG", "creator": "@kktv11news", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Woman Burned By Neighbors' Illegal Firework", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Woman Burned By Neighbors Illegal"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ce9\"", "article_summary": "A Widefield woman was struck by an illegal firework while walking through her neighborhood Saturday night.\nWhen the illegal firework flew toward her, she pulled the blanket over head while she ran for cover.\nLupita Vera was coming back from the Memorial Park fireworks show Saturday night.\nA piece of the firework melted through two layer of the blanket and burned her hair and scalp underneath.\nVera says she has a blanket draped over her shoulders that she had taken with her to the fireworks in Memorial Park."}
