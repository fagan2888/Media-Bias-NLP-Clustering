The talent in Studio 8H wasted no time in their second episode of the season by opening up with a spot-on impression of the hosts of Fox & Friends.

Actors Taran Killam, Vanessa Bayer, and Bobby Moynihan impersonated Steve Doocy, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Brian Kilmeade respectively in the show’s cold open, skewering the daily cable news morning show. SNL favorite Kate McKinnon played DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the opening sketch as well.

The show is following up on a successful season premiere last week that featured Secretary Hillary Clinton in a walk-on role opposite McKinnon. Saturday night’s episode is hosted by comedian Amy Schumer.
