But the demand has not yet been huge, they said, indicating that many enrollees may be succumbing to inertia, are willing to pay more to their keep their networks and level of coverage, or are unaware that they have a choice. About 120,000 residents of Arizona signed up for exchange plans this year, according to federal data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the confused,\u201d said Kathleen Oestreich, the chief executive of Meritus, a new insurer, which, after dropping its rates by 23 percent on average, is offering many of the lower-priced plans here for 2015. \u201cThat natural inclination to simply not change because it\u2019s too much effort: How will it affect the population of low-income people in particular?\u201d\n\nShanna Goldenberg of Phoenix, who works two jobs and pays $160 a month for her exchange plan, said she had no idea if her premium was going up. But Ms. Goldenberg, 27, said she would probably let her plan be automatically renewed, because the enrollment process last year was so confusing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of girl who just sticks with what\u2019s easy,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nBut in a later note, Ms. Goldenberg said she had discovered her plan would not be offered next year, adding: \u201cI guess now I have to shop around again. ... If only I can figure it out this time.\u201d\n\nMr. Norton, of Scottsdale, Ariz., did call HealthCare.gov on Thursday for a recalculation of his subsidy. It will drop by $30, he learned, and his portion of the premium will grow to $385 from $338.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Oestreich said those who were researching their options seemed fairly savvy about insurance. That is a big change from last year, she said, when many HealthCare.gov customers seemed baffled by the enrollment process and the policies they were buying.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey are calling with specific questions and looking for specific products,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many cases, they\u2019re buying up a little bit \u2014 going to a little bit bigger network because they\u2019ve understood the value of that.\u201d\n\nIn other states, too, enrollment groups said that people shopping around were asking smart questions.\n\nBrenda Cardenas, an enrollment counselor in Phoenix who helped dozens of families sign up for coverage last year, said that only about 15 had sought her help with the renewal process as of last week. Most people are picking new plans, often ones with smaller networks of doctors and hospitals, to avoid paying more, she said. For many, the switch will require finding new doctors, but Ms. Cardenas said nobody had complained so far.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of our consumers, this is the first year they\u2019ve had health coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cFor them, switching to a new provider isn\u2019t a big deal yet.\u201d\n\nIn one case, Ms. Cardenas said, a couple learned the amount of their subsidy would drop by $66 because of the availability of new lower-cost plans that influence the calculation. They decided to switch from a Health Net plan with a large network of providers and no deductible to a Meritus plan with a smaller network and a $1,000 deductible. By doing so, she said, they will spend almost $200 less a month.\n\nHealth Net signed up 65 percent of exchange enrollees here this year, but its rates are rising by an average of 12 percent, a company spokeswoman said. Altogether, 11 insurers are selling on the exchange here for 2015, up from eight.\n\nLeslie McGee, an acupuncturist in Tucson, also found a better deal when she went to HealthCare.gov and updated her personal information. Her income has dropped, so she will qualify for a subsidy in 2015 after receiving none this year. The premium on her current plan is increasing by 17 percent, so she is switching to a different insurer and will save $100 a month.\n\nMs. McGee, 60, will have higher out-of-pocket costs if she goes to the doctor, but she is gambling that she will need only preventive care, which is free.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichelle Steinberg, 54, of Phoenix, is avoiding a 23 percent increase by switching to a less expensive plan that will not cover as much of her medical costs. Her premiums will still increase 13 percent, to $450 a month, but she said she was satisfied with her new choice, which has a lower deductible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not averse to switching companies,\u201d said Ms. Steinberg, who is moving from Health Net to United Healthcare.\n\nThe big question is whether people who have not yet shopped around will flock to the online exchanges by Monday in a last-minute crush \u2014 and whether those who do not will later regret it. They can switch until Feb. 15, when open enrollment ends, but their new coverage will not begin until February or March if they wait past Monday.\n\nIn Maitland, Fla., Rebecca Pando, 60, said that she was happy to do the painstaking research to find a new plan.\n\nHer insurer, Florida Blue, is replacing her plan with one that has a substantially higher deductible: $5,000 compared with $1,300. Ms. Pando found a new plan from United Healthcare that will cost $400 a month in premiums, about $50 less than what she paid this year including her subsidy. It has a $4,000 deductible, she said, but a better choice of doctors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty time-consuming and you get a little crazy,\u201d Ms. Pando said of the shop-and-compare process. \u201cBut it certainly is better than not being able to buy insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141211122946, "twitter": {"description": "Data suggests that a lot of customers are keeping the health plans they purchased through the federal exchange, even though their premiums may rise in 2015.", "creator": "abbygoodnough", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/affordable-care-act-deadline-nears-many-not-seeking-cheaper-health-plan.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003279368"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Many Choose Not to Save in the Health Marketplace", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/12/us/12INSURED1-web/12INSURED1-web-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/affordable-care-act-deadline-nears-many-not-seeking-cheaper-health-plan.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003279368", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/affordable-care-act-deadline-nears-many-not-seeking-cheaper-health-plan.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Many Choose Not to Save in the Health Marketplace", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 11, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/abby_goodnough/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-12-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Arizona", "published": "2014-12-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,HealthCare.gov,Health Net Inc,Arizona", "description": "Data suggests that a lot of customers are keeping the health plans they purchased through the federal exchange, even though their premiums may rise in 2015.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Abby Goodnough", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/12/us/12INSURED1-web/12INSURED1-web-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "12insured", "byl": "By ABBY GOODNOUGH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Data suggests that a lot of customers are keeping the health plans they purchased through the federal exchange, even though their premiums may rise in 2015.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/12/us/12INSURED1-web/12INSURED1-web-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov,Arizona", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Health Net Inc", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Arizona", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141212142125, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/affordable-care-act-deadline-nears-many-not-seeking-cheaper-health-plan.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/12/us/12INSURED1-web/12INSURED1-web-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Data suggests that a lot of customers are keeping the health plans they purchased through the federal exchange, even though their premiums may rise in 2015.", "title": "Many Choose Not to Save in the Health Marketplace"}, "pdate": 20141211, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000003279368, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Many Choose Not to Save in the Health Marketplace", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "About 120,000 residents of Arizona signed up for exchange plans this year, according to federal data.\nThat is a big change from last year, she said, when many HealthCare.gov customers seemed baffled by the enrollment process and the policies they were buying.\nBut Ms. Goldenberg, 27, said she would probably let her plan be automatically renewed, because the enrollment process last year was so confusing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not averse to switching companies,\u201d said Ms. Steinberg, who is moving from Health Net to United Healthcare.\n\u201cFor a lot of our consumers, this is the first year they\u2019ve had health coverage,\u201d she said."}
