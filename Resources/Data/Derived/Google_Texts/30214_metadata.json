(\u201cUCL\u201d) was not preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-305 (Aug. 23, 1994) 108 Stat. 1569) (\u201cFAAAA\u201d). In P. ex rel. Harris v. Pac Anchor Transportation, Inc. (SC S194388 7/28/14), the Court held that California UCL was not preempted where a trucking company\u2019s alleged violations of state labor and insurance laws did not relate to the employer\u2019s \u201cprice, route or service,\u201d the concerns of the federal law.\n\nThe Court noted the FAAAA was passed originally so \u201cStates would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.\u201d Therefore, the FAAAA included a pre-emption provision. The Court, however, rejected the employer\u2019s argument that the FAAAA facially preempted all California UCL claims and, specifically, the case at issue. The Court ruled:\n\nthe FAAAA embodies Congress\u2019s concerns about regulation of motor carriers with respect to the transportation of property; a UCL action that is based on an alleged general violation of labor and employment laws does not implicate those concerns.\n\nThe misclassification of workers can lead to widespread liability in many areas under California and federal law. Employers should consult with counsel when making decisions with respect to independent contractor status.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a case alleging misclassification of an independent contractor in the transportation industry, the California Supreme Court has found that the California unfair competition law was not preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994).
