I don\u2019t think the American people want a court that will mandate unlimited abortion-on-demand, partial birth abortion with taxpayer funding, and no parental notification and I don\u2019t think the American people want a court that will write the Second Amendment out of the Constitution. All of those are 5-4 issues that are hanging in the balance.\"\n\nCruz, who led a 21-hour-long filibuster in 2013 against ObamaCare \u2013 at times reading children's stories to his daughters \u2013 joins most of his fellow Republican presidential hopefuls in saying the Senate must thwart Obama's plan to name a new nominee.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio took a similar line on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d saying, \u201cThe president can nominate whomever he wants, but the Senate's not going to act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're not moving forward on it, period,\u201d Sen. Rubio said.\n\nAt Saturday night's Republican presidential debate, held just hours after Justice Antonin Scalia's death had been announced, Donald Trump said Senate Republicans must use their majority to prevent a vote from taking place until a new president can be sworn in.\n\nJustice Scalia's death is a \u201ctremendous blow to conservatism and frankly to our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell and everybody to stop it. It\u2019s called delay, delay, delay.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Dr. Ben Carson said, \u201cGiven the dire condition our democracy currently finds itself under Obama\u2019s ideological agenda, I call on the Senate to stop any attempts to fill this crucial seat until We The People elect a strong Constitutionalist this November.\u201d\n\nNot everyone on stage agreed. Governors Jeb Bush and John Kasich were less committed.\n\n\"I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIf you were to nominate somebody, let\u2019s have him pick somebody that\u2019s going to have unanimous approval.\u201d\n\nBush also said Obama had the right to nominate someone, but clarified over the weekend that the Senate should not confirm the judge if he or she is \u201cout of the mainstream.\u201d\n\nBush previously encouraged the Senate to confirm Loretta Lynch, who defended the partial birth abortion ban, as U.S. Attorney General.\n\nAny successful appointment would shift the balance of the court, as Obama would replace Justice Scalia, a strict constructionist who believed in interpreting the Constitution according to its original intent, with a judicial activist similar to Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan.\n\nPresident Obama has said, regardless of popular sentiment, he's going to move forward by naming a judicial appointee. \u201cI plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time,\u201d he said this weekend. The Senate, he said, must \u201cfulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton agreed that Republicans dishonor our founding documents by refusing to confirm Obama's chosen Supreme Court justice. \"The Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for Justice Scalia\u2019s seat to remain vacant dishonor our Constitution. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility here that it cannot abdicate for partisan political reasons,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton has talked about naming Barack Obama to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.\n\nWhen asked Sunday if Obama has the better argument, since he won the 2012 election, Cruz responded, \u201cThe people also gave us a Republican Senate this last election, because they were fed up with Barack Obama's lawlessness.\u201d\n\n\"This is a 5-4 court,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next election needs to be a referendum on the court.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "'We're not moving forward on it, period,' Marco Rubio agreed.", "title": "Cruz, Rubio, Trump pledge to block Obama Supreme Court nominees", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/SCdebate.JPG", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/cruz-rubio-trump-pledge-to-block-obama-supreme-court-nominees", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "'We're not moving forward on it, period,' Marco Rubio agreed."}, "description": "'We're not moving forward on it, period,' Marco Rubio agreed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "President Obama has said, regardless of popular sentiment, he's going to move forward by naming a judicial appointee.\nSenator Ted Cruz affirmed that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d filibuster anyone President Obama would try to name to a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court.\nClinton has talked about naming Barack Obama to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the American people want a court that will strip our religious liberties.\n\u201cIf the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election\u201d this November, he told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d program on Sunday."}
