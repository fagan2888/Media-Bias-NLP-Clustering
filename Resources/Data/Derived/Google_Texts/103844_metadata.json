In 2013 the government spent $1.545 billion for administrative costs associated with the exchanges, and expects to spend an additional $1.390 million this year. The agency has requested another $1.788 billion for 2015.\n\nThe law enabled HHS to distribute multiple grants to states to plan and establish exchanges. Initial planning grants were valued at $1 million, though multiple rounds of \u201cexchange establishment grants\u201d cost much more, totaling $4.6 billion.\n\nEvery state and D.C. received planning grants except Alaska, which did not apply.\n\nThe government also provided $249 million for \u201cearly innovator\u201d grants for states creating their own exchanges. The grants were designed to help create the IT infrastructure of their exchanges that would then be used as models for other states.\n\nOregon was one of only eight states deemed an \u201cearly innovator,\u201d and received $59.9 million, the highest amount awarded. The state received $305 million in federal funding overall, for its failed exchange. The state decided to nix Cover Oregon earlier this year, and will join the federal Healthcare.gov exchange.\n\nThe states that received the most federal funding were California ($1.066 billion), New York ($511 million), Oregon ($305 million), Washington ($266 million), Kentucky ($254 million), and Hawaii ($205 million).\n\nA handful of states only received the $1 million for initial planning grants, including: Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Georgia, and South Carolina. All except Montana have Republican governors.\n\nAlaska never accepted any federal funding, and Florida and Louisiana returned all funds they received from the federal government.\n\n\u201cTo date, HHS has awarded a total of more than $4.8 billion to states and D.C. in planning, establishment, and early innovator grants,\u201d the report said. Ultimately only 14 states and D.C. set up their own exchanges, while 36 states joined Healthcare.gov.\n\nThe funding was provided by Section 1311 of the ACA, which \u201cappropriated indefinite (i.e., unspecified) amounts for planning and establishment grants for health insurance exchanges.\u201d\n\nIn addition to establishing the federal marketplace and state exchanges, the government spent roughly $700 million on marketing that went towards creating doge memes, cat GIFs, and cartoon ads to promote enrollment.\n\nEvery exchange is expected to be self-sustaining by next year, and the government is planning to fund the exchanges through user fees paid by insurance companies, which were first collected this year.\n\n\u201cHHS has described how it intends to generate funding for the 36 FFEs it administers,\u201d the report said. \u201cBeginning in 2014, HHS will charge a monthly user fee to all issuers that sell plans through an FFE. The fee for an issuer is equal to the product of the billable members enrolled in the plan through an FFE and a monthly user fee rate. For benefit years 2014 and 2015, the monthly user fee rate is 3.5 percent of the plan\u2019s monthly premium.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s budget for FY 2015 calls for $1.8 billion to operate the health care exchanges, $1.159 billion of which is planned to be paid for through user fees.\n\nHowever, the report noted that CMS is only expected to collect approximately $200 million in user fees this year.\n\n\u201cThe FY2015 budget does not identify any other sources of funding to support exchange operations,\u201d the report said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal government has spent nearly $5 billion to establish federal and state exchanges for Obamacare, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS).
