His opponent, Speaker of the House Beth Harwell, is seeking her 14th term representing District 56, and has been unopposed in three of the last four general elections. Moth says voters should not blithely send her back.\n\nWhy is this rangy software engineer, who projects a calm, analytical and rational approach, taking up the lance and tilting against one of Tennessee's political windmills?\n\n\"Well, it was either run, and try to accomplish something I believe is important, or buy a new car,\" he said. His wry words belied the passion in his eyes and posture.\n\nMoth clearly thinks our legislature needs to think differently, and more rationally, about the challenges we face.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nIn a Tennessee Voices piece, Moth wrote, \"States that have expanded Medicaid reap increased profits and financial stability at their hospitals, their health care employees are more secure, and their working citizens are healthier and more productive at their jobs.\"\n\nThe legislature sent a clear message to Gov. Bill Haslam to reject the Affordable Care Act's provision to expand TennCare to cover an additional 200,000 low-income Tennesseans with Medicaid insurance.\n\n\"It is a complex issue,\" said Harwell, whose district encompasses several hospital companies and who counts many health care executives among her constituents. She defends the legislature's decision as fiscally responsible and is counting on the governor to push through a \"Tennessee Plan\" that addresses covering the insurance gap and emphasizes lowering the cost of medical care.\n\nAmendment 1\n\nMoth also sees the constitutional amendments on the November ballot as a defining difference, saying that he thinks each is likely to pass, which makes the folks who sit in the legislature even more important.\n\n\"We should carefully consider any bills crafted to protect the health of women, but, if elected, I will strongly resist any extreme initiatives to fundamentally block access to abortion.\"\n\nFocus\n\nHarwell is an accomplished politician with 26 years of experience in the General Assembly, and she has benefited from the Republican Party's ascendance. She is the first woman to serve as speaker, and though she won't say it, her supporters are not shy to say that she will be the state's first woman governor.\n\nMoth would like to see Harwell pay more attention to the constituents in District 56 and less attention to her political ambition, which, he thinks, compromises her service to Nashville.\n\nHarwell refutes that position by citing her annual open \"town hall\" meeting with constituents at the Green Hills Public Library, and her standing policy that all constituent calls be returned within 24 hours.\n\nShe did, however, use the demands of her responsibilities as speaker and commitments to work on fellow legislators' campaigns to make scheduling a debate with Moth difficult to arrange.\n\nAn intriguing challenger\n\nWhile I am skeptical of Moth's chances in the race, I can imagine few more interesting challengers to a popular and entrenched legislator.\n\nMoth was born in London, England, where his mother, a Tennessee native, had met his father while working there. The family moved to Memphis when he was a few years old.\n\nHe studied music at the University of Rochester, and played principal horn for Orchestra Kentucky for nine years.\n\nWhile in college, his father, who had a floral shop, asked Moth to write a computer program to help manage his shop. They founded Daisy Systems together and marketed it to other florists. Teleflora bought the company in 1988, and Moth continues to supervise system development. He received a master's in computer science from Vanderbilt University in 1995.\n\nMoth returned to Vanderbilt for a master's in mathematics in 2002, and a doctorate in chemistry in 2008.\n\nWe like to make jokes about our politicians and deride their motives, but we should appreciate the passionate engagement that Moth represents. District 56 voters can't lose when they have these kinds of candidates.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III at 615-881-7039 and on Twitter @fdanielsiii.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1xvUBA7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Beth Harwell is seeking her 14th term; software entrepreneur Chris Moth is challenging her.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Beth Harwell is seeking her 14th term; software entrepreneur Chris Moth is challenging her.", "title": "Moth seeks to dim Harwell's light", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/frank-daniels/2014/10/09/moth-seeks-dim-harwells-light/17007279/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beth Harwell is seeking her 14th term; software entrepreneur Chris Moth is challenging her.", "title": "Moth seeks to dim Harwell's light", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9a16529f119701669b9708211a596ce10bb24e3c/c=0-145-2455-2600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Beth Harwell", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Beth Harwell", "title": "Moth seeks to dim Harwell's light", "author": "Frank Daniels III", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/frank-daniels", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7f10367d1061d3d3d4bc1693e7ddaf424a72508/c=198-0-2257-2745/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/704124909217428230367fd9c88f1d6fece744bb/c=0-145-2455-2600/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/828189111a507cbad99cb6e8f91900aa141055b5/c=0-452-2455-2293/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e8153b74bd04b77b900f77047ad79957fae6a32/c=0-682-2455-2063&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-09T21:30:20.760000-05:00", "shorthed": "Moth seeks to dim Harwell's light", "articleid": 17007279, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7b7464e3eb03adcc11da54e9f1f95fdb5c6d335b/c=0-682-2455-2063/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/507c87fd092fa583e8cd58c3b6b9352769a82d11/c=456-0-2000-2745/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/10/09/frankdanielscrop.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Moth clearly thinks our legislature needs to think differently, and more rationally, about the challenges we face.\n\"It is a complex issue,\" said Harwell, whose district encompasses several hospital companies and who counts many health care executives among her constituents.\nMoth was born in London, England, where his mother, a Tennessee native, had met his father while working there.\nWe like to make jokes about our politicians and deride their motives, but we should appreciate the passionate engagement that Moth represents.\nMoth returned to Vanderbilt for a master's in mathematics in 2002, and a doctorate in chemistry in 2008."}
