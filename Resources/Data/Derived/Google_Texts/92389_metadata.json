But the conversion has hit turbulence amid missed deadlines and rampant budget-cutting in Washington in recent years.\n\nRepublicans have argued that private companies could better handle the technological demands of the air traffic control conversion.\n\nThe aviation industry poll released Thursday found that 67 percent of voters think the FAA does a good job managing the nation's airplane traffic.\n\nThe FAA has said the NextGen system will ease congestion in the airspace around busy U.S. airports by streamlining the arrivals and departures of flights. It also argues that navigating flights more efficiently will have environmental benefits, because airplanes will use less gas and produce less smog.\n\nThe catch is that the NextGen system is expected to cost about $40 billion to complete, and an original 2020 deadline for implementing it nationwide is rapidly approaching.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Republicans have pushed to create a private air traffic control organization separate from the FAA.", "description": "Republicans have pushed to create a private air traffic control organization separate from the FAA.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Republicans have pushed to create a private air traffic control organization separate from the FAA.", "title": "Poll: 55 percent of voters oppose FAA privatization plan", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/253997-poll-55-percent-of-voters-oppose-faa-privatization-plan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/iad_airport_082315gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/253997-poll-55-percent-of-voters-oppose-faa-privatization-plan", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-17T09:43-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Aviation Administration, FAA privatization, Air Traffic Control Organization, ATC, ATC Reform,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-17T09:43:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/253997-poll-55-percent-of-voters-oppose-faa-privatization-plan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Republicans have pushed to create a private air traffic control organization separate from the FAA.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: 55 percent of voters oppose FAA privatization plan"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll: 55 percent of voters oppose FAA privatization plan"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe57b9\"", "article_summary": "'\u201dADVERTISEMENTOnly 29 percent of voters say they approve of the plan, although 51 percent of voters say they support other forms of government privatization, according to the poll.\nRepublicans have argued that private companies could better handle the technological demands of the air traffic control conversion.\nFifty-five percent of voters are opposed to a Republican plan to privatize some facets of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, according to a new poll released on Thursday.\nThe aviation industry poll released Thursday found that 67 percent of voters think the FAA does a good job managing the nation's airplane traffic.\nThe catch is that the NextGen system is expected to cost about $40 billion to complete, and an original 2020 deadline for implementing it nationwide is rapidly approaching."}
