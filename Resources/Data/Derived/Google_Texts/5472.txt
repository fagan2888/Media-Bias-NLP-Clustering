In a jaw-dropping speech delivered at the launch of her charity for animal welfare, Pamela Anderson revealed on Friday that she is a victim of sexual abuse and rape.

The Guardian reports that the former “Baywatch” actress, who held a backgammon competition and fundraising event at the Cannes Film Festival, opened up about the memories to share the reason animals are so important to her. “I feel now might be the time to reveal a few of my most painful memories,” she began her speech. “At the risk of over-exposing myself, again, or being inappropriate, again, I thought I might share with you why I am doing this.”

“I did not have an easy childhood. Despite loving parents, I was molested from age six by a female babysitter,” she revealed.

“I went to a friend’s boyfriend’s house and his older brother decided to teach me backgammon which led into a back massage, which led into rape. My first heterosexual experience,” she said. “He was 25 years old and I was 12.”
