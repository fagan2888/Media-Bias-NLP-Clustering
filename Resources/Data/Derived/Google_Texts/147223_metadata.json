A pre-priced payment system will offer \u201can incentive to focus on the essential elements of care and to avoid unnecessary steps,\u201d the organizations said.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center marks an important step toward expanded bundled care payment models and away from the traditional fee-for-service payments for oncology care,\u201d said Lee Newcomer, MD, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s vice president of oncology, genetics and gynecology. \u201cMD Anderson\u2019s work with value-based workflows makes them a natural partner for bundled payments.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s \u201ctotal care\u201d reimbursement model has been gaining traction since the advent of health reform, now accounting for $36 billion across clinical areas and projected to reach $65 billion by 2018, the company said.\n\nCancer treatment in particular is an area that United believes it needs to ply this model, with cancer therapies accounting for 11 percent of its commercial health plan spending. Nationwide, cancer care is expected to exceed $200 billion by the end of the decade, amid the aging of society, earlier detection and new and expensive drugs.\n\nNewcomer, who practiced oncology in Oklahoma before working in insurance, pointed to United\u2019s previous oncology pilots as proof that the costs of cancer care can be controlled or reduced without adversely affecting quality or access.\n\nIn a three-year bundled payment pilot with five medical oncology practices covering 810 breast, colon and lung cancer patients, medical costs were 34 percent less than projections based on fee-for-service costs.\n\nThe pilot, outlined in the Journal of Oncology Practice, based episode-of-care payments on expected costs for standard six to 12 month treatment regimens as determined by doctors, with chemotherapy medications reimbursed at the average sales price, as a proxy for actual cost.\n\nAt MD Anderson, UnitedHealthcare members with head and neck cancer being treated in the pilot program will have the same care, approach, treatment and diagnostics as would otherwise, the organizations said. What is different is that they will be billed just once, with costs of tests, treatment and other services priced upfront.\n\nWhile head and neck cancers are fairly uncommon, accounting for about 3 percent of cancer cases nationally. United said if the demonstration with MD Anderson is successful, it could apply the similar bundled payment models for more common cancers, like lung, colon and breast cancer, and on larger scales.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/md-anderson-cancer-center-bets-bundled-payments", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/MD-Anderson-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "UnitedHealthcare and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center are piloting an episode of care, or bundled, payment model for patients being treated with head and neck cancers, a collaboration they describe as among the first to use bundled payments in a large, comprehensive oncology center.", "title": "MD Anderson takes bet on bundled payments"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/MD-Anderson-feature.gif"}, "description": "UnitedHealthcare and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center are piloting an episode of care, or bundled, payment model for patients being treated with head and neck cancers, a collaboration they describe as among the first to use bundled payments in a large, comprehensive oncology center.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MD Anderson takes bet on bundled payments"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "UnitedHealthcare and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center are piloting an episode of care, or bundled, payment model for patients being treated with head and neck cancers, a collaboration they describe as among the first to use bundled payments in a large, comprehensive oncology center.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center marks an important step toward expanded bundled care payment models and away from the traditional fee-for-service payments for oncology care,\u201d said Lee Newcomer, MD, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s vice president of oncology, genetics and gynecology.\n\u201cFor the last five years, MD Anderson and its Institute for Cancer Care Innovation have been looking at how to best approach a single price for treating cancers,\u201d said Thomas Feeley, MD, head of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at MD Anderson.\nUnitedHealthcare and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center are piloting an episode of care, or bundled, payment model for patients being treated with head and neck cancers, a collaboration they describe as among the first to use bundled payments in a large, comprehensive oncology center.\n\"For the last five years, MD Anderson and its Institute for Cancer Care Innovation have been looking at how to best approach a single price for treating cancers.\"\nUnited said if the demonstration with MD Anderson is successful, it could apply the similar bundled payment models for more common cancers, like lung, colon and breast cancer, and on larger scales."}
