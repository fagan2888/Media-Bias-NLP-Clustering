A Littleton man has been charged with first-degree attempted murder after allegedly luring a man to Summit County and attacking him with a machete.

Tyrus Walter Vanmatre, 20, was also charged with conspiracy, first-degree assault and menacing in the incident, which occurred Tuesday.

He was being held without bond.

According to the victim, Vanmatre, under false pretenses, took him into the woods near Sapphire Point on Swan Mountain Road, in unincorporated Summit County, intending to kill him. Though wounded, the victim was able to fight back and escape. He hid in the woods in the darkness, evading detection as his attacker searched for him.

Just after 3 a.m. Tuesday, the 18-year-old victim, covered in blood with deep cuts on his face, was found stumbling on Swan Mountain Road.

He was transported to St. Anthony Summit Medical Center in Frisco and airlifted to St. Anthony Hospital in Lakewood.

Vanmatre, arrested Wednesday, was taken to St. Anthony Hospital and made his first court appearance through a Skype video link from his hospital bed.

According to the Summit Daily, Vanmatre attended Summit High School, where he played goalie on the hockey team. The newspaper said Vanmatre described himself in an online profile as an aspiring actor and model.
