No longer holding back: St. John plans dozen capital projects

Building a 32-bed adult unit at Providence Park Hospital, modernizing a neonatal unit at St. John Hospital and Medical Center and upgrading telemetry equipment at Providence Hospital are three of more than a dozen capital projects planned over the next year at St. John Providence Health System.



Flush off two "solid" financial years, the Warren-based, five-hospital Roman Catholic system will spend $140.5 million on capital projects in fiscal year 2014 that began July 1 and a total of $190.8 million over two years for those projects, St. John CFO Patrick McGuire said.



The capital spending for 2014 is more than double the $60 million St. John spent in fiscal 2013, he said.



"We were holding back on spending for a couple of years because most systems' financial performance dipped through 2008-2010. It was important to be conservative about what financial commitments you make," McGuire said.



Since the 2008 recession, some hospitals have scaled back on construction projects — except on emergency departments — and invested more in physician development, medical equipment and information technology.



One exception is Detroit Medical Center, which was infused with $850 million for designated construction and capital improvement projects by its new owner, for-profit Vanguard Health Systems.



Since 2011, DMC has spent $315 million on capital projects at its eight hospitals, leaving about $535 million to be spent by 2017. Projects include a heart center, pediatric outpatient center and two hospital emergency department expansions.
