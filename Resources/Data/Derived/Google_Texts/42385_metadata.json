James has never missed more than five straight games in his professional career; if the two-week timetable released by the team Thursday holds up, his absence could reach 10 games or more.\n\nJames has missed Cleveland\u2019s past two games, and the Cavs are on a three-game losing streak. They play in Charlotte on Friday, host Dallas on Sunday, visit Philadelphia on Monday, are back home to meet Houston on Wednesday \u2014 then head out for a five-game road trip against Western Conference clubs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be too much on the court for me right now,\u201d said James, who has the league\u2019s second-best scoring average this season at 25.2 points.\n\nIt\u2019s a tumultuous time for the Cavaliers, who are still dealing with the aftereffects of losing center Anderson Varejao for the season. They\u2019ve looked both brilliant and baffling at times in James\u2019 first year back with the club after his four-year stint with the Miami Heat.\n\nAnd if he misses extended time, as it appears will be the case, the Cavs\u2019 season will likely only be more tested.\n\nJames briefly left Cleveland\u2019s game at Miami on Christmas Day after jumping into the stands to chase an errant pass, and was grabbing at his left knee in obvious discomfort not long afterward.\n\nThat was not the cause of the injury, just a recurrence of an ongoing issue, James said Wednesday before Cleveland played at home against Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cIt was before that, but it reaggravated it,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s been hurting pretty much all year. I\u2019ve been playing with it and it goes away, it comes back. The one in Miami kind of reaggravated it.\u201d\n\nIncluding playoffs, James has logged 41,082 NBA minutes \u2014 ninth-most among all active players.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "LeBron James (knee, back) out for next 2 weeks", "title": "LeBron James (knee, back) out for next 2 weeks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/01/lebron-james-knee-back-out-for-next-2-weeks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150101__4e97b4b72d8e04006a0f6a706700dbacp1.jpg", "height": 474}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150101__4e97b4b72d8e04006a0f6a706700dbacp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-01T13:46:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T22:15:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb305\"", "article_summary": "And if he misses extended time, as it appears will be the case, the Cavs\u2019 season will likely only be more tested.\nThe one in Miami kind of reaggravated it.\u201dIncluding playoffs, James has logged 41,082 NBA minutes \u2014 ninth-most among all active players.\nCLEVELAND \u2014 LeBron James has been diagnosed with knee and back strains, injuries that are expected to keep him sidelined for the next two weeks and add to an already rocky time for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nJames briefly left Cleveland\u2019s game at Miami on Christmas Day after jumping into the stands to chase an errant pass, and was grabbing at his left knee in obvious discomfort not long afterward.\nJames has missed Cleveland\u2019s past two games, and the Cavs are on a three-game losing streak."}
