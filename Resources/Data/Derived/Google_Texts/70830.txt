Most of us know what we need to do in emergency situations, but what about our pets?

Sunday, Bay County Emergency Services hosted the last day of a workshop that prepares first responders, pet owners and their pets in an emergency situation like a hurricane.

Volunteers and their furry friends went through a mock evacuation procedure at the Bay County Fairgrounds.

The pets went through different procedures like decontamination, and emergency animal sheltering.

"Very good process, very good procedures, very organized," explained James Martin, a volunteer at the workshop. "I thought they did it really well. They handed out the cards and it seemed to me [there was] a lot of good varieties of pet circumstances; contaminated, not contaminated or lethargic or dehydrated, I thought they did a really good job."

More than a dozen agencies were involved in the mock evacuations, including the Bay County Fire Department and the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine.
