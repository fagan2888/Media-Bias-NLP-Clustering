Similar to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that caused a stir in Indiana last year and even put a local pizza maker in the news as she and her dad fought to keep their restaurant's doors open, House Bill 757 is front and center in Georgia.\n\nHouse Bill 757, which passed the Georgia legislature Wednesday night, would allow pastors to refuse to marry same-sex couples, permit churches, religious schools to refuse to host events for anyone who doesn\u2019t share their beliefs and allow faith-based employers to deny hiring someone for the same reason.\n\nOpponents of the bill argue it is discriminatory against homosexuals.\n\n\u201cThe decision by the legislature today was to make an egregious and discriminatory bill even worse,\u201d the Human Rights Campaign, which represents the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that anti-equality extremists in the legislature are trying to ignore the will of the people of Georgia,\u201d it said.\n\nThe bill has given Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal a lot to think about. While the Republican governor believes in the right to religious freedom, he is uncomfortable with the thought of local businesses denying service to customers because of their sexuality.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal Constitution describes the governor\u2019s \u201clong and complicated\u201d relationship with the bill.\n\nDeal insists his discomfort with the legislation is rooted in biblical principles.\n\nIn remarkably stark terms, the governor said he would reject any measure that \u201callows discrimination in our state in order to protect people of faith.\u201d Rooting his critique in biblical terms, he urged fellow Republicans to take a deep breath and \u201crecognize that the world is changing around us.\u201d \u201cWe do not have a belief in my way of looking at religion that says we have to discriminate against anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you were to apply those standards to the teaching of Jesus, I don\u2019t think they fit.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Deal, he\u2019ll have until May 3 to make the decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Religious freedom proponents vs. gay marriage activists..05/26/2016 18:42:05PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Religious freedom proponents vs. gay marriage activists.", "title": "Religious Freedom Bill Passes in Georgia, But May Face Governor's Veto", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/19/religious-freedom-bill-passes-in-georgia-but-may-face-governors-veto-n2135825", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/8/2016-01-08T120619Z_1_LYNXMPEC070IF_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Religious freedom proponents vs. gay marriage activists.", "title": "Religious Freedom Bill Passes in Georgia, But May Face Governor's Veto", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/19/religious-freedom-bill-passes-in-georgia-but-may-face-governors-veto-n2135825", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/8/2016-01-08T120619Z_1_LYNXMPEC070IF_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Religious Freedom Bill Passes in Georgia, But May Face Governor's Veto, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Religious Liberty Bill does not have a controversial name, but its contents have caused much debate between proponents of religious freedom and same-sex marriage supporters.\nWhile the Republican governor believes in the right to religious freedom, he is uncomfortable with the thought of local businesses denying service to customers because of their sexuality.\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling that anti-equality extremists in the legislature are trying to ignore the will of the people of Georgia,\u201d it said.\nThe Atlanta Journal Constitution describes the governor\u2019s \u201clong and complicated\u201d relationship with the bill.\nThe bill has given Georgia Gov."}
