MIT also studied the chemical composition of the papyrus and patterns of oxidation.\n\nOther scholars studied the carbon character of the ink and found that it matched samples of papyri from the first to eight century CE, according to Harvard.\n\n\"None of the testing has produced any evidence that the fragment is a modern fabrication or forgery,\" the divinity school said.\n\nAt least one scholar sharply disagrees, however, calling the papyrus scrap \"patently fake.\"\n\nUnveiled by Karen King, a Harvard Divinity School historian, in 2012, the scrap has sparked a heated debate over Christian history, archaeological accuracy and the role of women in the church.\n\nThe fragment, which is about the size of a business card, contains just 33 words, including: \u201cJesus said to them, \u2018My wife \u2026\" and \"she will be able to be my disciple.\"\n\nThough she dubbed the fragment, \"The Gospel of Jesus' Wife,\" King said that the papyrus does not prove that Jesus was actually married - just that ancient Christians discussed the possibility.\n\n\"This gospel fragment provides a reason to reconsider what we thought we knew by asking what the role claims of Jesus's marital status played historically in early Christian controversies over marriage, celibacy, and family,\" King said.\n\nOther Christians have suggested that Jesus may have been speaking metaphorically in the sentence fragments quoted in the papyrus. Some New Testament writers refer to the church as \"the bride of Christ.\"\n\nKing and other scholars said they are equally intrigued by Jesus' mention of a female disciple.\n\n\"The main topic of the fragment is to affirm that women who are mothers and wives can be disciples of Jesus\u2014a topic that was hotly debated in early Christianity as celibate virginity increasingly became highly valued,\" King said.\n\n5 questions and answers about Jesus' 'wife'\n\nThe Harvard Theological Review also published on Thursday a sharp-worded rebuttal to King's hypothesis by Leo Depuydt, a professor of Egyptology at Brown University.\n\n\"I personally\u2014and I am not sure whether I share this feeling with anyone\u2014experience a certain incredulity pertaining to how something that is at first sight so patently fake could be so totally blown out of proportion,\" Depuydt writes.\n\nDepuydt's criticism centers on the fact that the papyrus scrap contains a grammatical error in Coptic - one that mirrors a similar miscue in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas.\n\nThe chances that two ancient works would have the same mistake are minuscule, the scholar said, strongly suggesting that the author of the\"Jesus' wife\" scrap copied from the Gospel of Thomas.\n\n\u201cAs a forgery, it is bad to the point of being farcical or fobbish,\" Depuydt told the Boston Globe. \"I don\u2019t buy the argument that this is sophisticated. I think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican's newspaper has also called the papyrus fragment a fake. \u201cSubstantial reasons would lead us to conclude that the papyrus is actually a clumsy counterfeit,\" L'Osservatore Romano, said in an editorial in 2012.\n\nVatican newspaper calls fragment referring to Jesus' wife 'a fake'\n\nKing and Harvard acknowledge that \"nothing is known about the discovery of the fragment.\" King has said it was given to her by an unnamed donor.\n\n\"All the known data about its origin and circulation need to be publicly disclosed and thus made available for scholarly discussion, as is the norm in the handling of manuscripts. Is there some reason we cannot just be told?\" Depuydt said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) --\u00a0A team of scientists has concluded that a controversial scrap of papyrus that purportedly quotes Jesus referring to \"my wife,\" is not a fake, according to the Harvard Theological Review.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Study: 'Jesus' wife' fragment not a fake", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/04/10/study-jesus-wife-fragment-not-a-fake/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/120918060102-papyrus-front-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) --\u00a0A team of scientists has concluded that a controversial scrap of papyrus that purportedly quotes Jesus referring to \"my wife,\" is not a fake, according to the Harvard Theological Review.", "title": "Study: 'Jesus' wife' fragment not a fake"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, bible, christianity, church, history, jesus, jesus wife", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/04/10/study-jesus-wife-fragment-not-a-fake/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Vatican newspaper calls fragment referring to Jesus' wife 'a fake'King and Harvard acknowledge that \"nothing is known about the discovery of the fragment.\"\nI think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student.\u201dThe Vatican's newspaper has also called the papyrus fragment a fake.\nThough she dubbed the fragment, \"The Gospel of Jesus' Wife,\" King said that the papyrus does not prove that Jesus was actually married - just that ancient Christians discussed the possibility.\nAt least one scholar sharply disagrees, however, calling the papyrus scrap \"patently fake.\"\nBy Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor(CNN) - A team of scientists has concluded that a controversial scrap of papyrus that purportedly quotes Jesus referring to \"my wife,\" is not a fake, according to the Harvard Theological Review."}
