Ad­mit­ting the prob­lem is al­ways the first step in any re­hab­il­it­a­tion pro­cess. And in the af­ter­math of Mitt Rom­ney’s de­feat in the 2012 pres­id­en­tial elec­tion, Re­pub­lic­ans across the coun­try were do­ing just that. Among the GOP’s elec­ted of­fi­cials, strategists, and act­iv­ists, there was wide­spread ac­know­ledg­ment that the Re­pub­lic­an Party suffered from a dis­ease that would not quickly be cured.

Nowhere was this ad­mis­sion clear­er than in­side the Re­pub­lic­an Na­tion­al Com­mit­tee, where Chair­man Re­ince Priebus ap­poin­ted a five-per­son task force — the Growth and Op­por­tun­ity Pro­ject — to identi­fy the party’s fore­most prob­lems and ex­plore po­ten­tial solu­tions. As this RNC autopsy was un­der­way, we at Na­tion­al Journ­al con­duc­ted our own post-mortem, speak­ing with sev­er­al mem­bers of that RNC pan­el, along with dozens more Re­pub­lic­ans na­tion­wide. The res­ult was “A 12-Step Pro­gram for the Re­pub­lic­an Party,” pre­scrib­ing a road to re­hab­il­it­a­tion for the GOP.

This week the RNC cel­eb­rated the one-year an­niversary of its Growth and Op­por­tun­ity Pro­ject’s re­port. Priebus and his pan­el­ists boas­ted that many of the party’s most ur­gent short­com­ings were ad­dressed over the past 12 months, es­pe­cially those re­lat­ing to “ground game” and cam­paign in­fra­struc­ture. Per­haps. But on many of the polit­ic­al pre­scrip­tions sug­ges­ted by top Re­pub­lic­ans in our re­port, the party has sputtered. So, rather than eval­u­ate GOP head­way ac­cord­ing to the RNC’s own met­rics, what fol­lows is Na­tion­al Journ­al‘s 2014 pro­gress re­port of the Re­pub­lic­an Party, based on our 2013 pre­scrip­tions:

Step 2: Go Out­side Your Com­fort Zone

Pre­scrip­tion: En­gage non­tra­di­tion­al GOP voters (es­pe­cially minor­it­ies and young people).

Pro­gress: B- “¦ Rand Paul, the sen­at­or from Ken­tucky, told us that Re­pub­lic­ans need to be go­ing in­to urb­an com­munit­ies and pitch­ing their ideas, des­pite know­ing those ef­forts won’t pay off im­me­di­ately. Paul has been a lead­er in this re­gard, speak­ing at black col­leges and far-left cam­puses, as well as open­ing an RNC of­fice in De­troit. Ad­di­tion­ally, House Ma­jor­ity Lead­er Eric Can­tor has been tour­ing cit­ies to pro­mote school choice. But too few Re­pub­lic­ans are fol­low­ing their lead. Oth­ers, such as Rep. Paul Ry­an, have made com­mend­able ef­forts. But Ry­an’s “in­ar­tic­u­late” com­ments about the work eth­ic among black men showed why some Re­pub­lic­ans are reti­cent to en­gage new vot­ing blocs.

Step 3: Speak Their Lan­guage

Pre­scrip­tion: Present a softer mes­sage, and smarter policy solu­tions, to the His­pan­ic com­munity.

Pro­gress: D+ “¦ This was pri­or­ity No. 1 among most Re­pub­lic­ans after Rom­ney won just 27 per­cent of His­pan­ics in 2012. Party lead­ers called for Re­pub­lic­ans to tone down their im­mig­ra­tion rhet­or­ic, and moreover, of­fer policy solu­tions bey­ond “self-de­port­a­tion.” Ef­forts on both fronts have been in­con­sist­ent. Sen­ate Re­pub­lic­ans, in­clud­ing Marco Ru­bio, helped craft a com­pre­hens­ive bill that would cre­ate a path to leg­al­iz­a­tion for many un­doc­u­mented im­mig­rants. But House Re­pub­lic­ans balked, in­sist­ing that bor­ders must be demon­strably se­cure be­fore leg­al­iz­a­tion is dis­cussed. That policy in­er­tia is un­help­ful but not fatal; what’s more dam­aging is com­ment­ary, like that from Rep. Steve King about “calves the size of can­ta­loupes,” that con­tin­ues to paint Re­pub­lic­ans as cold and un­car­ing about His­pan­ic voters.

Step 4: Go Big on Edu­ca­tion

Pre­scrip­tion: Draw a sharp con­trast between parties on the is­sue of school choice.

Pro­gress: D “¦ Re­pub­lic­ans re­main con­vinced that edu­ca­tion is the X factor that could im­prove its stand­ings among cru­cial demo­graph­ics — wo­men and urb­an res­id­ents es­pe­cially — who worry about the health of the na­tion’s pub­lic-edu­ca­tion sys­tem. “No oth­er is­sue even comes close in its po­ten­tial for the Re­pub­lic­an Party,” former Rep. Ar­tur Dav­is, a de­fect­or from the Demo­crat­ic Party, told us. Edu­ca­tion speaks to the broad­er theme of “up­ward mo­bil­ity,” ad­ded Henry Bar­bour, an RNC pan­el­ist. Yet in the past year we’ve seen little ef­fort — at least on the na­tion­al stage — to make this part of the na­tion­al dia­logue. Sen. Ted Cruz, a po­ten­tial 2016 can­did­ate, told Iow­ans re­cently that “school choice is the civil-rights is­sue of the 21st cen­tury.” Rom­ney said something eer­ily sim­il­ar in 2012, yet failed to force a de­bate on the top­ic. Re­pub­lic­ans would be wise to learn from Rom­ney’s fail­ure.

Step 5: Let the Liber­tari­an Flag Fly

Pre­scrip­tion: Ex­pand the party by al­low­ing liber­tari­an voices to at­tract new, young voters.

Pro­gress: A “¦ To the chag­rin of tra­di­tion­al de­fense hawks such as Sen. John Mc­Cain and Rep. Mike Ro­gers, the fresh voices of Paul and Rep. Justin Amash are re­de­fin­ing the Re­pub­lic­an brand — at least on se­cur­ity is­sues — in front of our very eyes. Paul’s 13-hour fili­buster chal­len­ging the use of drones on do­mest­ic soil cap­tured the sus­pi­cion that young Amer­ic­ans feel to­ward the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment; and Amash’s amend­ment to re­strict bulk data col­lec­tion by the Na­tion­al Se­cur­ity Agency nearly won on the House floor des­pite op­pos­i­tion from the White House, the Pentagon, and the lead­er­ship of both parties.

Step 6: Bring Back the Boot­straps

Pre­scrip­tion: Em­phas­ize op­por­tun­ity for av­er­age Amer­ic­ans, not handouts for big busi­nesses.

Pro­gress: C- “¦ There was ad­ded ur­gency to this im­per­at­ive when me­dia nar­rat­ives dic­tated that 2014’s polit­ic­al cli­mate would be driv­en by “in­come in­equal­ity.” Re­pub­lic­ans, des­pite tak­ing heat for res­ist­ing an­oth­er ex­ten­sion to un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, are mak­ing genu­ine ef­forts to rebrand them­selves. Many con­ser­vat­ives are talk­ing boldly about end­ing “cor­por­ate wel­fare” through the tax code and even re­dir­ect­ing some fund­ing to­ward job train­ing pro­grams. Ry­an has been vis­it­ing poor areas and float­ing an­ti­poverty ini­ti­at­ives. Oth­er House Re­pub­lic­ans, mean­while, have worked with the Her­it­age Found­a­tion to re­vis­it wel­fare re­forms aimed at push­ing new people in­to the work­force. Still, these words haven’t been backed by con­sist­ent, con­crete le­gis­lat­ive ac­tion to pro­mote so­cial mo­bil­ity.

Step 7: Just Say Yes

Pre­scrip­tion: Po­s­i­tion Re­pub­lic­ans as pro­act­ive, rather than re­act­ive, on the is­sue of health care.

Pro­gress: D- “¦ Re­pub­lic­ans prom­ised an al­tern­at­ive to the Af­ford­able Care Act upon seiz­ing the House ma­jor­ity in 2011. Three years later, no such plan has reached the House floor — just a bunch of votes to re­peal Obama­care. This has spawned tre­mend­ous ten­sion with­in the House GOP, where con­ser­vat­ive mem­bers, tired of Obama’s claim that they lack policy solu­tions, have pro­duced com­pre­hens­ive plans that nev­er re­ceive a vote. Can­tor has prom­ised Re­pub­lic­ans a vote this year on a health care bill, but it’s likely to be a hodge­podge of pro­vi­sions rather than a full-scale re­place­ment. GOP lead­er­ship, es­pe­cially House Speak­er John Boehner, seems con­tent to make 2014 a ref­er­en­dum on Obama­care. That might work short-term, but Re­pub­lic­ans won’t have last­ing suc­cess without a vis­ion of their own.

Step 8: Leave the Labs Alone

Pre­scrip­tion: Al­low state parties, and gov­ernors, to lead the Re­pub­lic­an re­sur­gence.

Pro­gress: D “¦ “The re­build­ing of the party has to be­gin out in the states,” Kev­in Mad­den, who worked both Rom­ney pres­id­en­tial cam­paigns, told us after the 2012 elec­tion. While the GOP no longer has the con­crete policy ex­amples it did years ago (Mitch Daniels’s privat­iz­a­tion ef­forts in In­di­ana, Jeb Bush’s edu­ca­tion re­forms in Flor­ida), there are non­ethe­less some ef­fect­ive blue­prints be­ing laid. Two of the GOP’s suc­cess­ful battle­ground gov­ernors, Ohio’s John Kasich and Michigan’s Rick Snyder, have achieved con­ser­vat­ive res­ults by strad­dling the cen­ter on oth­er policy fights. Both al­lowed Medi­caid ex­pan­sion in their states, for ex­ample, which af­forded them polit­ic­al cap­it­al to push tax cuts and bal­anced budgets. It’s a dif­fi­cult mod­el for Re­pub­lic­ans on the Hill to fol­low, however, be­cause they simply don’t trust Obama — and there­fore are un­will­ing to ad­opt this give-and-take ap­proach. Mean­while, oth­er states have demon­strated what policy fights are worth pur­su­ing (Wis­con­sin’s en­ti­tle­ment re­forms) and which aren’t (Ari­zona’s im­mig­ra­tion en­force­ment and “an­ti­gay” bills).

Step 9: Let it Die!

Pre­scrip­tion: Stop the po­lar­iz­ing, di­vis­ive rhet­or­ic on so­cial is­sues.

Pro­gress: C “¦ Daniels was vil­i­fied for sug­gest­ing a “truce” on so­cial is­sues in 2010, but his ap­proach was vin­dic­ated in 2012 after Re­pub­lic­ans lost win­nable races due to clumsy com­ments about rape and abor­tion. 2013 was a struggle, as Re­pub­lic­ans walked the fine line between re­spect­fully op­pos­ing the Su­preme Court de­cision on gay mar­riage and of­fend­ing people while do­ing so. More re­cently, com­ments by former Gov. Mike Hucka­bee about con­tra­cep­tion sug­gest some in the GOP will nev­er learn their les­son. Still, there are signs that many Re­pub­lic­ans re­cog­nize the polit­ic­al ne­ces­sity of ton­ing it down. Speak­ers at this month’s Con­ser­vat­ive Polit­ic­al Ac­tion Con­fer­ence, for ex­ample, made hardly any men­tion of gay mar­riage — something that would have been un­ima­gin­able a few years ago.

Step 10: Don’t Go There

Pre­scrip­tion: End the GOP’s in­fatu­ation with ad­ven­tur­ism abroad.

Pro­gress: A- “¦ From Libya to Syr­ia to Ukraine, Re­pub­lic­ans have signaled a new ap­proach to for­eign policy — one that breaks sharply from the in­ter­ven­tion­ist years of George W. Bush. Chalk it up to a war-weary elect­or­ate, or on­go­ing de­fi­cit wars, or just re­li­able op­pos­i­tion to any­thing that em­powers Obama. Whatever the cause, most Re­pub­lic­ans de­sire a de­cidedly light­er foot­print on the glob­al stage. Even some of the most hawk­ish Re­pub­lic­ans — those al­ways quick to ant­ag­on­ize Obama’s for­eign policy — have stopped short of ad­voc­at­ing troops on the ground, opt­ing in­stead for arm­ing rebel groups. That dis­tinc­tion alone speaks to a shift oc­cur­ring in­side a party that has de­pend­ably pre­scribed mil­it­ary in­ter­ven­tion dur­ing mo­ments of glob­al tu­mult over the past half-cen­tury. Still, the dur­ab­il­ity of this non­in­ter­ven­tion­ist mood could be tested by Rus­sia’s 21st-cen­tury dis­play of ag­gres­sion.

Step 11: Give Power to the People

Pre­scrip­tion: Make en­ergy in­de­pend­ence a corner­stone of Re­pub­lic­an­ism.

Pro­gress: B+ “¦ Sus­tained ap­peals for the con­struc­tion of the Key­stone XL pipeline have ef­fect­ively framed the en­ergy de­bate in Wash­ing­ton — Re­pub­lic­ans want more ex­plor­a­tion, Demo­crats want more reg­u­la­tion. That’s a win­ning con­trast for the GOP, as evid­enced by some vul­ner­able Sen­ate Demo­crats voicing their dis­pleas­ure with Obama’s un­will­ing­ness to ap­prove the pro­ject. Ad­di­tion­ally, GOP at­tempts to high­light Obama’s “war on coal” have helped ce­ment this di­cho­tomy in the Rust Belt. “Drill, baby, drill” may have eli­cited sneers from elites in both parties, but it res­on­ates with Amer­ic­ans pay­ing close to $4 a gal­lon for gas. With nat­ur­al gas emer­ging as the next fron­ti­er of en­ergy ex­plor­a­tion, don’t ex­pect Re­pub­lic­ans to tone down their en­ergy of­fens­ive any­time soon.

Step 12: Build It, and They Will Come

Pre­scrip­tion: Pro­mote in­fra­struc­ture as a mech­an­ism for job cre­ation.

Pro­gress: C- “¦ There are se­lect cases of Re­pub­lic­ans fight­ing to fund new in­fra­struc­ture pro­jects. (Sen. Mitch Mc­Con­nell slipped money in­to last year’s gov­ern­ment spend­ing bill for a dam on the Ohio River; Gov. Snyder has brokered an agree­ment to build an­oth­er bridge between De­troit and Canada.) But by and large, Re­pub­lic­ans con­tin­ue to shy away from spend­ing money on bridges and roads, much less bike paths and light trans­it. That’s un­for­tu­nate, not just be­cause such pro­jects ap­peal to the voters they are des­per­ate to reach (city dwell­ers, es­pe­cially young ones) but also be­cause they can de­liv­er an eco­nom­ic shot in the arm des­per­ately needed in some slow-to-re­cov­er cit­ies and states.
