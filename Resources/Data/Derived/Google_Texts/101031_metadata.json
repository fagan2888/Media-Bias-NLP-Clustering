Family Express afforded me the opportunity to pursue an undergraduate degree in Human Resources, and I was subsequently promoted to director of human resources\u201d in 2006, Condon said.\n\nSince that time, Condon gained a Master\u2019s in HR Development from Villanova University and completed her Senior Professional of Human Resources Certification.\n\n\u201cA testament to our culture, my journey from store operations is not an anomaly at Family Express,\u201d she said.\n\nNEW INITIATIVES\n\nAs director of human resources Condon has been instrumental in implementing \u2018industrial psychology\u2019 into the Family Express hiring process long before it became the norm in the c-store industry.\n\n\u201cOur living brand is special. It requires the right type of person to deliver on the standard our customers expect,\u201d she said.\n\nAs such, hiring at Family Express is competitive. Only one in 50 applicants is welcomed into the chain\u2019s three-day training program. Industrial psychology helps Family Express identify the characteristics in a person\u2014such as a positive attitude and a natural inclination toward relationship building\u2014that would make him or her a \u201csuperstar member\u201d of the living brand. This allows Family Express to cultivate an employee\u2019s natural talent for building relationships.\n\nUnder Condon\u2019s watch, Family Express also audits its culture in the same way it audits inventory. In other words, the chain counsels employees on aspects of their jobs, such as preserving and enhancing a relationship, using a greeting that is unique and friendly, maintaining a knowledge of the brands sold at Family Express and delivering on promises.\n\nCondon has also revolutionized how Family Express hires by using \u201cprogrammatic\u201d hiring, meaning it hires store associates based on the expected rate of attrition\u2014before the attrition happens. This practice ensures Family Express is never understaffed or overstaffed.The result? Programmatic hiring has had a monumental impact on turnover. In 2016, Family Express is on pace to see a turnover rate of only 19%.\n\nEMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT\n\nFamily Express takes training seriously. Only 80% of prospective employees invited to the three-day training graduate to employment with the company. The c-store chain uses more than 50 modules of computer-based training as the basis of this initial three-day orientation.\n\nIn April 2015 Family Express rolled out the \u201cYOU MATTER!\u201d initiative, in which it made clear its plans to pay an hourly wage of $10 an hour. It also offers tuition reimbursement, a family festival on its 20+ acres, award luncheons and monetary gifts based on various lengths of service.\n\nIn the first 11 months of the $10 an hour wage campaign, the chain has seen a 10% reduction in turnover that happens in fewer than 90 days, 14% ACA (Affordable Care Act) premium reductions, 23% total turnover reduction and a 135% increase in applications\u2014with a acceptance rate of about 2.8%.\n\n\u201cHappy employees make economic sense,\u201d said Condon. \u201cThis journey doesn\u2019t happen without them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From programmatic hiring to competitive training processes, Kris Condon is helping shape the convenience store chain\u2019s flourishing workforce.
