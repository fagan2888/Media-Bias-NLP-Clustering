MOBILE, Ala. (AP) — Anna Nordqvist moved into position for her third victory of the year, shooting her second straight 6-under 66 on Saturday to take the third-round lead in the Airbus LPGA Classic.

The 26-year-old Swede, the winner in Thailand and Carlsbad, had a 16-under 200 total on The Crossings course at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail’s Magnolia Grove complex.

Catriona Matthew, the 44-year-old Scot who led after each of the first two days, was a stroke back. She birdied three of the last four holes for a 70.

Second-ranked Stacy Lewis, the 2012 champion who needs to finish solo third or higher to take the top spot in the world from Inbee Park, was third after a 66. Park missed the cut Friday.

Michelle Wie, Jessica Korda and 18-year-old Charley Hull were tied for fourth at 13 under. Wie shot 66, Korda 69, and Hull 71.
