Having built a small business into a big one, I can tell you that today the impediments that the government imposes are impossible to deal with. Home Depot would never have succeeded if we tried to start it today. Every day you see rules and regulations from a group of Washington bureaucrats who know nothing about running a business.\u201d\n\nIBD: \u201cPresident Obama has promised to streamline and eliminate regulations.\u201d\n\nMarcus: \u201cHis speeches are wonderful. His output is absolutely, incredibly bad. With just ObamaCare by itself, you have a 2,000-page bill that\u2019s probably going to end up being 150,000 pages of regulations.\u201d\n\nIBD: \u201cIf you could sit down with Obama and talk to him about job creation, what would you say?\u201d\n\nMarcus: \u201cI\u2019m not sure Obama would understand anything that I\u2019d say, because he\u2019s never really worked a day outside the political or legal area. He doesn\u2019t know how to make a payroll, he doesn\u2019t understand the problems businesses face.\u201d\n\nThe advice from Marcus to the business community? \u201cIt\u2019s time to stand up and fight. These people in Washington are out there making your life difficult, and many of you won\u2019t survive. We are on the edge of the abyss.\u201d\n\nJohn Mackey, co-founder of Whole Foods in 1980 and currently co-CEO of the company, has delivered similar words of warning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going bankrupt, for one thing,\u201d says Mackey, regarding the federal debt. \u201cUnless we\u2019re willing to take that seriously and deal with it without raising taxes and choking off the enterprise of America, then I see a decline as inevitable.\u201d\n\nMackey points to how Reagan reversed the economic breakdown of the Carter years, a stagflation that steadily cut the value of paychecks and reduced the nation\u2019s standard of living.\n\n\u201cWe had a leader who came in and cut taxes and freed up a lot of industries through deregulation,\u201d asserts Mackey, \u201cand America experienced a renaissance, a rebirth, and that pretty much carried us for the past 25 years or more.\u201d\n\nToday, cautions Mackey, we\u2019ve \u201cgone backwards again,\u201d retreating from Reagan\u2019s pro-growth, pro-business policies that rewarded work, encouraged investment, produced jobs, expanded incomes and delivered a 180-degree economic turnaround.\n\nMost recently, \u201cBush really accelerated that retreat,\u201d says Mackey, referring to George W. Bush, \u201cand now Obama\u2019s taking it to extraordinary lengths far beyond what any other president has ever done before.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdee0\"", "article_summary": "Bernie Marcus co-founded Home Depot in 1978, a bad economic time of rising unemployment, accelerating inflation and Jimmy Carter\u2019s downhearted feelings of malaise.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to make a payroll, he doesn\u2019t understand the problems businesses face.\u201dThe advice from Marcus to the business community?\nHere are several of the interview\u2019s highlights:IBD: \u201cWhat\u2019s the single biggest impediment to job growth today?\u201dMarcus: \u201cThe U.S. government.\nThese people in Washington are out there making your life difficult, and many of you won\u2019t survive.\nHaving built a small business into a big one, I can tell you that today the impediments that the government imposes are impossible to deal with."}
