(Photo: Craig Harris/Sumner County Publications)\n\nHendersonville High senior Chris Kacprowski been selected to play in the Toyota East vs. West Tennessee All-Star Classic, which will be held at Cookeville\u2019s Tennessee Tech University on Friday, Dec. 12.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big honor,\u201d Kacprowski said. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I can be a part of something like that.\n\n\u201cI was really surprised. Joe Townsend (who is currently a senior center at Vanderbilt University) was the last one who came from Hendersonville (to play in the all-star game). I didn\u2019t think I was going to get that game. I found out Nov. 10. I was really surprised.\u201d\n\nKacprowski \u2013 a 6-foot-2, 270-pound offensive tackle and defensive tackle for the Commandos \u2013 was selected as an offensive guard.\n\nHe helped Hendersonville\u2019s run-oriented offense average better than 44 points per game this fall.\n\nKacprowski was selected as the District 9-AAA most valuable defensive lineman. Through the regular season, he had 23 tackles (20 solo tackles and 10 of which resulted in a loss of yardage), three quarterback sacks, eight hurries and one fumble recovery.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s times I prefer offense, and there\u2019s times I prefer defense,\u201d Kacprowski \u2013 a two-year starter on both sides of the ball \u2013 said. \u201cMost of the time, I prefer offense a little more. The offensive-line bond is a good thing to be a part of. I like that.\u201d\n\nHendersonville finished 10-2 this season, winning the District 9-AAA regular-season championship before suffering a 24-7 loss to Centennial in the second round of the 6A playoffs.\n\nThe Commandos reached the 6A state championship game last season.\n\n\u201cI played to my capabilities,\u201d Kacprowski said. \u201cI just wish we could have extended the season a little longer.\u201d\n\nKacprowski was selected to the West squad, which will be coached by Whitehaven head coach Rodney Saulsberry.\n\nThe East squad will be coached by Siegel head coach Greg Wyant.\n\nThe all-stars were nominated by their high-school coaches and then selected by the coaching staffs for the game.\n\nKacprowski is hoping to receive additional recruiting interest as a result of playing in the game. To this point, the majority of his attention has come from East Tennessee State University.\n\n\u201cI would like to play college football,\u201d Kacprowski said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about that (participation in the game helping his recruiting interest). I\u2019m glad I can have the opportunity.\n\n\u201cBecause of my size, I\u2019m not looked at that much. This game will be a boost in recruiting.\u201d\n\nPlayers will report to Carson-Newman on Tuesday, Dec. 9 and will practice through Thursday.\n\nKickoff for the game is slated for 7 p.m.\n\nThe West squad won last year\u2019s contest by a 55-39 score, with the two teams setting an all-star-game record of 94 points.\n\nThe West team leads the all-time series 4-3.\n\nThe rosters are as follows:\n\nName Position School Height Weight Coach College commitment\n\nVincent Perry Athlete Hillsboro 5-10 175 Craig Clayton Tennessee\n\nTimmie Barbee Athlete Springfield 5-10 170 Dustin Wilson\n\nKyle Akin QB Trinity Christian 6-2 195 Blake Butler\n\nJordan Williams QB Whitehaven 6-1 170 Rodney Saulsberry\n\nDeon Sanders RB Centennial 6-0 210 Brian Rector\n\nJohnny Jones RB Crockett Co. 5-9 185 Kevin Ward\n\nChase Henderson RB Henry Co. 6-0 215 James Counce\n\nKe\u2019shawn Vaughn RB Pearl-Cohn 5-10 205 Tony Brunetti\n\nRoss Burcham WR Adamsville 6-5 220 Brandon Gray\n\nJaylon Moore WR Mitchell 6-1 180 Nathan Cole\n\nDavonte Boyland WR Raleigh-Egypt 6-0 185 Major Wright\n\nAustin Percy WR Ravenwood 6-4 175 Will Hester\n\nLaDariel Ester WR Whitehaven 6-3 210 Rodney Saulsberry\n\nJ.
