Members of a church in Quitman are picking up the pieces after it caught fire Saturday afternoon.

Quitman's First Church of the Nazarene experienced that fire around 2:45 Saturday. Flames scorched the side of the building and did major damage on the inside. The fire also completely destroyed their church van. The pastor's son says they're unsure of how it started.

"At this moment, some things have been spoken to us, but we really don't know at this time. Hopefully there is an investigation and we'll see what will happen and come from this," Donald Boyd Jr. says.

Boyd says everyone is in good spirits and are thankful the entire church was not burned.
