A Bartlesville teenager convicted last year of carrying a machete onto school property was arrested for an armed robbery at a Bartlesville convenience store early Sunday.

In a court affidavit, Bartlesville Police say Jonathan Hubler, 18, pointed a handgun at a QuikTrip clerk and demanded money at 2:40 a.m. on Sunday, January 5, 2014.

Officers say the car they believe was used in the robbery was found wrecked several miles away. A police officer located Hubler a short time later at another convenience store and arrested him on complaints of robbery with a firearm, assault on a police officer and threatening to perform an act of violence.

A judge set a $500,000 bond for Hubler.



Hubler pleaded guilty in November 2013 for carrying a machete onto Bartlesville Public School property in April of that year. A judge gave Hubler a 10-year deferred sentence.
