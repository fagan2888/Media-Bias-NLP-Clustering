Some even cite the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as adding to their costs.\n\nAnthony Wright, of the consumer watchdog group Health Access California, says that reason doesn\u2019t fly.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has another provision that puts a limit on how much your premium can be spent on patient care, rather than administration and profit. So, again, having an outside fee that is for administration is in violation in the spirit of the law, which is to try to limit the amount of money that\u2019s spent on administration profit, and really target those dollars towards patient care,\u201d Wright said.\n\nFor the vast majority of Californians who have health insurance \u2014 which is now more than 20 million residents \u2014 adding on extra fees beyond the usual co-payments and co-insurance is illegal under state law.\n\n\u201cDoctors KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO playpause\n\n\u201cHealth plan members cannot be charged administrative fees when they visit an in-network provider,\u201d says Shelley Rouillard, the director of the California Department of Managed Health Care, which regulates the vast majority of health plans offered in the state.\n\nThe California Academy of Family Physicians says it hasn\u2019t heard of this practice here and has no policy in place.\n\nMany doctors have long charged extra for such services as filling out school forms. But Feldman reports that new fees are cropping up recently, applied in the form of a flat fee, which range from a few hundred to more than $1,000 a year, regardless if a patient uses a particular office service.\n\nDoctors in other parts of the country are starting to also add on these extra fees, says David Doyle, CEO of a major physician billing consulting firm in Michigan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a growing number of physicians across the country that are moving in that direction,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cAnd it should be noted that, up until several years ago, physicians did charge for certain services that were not covered, if you will, by insurance carriers such as preparing for school athletic forms, school participation forms, disability forms, things of that nature. Those were items that they had historically charged for \u2014 they\u2019re now expanding that into a much wider area.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO playpause\n\nFor some plans it\u2019s not illegal to charge extra fees, because they\u2019re not covered by the state law that prohibits it. But it\u2019s almost impossible for a patient to find out whether their insurance company permits the fees; the contracts are between the insurer and the doctor, leaving the patient only to rely on the doctor\u2019s word that the fees are allowed.\n\nIf you think your doctor is charging you an illegal fee you can file a complaint by calling the California Department of Managed Healthcare\u2019s (DMHC) at (888) 466-2219 or submit the complaint online.
