Bewildered by the decision, Lowery provided a copy of his personal medical file in 2010. Two years later, his claim was rejected again.\n\nSince the Review-Journal wrote about Lowery\u2019s case last week, other veterans have come forward with complaints about tactics employed by the agency, which demands that veterans prove their injuries were service-related but can deny claims without proving anything.\n\nThey include Phil Cushman, a Vietnam War Marine veteran from Oregon who beat the VA system there by winning a \u201cdue process\u201d challenge in a federal appeals court that netted $400,000 in compensation. Now, through his nationally recognized nonprofit veterans rights advocacy group, Cushman is helping disabled Korean War soldier Charles P. Mahoney, of Las Vegas, with his appeal for more compensation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not filing claims for the money. I want justice,\u201d Mahoney, 82, told the newspaper. \u201cWhat the VA did to me 60 years ago is they tore up the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nMahoney, who served with the 1st Cavalry Division in Korea in 1950, suffered wounds and mental problems from a mortar blast that heaved him 15 feet into the air. After a hospital stint in Japan, he was taken to Fort Hood, Texas, where he underwent a series of electro\u00adshock treatments in 1951 that \u201cblotted out my memory for nine months.\u201d\n\nTwo Army evaluation boards determined he was 100 percent disabled, but a third said he was only 10 percent disabled. The Army then told him he was cured and discharged him in 1952.\n\nThe VA immediately opened a claim but never processed it or issued a decision and never told him about it. Concealment of the claim effectively denied his right to counsel, Cushman said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2012, three years after Mahoney filed a claim with the VA, that he obtained records showing he had been diagnosed in the early 1950s with a permanent mental disability.\n\n\u201cI thought I was normal, but I wasn\u2019t normal. I had problems with, I guess they call it post-traumatic stress disorder now,\u201d Mahoney said, describing dreams that would cause him to \u201cwake up in the middle of the night screaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew something was wrong with me, but I didn\u2019t find that out until I read (about) my physical evaluation boards that I got out of (military archives in) St. Louis in 2012.\u201d\n\nIn resolving his 2009 claim, the VA awarded him 30 percent disability for one year and 10 percent disability retro\u00adactive to 1952, a total of about $37,000. But in a 2013 letter to former VA General Counsel Will Gunn that Cushman crafted for Mahoney, the Korean War veteran argued that his rights were violated because the VA and the Army knew his file held two different discharge papers, one of which omitted his mental condition.\n\nThis year Mahoney sent a certified letter to the VA Reno benefits office about his quest for 100 percent retroactive compensation to the 1950s. If successful, that could mean Mahoney would stand to collect between $800,000 and $1 million.\n\nThe VA signed for the letter but never responded.\n\nCushman said there are similarities between Mahoney\u2019s and Lowery\u2019s cases \u2014 bureaucratic foot-dragging, missing documents, lack of communication and unwarranted denials without regard to the VA\u2019s own doctrine that says the veteran should be given the benefit of the doubt when records are missing or unavailable.\n\nCushman said the VA\u2019s actions amount to a violation of a veteran\u2019s constitutional guarantee of due process.\n\n\u201cThe VA routinely, and as a matter of illegal policy, frequently denies clearly meritorious claims by simply ignoring the evidence and applicable VA laws and regulations,\u201d Cushman said.\n\nLike Lowery and Cushman, other vets and their loved ones have expressed outrage at the way the VA Reno benefits office has handled their claims.\n\nThe widow of one Vietnam veteran said the VA constantly dragged its feet in processing her husband\u2019s claim. Many issues related to his bout with illness attributed to Agent Orange exposure, treatment for PTSD, Parkinson\u2019s disease and deteriorating eyesight were in limbo when he died a month after his 63rd birthday.\n\n\u201cLowery is not a story but a reality of how the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2026 (has) failed and still fails to enforce the constitutional rights of our soldiers of wars,\u201d said Johnnette Fafard. Her husband, former Army Sgt. Raymond Fafard, died in 2013.\n\nMore than a year after his death, the VA continued to mail him a summary of payments for medical service it made on his behalf.\n\n\u201cPlease contact the VA facility listed below ... if you have any questions about the information on this notice or you believe that VA payment was made in error,\u201d reads a Sept. 13, 2014, letter from a local VA office. \u201cThank you for your military service.\u201d\n\nJohnnette Fafard believes \u201cthis is evidence of CUE (clear unmistakable error) done by the VA.\n\n\u201cThe VA sent a summary of payment letter to the deceased veteran of 18 months. Why? Was the VA expecting a response?\u201d she asked.\n\nRetired Navy equipment operator Pete Wallace of Pahrump said in a letter last week that he was informed by \u201cA. Bittler\u201d \u2014 the same veterans service center manager in Reno who denied Lowery\u2019s claim and handled Fafard\u2019s case \u2014 that the VA had no record of him being at Fort Hunter Liggett, Calif., where he was injured in 2000.\n\nReached Friday, Wallace said he finds that hard to believe because he submitted copies of his orders, a letter of commendation and his medical records \u201cthree or four times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went through the same thing (as Lowery) a few years ago, although for a much lesser injury, and the common denominator is A. Bittler,\u201d Wallace said.\n\nLowery is now getting some attention from the VA, which scheduled his Thursday medical exam in the wake of last week\u2019s Review-Journal article.\n\n\u201cThe Reno Regional Office has worked directly with Mr. Lowery and the VA Medical Center to expeditiously complete examinations so his claim can be processed as soon as possible,\u201d Nathanial Miller, a management analyst for the Reno office, said in an email to the Review-Journal.\n\nBut VA Reno officials declined to answer any questions about any of the veteran\u2019s complaints, nor would they even confirm that A. Bittler works there.\n\nA call to Alan L. Bittler in Reno seeking comment for this article wasn\u2019t returned.\n\nContact Keith Rogers at krogers@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0308.
