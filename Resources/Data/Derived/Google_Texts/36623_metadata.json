We want to find somebody who can get things done.\u2019... Does [incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell back away from repealing, for example, Affordable Care? Will we not hear about Benghazi again for a while and all the other issues that have been coming up? It was not so long ago a lot of Republicans said impeach the President. Do they want to go there?

So the \u2018hell no caucus,\u2019 as you\u2019ve put it, is getting bigger and some of them don\u2019t think you\u2019re conservative enough.\u201d\n\n\u2014 CBS correspondent Nancy Cordes to House Speaker John Boehner at a November 6 press conference.\n\n\n\nAndrea Derides Call to Repeal ObamaCare: \u201cIt\u2019s So Retro\u201d\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough: \u201cRepublicans that are out there in red states talking about cutting education, cutting infrastructure, cutting R&D, are losing, even losing among Republicans.

Did you ever go back to the residence at night and say, \u2018Are we ever going to get a break here?\u2019...You came here talking about hope and change. Do you still hope?
