The release is built around a collection of photos of Vaslav Nijinsky, who lived from 1889 to 1950 and left a legacy as perhaps the greatest dancer of all time.\n\nNijinsky teamed with ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev around the turn of the (last) century, and stunned the world working in the famed Ballets Russes, based in Paris. He danced for less than a decade, the story goes, before a crippling schizophrenia ended his career. There is no known video footage of him at work.\n\nThe photos were collected by Roger Pryor Dodge (1898-1974) a dancer himself who was taken by Nijinsky and the originals currently reside in the New York Public Library. The 242 photos are a combination of costume stills, formal portraits and publicity shots. As a set they easily earn the praise \u201cOne of the most remarkable collections in the world,\u201d as Dance magazine labeled them back in 1950.\n\nThe app certainly has use for dancers who can gaze at it to study Nijinsky\u2019s peculiar body positioning but I found it appealing, on a wider level, as time capsule of a certain period in dance history and as a rounded portrait of an artist at his creative height. Like the silent film stars of his day, the dancer said a lot in his facial expressions, so the sealed images are captivating. So are images of the dancer\u2019s famous, and unusually large, thighs, thought to be the secret to his famous sky-high leaps.\n\nPicture book apps are still a new form, so pegging an audience for \u201cNijinsky: God of Dance\u201d is not easy. There are a few collected articles written about the photo collection over time included, but this is not a high-tech app by any stretch; the work is basically self-published by the collector\u2019s son Pryor Dodge. Its kicks rely on visuals, but what high kicks there are to see.\n\nAvailable as a phone app at the Apple store, but it looks just fine on the iPad, too. You can also find an Android-friendly app at Google Play.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ballet Russes,dance history,dance photogrpahy,Nijinsky,Roger Pryor,Vaslav Nijinsky", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/2013/12/26/nijinsky-photos-a-time-capsule-of-dance-history-captured-in-new-app/10824/", "type": "blog", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/files/2013/12/nijinsky1.jpg", "site_name": "Artmosphere", "title": "Nijinsky photos a time capsule of dance history, captured in new app | Artmosphere \u2014 The Denver Post"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "creator": "@rayrinaldi", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/2013/12/26/nijinsky-photos-a-time-capsule-of-dance-history-captured-in-new-app/10824/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/files/2013/12/nijinsky1.jpg", "title": "Nijinsky photos a time capsule of dance history, captured in new app", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Nijinsky photos a time capsule of dance history, captured in new app"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0cb\"", "article_summary": "Not many new books use critical blurbs from 1950 to promote their contents, but \u201cNijinsky: God of Dance\u201d isn\u2019t a typical book.\nPicture book apps are still a new form, so pegging an audience for \u201cNijinsky: God of Dance\u201d is not easy.\nIt\u2019s more like a gallery of great photographs and it\u2019s only available as an app for $7.99.\nAvailable as a phone app at the Apple store, but it looks just fine on the iPad, too.\nThe release is built around a collection of photos of Vaslav Nijinsky, who lived from 1889 to 1950 and left a legacy as perhaps the greatest dancer of all time."}
