Rick Scott on Friday laid out what he\u2019s looking for in the next president but declined to offer support for Sunshine State hopefuls Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio.\n\nThe Republican, who talked up his state\u2019s economic recovery at length at POLITICO\u2019s Fifth Annual State Solutions Conference in Washington, suggested that the next occupant of the White House should take a more aggressive tack at home and abroad than President Barack Obama.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get our economy going. Let\u2019s defend our country from terrorism. Let\u2019s fix Obamacare. Let\u2019s pick someone who brags about our country,\u201d Scott said at the conference, just before the opening of the National Governors Association winter meeting.\n\nScott praised Rubio, the Florida Republican senator, as a \u201cvery good partner,\u201d and said he has talked recently with Bush, who served as governor from 1999-2007.\n\nBut Scott, who said he would \u201cmost likely\u201d endorse a GOP candidate before the state\u2019s primary in March 2016, offered his highest praise for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying he was Florida\u2019s \u201cbiggest competitor\u201d for jobs and calling the Lone Star State \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for employment policy.\n\n\u201cRick is a ball to be with. He has a lot of energy,\u201d Scott said, prompting laughter from the crowd.\n\nHe added that of all the potential 2016 contenders, he speaks to Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal most frequently.\n\nScott, who boasted about Florida throughout the discussion \u2014 on everything from job openings to Friday\u2019s high temperature in his hometown of Naples \u2014 added that it would be a positive for the state if Rubio and Bush decided to run.\n\n\u201cI think anybody from Florida running for president is good for Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to talk about how great we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nScott said Sen. Marco Rubio should run for president if he wants to but declined to say whether the senator should also run for reelection simultaneously. The senator has said in the past that he would not contest Florida law disallowing him from being on the ballot for two different offices.\n\nToward the end of the discussion, Scott said he opposes the Obama administration\u2019s moves to normalize relations with Cuba, a divisive issue in his state, which is home to a large number of Cuban-Americans. The only way Cuba will make human rights reforms and become a democracy, Scott said, is if the U.S. maintains the embargo and trade sanctions.\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Republican suggests that the next occupant of the White House should take a more aggressive tack at home and abroad than President Barack Obama.", "title": "Scott will 'most likely' endorse before Fla. primary", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/rick-scott-endorse-florida-primary-115351.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/20/150220_rick_scott_1160_rl-3.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Jeb Bush,Politics,Marco Rubio,Rick Perry,Rick Scott,Florida", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Republican suggests that the next occupant of the White House should take a more aggressive tack at home and abroad than President Barack Obama.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda5d5\"", "article_summary": "Rod Lamkey Jr. for POLITICO Scott will 'most likely' endorse before Fla. primaryFlorida Gov.\nBut Scott, who said he would \u201cmost likely\u201d endorse a GOP candidate before the state\u2019s primary in March 2016, offered his highest praise for former Texas Gov.\nScott praised Rubio, the Florida Republican senator, as a \u201cvery good partner,\u201d and said he has talked recently with Bush, who served as governor from 1999-2007.\nRick Scott on Friday laid out what he\u2019s looking for in the next president but declined to offer support for Sunshine State hopefuls Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio.\nLet\u2019s pick someone who brags about our country,\u201d Scott said at the conference, just before the opening of the National Governors Association winter meeting."}
