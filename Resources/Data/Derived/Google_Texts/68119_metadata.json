Sebelius and declare the mandate illegal and unconstitutional. Eighteen states and other parties filed friend-of-the-court briefs last month that also ask the high court to hear the case.\n\n\u201cAll Americans, including family business owners, should be free to live and do business according to their faith,\u201d said Senior Counsel David Cortman. \u201cAs our brief argues, this case provides the cleanest opportunity for the Supreme Court to uphold that long-held American principle.\u201d\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorneys represent Conestoga Wood Specialties and the Hahn family, Mennonite cabinetmakers in Pennsylvania who appealed to the nation\u2019s high court after a divided federal appellate court ruled against them. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\u2019s 2-1 decision runs counter to decisions issued in other circuits and to the vast majority of court rulings on the mandate so far.\n\n\u201cThe cost of religious freedom for the Hahn family and many other job creators across the country who face this mandate is severe,\u201d added Senior Legal Counsel Matt Bowman. \u201cA family should not face massive fines and lawsuits just because they want to earn a living consistent with their faith.\u201d\n\nThe mandate could cost the family nearly $3 million per month in fines if it doesn\u2019t agree to live contrary to its Christian convictions. It forces employers, regardless of their religious or moral convictions, to provide insurance coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception under threat of heavy penalties by the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies if the mandate\u2019s requirements aren\u2019t met.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nConestoga Wood Specialties owners Norman Hahn, Elizabeth Hahn, Norman Lemar Hahn, Anthony H. Hahn, and Kevin Hahn desire to run their company, a wholesale manufacturer of custom wood cabinet parts, in a manner that reflects their Christian beliefs, including their belief that God requires respect for the sanctity of human life.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorneys are co-counsel in the case, Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius, together with allied attorneys Charles Proctor, III, with the Pennsylvania firm Proctor, Lindsay & Dixon, and Randall Wenger, chief counsel of the Independence Law Center.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom attorneys and allied attorneys are also litigating 14 other lawsuits against the mandate. The lawsuits represent a large cross-section of Protestants and Catholics who object to the mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mennonite Cabinet Makers Tells Supreme Court: Don't Let Obama Force Us to Obey HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court Monday to answer federal government arguments that downplayed the need for the co", "title": "Mennonite Cabinet Makers Tell Supreme Court: Don\u2019t Let Obama Force Us to Obey HHS Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/04/mennonite-cabinet-makers-tell-supreme-court-dont-let-obama-force-us-to-obey-hhs-mandate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pichealth41b-190x98.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "mennonite,cabinet,conestoga,supreme court,hhs,mandate", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0026\"", "article_summary": "Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys and allied attorneys are also litigating 14 other lawsuits against the mandate.\nThe brief encourages the high court to accept the case Conestoga Wood Specialties v.
