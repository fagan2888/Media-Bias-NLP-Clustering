Money quote from CBS\u2019s story about this:\n\nChao said he was unaware of a Sept. 3 government memo written by another senior official at CMS. It found two high-risk issues, which are redacted for security reasons. The memo said \u201cthe threat and risk potential (to the system) is limitless.\u201d The memo shows CMS gave deadlines of mid-2014 and early 2015 to address them\u2026 It was Chao who recommended it was safe to launch the website Oct. 1. When shown the security risk memo, Chao said, \u201cI just want to say that I haven\u2019t seen this before.\u201d A Republican staff lawyer asked, \u201cDo you find it surprising that you haven\u2019t seen this before?\u201d Chao replied, \u201cYeah \u2026 I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be surprised if you were me?\u201d He later added: \u201cIt is disturbing. I mean, I don\u2019t deny that this is \u2026 a fairly nonstandard way\u201d to proceed.\n\nNote well: The estimated fix for the unspecified security problems was the middle of next year at the earliest. HHS says they rolled out the site on October 1 even though it wasn\u2019t functioning because they thought they could fix it on the fly relatively quickly after launch. This memo proves that that\u2019s a lie.\n\nNow, the question: Did Chao lie to the committee about not having seen the Sept. 3 memo before or was there a deliberate effort within CMS to withhold the extent of the site\u2019s problems from supervisors like him so that they\u2019d greenlight it for launch as scheduled? If the latter, who\u2019s responsible? As it turns out, the memo was written by \u2014 ta da \u2014 Tony Trenkle, lead tech officer for Healthcare.gov who left last week under mysteriously vague circumstances. As CBS reported, Trenkle himself never signed off on security for the site in September; it was his boss, Marilyn Tavenner, who signed the authorization, supposedly because she thought that a project this big should carry the John Hancock of the head of CMS. Is that the truth, or did Trenkle refuse to sign because he knew the site\u2019s security was a travesty and couldn\u2019t in good conscience authorize launching it? The fact that he wrote such a dire memo about \u201climitless\u201d risk suggests that he knew the extent of the problem \u2014 and yet, if you believe Chao, that information somehow never made its way to the project manager. Why? Why are there so many unorthodox procedures related to approval of the site\u2019s security here? Did Tavenner, at least, see Trenkle\u2019s memo before she authorized the launch or was it withheld from her too? If she did see it, why didn\u2019t she tell Obama and Sebelius that security was too weak to justify rolling it out now?\n\nI assume CMS will try to pin all of this on Trenkle by claiming he didn\u2019t do enough to warn his superiors about how bad things were. And yet the fact remains: He wrote the memo. He wanted someone to see it. The language he used was sufficiently alarming that Chao himself said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that he hadn\u2019t seen it before when it was handed to him at the hearing. It can\u2019t be Trenkle who suppressed the bad news about security. Whodunnit?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cIt is disturbing.\u201d", "title": "The plot thickens: ObamaCare website project manager claims he wasn\u2019t told that security flaws posed \u201climitless\u201d risk", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/12/the-plot-thickens-obamacare-website-project-manager-claims-he-wasnt-told-that-security-flaws-posed-limitless-risk/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-12T16:11:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-12T17:22:07+00:00"}, "keywords": "CBS, chao, cms, Department of Health and Human Services, healthcare.gov, ObamaCare, trenkle, White House,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce630\"", "article_summary": "Why are there so many unorthodox procedures related to approval of the site\u2019s security here?\nIs that the truth, or did Trenkle refuse to sign because he knew the site\u2019s security was a travesty and couldn\u2019t in good conscience authorize launching it?\nNote well: The estimated fix for the unspecified security problems was the middle of next year at the earliest.\nDid Tavenner, at least, see Trenkle\u2019s memo before she authorized the launch or was it withheld from her too?\nMoney quote from CBS\u2019s story about this:Chao said he was unaware of a Sept. 3 government memo written by another senior official at CMS."}
