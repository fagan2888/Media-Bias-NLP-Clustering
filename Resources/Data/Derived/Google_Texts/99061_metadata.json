Rain will be the issue for much of the West Coast while the rest of the country basks in tepid temperatures.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news and it\u2019s all going to swoop in Wednesday evening into Thanksgiving Day night.\n\n\u201cTravel will be miserable on Wednesday,\u201d says Scott Bernhardt, president of weather analysts Planalytics.\n\nWeather havoc translates into what climate trackers call \u201ctravel-inhibiting events,\u201d meaning flights will be tardy, even canceled at key airports nationwide, and roads will be congested with bumper-to-bumper autos moving at a turtle\u2019s pace.\n\nSchneider Electric Weather, an analytics arm of Schneider Electric, has tagged 12 major airports as \u201cThanksgiving travel hazards.\u201d It includes the usual suspects of O\u2019Hare, Minneapolis-St. Paul, La Guardia, JFK, Newark and Logan as well as Dulles, Reagan, Philadelphia and Baltimore-Washington, plus Portland and Seattle. Not a great start to a long, oftentimes harried weekend.\n\nBut come Thursday, all will be well in the U.S. weather world, says Ronald Sznaider, vice president of weather service at Schneider Electric. \u201cThere will be no showstoppers on Thanksgiving, per se, and things will really have quieted down by Friday,\u201d he insists.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news, for the most part. The mad snow dump that hit Buffalo, N.Y., last week is projected to be a flooding problem later into the weekend.\n\nAnd if you plan to start your holiday shopping this weekend at Destiny USA in Syracuse, N.Y., the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Ill., or the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., be sure to bundle up and prepare for some snow flurries.\n\nSchneider Electric did the legwork for you and mapped out the top 10 shopping centers and malls in the U.S. and their corresponding wintry prognostications. The weather forecasts for those three project light snow and below-freezing temperatures, as low at 10 degrees at Mall of America. Even still, it could be worse at Destiny where lake-effect snow could pile up.\n\nIt won\u2019t be a whole lot nicer at Pennsylvania\u2019s King of Prussia Mall or the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y., but it looks like you\u2019ll be in fine stead in most shopping centers in California or Florida, according to Schneider Electric.\n\nMall name City Schneider Electric weather forecast for Nov. 28 Mall of America Bloomington, Minn. Cloudy with a little light snow in the morning: Low 10. High 25 King of Prussia Mall King of Prussia, Penn. Partly Cloudy: Low 25. High 39 Aventura Mall Aventura, Fla. Partly Cloudy: Low 56. High 73. South Coast Plaza Costa Mesa, Calif. Partly Cloudy: Low 56. High 77. Del Amo Fashion Center Torrance, Calif. Partly Cloudy: Low 56. High 76. Destiny USA Syracuse, N.Y. Cloudy with Lake Effect snow showers: Low 22. High 30. Sawgrass Mills Sunrise, Fla. Partly Cloudy: Low 54. High 72. The Galleria Houston, Tex. Cloudy: Low 43. High 69. Roosevelt Field Garden City, N.Y. Cloudy: Low 28. High 40. Woodfield Mall Schaumburg, Ill. Cloudy, with flurries possible: Low 14. High 30.\n\nAs for the rest of the year, many experts predict a thankfully milder winter session than most of us suffered through last year. Don\u2019t get too cocky too fast, though. There will still be frigid icy, very cold weather this winter \u2014 just not for the intolerable long bouts that persisted in January, February and March, both Planalytics and Schneider Electric say.\n\n\u201cThere will be very, very cold outbreaks in January again, particularly in the eastern half of the country,\u201d Sznaider says. \u201cBut the difference will be that we expect moderation much earlier this year compared with last year,\u201d he adds.\n\nLast year, temperatures almost everywhere were anywhere from eight to 12 degrees below normal. This season, they\u2019ll be below normal again in some choice spots, just not so much, he says.\n\nBut Bernhardt reminds us that weather is much like politics: It\u2019s all local and relative. \u201cIf you consider 30 degrees cold and the week before it was 50 degrees and then it\u2019s 30, it feels really, really cold. If it was 35 and then dropped to 30, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\n\n\u201cOf course, for people in Atlanta, 30 degrees and 3 inches of snow is a whole lot different than 30 degrees and 3 inches for people in Chicago,\u201d he adds.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The hustle and bustle of the beginning of the holiday season wouldn\u2019t be complete without a lousy weather forecast.", "creator": "@JenWatersMKW", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DA097_pfsnow_MG_20141125132812.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Jennifer Waters", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The hustle and bustle of the beginning of the holiday season wouldn\u2019t be complete without a lousy weather forecast.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/marketwatchs-farmers-almanac-horrible-weather-just-in-time-for-the-holidays-2014-11-25", "author": "Jennifer Waters", "parsely-title": "MarketWatch\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Almanac: Horrible weather just in time for the holidays", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-26T10:37:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The hustle and bustle of the beginning of the holiday season wouldn\u2019t be complete without a lousy weather forecast.", "title": "MarketWatch\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Almanac: Horrible weather just in time for the holidays", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/marketwatchs-farmers-almanac-horrible-weather-just-in-time-for-the-holidays-2014-11-25", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DA097_pfsnow_MG_20141125132812.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DA097_pfsnow_MG_20141125132812.jpg"}, "article.id": "8011BE1C-74CF-11E4-A5F8-39B9AA2FB6E8", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bf2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you consider 30 degrees cold and the week before it was 50 degrees and then it\u2019s 30, it feels really, really cold.\n\u201cOf course, for people in Atlanta, 30 degrees and 3 inches of snow is a whole lot different than 30 degrees and 3 inches for people in Chicago,\u201d he adds.\nCloudy: Low 43.\nBut come Thursday, all will be well in the U.S. weather world, says Ronald Sznaider, vice president of weather service at Schneider Electric.\nPartly Cloudy: Low 56."}
