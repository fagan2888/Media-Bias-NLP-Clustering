The bulk of that revenue would come through tax increases targeted at the investment income of high income earners and bequests by wealthy Americans.\n\n\n\nObama will propose to raise the tax rate on capital gains for high income earners from 23.8 percent to 28 percent, including the Medicare surtax imposed as part of Obamacare.\n\nRead the full story here\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nObama to Seek Billions in New Taxes on Investments and Inheritance\n\n\n\nNewmax\n\nPresident Barack Obama is turning to his biggest television audience of the year to pitch tax increases on the wealthiest Americans and put the new Republican Congress in the position of defending top income earners over the middle class.\n\n\n\nAs Obama continues to signal what he will propose during Tuesday's State of the Union address, senior administration officials said Saturday that he will call for raising the capital gains rate on top income earners and eliminating a tax break on inheritances. The revenue generated by those changes would fund new tax credits and other cost-saving measures for middle-class taxpayers, officials said.\n\n\n\nTax increases are rarely welcomed by congressional Republicans, who now hold majorities in the House and the Senate for the first time in Obama's presidency. Obama's tax proposals will likely be dismissed, if not outright ignored, by lawmakers outside the Democratic Party's liberal base.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "01-18-15", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/obamamoney-ap_6.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Still Not Paying Your \\u2018Fair Share\\u2019?
