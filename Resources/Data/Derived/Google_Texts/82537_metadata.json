First, on the government's claim that there was a compelling interest in uniform enforcement of the contraception mandate, Cogan wrote:\n\nTens of millions of people are exempt from the Mandate, under exemptions for grandfathered health plans, small businesses, and \u201creligious employers\u201d like the Diocesan plaintiffs here. Millions of women thus will not receive contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing through the Mandate. Having granted so many exemptions already, the Government cannot show a compelling interest in denying one to these plaintiffs.\n\nSecond, the court also rejected Obama's last minute claim that Obamacare's contraception mandate, as implemented for religious organizations, did not, in fact, mandate contraception:\n\nHere, the Government implicitly acknowledges that applying the Mandate to plaintiffs may in fact do nothing at all to expand contraceptive coverage, because plaintiffs\u2019 TPAs aren\u2019t actually required to do anything after receiving the self-certification. In other words, the Mandate forces plaintiffs to fill out a form which, though it violates their religious beliefs, may ultimately serve no purpose whatsoever. A law that is totally ineffective cannot serve a compelling interest.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nFinally, the court also rejected the government's argument that Obama's failure to convince Congress to \"fix\" Obamacare authorized him to enforce his contraception mandate in the manner he did:\n\nNor is the Mandate the least restrictive means by which the Government can improve public health and equalize women\u2019s access to healthcare. ... The Government could provide the contraceptive services or insurance coverage directly to plaintiffs\u2019 employees, or work with third parties \u2013 be it insurers, health care providers, drug manufacturers, or non-profits \u2013 to do so without requiring plaintiffs\u2019 active participation.\n\n... The Government first argues that the alternatives above are infeasible because the defendants lack statutory authority to enact some of them. This argument makes no sense; in any challenge to the constitutionality of a federal law, the question is whether the federal government could adopt a less restrictive means, not any particular branch within it. It would set a dangerous precedent to hold that if the Executive Branch cannot act unilaterally, then there is no alternative solution. If defendants lack the required statutory authority, Congress may pass appropriate legislation.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nConsidering how often Obama has justified his expansion of executive power on Congress' failure to do his bidding, yesterday's ruling was not only a huge victory for religious liberty, but a huge win for limited government in all spheres as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's contraception mandate suffered another huge loss in federal court Monday..05/23/2016 18:41:32PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama's contraception mandate suffered another huge loss in federal court Monday.", "title": "- Federal Judge Calls Obamacare \"Totally Ineffective\" While Striking Down Contraception Mandate", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2013/12/17/federal-judge-calls-obamacare-totally-ineffective-while-striking-down-contraception-mandate-n1764623", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/76/d8395f3e-faaa-46a5-984a-81ad030104fe@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "President Obama's contraception mandate suffered another huge loss in federal court Monday.", "title": "- Federal Judge Calls Obamacare \"Totally Ineffective\" While Striking Down Contraception Mandate", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2013/12/17/federal-judge-calls-obamacare-totally-ineffective-while-striking-down-contraception-mandate-n1764623", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/76/d8395f3e-faaa-46a5-984a-81ad030104fe@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Federal Judge Calls Obamacare \"Totally Ineffective\" While Striking Down Contraception Mandate, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8b9\"", "article_summary": "The contraception mandate \"directly compels plaintiffs, through the threat of onerous penalties, to undertake actions that their religion forbids,\" Cogan wrote.\nIn other words, the Mandate forces plaintiffs to fill out a form which, though it violates their religious beliefs, may ultimately serve no purpose whatsoever.\nHaving granted so many exemptions already, the Government cannot show a compelling interest in denying one to these plaintiffs.\nCogan forcefully rejected three key Obama defenses of the mandate.\nMillions of women thus will not receive contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing through the Mandate."}
