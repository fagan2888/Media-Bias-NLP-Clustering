University of Chicago Medicine and Land of Lincoln Health have mended a tense relationship, allowing several hundred patients at the South Side academic medical center to continue to have their treatments paid for there.

Land of Lincoln, which was created under the Affordable Care Act to address competition and health care costs, was going to cut U of C Medicine from its network March 1, but negotiations “took a positive spin,” Dennis O'Sullivan, a spokesman for the insurer, said in an interview.



“Land of Lincoln Health strives to provide high-quality, affordable health insurance to its members,” O'Sullivan said separately in a statement. “This includes providing rich benefits to members and offering a robust network of health care providers. It has always been Land of Lincoln Health's full intention to continue offering coverage for the University of Chicago.”

U of C Medicine told patients in a December letter that it would no longer be in Land of Lincoln's network; now the health system is notifying them that they still are covered by the insurer.



“We're gratified several hundred University of Chicago Medicine patients who were enrolled in Land of Lincoln will be able to receive our in-network care,” U of C spokeswoman Ashley Heher said in a statement. “We're in the process of individually notifying all our current and former Land of Lincoln patients about this latest update.”

In February, two U of C patients filed a class-action lawsuit against Land of Lincoln over the threat of dropped coverage.
