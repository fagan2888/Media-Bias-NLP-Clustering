Remember Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown Law student and “reproductive rights activist” who demanded taxpayers cover the cost of her birth control? After her testimony before Congress on behalf of Democrats, she quickly became the most outspoken antagonist of the Republicans and their so-called “War on Women.” Free contraception is a matter of women’s health, Fluke argued at the time, and how dare Republicans suggest exercising self-control or personal responsibility?!

Fast-forward to today and the latest Obamacare ad campaign. For guys, there’s brosurance to keep that beer fund intact. For girls, there’s… hosurance:

“OMG, he’s hot! Let’s hope he’s as easy to get as this birth control,” the newest ad from Got Insurance? says. ”My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers. I got insurance.”

And if you’re not “hot to trot” or into derbying, there’s always wine.

So who’s paying for this garbage? Take note:
