A Florida police officer who got his start in the New York Police Department was fatally shot early Sunday morning in Tarpon Springs, just hours after two NYPD officers were killed in Brooklyn.

Tarpon Springs Officer Charles “Charlie K” Kondek, 45, was shot and killed while responding to an incident at about 3 a.m. in Pinellas County, NBC News reported. Police did not provide any further details about the shooting.

The 17-year law enforcement veteran was reportedly a father of five.

Pinellas County spokeswoman Cecilia Barreda said a suspect was in custody and likely being questioned.

“Our hearts and prayers go out to the Kondek Family and offer our deepest sympathy to them. May Charlie rest in peace and We Will Never Forget him,” the Tarpon Springs Police Department posted on Facebook.

The shooting came hours after Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, allegedly shot and killed New York Police officers Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, before taking his own life Saturday afternoon. Investigators say that just three hours before his rampage, Brinsley posted on Instagram anti-police rhetoric and threatened vengeance for the police-involved death of Eric Garner and Michael Brown.
