Others threatened to shutter the church\u2019s infrastructure of hospitals, charitable ministries, schools and universities rather than accept a policy that they say would force Catholic employers to provide health insurance that covers sterilization and perhaps abortion-inducing drugs as well as contraception.\n\n\u201cThe government is willing to jeopardize a massive network of hospitals, schools, and social services by insisting they provide for services they find objectionable,\u201d Bishop Lawrence Persico of Erie, Pa., said in October as his diocese filed suit against the mandate.\n\nBut after repeatedly drawing that line in the sand, a growing number of bishops have begun to push back, arguing that such hard-line rhetoric has put them in an untenable position. These bishops do not want to close Catholic institutions over a birth control policy \u2014 and they say they actually can\u2019t do so in most cases.\n\nIn addition, they argue that there is no reason to try \u2014 the exemptions and accommodations in the mandate are sufficient, some say, and the church\u2019s teaching that access to good, affordable health care is a basic right should outweigh any remaining reservations.\n\nThat\u2019s why those familiar with the deliberations in Baltimore note that the statement is carefully worded to acknowledge that each bishop can make his own arrangements on health insurance \u2014 as some are doing \u2014 and it begins to provide cover for the entire hierarchy as the prelates try to find an exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThe first step off the limb they have been climbing out on the past couple of years\u201d was how National Catholic Reporter columnist Michael Sean Winters described the bishops\u2019 statement. His verdict was privately confirmed by a number of bishops who took part in what were described as \u201ccandid\u201d though cordial discussions.\n\nGiven the vocal and lengthy record of opposition by some members of the hierarchy, backing away from these ultimatums may not be easy. But hard-liners who have wanted to make a last stand out of the contraception mandate may be facing too many challenges to maintain their position.\n\nFor one thing, even bishops who oppose the mandate are hardly eager to exercise the \u201cnuclear option\u201d and shut down Catholic ministries. As Boston Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley said during the Baltimore meeting, \u201cClosing the institutions down is also an evil for us.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s opinions carry great weight since he is the top American adviser to Pope Francis, and the pope himself has made caring for the poor a priority for the church while also saying the church is often too focused on hot-button moral issues around sexuality. At the Baltimore meeting, the bishops signaled that they are also taking cues from their new pope and want to highlight other issues, which left the culture warriors somewhat isolated.\n\nMoreover, the Obama administration has modified the original policy to such an extent that a number of bishops have publicly said they could find ways to live with it without closing ministries. \u201cThese kinds of scare tactics and worse-case scenario predictions are uncalled for and only unnecessarily disturb the hardworking and dedicated people who are employed by the Church,\u201d Bishop Blase Cupich of Spokane, Wash., wrote to his diocesan employees last February.\n\nAnother problem for the die-hards is that the mandate exempts dioceses and perhaps the Catholic schools, charities and other institutions connected to them. Given that protection, it\u2019s not clear that the bishops themselves would be subject to fines for not complying with the mandate, much less jail time.\n\nThe limited scope of the bishops\u2019 purview also points to what is perhaps the biggest obstacle for hard-liners: Bishops don\u2019t in fact control the vast majority of the institutions they say they would shut down.\n\nFor example, of the 630 Catholic hospitals in the U.S., just 33 are controlled or sponsored by a bishop, and the Catholic Health Association, which represents all of those hospitals, has said it would accept the White House accommodation. Similarly, just 10 of the nearly 200 Catholic colleges and universities in the U.S. fall under diocesan auspices, and local Catholic Charities are often separately incorporated entities.\n\nOne option for the bishops could be to declare that organizations that work within the mandate are no longer officially \u201cCatholic\u201d \u2014 a powerful threat if they choose to wield it.\n\nBut even moral theologians who back the bishops and oppose the mandate, such as Janet Smith of Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, have said that Catholics can \u201cmorally comply\u201d with the policy since they do so under duress.\n\nNone of this means that the bishops are poised to drop their objections to the birth control mandate itself. Most still think it is problematic, and they are joined in that view by Catholics across the spectrum who say that at the very least it was a ham-handed policy solution and poorly executed by the White House. They expect sporadic confrontations as some church-affiliated groups or Catholic-owned businesses protest the mandate by refusing to pay fines or by dismissing employees or dropping health insurance.\n\nAlso, the Supreme Court could make this all moot by ruling in favor of the bishops. The justices on Tuesday (Nov. 26) are expected to decide which of the many challenges to the mandate they will take up, with the rulings expected in June.\n\nBut if the verdicts go against the bishops, they may well have few tools \u2014 and little desire \u2014 to take the battle much further.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Bombshell Pope Quotes Bombshell Pope Quotes\n\n1 of 12 \"Who Am I To Judge?\" Pope Francis has had a busy week at World Youth Day in Rio as he visited his slums and prisons, blessed the Olympic flag and brought three million people to Copacabana Beach for a final Mass on Sunday morning.
