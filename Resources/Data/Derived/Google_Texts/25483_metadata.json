Loud criticism has been raised over the agreement, with protesters attempting to carry a mock coffin to the U.S. embassy in Manila on Friday.\n\n\n\nHowever, as Steven Rood, the Asia Foundation\u2019s representative in the Philippines, points out, much of that will blow over.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the sensitivity of not treating Filipinos as second-class citizens in their own country,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the backdrop is that the average Filipino citizen is very much in favor of having U.S. troops here. This doesn\u2019t threaten U.S.-Filipino relations; the strategic benefits for the alliance will override this specific issue.\u201d\n\nRather, some people hope that the strong bilateral connection between the two countries could impact the LGBT rights struggle in the Philippines. LGBT groups have participated in several protests outside the U.S. embassy in Manila and at vigils in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf media and other groups in the U.S. frame [Laude\u2019s murder] as a hate crime and focuses on transgender rights, it might trickle down to people in society here and affect how they treat transgender and LGBT people,\u201d says Saballe.\n\nWhile visible, LGBT people in the Philippines lack anti-discriminatory legislation and the legal recognition of transgender available in many other countries, including the U.S.\n\n\u201c[Seen] with American eyes, the position of the LGBT community in the Philippines is an unusual one,\u201d says Rood. \u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of the Filipino community, but the violence they may be subjected to has not been very visible. This will certainly be a rallying cry.\u201d\n\nSaballe, whose organization also monitors violence against LGBT people in the Philippines, stresses that the community is \u201cnot really accepted in society.\u201d She adds, \u201cOnly days after Jennifer was killed, two other trans women were murdered.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s protest action is being held simultaneously in four cities in the Philippines, with a solidarity event also arranged in the Netherlands and a discussion forum in Thailand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Countrywide protests are held to remember Jennifer Laude, with Friday declared 'National Day of Outrage.'", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Groups say the death of Jennifer Laude highlights the vulnerable position of trans people in the Philippines", "title": "LGBT Rage Over Transgender Murder", "url": "http://time.com/3536215/philippines-transgender-murder-jennifer-laude-lgbt-rights/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ap721992695871.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ap721992695871.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Groups say the death of Jennifer Laude highlights the vulnerable position of trans people in the Philippines", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "LGBT Rage Over Transgender Murder"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "the philippines, transgender, murder, u.s. marine, pemberton, laude, lgbt, protest, national day of outrage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "the Philippines, transgender, murder, U.S. Marine, Pemberton, Laude, LGBT, protest, national day of outrage"}, "article_summary": "The burial of transgender woman Jennifer Laude has sparked a \u201cNational Day of Outrage\u201d in the Philippines, with LGBT organizations staging candlelight vigils across the country on Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of the Filipino community, but the violence they may be subjected to has not been very visible.\nWhile visible, LGBT people in the Philippines lack anti-discriminatory legislation and the legal recognition of transgender available in many other countries, including the U.S.\u201c[Seen] with American eyes, the position of the LGBT community in the Philippines is an unusual one,\u201d says Rood.\n\u201cWe will deliver messages of solidarity and push for justice,\u201d says Charlese Saballe, chairwoman of the Society of Transsexual Women of the Philippines (STRAP).\nHowever, as Steven Rood, the Asia Foundation\u2019s representative in the Philippines, points out, much of that will blow over."}
