If after Santa’s come and gone you’re still a gift short for a loved one on Christmas Day, what can you do?

Most of the largest retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy are closed on Christmas Day and Amazon’s same-day delivery guarantee runs out on Christmas Eve. But a handful of stores will be open on Christmas Day to help with your holiday shopping crisis.

About 6,000 CVS/pharmacy stores will be open on Christmas Day, said a company spokesperson. Walgreens Stores also will be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., with 24-hour stores not closing at all, a company spokesperson said. Family Dollar will have 4,500 of its stores open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

“Team members volunteered to work in these select stores during the holiday,” a spokesperson said.

Rite Aid, 7-Eleven, Albertsons and Kroger also are open on Christmas Day, according to a GOBankingRates.com holiday guide. GOBankingRates recommends to call each local store or supermarket to find out if they are open and for how long. (The guide also lists which popular stores are closed on the holiday and which restaurants are open.)

Procrastinating shoppers can find a range of suitable gifts such as toys, gift cards, stocking stuffers and even wine (depending on the state) at these stores, along with gift wrap and cards to create a thoughtful, if last-second, present. And no one needs to know the presents were purchased on Christmas Day.
