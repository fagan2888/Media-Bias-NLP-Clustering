A study last year finding that each additional month of breastfeeding turns into a half-point gain in IQ by age seven was widely and gleefully reported. (As Amy Sullivan has written, there are legitimate questions about the way many of the studies that report the benefits of breastfeeding are conducted.)\n\nAt the same time that the pressure on women to act as human milk machines has ratcheted up, so has the pressure not to miss a beat at work. For many feminists, \u201chousewife\u201d might as well be a dirty word; euphemisms like \u201cstay-at-home-mom\u201d and \u201chomemaker\u201d aren\u2019t much better. Super-moms like Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer have only given the working-mom routine a veneer of manageability, while often sidestepping the immense privilege (and assistance) that these women possess. Breast pumps are of imperfect assistance: Pumping at work can be awkward and inconvenient, and their functionality is anything but sleek. Despite the fact that the market for these machines will reach 5.63 million units in 2015, the unwieldy machines have not undergone a major redesign in almost 60 years.\n\nSharing nursing responsibilities\u2014whether by hiring a paid wet nurse or by figuring out an informal arrangement with friends (a practice more often called \u201ccross-nursing\u201d)\u2014seems like a reasonable solution. It could relieve the burden on working mothers without compromising their babies\u2019 feeding. It could take the pressure off women who find breastfeeding painful or impractical. It could make it possible for babies who aren\u2019t being brought up by their biological mothers to breastfeed.\n\nWet nurses\u2014that is, a woman who nurses a baby who is not her own\u2014have fed some of the most famous babies in fiction and myth\u2014from Rebecca, the Biblical wife of Isaac, to Muhammad to Shakespeare\u2019s Juliet. Louis XIV was painted suckling at the breast of a woman who was not his mother. \u201cSince time immemorial, families and institutions have hired wet nurses to breastfeed infants who have lost their mothers or whose mothers were not breastfeeding them for whatever reason,\u201d lactation consultant Virginia Thorley wrote in Breastfeeding Review, the journal of the Australian Breastfeeding Association, in 2008.\n\nHigher rates of infant mortality prior to the twentieth century also indirectly supported the role of the wet nurse. \u201cIf you had a baby and it died, you\u2019d have a window of opportunity to make some money,\u201d says writer Erika Eisdorfer, who researched wet nursing in the Victorian era while writing a historical novel, A Wet Nurse\u2019s Tale, set in nineteenth-century England. \u201cYou could go work as a wet nurse and feed one baby, and when that baby was ready to be weaned you could go on to the next baby and the next,\u201d Eisdorfer told me over the phone. \u201cAs long as a baby\u2019s suckling, you\u2019ll produce milk.\u201d She estimates that a wet nurse\u2019s career could last nine or ten years. \u201cWealthier families would look for young, firm women, but families that couldn\u2019t afford to be so picky would take what they could get.\u201d The popular 1861 domestic guide-book Mrs Beeton\u2019s Book of Household Management advised families to seek out a woman between 20 and 30 years old.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, wet nurses could advertise their services in community newspapers or ask local doctors to spread the word. \u201cDuring the heyday of wet nurse advertising in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, women typically emphasized four qualities: good health, upstanding character, plentiful milk, and milk that was fresh,\u201d Janet Golden wrote in A Social History of Wet Nursing in America. One wet nurse advertising her services in the Philadelphia Public Ledger in 1837 described herself as \u201ca healthy young English woman having abundance of milk,\u201d promising that she \u201chas nothing to engage her time except her own child which is three months old.\u201d So high was the demand that nineteenth-century wet nurses had their pick of families to work for; according to a 1886 article in Popular Science Monthly, \u201cThe search for a wet-nurse is one of the most disheartening. The supply is in no way proportioned to the demand.\u201d\n\nWet nursing was not without complications. While modern mothers might worry about their babies getting the right nutrients, upper-class English mothers fretted that the wet nurse would transmit some moral failing or lower-class value. Mrs Beeton\u2019s Book of Household Management advised women to put up their wet nurses in their own homes, if possible, in order to monitor their behavior and ensure they conformed to Victorian codes of virtue and chastity. Not that her physical state could be ignored: According to Mrs. Beeton, families should look for a wet nurse with a \u201cclear open countenance,\u201d \u201ca natural vigor\u201d at meal times and \u201cfull, round, and elastic\u201d breasts.\n\nIt was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that wet nursing began to fall out of fashion in the Western world. In the early and middle decades of the twentieth century, mothers in newly prosperous societies found themselves with more time on their hands, some of which they chose to invest in child-rearing; they became less inclined to pass off child-related chores, including breastfeeding. Inventions like the baby bottle and commercial formula in the early 1900s also offered alternatives to women who didn\u2019t want to outsource the feeding of their babies but couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to breastfeed.\n\nIn non-Western parts of the world, however, wet-nursing continued\u2014creating distinct cultural structures and associations. In many parts of the Islamic world, where sisters and female friends traditionally nurse each other\u2019s children, unrelated babies who breastfeed from the same woman enter into a special lifelong relationship as \u201cmilk kin,\u201d and are forbidden from marrying each other. Remco Ensel, an anthropologist at the Free University in Amsterdam, observed a similar pattern in contemporary pre-Saharan Morocco.\u201cIn Morocco, like in North Africa or the Islamic world, co-lactation involves legal obligations,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cMilk children and milk mothers become \u2018related,\u2019 which implies that the incest taboo applies. In Morocco, it was used in tribal peace arrangements and in villages to cement patron-client relations.\u201d Cross-feeding can strengthen ties among friends, too; according to a Moroccan proverb, \u201cHe who has no milk, has no friend.\u201d\n\nAlma Gottlieb, a cultural anthropologist currently based at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, raised her own family among the Beng of the Ivory Coast in the 1990s\u2014where cross-nursing is as casual as baby-sitting. \u201cIt\u2019s not that every baby is breastfed by every woman,\u201d she told me over the phone. \u201cBut if the biological mother isn\u2019t around, any mother who happens to be breastfeeding will feel comfortable picking up the baby. It might be an aunt or cousin or sister, but it might happen to be someone who\u2019s not related. It's a clich\u00e9 that it takes a community to raise a child, but they take it literally.\u201d If there are no breastfeeding mothers in the vicinity, even a woman who isn\u2019t lactating can step in. \u201cAny mother who\u2019s around might just give the baby her breast: The sucking mechanism will help the baby calm down even though no milk is coming out\u2014like a pacifier.\u201d Anthropologists have observed cross-nursing in contemporary North Africa, too.\n\nWe are, of course, a long way from embracing the idea of cross-nursing. Newspapers and magazines sporadically report on a \u201crise\u201d of wet nurses in western countries, but these accounts tend to rely on a few anecdotes and seem most interested in gawking. The primary deterrent is understandable incredulity, inflected with the ick factor. A \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host can hardly keep the skepticism out of her voice as she reports on a pair of best friends who \u201cshare everything\u2014even what many people consider the most intimate act between a mother and child: breastfeeding.\u201d \u201cThe majority of moms,\u201d she hastens to add, \u201cfeel uncomfortable\u2014even repulsed\u2014by the idea.\u201d In an article on milk banks, Salon asks, \u201cIsn\u2019t asking another woman to lactate for your child kind of \u2026 weird?\u201d The Daily Mail deems it \u201cincredible\u201d that a woman who came upon her friend breastfeeding her child didn\u2019t mind \u201csuch an intrusion on the sacred bond between mother and child.\u201d Salma Hayek provoked international uproar when she breastfed a starving baby while on a humanitarian mission to Sierra Leone. In 2003, an Oklahoma woman was charged with \u201coutraging public decency\u201d for breastfeeding a crying baby without the mother\u2019s consent.\n\nAnd there are sensible reasons for the taboo, as well. Diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, herpes, and syphilis can all be transmitted through breast-feeding. Research has shown that breastfeeding can lessen a woman\u2019s risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and osteoporosis\u2014not to mention the benefit of the intense mother-child bonding that many women experience as a result of breastfeeding. Issues of class can\u2019t be ignored, either; wet nurses have traditionally come from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and hiring a wet nurse could raise issues similar to those that arise around organ donation (or purchase) or surrogacy.\n\nBut ten years ago, eating your own placenta would have been unthinkable. Twenty years ago, only a hippy would give birth at home.
