In Will\u2019s mind, all of this legislation demonstrates the \u201cbruising, untidy, utterly Democratic\u201d process of changing laws. Will explained:\n\n\u201cHow does this short-circuit the system? \u201cI hear Democrats say, \u2018The Affordable Care Act is the law,\u2019 as though we\u2019re supposed to genuflect at that sunburst of insight and move on. Well, the Fugitive Slave Act was the law, separate but equal was the law, lots of things are the law and then we change them.\u201d Will went on to say that a political party using the debt ceiling as leverage to extract concessions from the opposing party is \u201cnot novel,\u201d although he did acknowledge that the GOP\u2019s plan will likely fail. Will added, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work. A tactic is supposed to have at least an articulable path to victory and success, and I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nWell, he\u2019s right about the GOP\u2019s latest plot being doomed from the start, but he\u2019s still a racist who is dumbing it up on purpose. To compare a health care law made in the image of Republicans\u2019 love of all things private industry to what was considered at the time to be the \u201cBloodhood Law,\u201d given dogs were used to help track down runaway slaves and return them to their masters, speaks to Will\u2019s ignorance and lack of regard for Black people.\n\nAs my spirit animal, Charles Pierce, put it over at Esquire.com, \u201cMaybe we should have a civil war to make sure that an insurance-friendly Republican health-care law is not fully implemented. That Fox mind-wipe is a powerful thing.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m surprised.\n\nMind you, George Will is the same person who once wrote:\n\n\u201cThe nation, which is generally reluctant to declare a president a failure, seems especially reluctant to give up on the first African American president.\u201d\n\nYes, White guilt has done so much for Black people in this country. I mean, look at how great we\u2019ve done in this economic turmoil of the past few years. All these politicians in Washington, rushing to save us. All of the media elites, tripping over themselves to cover our plight.\n\nBack in the 1990s, Will wrote many a column chiding the likes of former Republican Vice Presidential candidate, Jack Kemp, over his initial support of affirmative action.\n\nEven a year ago, he patronized colleague Donna Brazille on ABC This Week over legitimate arguments that select Republicans were employing racial politics in their critiques of President Obama.\n\nAnd just this summer, Will claimed that Detroit\u2019s failure was not rooted in fiscal problems, but a cultural one. Of course he would rather focus on his own perverse view of Black people than the ugly realities of deindustrialization and GOP-driven economic policy.\n\nIn another ABC This Week appearance, he said:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t solve their problems because their problems are cultural. You have a city, 139 square miles, you can graze cattle in vast portions of it. Dangerous herds of feral dogs roam in there. You have three percent of fourth graders reading at the national math standards. Forty-seven percent of Detroit residents are functionally illiterate. Seventy-nine percent of Detroit children are born to unmarried mothers. They don\u2019t have a fiscal problem, Steve, they have a cultural collapse.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not so great at breaking down policy, but he\u2019s certainly adept at peddling racism porn to like-minded bigots. Indeed, with \u201canalysis\u201d like this it\u2019s no wonder why FOX News has offered George Will a contract. Who better to appeal to the prejudices and paranoia of crotchety, old White men than one himself?\n\nMichael Arceneaux is a Houston-bred, Howard-educated writer.
