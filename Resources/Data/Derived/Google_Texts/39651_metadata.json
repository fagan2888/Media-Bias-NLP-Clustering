The SUV had both front doors open. The RTD bus was also part of the crime scene, its interior lights on and a \u201cnot in service\u201d message displayed.\n\nPolice took several witness to the shooting downtown to be questioned, Jackson said. They also expanded the crime scene after a disturbance broke out at the Shell gas station nearby.\n\nDenver Police tweeted Sunday that the investigation is continuing. No arrests have been made, and police released no suspect information.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver police investigate fatal shooting near Montbello park-n-Ride", "title": "Denver police investigate fatal shooting near Montbello park-n-Ride", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/denver-police-investigate-fatal-shooting-near-montbello-park-n-ride/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__shootingp1-1.jpg", "height": 413}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__shootingp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T18:14:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:53:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver Police are investigating after a man was shot and killed Saturday in a shopping center parking lot near the Montbello park-n-Ride, 12300 Albrook Drive.\nPolice spokesman Sonny Jackson said an alteration between two groups broke out on the south end of the shopping center and moved north toward the RTD park-n-Ride.\nNate Currey, RTD spokesman, said a 25-year-old man got off an RTD bus at the park-n-Ride and was shot about 20 feet from the bus around 5:30 p.m.\nThe RTD bus was also part of the crime scene, its interior lights on and a \u201cnot in service\u201d message displayed.\nIsaac Freyta, who was working the drive-thru window at the Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard in the shopping center, said he heard four shots through the drive-thru speaker."}
