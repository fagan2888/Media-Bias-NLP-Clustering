For months, the University of Chicago professor has recorded interviews with fellow wonks for HealthInsurance.org. In 2012, he recorded two short \u201csuper-PAC ads\u201d that explained the benefits of social insurance, and the ways they can save the lives of people who find themselves unexpectedly burdened.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Z4-EGUif_N0\n\nThese videos weren't ignored, exactly\u2014but finally, Pollack is starring in a hit. Yesterday afternoon, conservative reporter/blogger Keith Koffler \u201cuncovered\u201d a short clip of Pollack talking to Jonathan Gruber about Medicaid.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s really striking to me is, there\u2019s a politics of impunity towards poor people, particularly non-white poor people that\u2014it\u2019s almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states, not to cover people under Medicaid even if it\u2019s financially very advantageous to do so,\u201d said Pollack in the video, as Gruber nodded.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not just not interested in covering poor people, they\u2019re willing to sacrifice billions of dollars in injections into their economy in order to punish poor people,\u201d said Gruber. \u201cI mean, it really is just almost awesome in its evilness.\u201d\n\nTo Koffler, this was prima facie offensive. \u201cStates say they have done so not to hurt poor people\u2014or minorities, for that matter\u2014but because they view Medicaid as a failed program,\u201d he wrote. At the Daily Mail, this became a video of \u201cObamacare architect Jonathan Gruber agreeing that states' opposition to massive Medicaid expansion may be race-related.\u201d At the Daily Caller, the \u201cawesome in its evilness\u201d quote was the lede.\n\nPollack finds the whole story, and the discovery of what he calls \u201cmy ZaGruber tape,\u201d baffling.\n\n\u201cI have this interview show in which I interview policy wonks, some of whom, like Avik Roy, are conservative,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a little insulting to say that my videos have been uncovered. From my point of view, I\u2019m trying to publicize them. And this particular clip was cited by Paul Krugman!\u201d\n\nIndeed it was. Back in April, when the video was fresh and Gruber was not yet appearing on a thousand wanted posters, Paul Krugman cited the \u201cawesome in its evilness\u201d line in his print New York Times column. (Krugman added that Gruber was \u201cnormally a very mild-mannered guy.\u201d) That was the coverage Pollack was hoping for; less so the cameo in a rolling scandal.\n\n\u201cI must say I could do without some of the anti-semitic hate mail that\u2019s coming in,\u201d said Pollack. \u201cI feel really bad for Jon Gruber, who\u2019s the subject of this Internet gang-tackle. People are putting awful comments on healthinsurance.org, and it takes about six seconds for the 'Jew' stuff to come up. I just wish I didn't look so dorky.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pollack, none of the new spelunkers of his video have talked to him. \u201cNo one's asked if I had any evidence to make the claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no actual reporting going on.\u201d But when I asked if he thought race was one factor leading states to deny expansion, he stuck to his argument.\n\n\u201cLook, race is not the only factor in the politics of Medicaid, and my real comment was not about race,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about the politics of impunity. It\u2019s considered an actively positive thing that to withhold a benefit from poor person, and the impact of these policies on poor people on states and counties is pretty devastating. That said, around 80 percent of the adults who've been shut out of the Medicaid expansion live in the Southeast, and 43 percent live in just Florida, Georgia, and Texas. It is entirely correct to say politics of race has played a role in politics in America.\u201d\n\nPollack was happy to have the debate, and until this week, it was a perfectly normal thing for progressive wonks to do. Yet absent Grubergate the wonks might be talking about Obamacare's second annual enrollment period.\n\n\u201cThe actual experience of health reform right now is pretty important for most people,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cThose are the stories I'd like to see uncovered. Is it changing lives? What are the experiences of people under health care reform? Every second we spend arguing about Grubergate is a second that\u2019s wasted.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly quoted Harold Pollack discussing Medicaid and geography in the eleventh paragraph.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "A professor has a conversation with Jonathan Gruber.
