These changes follow departures by two finance directors earlier this year.\n\nThe California Attorney General \u2014 who has close ties to President Obama \u2014remains the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer Barbara BoxerTrump and Sanders whip up debate buzz Boxer: Sanders appeals to young voters with grandpa effect The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Calif.) and win election to the Senate, but the problems are leading to calls for additional changes.\n\nCritics point to Harris\u2019s own personality as the reason for some of the problems.\n\n\u201cShe's perceived as very, very difficult to work for,\u201d one strategist familiar with the campaign told The Hill. \u201cShe doesn't have real relationships and partnerships. She has acquaintances.\u201d\n\nThe fundraising numbers point to the problem, the strategist said.\n\n\u201cHere she is, she's running for Senate, as an African American woman, she should be raising gobs of money,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe fact that she's raising one and a half to 2 million a quarter, is absurd.\n\n\u201cShe expects fundraisers who helped Obama to help her\u2026She gets upset when donors don't flock to her, it drives her crazy that she actually has to meet and talk with people,\u201d the source added.\n\nA spokesman for Harris\u2019s campaign dismissed much of the criticism, saying Harris is a strong fundraiser and that the changes she has made will help her.\n\n\u201cLike every campaign, we\u2019re making adjustments in alignment with our strategy to win,\u201d spokesman Nathan Click said.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has proven herself to be one of the strongest fundraisers in the country this election cycle and our campaign is going to have the resources to win in June and November,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are making some additional reductions to our consultants and staff to put our campaign in the strongest position to win.\u201d\n\nSince announcing her bid for the Senate in January, Harris has raised $5.9 million and spent $2.6 million, at a relatively high burn rate of 44 percent. In the most recent fundraising quarter, Harris raised $1.7 million and spent $1.4 million at an even higher burn rate of 82 percent, according to Federal Elections Commission filings.\n\nHer main rival, Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.), has a burn rate of just 25 percent, but is raising significantly less money.\n\nShe has taken $1 million from contributors since announcing in May, and has also loaned her campaign $300,000 and transferred $500,000 from her House account. Sanchez has spent just $250,000 to date.\n\nHarris has been spending at roughly double the rate of other Democrats running in safe seats such as Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Ron Wyden (R-Ore.), the Sacramento Bee pointed out in an analysis of Harris' spending.\n\n\u201cIt does raise some eyebrows,\u201d Roy Behr, a California-based Democratic consultant who has worked for Boxer, said of Harris\u2019s spending.\n\n\u201cHaving said that\u2026 none of this really matters because in the end she\u2019s virtually unbeatable,\u201d Behr said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in the race who poses a threat to her.\u201d\n\nThough she\u2019s the favorite, Harris will still need more than her $3.3 million on hand to win.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s expensive media market means advertising comes at a high cost, which will force Harris to significantly increase her cash.\n\nOne unaffiliated Democratic strategist said the attorney general is carrying \u201ca lot of consultant overhead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of other overhead there for consultants that\u2026 in a traditional model aren\u2019t getting paid in an off year and have no reason to get paid in an off year,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nThe strategist pointed in particular to the $85,000 in \u201ccampaign consulting\u201d fees given to SCN Strategies, whose partner Ace Smith is a veteran of California politics and an adviser to Harris.\n\nYet some think Harris needs the help.\n\nAsked if Harris should be paying people like Smith as consultants, another high-profile California operative surmised: \u201cYeah, because I don't think she has very good political instincts. That's been the rap on her since she started running. So she has to go for the big guns.\u201d\n\nThis source also said Harris needs to talk more about what she\u2019d do as Boxer\u2019s successor to win over support in her state.\n\n\u201cShe needs to show a little leg in terms of what she'd do in the Senate,\u201d the operative said. \u201cI mean, she's been giving her AG stump speech.\u201d\n\nBill Brandt, a veteran Democratic bundler believes Harris has done the right thing by overhauling her staff at a relatively early stage in the campaign.\n\n\u201cOne thing I give Kamala credit for is you have got to constantly re-evaluate your campaign,\u201d said Brandt, who has done political fundraising for more than 30 years and is a longtime friend of former President Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe also said there\u2019s a learning curve to running for the Senate, compared to seeking other statewide offices in California.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is an enormous state\u2026 What inevitably happens is that people who have run for statewide office have amassed a good team to get there, but when you go up to the Senate level\u2026 [the leap is] like running for president.\u201d\n\nDan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, said there is \"no question\" that a shuffling this early is indicative of a larger problem but he said it is early enough in the campaign for the change to have its desired impact.\n\n\u201cIf fundraising picks up and spending falls down then they made the necessary change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, then there's bigger problems to deal with.\u201d\n\nSchnur and other strategists say Harris might be facing a more fundamental fundraising problem: Inertia.\n\n\u201cIt may not be that easy to motivate Democratic donors to give heavily in a Senate race that looks like an easy Democratic safe seat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNone of the Republicans have emerged yet as a serious threat.\n\n\u201cIf you're a Democratic donor its hard to get all excited about which Democratic woman will replace the current Democratic woman in the Senate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Critics point to Harris\u2019s own personality as the reason for some of the problems.", "description": "Critics point to Harris\u2019s own personality as the reason for some of the problems.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Critics point to Harris\u2019s own personality as the reason for some of the problems.", "title": "Eyebrows rise in Calif. as Kamala Harris makes changes to staff", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/260946-eyebrows-rise-in-california-as-kamala-harris-makes-changes-to", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/kamalaharris_030315gn3.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-21T15:46:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-11-21T15:46-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/260946-eyebrows-rise-in-california-as-kamala-harris-makes-changes-to", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-21T15:46-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "author": "Amie Parnes and Jonathan Swan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Kamela Harris, Barbara Boxer, Loretta Sanchez,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T15:46:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-21T15:46:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/260946-eyebrows-rise-in-california-as-kamala-harris-makes-changes-to", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Critics point to Harris\u2019s own personality as the reason for some of the problems.", "card": "summary", "title": "Eyebrows rise in Calif. as Kamala Harris makes changes to staff"}, "dcterms.title": "Eyebrows rise in Calif. as Kamala Harris makes changes to staff"}, "article_summary": "Turmoil and lackluster funding in California Attorney General Kamala Harris\u2019s Senate campaign has some Democratic operatives wondering what\u2019s gone wrong.\n\u201cHere she is, she's running for Senate, as an African American woman, she should be raising gobs of money,\u201d the source said.\nHarris this week replaced campaign manager Rory Steele with Juan Rodriguez, who was serving as the campaign's senior adviser.\n\u201cShe's perceived as very, very difficult to work for,\u201d one strategist familiar with the campaign told The Hill.\nHarris has been spending at roughly double the rate of other Democrats running in safe seats such as Chris Van Hollen (D-Md."}
