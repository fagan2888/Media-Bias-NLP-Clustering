Producer Oprah Winfrey and stars of the movie "Selma" will march in the famed Alabama city on Sunday to honor the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.

Paramount Pictures Corp. says the march also will include "Selma" director Ava DuVernay and actor David Oyelowo, who portrays King in the movie.

The event will commemorate King's civil rights leadership and his involvement in the Selma voting rights protests of 1965.

The demonstrations are the subject of the film, which is among the nominees for best picture at the Academy Awards.

The lone black member of Alabama's congressional delegation, Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell, will moderate a panel discussion at Selma High School during the daylong event.

Paramount is holding two free screenings of the movie in Selma on Monday for the King holiday.
