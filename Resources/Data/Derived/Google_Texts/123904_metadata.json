He avoided registering by working as a consultant for clients, a practice that has garnered criticism, with some dubbing it \"the Daschle loophole.\"\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the number of registered lobbyists has fallen, with Washington advocates avoiding the direct contacts and time thresholds that would require one to register as a lobbyist.\n\nLast year, Daschle made news by registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to work on behalf of foreign clients.\n\nSo far, the Daschle Group has signed the government of Japan, to help with negotiation on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal; the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, the de facto embassy of the Republic of China (Taiwan); and a Macedonian political party, the VMRO DPMNE.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The former senator, who had avoided registering for a decade, will be lobbying for Aetna.", "description": "The former senator, who had avoided registering for a decade, will be lobbying for Aetna.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
