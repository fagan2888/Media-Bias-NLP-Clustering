The appointment, which will take effect later this year, was announced a week after Partners\u2019 expansion strategy was thrown back to square one thanks to a court\u2019s rejection of a years-long plan to acquire suburban hospitals in tandem with state-mediated reimbursement reforms.\n\n\u201cDr. Torchiana possesses the instincts and the political savvy to be an outstanding leader for Partners,\u201d said Edward Lawrence, chairman of the Partners HealthCare board and a retired partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray. \u201cHe has an appreciation for each institution within the Partners HealthCare system and all the remarkable people who dedicate themselves to the mission.\u201d\n\n[Also: Court blocks Partners settlement, killing merger]\n\nTorchiana is a Harvard Medical School-trained cardiothoracic surgeon and the current chairman and CEO of the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization, the 2,300-plus physician network of Partners\u2019 founding hospital.\n\nAlso known by the nickname \u201cTorch,\u201d he completed a residency at Massachusetts General and in 1989 joined the hospital\u2019s surgery department. In 1998, four years after Partners was founded through the merger of Mass General and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Torchiana became the hospital\u2019s chief of cardiac surgery. In 2003 was named to the CEO of the physicians organization.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nUnder Torchiana, in 2006, Mass General launched one of six Medicare-backed care management pilots for high-risk seniors. That program, relying on a team of caregivers managed by a primary care physician, became \u201cthe cornerstone of Partners population health management initiative,\u201d the organization said.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to my new role at Partners HealthCare as its next president and CEO,\u201d Torchiano said.\n\nGottlieb, a psychiatrist and Harvard Medical School professor, became Partners CEO in 2010 and oversaw a range of clinical and institutional achievements, including an enterprise-wide electronic health record, whole genome sequencing and the Partners Biobank.\n\nHis tenure was also marked by a fierce local debate about Partners\u2019 reimbursement advantages. The system came under state investigation at the same that it was trying to acquire the South Shore hospital in Weymouth, the two hospital Hallmark Health System north of Boston and Emerson Hospital in Concord.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nLast year, then attorney general Martha Coakley approved the acquisitions on the condition that Partners keep prices indexed to inflation for six years and cap the size of its physicians groups for five years. Rival health systems such as Beth Israel Deaconess and Tufts Medical Center opposed the agreement, however, and so did the new attorney general, Maura Healey. In early February, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders rejected the agreement on the grounds that it was not in the public interest.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/partners-healthcare-names-new-ceo-after-merger-fails", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Brigham-and-Women%27s-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Cardiac surgeon David Torchiana tapped to replace outgoing leader Gary Gottlieb.", "title": "Partners HealthCare names new CEO after merger fails"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Brigham-and-Women%27s-feature.gif"}, "description": "Cardiac surgeon David Torchiana tapped to replace outgoing leader Gary Gottlieb.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Partners HealthCare names new CEO after merger fails"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Still reeling from failed acquisitions and criticism from regulators, Partners HealthCare, has tapped a cardiac surgeon as new CEO.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Still reeling from failed acquisitions and criticism from regulators, Partners HealthCare, has tapped a cardiac surgeon as new CEO.\n\u201cI am looking forward to my new role at Partners HealthCare as its next president and CEO,\u201d Torchiano said.\nThe board of Boston\u2019s Partners HealthCare has named David Torchiana, MD, as the next president and CEO to replace outgoing leader Gary Gottlieb, MD.\nTorchiana possesses the instincts and the political savvy to be an outstanding leader for Partners,\u201d said Edward Lawrence, chairman of the Partners HealthCare board and a retired partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray.\nIn 1998, four years after Partners was founded through the merger of Mass General and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Torchiana became the hospital\u2019s chief of cardiac surgery."}
