But she said it seemed inappropriate to raise salaries \u201cwhen part of the goal of the Affordable Care Act was to decrease costs to the system.\u201d\n\nIn recommending the raise, board chair Margaret Stanley cited pay equity as a consideration.\n\nShe said the board hired an outside consultant to find out how Onizuka\u2019s salary compared with the salaries of CEOs at the other state-based insurance exchanges.\n\nThe results of the analysis were not immediately available to the public.\n\nBut Stanley said the pay increase would bring Onizuka\u2019s salary more in line with the salaries of the other CEOs.\n\nAccording to media reports, the CEO of Oregon\u2019s exchange, which still does not have a functioning website, makes $181,000 annually. Idaho\u2019s exchange CEO earns $175,000.\n\nThe board sets executive compensation for the exchange, which is a public-private partnership separate from the state.\n\nThe pay increase came up during the board\u2019s monthly meeting at a SeaTac hotel.\n\nAfter the meeting, Onizuka said the raise was a reflection of the work of the entire staff at the exchange, which has more than 100 salaried employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel very humbled and honored to be able to do this.\u201d\n\nBoard members praised the performance of Washington\u2019s exchange to date, especially compared with other exchanges that have run into more serious problems.\n\nFor now, the exchanges are funded by federal money. Washington\u2019s exchange is on track to spend a total of more than $85 million through the end of 2013, according to Chief Financial Officer Bob Nakahara, who presented budget figures at the board meeting.\n\nThe projected budget for 2014 is about $65 million, Nakahara said. But the exchange recently submitted a request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for an additional $92 million to be spent on technological enhancements and other improvements in 2014.\n\nStarting in 2015, Washington \u2013 like the other state-based exchanges \u2013 will have to be financially self-sustaining.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "The board of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange raised\u00a0the salary of exchange CEO Richard Onizuka by 13 percent. \u00a0 The increase will boost Onizuka\u2019s annual salary from $157,000 to $177,400, retroactive to August. \u00a0 All of the board members in attendance\u00a0voted in favor of the pay raise except one. \u00a0 Teresa Mosqeda, legislative and policy director for the Washington State Labor...", "t_omni_contenttitle": "Exchange board votes to raise CEO\u2019s salary - uncategorized - HealthCare Checkup", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "The board of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange raised\u00a0the salary of exchange CEO Richard Onizuka by 13 percent. \u00a0 The increase will boost Onizuka\u2019s annual salary from $157,000 to $177,400, retroactive to August. \u00a0 All of the board members in attendance\u00a0voted in favor of the pay raise except one. \u00a0 Teresa Mosqeda, legislative and policy director for the Washington State Labor...", "title": "Exchange board votes to raise CEO\u2019s salary", "url": "http://blogs.seattletimes.com/healthcarecheckup/2013/11/20/exchange-board-votes-to-raise-ceos-salary/", "image": "http://seattletimes.com/art/ui/fb_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "t_omni_site": "st", "twitter": {"url": "http://blogs.seattletimes.com/healthcarecheckup/2013/11/20/exchange-board-votes-to-raise-ceos-salary/", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Exchange board votes to raise CEO\u2019s salary"}, "t_omni_pagename": "st|health|healthcarecheckup", "fb": {"app_id": 225286600856790}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=.78", "t_omni_pubdate": "11/20/2013 06:35", "t_omni_author": "Amy Snow Landa", "t_omni_articleid": "exchange-board-votes-to-raise-ceos-salary", "bitly-verification": "fcb5c28d2fff", "t_omni_pagetype": "article"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda32b\"", "article_summary": "November 20, 2013 at 6:35 PMThe board of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange raised the salary of exchange CEO Richard Onizuka by 13 percent.\nAll of the board members in attendance voted in favor of the pay raise except one.\nBut Stanley said the pay increase would bring Onizuka\u2019s salary more in line with the salaries of the other CEOs.\nShe said the board hired an outside consultant to find out how Onizuka\u2019s salary compared with the salaries of CEOs at the other state-based insurance exchanges.\nIdaho\u2019s exchange CEO earns $175,000."}
