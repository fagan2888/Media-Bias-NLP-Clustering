If the payer overpays, or pays incorrectly, waiting for a retroactive refund can take longer than hoped.\n\nPayers and providers save the most money through electronic billing and auto-adjudication, a system which involves no human touch. At least half of claims are processed this way, he said.\n\n\"The biggest cost on the provider and payer side is labor,\" Hallowell said. \"Nirvana is to get to the least amount of money spent to do the process. As soon as you hit the first error, is when costs start building up.\"\n\nBill Heitman, founder and managing director of consulting firm The Lab, works with insurers and other companies to weed out inefficiencies that can hinder the processing of a clean claim.\n\n\"New technology alone will not improve productivity until inefficient, dysfunctional, routine administrative processes are streamlined,\" Heitman said. \"It boils down to understanding what's going on from front to back.\"\n\nThe Lab in Houston implements non-technology business improvements of the kind first introduced more than 100 years ago by Henry Ford in assembly line production.\n\nWhen Heitman analyzes companies, he often finds productively is bogged down by what he calls \"virtuous waste.\" This is loosely defined as processes continuing to be done the way they've always been done, even if it means someone must correct the same mistakes over and over again.\n\nAccumulated, the small repetitive tasks can churn up 20 to 30 percent of a day, he said.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\"What we're working on is the long tail of improvements, hundreds of small improvements that never make it to the flip chart because they're too inconsequential,\" Heitman said.\n\nUp to 60 and 70 percent of provider submitted claims have incomplete or incorrect data, Heitman said. Errors include missing ID numbers, numbers that don't match or names that don't match.\n\n\"Out of 100 plans, those with high error rates are usually not distributed equally,\" Heitman said. \"We'll find usually the offenders are concentrated. The same people, the same plans are responsible for a disproportionate percent of the errors. You can knock out 60 to 70 percent of errors by concentrating on the violators. It's in everybody's interest to get it once and done.\"\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/if-only-claims-were-clean-payers-providers-lose-big-inaccuracies-poor-workflows", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/docclaimfeat.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Errors in insurance claims are costing the healthcare industry billions in wasteful spending, and both the payers and the providers are at fault, experts say.", "title": "If only the claims were clean: Payers, providers lose big on inaccuracies, poor workflows"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/docclaimfeat.png"}, "description": "Errors in insurance claims are costing the healthcare industry billions in wasteful spending, and both the payers and the providers are at fault, experts say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "If only the claims were clean: Payers, providers lose big on inaccuracies, poor workflows"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Errors in insurance claims are costing the healthcare industry billions in wasteful spending, and both the payers and the providers are at fault, experts say.&#13; \"What the payer wants from the provider is a clean claim,\" said Bruce Hallowell, managing director in the healthcare practice at Navigant Consulting. \"If I submit a clean claim, I'll get paid in five days.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "[Also: CMS proposes sharing claims data with providers, employers to improve care]According to Hallowell, accuracy depends on clean claims, but the problem is the definition of a clean claim can be fuzzy.\n\"If I submit a clean claim, I'll get paid in five days.\"\n\"What the payer wants from the provider is a clean claim,\" said Bruce Hallowell, managing director in the healthcare practice at Navigant Consulting.\nThe best recommendation is for payers to communicate what they need so that providers can get paid right away.\nErrors in insurance claims are costing the healthcare industry billions in wasteful spending, and both the payers and the providers are at fault, experts say."}
