Laurel is mousy and muddled; in her early twenties, she\u2019s still living at home with her widowed father, going nowhere. Audrey \u2013 the pretty one \u2013 has moved out into the world; she has a cool job, a boyfriend \u2013 everything Laurel wishes she could have, but suspects she never will. Out driving around during a brief reunion, the girls collide with a truck. Audrey is killed, and Laurel comes to not knowing at first who she is. Her grieving dad thinks she\u2019s Audrey \u2013 that it was Laurel who was killed. Laurel soon realizes that\u2019s not the case. But she has always envied her sister\u2019s life; now, if she wants, she can have it.\n\nThe Pretty One is a first feature by writer-director Jen\u00e9e LaMarque. The movie is a lot of fun in parts, but it\u2019s subverted by lazy plotting and narrative tones that clash like soup-pot cymbals. Fortunately, it also has Zoe Kazan, playing both Laurel and Audrey. And as anyone who saw her at full glow in Ruby Sparks might guess, Kazan is enough to make the movie worth seeing.\n\nHaving one actor play a pair of twins is basically a stunt, and LaMarque brings it off with seamless digital ministrations. The real wonder, though, is the way Kazan manages to create two separate characters almost entirely through gesture and bearing and carefully calibrated details of personality. (The scene in which we see Laurel and Audrey laughing and bantering in the front seat of a pickup is a small triumph of artistic concentration.)\n\nWe meet Laurel first. She\u2019s pathetic, drifting around her childhood country home in her dead mother\u2019s dresses while tending to her mopey dad (John Carroll Lynch), an entirely implausible character who occupies himself painting copies of famous masterworks (the Mona Lisa, and so forth). \u201cYou\u2019re like his wife,\u201d says Audrey, popping in for a birthday visit. Audrey has brought some strained foreshadowing with her. She treats Laurel to a salon makeover (she opts for a haircut just like Audrey\u2019s, naturally), and is about to take Laurel with her back to the big city (Los Angeles, apparently) when the fatal crash occurs. It is entirely unbelievable that everyone should decide that the living Laurel must be the dead Audrey, but they do. Attending her own funeral, Laurel is crushed to realize that no one has a fond word to say about her. So she takes the plunge, packs up and moves to LA.\n\nNobody at the real-estate agency where Audrey worked registers any doubts when Laurel turns up to take her place. She\u2019s pretty bad at showing houses to prospective buyers, but she quickly gets better, as we know she must. She also gets to meet Audrey\u2019s boyfriend, Charles (Ron Livingston), a beardy smarm-bag who is also\u2014Audrey never mentioned this\u2014married. This situation might have been fine with Audrey. But Laurel\u2014as even Charles inexplicably fails to realize\u2014is not Audrey.\n\nThe movie comes most alive after Laurel moves into her sister\u2019s apartment and makes the acquaintance of her next-door neighbor, Basel, who\u2019s played\u2014with radiant, low-key charm\u2014by Jake Johnson, of New Girl. The ambitious Audrey had no time for Basel\u2014she called him a \u201ccreepy man-child,\u201d and we can understand how his aimless amiability might have rubbed her the wrong way. But he\u2019s just right for Laurel\u2014and Kazan and Johnson vibrate on the same sweet wavelength as their characters are drawn together toward the happy ending that\u2019s inscribed in the story\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe movie has a considerable amount of heart, however overplayed, and it\u2019s shiny and clever and, Lord knows, lovable. If only it had been more tightly conceived. Launching a whimsical tale like this with a violent death feels off, and Laurel\u2019s stay-at-home relationship with her strange dad is borderline creepy. The byplay with married boyfriend Charles exists to serve a single plot point, and another story element\u2014a support group for \u201cTwins without Twins\u201d\u2014goes limp the moment it appears. But Kazan, with her googly eyes and carefully shaded reactions, can sell us on almost anything\u2014even the plausibility of reacting to a life crisis with a cry of, \u201cWe need to get some ice cream!\u201d She makes you want to believe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Zoe Kazan shines again in a case of mistaken identity.", "title": "The Pretty One", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/14/the-pretty-one", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13923265783499.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Laurel and Audrey are identical twins, but they\ncouldn\u2019t be less alike.
