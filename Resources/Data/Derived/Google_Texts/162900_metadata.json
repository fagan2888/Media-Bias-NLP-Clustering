Winkler granted a preliminary injunction forbidding UFCW organizers and supporters not employed by Walmart from \u201centering onto Walmart\u2019s private property in the State of Ohio\u201d to engage in any of a long list of common union activities.\n\nWinkler\u2019s order limited the ability of union agitators to disrupt Walmart\u2019s business on Black Friday. UFCW International headquarters in Washington, D.C., and UFCW Local 75 in Dayton proudly admit coordinated Black Friday protests are meant to hit the retailer on \u201cthe biggest shopping day of the year.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest employers in the United States, Walmart is a huge target for UFCW unionization. Although UFCW bosses in D.C. are paid more than $300,000 and take mandatory dues in Ohio and other forced-unionism states, Walmart workers and customers have been subjected to the union\u2019s pseudo-populism for years.\n\nUFCW Local 75, which represents workers in retail sales and other entry-level jobs in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, had 29,925 members as of Dec. 31, 2013. UFCW Local 75 secretary treasurer Steve Culter was paid $355,400 in 2013, while union president Lennie Wyatt was paid $328,116.\n\nThe Ohio injunction against the union specifically forbids \u201cpicketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, chanting, \u2018flash mobs,\u2019 handbilling, solicitation, customer disruptions, manager delegations or confrontations, or associate engagement for a non-shopping purpose.\u201d\n\nUFCW and its allies are also forbidden from \u201cinterfering with, obstructing, or blocking\u201d Walmart entrances, and from \u201cengaging in any nuisance conduct off Walmart\u2019s private property which disrupts and/or interferes with Walmart customers\u2019 or associates\u2019 access to, or ability to move around on or exit\u201d Walmart property.\n\nUnion organizers who are not Walmart employees \u201cunlawfully trespassed onto and into Walmart\u2019s private property and stores across Ohio\u201d and \u201chave continued to trespass onto Walmart\u2019s private property and conduct demonstrations on Walmart\u2019s private property\u201d after being told to stop, Winkler wrote on Nov. 24.\n\nWinkler found that UFCW\u2019s \u201cunauthorized entries onto Walmart\u2019s private property throughout the State of Ohio are likely to continue in the future and a substantial and irreparable injury to Walmart and its property would be unavoidable\u201d in the absence of a restraining order.\n\nAt Thanksgiving and throughout the year, UFCW organizing campaign Making Change at Walmart works with UFCW front group Organization United for Respect at Walmart to demand full-time hours and $15 per hour starting pay for all Walmart workers as a pretext for unionizing. Ohio\u2019s legacy media reporters seem happy to help.\n\nIn a Friday Cincinnati Enquirer story about an OUR Walmart protest, reporter Henry Molski failed to identify OUR Walmart as an arm of UFCW and noted only in passing that the protest in the Cincinnati suburb of Evendale violated a court order.\n\n\u201cThe OUR Walmart protests were also met with the approval of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO),\u201d Molski wrote. UFCW is an AFL-CIO affiliate \u2014 something Molski didn\u2019t acknowledge because he didn\u2019t mention UFCW at all.\n\nA Friday Cleveland Plain Dealer story on similar protests gave the false impression of broad support for UFCW-operated Making Change at Walmart by describing it as \u201ca campaign that includes the United Food & Commercial Workers.\u201d Reporter Olivera Perkins made the same error in her Nov. 20 story about a study paid for by UFCW.\n\nUFCW Local 75, in addition to demanding $15 hourly pay and full-time hours for Walmart workers, supports amnesty for illegal immigrants and opposes right-to-work laws, which allow workers to opt out of paying union bosses without being fired.\n\nIn an attempt to bolster support for its political agenda, UFCW Local 75 warns members \u201ccorporations and the super-rich\u201d are spending big \u201cto create an even more unbalanced economy where the rich get richer, the powerful stay in power, and working people have no mechanism to fight back.\u201d\n\nUFCW Local 75 didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the conflict between union politics and union officer pay. No further hearings have been scheduled on Walmart\u2019s complaint in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Cincinnati judge blocked UFCW from demonstrating in Walmart's Ohio stores last week, hampering the organizing efforts of wealthy union bosses.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A Cincinnati judge blocked UFCW from demonstrating in Walmart's Ohio stores last week, hampering the organizing efforts of wealthy union bosses.", "title": "Walmart gets Ohio court order restraining union front groups - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/ourwalmart-logo-300px.gif", "updated_time": "2014-12-04T09:15:58+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/185295/walmart-restraining-order/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A Cincinnati judge blocked UFCW from demonstrating in Walmart's Ohio stores last week, hampering the organizing efforts of wealthy union bosses.", "title": "Walmart gets Ohio court order restraining union front groups - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/12/ourwalmart-logo-300px.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2014-12-02T08:49:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T09:15:58+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "UFCW, United Food and Commercial Workers, Big Labor, forced unionism, Black Friday, OUR Walmart, Making Change at Walmart, Organization United for Respect at Walmart"}, "article_summary": "UFCW Local 75 secretary treasurer Steve Culter was paid $355,400 in 2013, while union president Lennie Wyatt was paid $328,116.\nBy Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogA Cincinnati judge blocked United Food & Commercial Workers from demonstrating in Walmart\u2019s Ohio stores last week, hampering the organizing efforts of wealthy union bosses.\nUnion organizers who are not Walmart employees \u201cunlawfully trespassed onto and into Walmart\u2019s private property and stores across Ohio\u201d and \u201chave continued to trespass onto Walmart\u2019s private property and conduct demonstrations on Walmart\u2019s private property\u201d after being told to stop, Winkler wrote on Nov. 24.\nUFCW Local 75, which represents workers in retail sales and other entry-level jobs in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, had 29,925 members as of Dec. 31, 2013.\nWinkler\u2019s order limited the ability of union agitators to disrupt Walmart\u2019s business on Black Friday."}
