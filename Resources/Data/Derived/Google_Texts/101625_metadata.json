I grew up going there,\u201d Story said. \u201cIt\u2019s familiar and comfortable. I\u2019d go there a lot with my family. I\u2019d go there with my grandpa a lot before he died. He was a big part of my life. And I think they have good food. The queso is my favorite.\u201d\n\nBaseball falls into an easy routine. Every game follows the same convention. Everyone bats in order. Players rely on normal. And occasionally, the ordinary swivels into extraordinary. Justin Morneau ate the same Jimmy John\u2019s turkey sandwich before every home game in his 2007 MVP season in Minnesota.\n\nStory, the Rockies\u2019 23-year-old rookie shortstop, set home run records through his first two weeks in the big leagues before he even unpacked the boxes of his new life in Denver. He\u2019s still living in a hotel. But a queso dip is never too far away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy life to live, on the road all the time,\u201d Story said. \u201cEverything is routine with baseball, even outside life. It\u2019s good to stick with it.\u201d\n\nLegendary way for Trevor Story to start\n\nStory\u2019s seven home runs through his first six major-league games broke the record of six held by Willie Mays, Mike Schmidt and Larry Walker. \u201cThat\u2019s something that legends do,\u201d Rockies right fielder Carlos Gonzalez said.\n\nThe previous 24 players who hit five or more home runs in the first six games of a season averaged 35 homers by season\u2019s end, according to ESPN, led by Luis Gonzalez\u2019s 57 in 2001. Story, a 2011 first-round draft pick, is now the talk of the town in Denver. Storefront signs dot downtown with his projected home run totals.\n\n\u201cThe attention that Trevor Story is getting not only has gone national, it probably crosses solar systems,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said last week. \u201cIf (there\u2019s life) out there, they\u2019re talking about Trevor Story.\u201d\n\nBut in horn-rimmed glasses and a hat, Story still goes unnoticed eating breakfast around town. \u201cI feel in control,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting used to the big leagues is different. It\u2019ll take a little bit. But it hasn\u2019t sped up on me. I feel good about how I\u2019m handling it.\u201d\n\nThe ballpark always brings him back to normal. An echo from the batting cage before Rockies home games sounds eerily familiar.\n\n\u201cYou hear the difference,\u201d Colorado hitting coach Blake Doyle said.\n\nThe pop of the ball off his bat sounds a whole lot like that of the man he replaced at shortstop, Troy Tulowitzki. Fans can see it, too, during games. The white, velcro batting gloves and that deep breath while he stares at his bat before he steps to the plate mimic Tulo. That\u2019s Story now.\n\nIt\u2019s not the end of the comparison. Story worked out two winters ago with the Rockies\u2019 former shortstop at \u201cCamp Tulo\u201d near Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cHe really gets into his legs well,\u201d Doyle said of Story\u2019s swing. Tulowitzki was the same way. Their plate approach starts out tall and upright. But they both crouch down as the ball nears the plate and swing up through the ball.\n\nThat\u2019s led Story to a 64 percent flyball rate, right around Bryce Harper\u2019s 62.5 percent. Story, strong through the shoulders and powerful in the legs, has so far turned those flyballs into home runs.\n\n\u201cI use the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s shown he can rebound from a tough game too. San Francisco\u2019s Jeff Samardzija struck him out three times with a 96 mph cutting fastball outside the zone last week. But Story rebounded the next night with two triples to the opposite field in right-center that would have been home runs a year ago if not for the new fence installed at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too overanalyzing. He had a good night. I have to tip my cap to him,\u201d Story said of Samardzija. \u201cI just try to hit the ball hard, and if it gets in the air and it goes out, that\u2019s awesome. But I hope they don\u2019t think I\u2019ll hit one out every time. That\u2019s not very realistic.\u201d\n\nToo many strikeouts\n\nStory\u2019s rocket-like rise has had its hitches. In 48 at-bats through 11 games, he has 20 strikeouts and just two walks. But even after a five-game homerless skid, Story still has a .292 average and leads the major leagues with seven home runs, which entering Saturday was two better than Seattle\u2019s Robinson Cano, Toronto\u2019s Josh Donaldson and Baltimore\u2019s Mark Trumbo. And through Friday, he trailed only teammate Nolan Arenado in RBIs, 14-13.\n\nThat\u2019s how far Story jumped in a whiplash start. But he\u2019s not the first Rockies player to sprint from the gate. Charlie Blackmon went 6-for-6 in the Rockies\u2019 home-opener in 2014 and was hitting .402 on April 27. Blackmon said it would be better to yield on expectations.\n\n\u201cThe game is way more fun when you\u2019re doing really, really well,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cBut in terms of all the media attention, it\u2019s really frustrating, and it\u2019s tough on players, especially young players, to deal with that. Just let the kid play baseball. You don\u2019t have to project him to hit 50 home runs in a season.\u201d\n\nBlackmon parlayed his fast start into an All-Star Game appearance in 2014. But he was a better player in 2015. He increased his hit total by only five over 157 games, but he got on base more, stole more bases, hit more doubles, hit more triples and walked more. His key was finding a more normal routine.\n\n\u201cI know for a fact that at some point you\u2019re going to be bad,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cJust because you\u2019re good out of the gate doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be good all year. Just know that. You start thinking ahead of yourself. You start thinking about tomorrow before today gets here. You have to stay in the moment. And realizing that you can only do your best at one pitch. And if you can do that, then your next step is to do that every time.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the regular, Blackmon said, only comes with experience. He can\u2019t tell a rookie to do it. But Story long ago locked into a routine as a teenage prospect at Irving High School in Texas \u2014 with every trip to Chili\u2019s.\n\nAnd he has a lot of everydays left to play.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I\u2019d rather be doing than this,\u201d Story said. \u201cYou can be in all kinds of different cities, and the year will be crazy, but you get used to it.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\n\nShortstop\u2019s shortlist\n\nFive more things to know about Rockies rookie shortstop Trevor Story:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eating queso.
