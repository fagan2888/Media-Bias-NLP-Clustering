Consequently, the safety of airline passengers and aircraft could be jeopardized,\u201d the auditors said.\n\nThe TSA screens roughly 1.8 million passengers each day and about 1.2 million checked bags, which the screening equipment is relied upon to detect anything that could pose a threat to the safety of each airplane and its passengers.\n\nThe government pays about $1.2 billion in maintenance contracts for the equipment every year. Still, despite spending all of that money, the TSA has no policy or procedure to assure that contractors are providing effective maintenance of the expensive equipment.\n\nRelated: Report Says TSA Wasted $1 Billion on Screening Program\n\nThe IG recommended that the TSA develop a process to verify that the contractors are completing required maintenance activities. It also suggested that local TSA agents at each airport should be required to document the maintenance hours that the contractors log to assure that they are putting in the appropriate amount of time on the equipment.\n\nThe TSA agreed with the auditor\u2019s recommendations but disputed the title of the report, \u201cThe TSA Does Not Properly Manage Its Airport Screening Maintenance Program,\u201d and it also said the program\u2019s effectiveness should \u201cnot be questioned.\u201d\n\nThe IG, for its part, disagreed with the TSA, and said that the title of the report accurately reflected what it found.\n\n\u201cWe determined that TSA does not have adequate procedures to ensure that preventive maintenance for its screening equipment is completed according to contractual requirements and manufacturer\u2019s specifications,\u201d the IG said.\n\n\u201cWe also determined that TSA does not adequately oversee the preventive and corrective maintenance processes for its equipment. In our opinion, proper management of a program requires effective oversight to ensure the program goals are met.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Travelers shuffling through America\u2019s airports each day might be waiting in lines to g", "title": "Poor Maintenance Could Make that Airport Scanner a Dud", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/11/Poor-Maintenance-Could-Make-Airport-Scanner-Dud", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/11/Poor-Maintenance-Could-Make-Airport-Scanner-Dud", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Travelers shuffling through America\u2019s airports each day might be waiting in lines to g", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because the Transportation Security Administration is failing to manage the up-keep of its multi-billion dollar airport screening equipment, potentially jeopardizing the safety of airline passengers across the country.\nOn top of that, the IG said that since TSA can\u2019t assure that the screening equipment is functioning properly, it risks passenger and airport safety.\n\u201cWe also determined that TSA does not adequately oversee the preventive and corrective maintenance processes for its equipment.\n\u201cOur prior work on airport passenger and baggage screening demonstrated that these other measures may be less effective at detecting dangerous items.\nThe government pays about $1.2 billion in maintenance contracts for the equipment every year."}
