HONG KONG—China’ s largest oil refiner said Sunday it will sell almost a 30% stake in its sales-and-marketing unit for 107.094 billion yuan ($17.44 billion) to 25 investors as part of Beijing’s efforts to inject private capital into state-owned enterprises to boost returns and efficiency.

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, SHI, +0.68% said it would retain a 70.01% stake in the unit, known as Sinopec Sales, which operates more than 30,000 gasoline stations and 23,000 convenience stores in some of the richest areas of China. No investor will own more than a 2.8% stake in the unit.

The investors run the gamut of industries—life insurance, technology, appliance making and juice production, among others—and include a number of companies that already have been announced as Sinopec’ s “strategic partners.” One investor is a fund that counts Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY, +1.29% among its shareholders.

More than half of Sinopec’s 25 newest investors are incorporated in China, with the other half incorporated offshore but ultimately related to Chinese entities. Earlier this year, Sinopec Chairman Fu Chengyu said the stake would be open to both foreign and domestic investors.

The announcement caps a process that began in February, when Sinopec said it was following directives laid out in China’s landmark reform blueprint issued in November, which called for private companies to play a larger role in a mixed-ownership economy. Sinopec has the largest petroleum sales-and-distribution network in China, based on the number of its fuel stations, which the company pegs at 30,532 at the end of last year. The associated convenience-store network is the biggest in the country, with a footprint 12 times as large as 7-Eleven’s, according to brokerage firm Bernstein Research.
