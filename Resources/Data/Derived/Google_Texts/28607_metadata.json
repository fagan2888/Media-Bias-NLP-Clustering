He\u2019ll run against Democrat Jenny Wilson to replace County Councilman Randy Horiuchi, who is retiring. If Bruner wins, county council Republicans will hold a veto-proof majority.\n\nSeveral incumbents lost at the Republican gathering. Salt Lake County auditor Greg Hawkins lost his bid for a second term to Scott Tingley, who promised to improve the relationship between the auditor\u2019s office and the city council.\n\nCurrent County Assessor Kevin Jacobs was forced into primary election after Jake Parkinson, deputy Tooele County assessor, won 53 percent. Both advance to the primary.\n\nJacobs in September took the office after his boss left to serve a mission for the Mormon church.\n\nFour-term incumbent Rep. Jim Bird of West Jordan was ousted by GOP activist and political consultant Kim Coleman, who is also the founder of charter school Monticello Academy.\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, women made gains in races for county seats. Sandra Hollins advanced toward becoming the state\u2019s first black female legislator by winning the bid to replace retiring House Minority Leader Rep. Jennifer Seelig of Salt Lake City.\n\nThe race to succeed Utah Sen. Pat Jones, D-Holladay, went to former Salt Lake County Council member Jani Iwamoto. She defeated former Senate Minority Leader Ross Romero.\n\nRomero and Iwamoto waged the most expensive legislative race in either county party to date, The Salt Lake Tribune reports (http://bit.ly/1m2sLq7). Before the convention, Romero raised $31,000, surpassing Iwamoto\u2019s $27,000.\n\nThe Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus endorsed Iwamoto, who said more women are needed in the Legislature. She will face Republican nominee Holladay City Councilwoman Sabrina Petersen.\n\nAlso at the Democratic Convention, Associate Deputy Salt Lake County Mayor Justin Miller won the bid for the seat of Rep. Lynn Hemingway, D-Millcreek, who is retiring. Miller defeated Sophia Hawes, who was vying to become the Utah party\u2019s first-ever transgender nominee, and Amy Fowler, a public defender and gay rights activist.\n\nFormer Democratic County Auditor Jeff Hatch will face Christopher Stout in the June 24 primary to regain the post.\n\nRepublican delegates also applauded Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes for defending the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban last week in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican, addressed the group, too, criticizing Obamacare.\n\nThe weekend nominations come in advance of the parties\u2019 statewide conventions, just under two weeks away.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans and Democrats have chosen their nominees for Salt Lake County seats at separate weekend conventions.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/14/salt-lake-county-conventions-choose-nominees/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Republicans and Democrats have chosen their nominees for Salt Lake County seats at separate weekend conventions.", "title": "Salt Lake County conventions choose nominees"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Republicans and Democrats have chosen their nominees for Salt Lake County seats at separate weekend conventions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Salt Lake County conventions choose nominees"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Micah Bruner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ecb\"", "article_summary": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Republicans and Democrats have chosen their nominees for Salt Lake County seats at separate weekend conventions.\nSalt Lake County auditor Greg Hawkins lost his bid for a second term to Scott Tingley, who promised to improve the relationship between the auditor\u2019s office and the city council.\nThe race to succeed Utah Sen.
