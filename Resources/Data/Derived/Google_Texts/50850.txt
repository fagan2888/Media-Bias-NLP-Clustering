Michelle Obama says young people need Obamacare in case they “slip at a club” or “cut a finger”

Continuing the White House rhetoric that young people aren’t invincible, First Lady Michelle Obama provided more reasons millennials should sign up for Obamacare: in case they “slip at a club” or “cut a finger” while cooking for the first time.

The Rev. Al Sharpton interviewed FLOTUS about her husband’s healthcare law in a pre-recorded interview that aired on his radio show Thursday. The First Lady told the MSNBC host that getting young people signed up was an important goal of Obamacare outreach.

“We need young people signed up too for this, because it’s not just about moms and babies, it’s about young people who feel invincible, right?” she told Sharpton, according to a transcript.

She then went on to give reasons millennials might need health coverage.

“Well, young people are the ones who are driving around late at night, you know, that can get into a car accident, or slip at a club, you know?” she said. “Who play pick-up games and to get a black eye, you know? Cooking for the first time and cut a finger, and you know, bust an artery, you know?”

Earlier this month, at a youth summit hosted by the White House, a former Obama 2008 campaign staffer told young people they should sign up for the Affordable Care Act so they’re covered if they break an arm at a “YOLO party.”

Mrs. Obama also told Sharpton on Thursday that young people “owe it” to their family members to sign up for Obamacare, thereby providing their mothers with “peace of mind.”

“You know, young people aren’t just living out there on their own, if they get sick and can’t afford it, who’s going to have to come in and clean up that financial mess but the parents and grandparents who care about them,” FLOTUS added.

President Barack Obama argued the same point this month, attempting to guilt young people into buying into Obamacare.
