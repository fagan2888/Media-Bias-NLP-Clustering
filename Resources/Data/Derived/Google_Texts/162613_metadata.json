Crowley, senior health policy analyst for the ACP.\n\n\n\n\u201cPatients who exhibit physical ailments - such as chronic diseases like diabetes - often have behavioral health problems that may affect their physical care needs,\u201d Crowley told Reuters Health by email.\n\n\n\nIn the statement, the ACP recommends integrating behavioral healthcare into primary care by removing financial barriers, closing insurance coverage gaps and using government incentives to train and educate an adequate number of providers to administer behavioral health care in the primary care setting.\n\n\n\nMore research is needed to define the most efficient approaches for integrating care and efforts should be made to remove the lingering stigma associated with mental healthcare, both among the general public and among physicians themselves, the statement notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople might think of behavioral health as stigmatizing and wouldn\u2019t think of going to specialized care for it,\u201d said Constance M. Horgan of the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nDelivering mental healthcare in the primary care office, where so many people already go, could help bridge that gap, said Horgan, who was not involved in the ACP statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere certainly are people who need the specialty system, so the primary care system certainly should be in a position to refer to specialty systems,\u201d she said. Though these resources may be available in many communities, many primary care providers don\u2019t know about them, or how to hand off a patient into specialized care, she said.\n\n\n\nPlacing a behavioral care specialist in primary care offices would help make those connections, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn some cases some physicians may not know how to ask difficult questions,\u201d like inquiring about signs of alcohol abuse, Horgan said. Those providers may need specialized training in how to deal with substance abuse.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act (ACA) should help to address some of the barriers to integrated care, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot only has the ACA helped increase the number of people with comprehensive, affordable health coverage, but it requires many plans to cover essential health benefits that include mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment and preventive services (e.g., substance abuse screening) without cost sharing,\u201d Crowley said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe hope that all states will choose to expand Medicaid coverage, which includes behavioral health and medical benefits,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cPhysicians can establish professional relationships with behavioral health providers to facilitate referrals when needed; they can educate themselves on screening and diagnostic protocols and understand what, if any, treatment they can provide their patients; they can educate their patients on behavioral health issues,\u201d Crowley said.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Thomson/Reuters.
