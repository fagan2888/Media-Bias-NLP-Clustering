He was swiftly cut from the team, subsequently expelled from school and later sentenced to a year in prison.\n\nForty-five days later, as part of a plea deal, Alexander returned home to Eureka, Mo., on parole. He took up work as a janitor at the Rams\u2019 stadium, where he found the determination to turn his life around.\n\n\u201cWere it not for the team\u2019s seventh-round choice of defensive end Michael Sam, Alexander\u2019s story might have been the best story of the draft\u2019s final day,\u201d says ESPN\u2019s Nick Wagoner\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what really motivated me,\u201d Alexander explained to ESPN. \u201cEvery time I went to work, I always sat on the end of the field, and I looked at it like, \u2018This could be my dream spot.\u2019\u201d\n\nFortunately for Alexander, the Aggie community didn\u2019t give up on him. In 2013, coach Gary Andersen invited Alexander to return for his senior year.\n\n\u201cYou have to pay a price when you make mistakes. That\u2019s the way the world is. He did. I think we owe it to kids to give them a second chance,\u201d Andersen told the Deseret News.\n\nCoached on and off the field by Aggie staff, Alexander rebounded personally and professionally that season to lead his team to victory in the 2013 Poinsettia Bowl.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my life, I had to really deal with adversity. I fought, and I got back\u201d Alexander recalled.\n\nNFL scouts took notice.\n\nSt. Louis Rams general manager Les Snead said of Alexander\u2019s troubled path: \u201cThat\u2019s adversity that you\u2019ve got to have some grit to get through. You love the passion.\u201d\n\nOn May 9, 2014, the Rams selected Alexander with the 110th pick of the draft. He would play professional football at the stadium where he used to work as a janitor in the stands.\n\nThough the Rams ended this season with a losing record, Alexander started the beginning of career he once only dreamed of.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Maurice Alexander finished sweeping the aisles at Edward Jones Stadium, he used to find a seat behind the end zone, sit and dream.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "When Maurice Alexander finished sweeping the aisles at Edward Jones Stadium, he used to find a seat behind the end zone, sit and dream.", "title": "How This NFL Player Overcame the Odds (and a Stint in Jail)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150104_MauriceAlexander.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-19T22:23:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xmYGJm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "When Maurice Alexander finished sweeping the aisles at Edward Jones Stadium, he used to find a seat behind the end zone, sit and dream.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150104_MauriceAlexander.jpg"}, "title": "How This NFL Player Overcame the Odds (and a Stint in Jail)", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream,sports", "published_time": "2015-01-04T03:01:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T22:23:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "maurice alexander, nfl, football, st. louis rams, utah state, aggies, jail, janitor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb288\"", "article_summary": "He took up work as a janitor at the Rams\u2019 stadium, where he found the determination to turn his life around.\nHe would play professional football at the stadium where he used to work as a janitor in the stands.\nYou love the passion.\u201dOn May 9, 2014, the Rams selected Alexander with the 110th pick of the draft.\nThough the Rams ended this season with a losing record, Alexander started the beginning of career he once only dreamed of.\nWhen Maurice Alexander finished sweeping the aisles at Edward Jones Stadium, he used to find a seat behind the end zone and sit and dream."}
