LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Got questions about healthcare?

KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO anchor Tom Haule and chief investigative reporter Charles Feldman hosted a live, listener call-in program Wednesday featuring experts who will look at the state of Obamacare as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enters its second year.

Among the guests interviewed was H&R Block tax advisor Aaron Martinez, who said those ACA participants whose incomes were too high and were getting subsidies would likely owe money to the IRS.

“Probably about 40 to 50 percent will have to pay at least a portion of the money back,” said Martinez.

“That’s 40 to 50 percent of people whose circumstances changed for the better?” asked Haule.

“That’s correct,” Martinez replied.

Listeners were asked to submit questions by calling 1-866-569-1070 or through Twitter using #KNXHealthcare.
