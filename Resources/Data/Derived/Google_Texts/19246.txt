Hundreds of kids came out to the Lynn Haven Walmart Saturday to learn about safety and meet some new furry friends.

H & H Wilderness and Florida Game and Fish held one of their many "Kid Safety and Fun Expos" Saturday afternoon.

Kids were taught safety tips, like not touching guns and telling an adult if they find one, and the differences between all of the beach warning flags.

The kids even got to play with bunnies and get up close to a white deer named "Buckaroo."

"We go on a deal that if we save one kid, it is worth it all," said Milton Peel, a manager with H & H Wildlife. "That is what we are all about, teach them about education and wildlife and wildlife management."

If you missed Saturday's Kid Safety and Fun Expo they will be at the Chipley Walmart on July 25th, and then they will be back at the Lynn Haven Walmart in August.
