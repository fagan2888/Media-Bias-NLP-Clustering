The House passed a new definition of full-time work that raises the threshold to 40 hours a week, and eighteen House Democrats voted for passage:\n\nEighteen House Democrats voted with Republicans Thursday to change the definition of full-time work as it relates to the Affordable Care Act, signaling that for some members of President Obama\u2019s party the law remains a difficult political issue. The bill approved Thursday would change the law\u2019s definition of full-time work from 30 hours a week back to 40 hours, a move that Republicans say is necessary as employers continue limiting the hours of part-time workers in anticipation of the law\u2019s employer insurance requirement.\n\nThat prompted a veto threat from the White House, and a further demonstration of cluelessness:\n\nObama threatened to veto the House bill this week, citing a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said about that1 million people would lose employer-backed coverage and that the number of uninsured would climb by almost 500,000 if the law\u2019s work definitions were changed. And most congressional Democrats, buoyed by the new enrollment figures, said Thursday that Republicans were merely bending to the will of companies who are using the new law as an excuse to cut workers\u2019 hours and pay. \u201cIt is not Obamacare that decides how much somebody works, it\u2019s the person who runs the company,\u201d Rep. James McDermott (D-Wash.) said Thursday.\n\nWell, yes \u2026 and cost and price signals largely direct those decisions. Democrats made it a lot more costly to give workers 30 hours a week. Did they think that would not have any impact on staffing decisions? This takes the tunnel vision created by static analysis to a ridiculously narrow new limit.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, that kind of unseriousness should discredit McDermott and his fellow Democrats. However, Barack Obama and his party have spent the last few years filling the debate with sophistry and flat-out untruths about ObamaCare, so this just adds to the catalogue of discrediting statements. Peggy Noonan addressed this phenomenon today, noting that it comes as part of their effort to avoid responsibility for the easily-predictable consequences of their actions:\n\nHer comments alarmed congressional Republicans but inspired Democrats, who for the next three years would carry on like blithering idiots making believe they\u2019d read the bill and understood its implications. They were later taken aback by complaints from their constituents. The White House, on the other hand, seems to have understood what the bill would do, and lied in a way so specific it showed they knew exactly what to spin and how. \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you can keep your health-care plan, period.\u201d \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, period.\u201d That of course was the president, misrepresenting the facts of his signature legislative effort. That was historic, too. If you liked your doctor, your plan, your network, your coverage, your deductible you could not keep it. Your existing policy had to pass muster with the administration, which would fight to the death to ensure that 60-year-old women have pediatric dental coverage. The leaders of our government have not felt, throughout the process, that they had any responsibility to be honest and forthcoming about the major aspects of the program, from its exact nature to its exact cost. We are not being told the cost of anything\u2014all those ads, all the consultants and computer work, even the cost of the essential program itself. What the bill declared it would do\u2014insure tens of millions of uninsured Americans\u2014it has not done. There are still tens of millions uninsured Americans. On the other hand, it has terrorized millions who did have insurance and lost it, or who still have insurance and may lose it.\n\nMichael Ramirez uses his Pulitzer Prize-winning talent to make a blunter argument at Investors Business Daily:\n\nApril Fools, indeed. The Obama administration and Capitol Hill seem chock-full of them, and not just on April 1.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out Ramirez\u2019 terrific collection of his works: Everyone Has the Right to My Opinion, which covers the entire breadth of Ramirez\u2019 career, and it gives fascinating look at political history.
