Bruce Rauner, while purporting to correct \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the memo to employees, is playing some games of its own.\n\nBecause some of the state employee healthcare plans are considered \u201cPlatinum Plus\u201d or \u201cCadillac\u201d plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, they likely will be subject to federal penalties in future years, Pam Kogler, deputy director of benefits for the state\u2019s Department of Central management services, wrote to state employees.\n\n\u201cPremiums for these expensive Platinum Plus, Cadillac plans are likely to double after July 1, 2016,\u201d Kogler wrote in her letter of Dec. 11.\n\nBut, contrary to some information employees might have received, the state is trying to hold the cost for employees down, she said.\n\n\u201cStarting July 1, 2016, under the completed contracts and in our current proposals, we will offer less expensive plans with the same carriers and the same services for substantially the same premium costs that we offer today.\u201d\n\nFurther, Koger said the state has proposed a cap on any increases to employee premiums for 2018 and 2019. She said the state would cap increases to employee premiums at 10 percent even if the state\u2019s actual costs increase by more than that.\n\nKoger said Illinois \u2014 faced with sharply rising health spending \u2014 is \u201cimplementing several cost-savings measures, including identifying and removing those individuals who are defrauding the system, that will allow us to contain costs going forward.\u201d\n\nAnd, she wrote, \u201cOverall, we\u2019re shifting towards a consumer-focused model and away from a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach, a strategy that mirrors what is happening in other states and is long overdue here in Illinois.\u201d\n\nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council says the Rauner administration is playing word games in an attempt to downplay the potential cost increases that workers face.\n\nAFSCME spokesman Anders Lindall on Monday pointed to recent comments by Mike Newman, AFSCME\u2019s deputy director, who told the (Springfield) State Journal-Register the administration\u2019s letter was \u201cextremely misleading and disingenuous.\u201d\n\nAccording to Newman:\n\n\u25cf The state had no choice but to leave the existing plans in place for the current fiscal year, 2016, because so much of that fiscal year has gone by it is too late to implement changes.\n\n\u25cf The administration is still demanding a plan that would double employee health costs in fiscal year 2017, and he says the additional cost that would come by way of premiums, copays and other out-of-pocket expenses that would average an additional $3,100 per employee.\n\n\u25cf The new plans the administration refers to are not less expensive plans but instead an offer to pay the same premiums but see increased costs by way of higher co-pays, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.\n\nRegarding costs for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Newman told the Journal-Register, \u201cThey\u2019re talking about capping them at 10 percent after they\u2019ve already doubled.\u201d\n\nThe Republican governor\u2019s administration, AFSCME and and several other large unions remain in negotiations more than five months after expiration of the most-recent contract.\n\nAnalyst Naomi Lopez Bauman said it\u2019s no surprise Illinois is facing challenges under the penalty provisions Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cSince not one penny of this \u2018Cadillac\u2019 tax actually goes to provide any health care for the employee, it really is good to get out of it,\u201d said Bauman, health care policy director for the Goldwater Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line for employees is that Illinois does offer some of the most lavish health benefits in the country and if they\u2019re not triggered immediately (under ACA), they will be eventually because of the way that the tax is pegged to inflation and not to medical inflation,\u201d Bauman said.\n\n\u201cRight now is the time \u2026 for the state to craft new health plan options, ones that will put the employees in charge of their first-dollar coverage and can actually provide more access and affordability without paying this tax that\u2019s not going to benefit them.\u201d\n\nThe efficacy of the excise tax on high-cost plans, or so-called Cadillac plans, is heavily debated.\n\n\u201cProponents of the new excise tax argue that these benefit-rich plans insulate workers from the high cost of care and encourage the overuse of care \u2014 such as unnecessary tests and hospital visits\u2014that raise U.S. health costs overall,\u201d notes the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in its Health Affairs publication.\n\nAt the same time, the foundation notes, the plans may be more costly for reasons other than their generous benefits, including plan participants\u2019 health status or advanced age, and critics say the tax unfairly \u201chollows out\u201d benefits, according to Health Affairs.\n\n[RECOMMENDED]", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 RebootIllinois.com 2016.
