There was a frightened deer looking back at her. Unable to rescue the deer, she called 911.\n\nThis is how Austin firefighters got dispatched to a call they don\u2019t hear every day, \u201cdeer in storm drain.\u201d The response took some thought and quite a bit of time.\n\nThey removed a manhole cover some distance from the drain and got a rope with which to lasso the deer. Then they had to frighten the deer enough to make it move towards the manhole but not enough that it would harm itself.\n\nEventually, they got the lasso on the young buck\u2014weight estimated at 50-60 pounds\u2014and lifted him straight up. Then they carried him off into the woods so he would not try to cross any of the busy highways.\n\nSome years ago, the same department was called to my neighborhood, where a small kitten had managed to get itself to the very top of a utility pole\u2026.but not back down. After listening to it scream for a couple of hours and calling it in vain, we notified the fire department and they dispatched a ladder truck. One of the firefighters put on heavy gloves in case the feline was ungrateful and carried it down the ladder.\n\nYou\u2019re really glad to see these guys if you have a fire, but that\u2019s not all they do.\n\nAssociated Press reported that New York\u2019s JFK Airport is installing a \u201cpet relief area,\u201d the euphemism for toilet facilities for traveling animals, usually dogs and quite often service dogs, which are not exactly \u201cpets.\u201d The New York facility joins those at Dulles International in Washington, O\u2019Hare in Chicago, and Seattle-Tacoma International. A federal regulation requires these facilities in all airports serving more than 10,000 passengers per year, but the rule is not in place until August.\n\nMy cousin Ray Sixkiller reminded me that we\u2019ve never visited the VA Hospital without seeing several service dogs. Then he asked me to speculate on what the potty police in North Carolina would do with \u201cpet relief areas?\u201d\n\nI am not informed, but how could it be any crazier than the current rule requiring a person wearing male clothes who may be sprouting a beard from the hormone treatments to go in the ladies room while a person wearing female clothes with noticeable breasts from the same treatments has to go in the men\u2019s room?\n\nAfter some alleged \u201cinvestigation,\u201d the Justice Department found the North Carolina law to contain civil rights violations. Duh.\n\nCousin Ray wondered how you \u201cinvestigate\u201d something that\u2019s crazy on its face? \u201cDid they just count the number of trans people beaten up trying to comply with both the law and doctor\u2019s orders?\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the news of bodily wastes and law, NBC 6 in South Florida reported that Zoo Miami is losing animals to toxoplasmosis, a disease carried in cat feces. Cats have been observed entering the zoo from the surrounding park and using the sand in holding areas, since there are no litter boxes.\n\nHaving lost a red kangaroo and three squirrel monkeys to toxoplasmosis, the zoo has started trapping the cats to put the healthy ones up for adoption and euthanize the unhealthy ones.\n\nCat advocates in the community are protesting, and one emailed: \"This zoo should have never been built near our homes in the first place. So you and the zoo are the ones invading and should be trapped and euthanized.\"\n\nRon Magill, a spokesman for Zoo Miami, told NBC 6, \"This is Pine Rockland, the most endangered natural habitat in South Florida.
