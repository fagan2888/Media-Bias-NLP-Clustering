Faced with the fact that the economy is getting better under this president, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus blamed Obama for Ebola on Meet The Press.

Chuck Todd pointed out that unemployment is below six percent and asked him how this was bad for Democrats.

Priebus answered by blaming Obama for Ebola, “I think you guys spelled it out pretty well when you had Mr. Pfeiffer on. From the real unemployment rate, for how many people are out of work. The labor participation rate is at record lows. People don’t feel better off than they were five years ago, and obviously whether it’s the GSA, the IRS, Syria, Ebola, the Secret Service, I means what’s going well in regard to this administration and those senators who have followed him in lockstep?”

Priebus can’t discuss the fact that the economy is doing better, so he had to change the subject by blaming President Obama for Ebola. Republicans, obviously, do not understand how crazy they sound. The leader of the Republican National Committee is blaming the President for a fake IRS scandal that Republicans created, a Secret Service scandal that is based on the agency’s repeated failures to keep the president safe, and Ebola.

Out of the roughly 320 million people in this country, two people got Ebola. In the Republican mindset, this means that Obama is now responsible for unleashing Ebola on the American people. Republicans never seemed too concerned about the real unemployment rate when George W. Bush was president, but under Obama falling unemployment rates no longer count.

The Republican Party would rather not discuss the improving economy. Another thing that Priebus never mentioned was Obamacare. It wasn’t too long ago that Republicans believed that Obamacare would help them win back the Senate, now it is something that they don’t discuss beyond a vague promise to “reform health care.”

Republicans really will blame President Obama for anything, including Ebola.
