That strategy may win enough primaries to clinch the nomination, but will sadly fail the GOP standard bearer in the general election.\n\nHillary Clinton, even with her integrity impugned, beats GOP hopefuls in head to head polls, because she addresses issues voters care about.\n\nJobs, fairness, education, health care, and equality!\n\nFor conservatives to win, they must offer understandable proposals that get to the root causes of job loss, student debt, unaffordable health care, and remaining discrimination\u2014or they simply can\u2019t win.\n\nRepublicans instead offer repackaged Reaganism\u2014for example, Job Bush\u2019s tax package and incredible promise to accomplish 4 percent growth.\n\nConservatism\u2014and by derivation Republicans\u2014must change with the times, and recognize solutions that worked for the Gipper don\u2019t resonate today.\n\nDemocrats have an advantage. European-style democratic socialism offers plausible sounding, even if tragically flawed, solutions.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nClinton has a fresh list of free stuff and wrong-headed mandates for private business, even though two generations of handouts and affirmative action have failed to raise the African-American living standards to anywhere near parity with other Americans.\n\nPalliatives nearly always fail\u2014subsidized student loans, grants and government coerced minority and low-income enrollment have driven tuition costs out of sight. Medicare prescription drug coverage for seniors has accelerated the rise in drug prices.\n\nFor conservatives to win, they must offer understandable proposals that get to the root causes of job loss, student debt, unaffordable health care, and remaining discrimination\u2014or they simply won't triumph at the box office.\n\nGlobalization is victimizing many Americans by driving down wages and pushing too many workers into the contingent economy\u2014where they work erratic hours, get poor benefits and face zero job security.\n\nTrade agreements with China and others have offered virtually unimpeded access to U.S. markets, while foreign governments target American jobs with artificially cheap currencies, subsidies and discriminatory regulations.\n\nGOP candidates must promise to do whatever it takes to eradicate the $500 billion trade deficit and restore 4 million good paying jobs.\n\nAmericans can\u2019t compete without affordable universities, but a river of federal student loans has only left a generation too heavily in debt and that harms the economy. The GOP candidate should promise to cut off federal aid to institutions that don\u2019t slash tuition by 20 percent and limit future increases to inflation.\n\nNo matter what they earn, Americans increasingly are up against monopoly abuse. Each year computer and communications technologies become less costly but home cable bills rocket, banks pay hardly any interest for deposits but still charge double digit interest rates on credit cards, hospitals and drug manufactures enjoy government subsidies but extort prices a Pharaoh couldn\u2019t afford, and fuel prices may be down but air travel becomes more expensive and uncomfortable.\n\nBig businesses in all these sectors have merged and acquired smaller competitors, snuffed out competition and jacked up prices. In the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, the GOP should promise to bust up monopolies and get ordinary folks a fair shake in the marketplace.\n\nHealth care in the United States is 50 percent more costly than in Germany and Holland, which also have mandatory private insurance and quality care, because prices there are much lower.\n\nRepealing Obamacare is no longer practical\u2014too many folks could not get back their old policies, and businesses have rearranged practices to accommodate it. The GOP candidate should promise to require drug companies, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to benchmark prices and practices against those in western European countries with mandatory private insurance.\n\nHillary\u2019s trump card is gender\u2014many Democratic women would like a woman president and that will give her a strong base in the general election. The GOP candidate has to convince women that he (or she) feels their pain\u2014by explicit example.\n\nSimply stated, half of his (or her) cabinet and political appointees must be female\u2014corporate America would be compelled by that example to follow suit. If the GOP candidate does not commit to that, then President Hillary Clinton will surely enforce the same.\n\nIt\u2019s all very radical but conservatives should be about empowering ordinary people\u2014be they white or not, male or female, gay or straight.\n\nPeter Morici served as Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1993 to 1995.
