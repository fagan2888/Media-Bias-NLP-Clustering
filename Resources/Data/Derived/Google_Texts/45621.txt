The Arizona Department of Transportation and the National Weather Service have scheduled a dust storm workshop for Monday.

The annual event that focuses on detecting storms and enhancing safety will be held at Central Arizona College, 8470 N. Overfield Rd, Coolidge, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. For those attending, it will be at the Gloria R. Sheldon University Center T Building, Room T-116. Attendees should use Parking Lot H.

According to ADOT, the workshop brings together a group of local, state and federal agencies to discuss and evaluate goals and solutions when it comes to dust storms in Arizona.

One of the main campaigns is "Pull Aside, Stay Alive." It was launched in 2012 shortly after the inaugural dust storm workshop. The year-round campaign educates drivers about what to do, and what not to do, when they are driving in or through a dust storm. For more information, click here.
