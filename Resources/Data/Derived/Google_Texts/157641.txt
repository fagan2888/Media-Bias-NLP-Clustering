Police have fatally shot two suspected robbers and injured two others outside a Houston furniture store.

Houston police spokesman John Cannon tells The Associated Press that five people were robbing the store Thursday evening. Five officers who were monitoring the suspects throughout the day after robberies opened fire when the suspects pointed their weapons. Two guns were recovered.

Two suspects -- including one who sustained a minor injury -- were taken into custody outside the store near Interstate 45. Cannon said the suspect who wasn't injured had posed as a store employee.

Another suspect was taken to the hospital, and his condition was unknown.

Cannon says no officer was injured. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects fired any shots.
