For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a believer, in the ordinary sense of that word, and I\u2019m aware that Paul is a problematic figure in theological history, to put it mildly. But those words have resonated with me over the last two weeks. Painful recent events on the ground in Ferguson, Missouri \u2014 and the strongly divided national response to those events \u2014 offer us a chance to become aware of the ways we see race in America \u201cthrough a glass, darkly,\u201d and perhaps also the beginnings of a chance to see each other face to face, to know as we are known. Let me be clear that when I say \u201cwe\u201d I am primarily addressing America\u2019s white majority, to which I belong. We are the ones whose vision is occluded by the darkened glass of white privilege, and it\u2019s up to us to do something about it. Black people can see white privilege pretty clearly, but from a different perspective, and it\u2019s beyond their power to change it.\n\nWhite privilege is a term that sometimes gets thrown around too cavalierly, especially when people are having a fight on the Internet and want to shut each other up. (I find myself echoing here many of the things I wrote about masculinity and male privilege in the wake of the Elliot Rodger case in May. It\u2019s been a tough summer in America.) Recognizing white privilege does not mean that white people don\u2019t get to express our views on controversial racial topics, or that we have to defer to whatever a person of color may say. It does mean, however, that we have a responsibility to be alert to advantages we may possess, whether as ordinary citizens on the street, economic agents or wielders of rhetoric that appears neutral rather than \u201cracial.\u201d By definition, it means that some of those advantages are things we don\u2019t notice, or take entirely for granted.\n\nMy former Salon colleague Matt Zoller Seitz (now the editor of Roger Ebert\u2019s website) wrote a memorable personal essay on this topic last week. It generated some heated discussion among my colleagues, because it\u2019s arguably only half on-topic. It was partly a confession about a period of extreme disorder in Matt\u2019s own life, when he did some foolish and destructive things, and partly a reckoning with the fact that the consequences of those actions could have been a whole lot worse if he hadn\u2019t had white skin. I have no anecdotes anywhere near that dramatic in my past, but like many other white people who read Matt\u2019s story, I was compelled to think about encounters with cops where I was treated courteously and given the benefit of the doubt, and where it never even occurred to me that the outcome might have been different for someone who didn\u2019t look like me. (A traffic stop in suburban California at age 18: underage, probably over the limit and carrying both alcohol and marijuana. \u201cDrive yourself straight home, son, and don\u2019t let me see you out here again.\u201d)\n\nBut the most insidious power of white privilege, the albatross effect that makes it so oppressive to white people themselves, is the way it renders itself invisible and clouds the collective mind. It\u2019s like a virus that adapts in order to ensure its own survival and perpetuation, in this case by convincing its host it isn\u2019t there. So we see polls suggesting that large percentages of white Americans believe that racism is not a significant factor in Ferguson or law enforcement in general, that cops are just doing their jobs, and that whatever bad things may have happened once upon a time in our beloved country, they\u2019ve been locked away in the dusty cabinet of history and don\u2019t matter anymore. We passed the Voting Rights Act and exiled the Ku Klux Klan to the margins of society (or at least to websites with really bad graphics). Ergo, white privilege obviously doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nAmong the \u201cchildish things\u201d we need to put aside, white people, is the idea that America\u2019s tormented racial legacy belongs to the past. You know exactly the attitude I mean: We have twice elected a biracial president and LeBron James and Jay Z are zillionaires, so no more talk of racism, please. In the more paranoid formulation prevalent in the Fox News demographic (but not limited to it), this becomes the idea that the federal government has spent the last 50 years giving away money, housing, education and other \u201cfree stuff\u201d to black people who don\u2019t work or pay taxes, while vigorously grinding down the white man. So either the vision of healing and reconciliation conjured up so eloquently by Martin Luther King, Jr. more than 50 years ago has now been fulfilled (and black people need to stop complaining), or America is being not so slowly turned into a gay-Muslim-socialist totalitarian state where every day is Kwanzaa. Both scenarios come up against the nettlesome fact that African-Americans stubbornly persist in being poor, living in disadvantaged circumstances, getting shot by the police for no particular reason and going to prison in large numbers.\n\nThis kind of white privilege is a willful blindness, along with a passionate embrace of exactly the kind of aggrievement and victimhood that white people often claim to resent in others. It\u2019s found in Sarah Palin and Sean Hannity, of course, but also among people like hipster \u00fcber-troll Gavin McInnes, the co-founder of Vice, who wrote a piece not long ago explaining that racism, sexism and homophobia do not actually exist. But I\u2019m not principally talking about Republican ideologues and their hardcore supporters, who have built their power and influence on thinly veiled racism over the past 40 years and barely even bother denying it. There is a much larger population of white Americans, I believe, who feel troubled by what they saw in Ferguson but are unable or unwilling to face the fact that it reflects a recurring historical pattern that has obviously not been exorcised, a pattern of power, privilege and domination in which they are complicit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ferguson offers white people a chance to understand the price of our privilege", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ferguson offers white people a chance to understand the price of our privilege", "title": "White privilege: An insidious virus that\u2019s eating America from within", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/white_privilege_an_insidious_virus_thats_eating_america_from_within/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/boy_flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ferguson offers white people a chance to understand the price of our privilege", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/boy_flag.jpg", "title": "White privilege: An insidious virus that\u2019s eating America from within", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "White privilege: An insidious virus that\u2019s eating America from within", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, African American, African Americans, eric garner, ferguson missouri, Ferguson police shooting, Matt Zoller Seitz, michael brown, Race, Racism, Rebecca Carroll, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Trayvon Martin, White people, white privilege", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f77\"", "article_summary": "We are the ones whose vision is occluded by the darkened glass of white privilege, and it\u2019s up to us to do something about it.\nThis kind of white privilege is a willful blindness, along with a passionate embrace of exactly the kind of aggrievement and victimhood that white people often claim to resent in others.\nBlack people can see white privilege pretty clearly, but from a different perspective, and it\u2019s beyond their power to change it.\nWhite privilege is a term that sometimes gets thrown around too cavalierly, especially when people are having a fight on the Internet and want to shut each other up.\nErgo, white privilege obviously doesn\u2019t exist anymore."}
