Pakistani air strikes and ground operations in the Khyber region - where the school attack is believed to have emanated - have killed around 200 militants.\n\nThe drone strike took place in the town of Datta Khel in North Waziristan, where Pakistani troops have been carrying out a major operation against local and foreign militants since June, the officials said.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said the men killed in the drone strike fought under local Pakistani Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur. It was not immediately clear if the drone strike was connected to the school massacre.\n\nU.S. officials rarely if ever comment on the covert drone program, which has eliminated several top militants but has also resulted in civilian casualties, making it extremely unpopular among Pakistanis.\n\nAlso on Saturday, a security official and a police officer were killed during a shootout with militants in Peshawar, police officer Ijaz Ahmed said.
