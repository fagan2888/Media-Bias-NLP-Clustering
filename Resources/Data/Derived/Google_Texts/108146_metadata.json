The child, the couple's first, was delivered Feb. 5 by a medical team at Lingkana Palace in Thimphu.\n\nThe young couple made news in Bhutan while they were dating, when Wangchuck displayed open affection for his wife-to-be by publicly holding hands and even planting kisses on her cheek, something rare in conservative Bhutan, particularly among royalty.\n\nWangchuck ascended Bhutan's throne in November 2008, when his father, King Jigme Singhye Wangchuck, abdicated in his favor.\n\nBy that time, the older Wangchuck had also guided the remote Himalayan kingdom toward democracy. In March that same year, the kingdom held its first democratic election and voted in a new parliament that can constitutionally impeach the king.\n\nBhutan first began opening up to the world in the 1960s. Foreigners and the international media were first admitted in 1974, and the Internet and television finally arrived in 1999.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bhutan holds elaborate naming ceremony for new crown prince - AP News: GAUHATI, India (AP) \u2014 Bhutan's new crown prince was bestowed .05/26/2016 10:41:23AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "GAUHATI, India (AP) \u2014 Bhutan's new crown prince was bestowed with a name Saturday at", "title": "AP News - Bhutan holds elaborate naming ceremony for new crown prince", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/04/16/bhutan-holds-elaborate-naming-ceremony-for-new-crown-prince-n2149443", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "GAUHATI, India (AP) \u2014 Bhutan's new crown prince was bestowed with a name Saturday at", "title": "AP News - Bhutan holds elaborate naming ceremony for new crown prince", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/04/16/bhutan-holds-elaborate-naming-ceremony-for-new-crown-prince-n2149443", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Bhutan holds elaborate naming ceremony for new crown prince, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2514\"", "article_summary": "The 2 1/2-month-old son of King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema was given the name Jigme Namgyal Wangchuck at the ceremony.\nThe Oxford-educated Wangchuck, who is now 35, married commoner Jetsun Pema, 25, in an elaborate Buddhist ceremony in 2011.\nDorji said the relics of this revered Buddhist master were preserved at the Punakha palace, where the naming ceremony was held.\nWangchuck ascended Bhutan's throne in November 2008, when his father, King Jigme Singhye Wangchuck, abdicated in his favor.\nKinley Dorji, the government's information secretary, said the naming ceremony was held to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the day that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, a revered Tibetan Buddhist master, arrived in Bhutan."}
