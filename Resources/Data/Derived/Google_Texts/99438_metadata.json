An item published last month grimly titled \u201cHow Being a Doctor Became the Most Miserable Profession\u201d cited high suicide rates among physicians and increasing numbers of doctors retiring early and leaving medicine for the corporate world as evidence of widespread misery among my colleagues. Loss of respect and autonomy, decreased insurance reimbursements, and larger administrative burdens \u2014 some imposed by new medical documentation requirements under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are said to contribute to our alleged burnout.\n\nAlso last month, an editorial appeared in The Wall Street Journal titled \u201cA Doctor\u2019s Declaration of Independence.\u201d An orthopedic surgeon called for physicians to say, essentially: \u201cWe\u2019re mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore!\u201d Dr. Daniel F. Craviotto Jr. claimed: \u201cI don\u2019t know about other physicians but I am tired \u2014 tired of the mandates, tired of outside interference, tired of anything that unnecessarily interferes with the way I practice medicine. No other profession would put up with this kind of scrutiny and coercion from outside forces.\u201d\n\nCraviotto recommended radical action by doctors, such as refusing to accept insurance, including Medicare, until our grievances are addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have mixed feelings about these articles, and many similar recent ones touting how awful my job has supposedly become.\n\nOn the one hand, I feel validated. There\u2019s no question that practicing medicine isn\u2019t as much fun as it was even five years ago. New regulations and restrictions issued by government agencies, insurance companies, and professional organizations mean I now spend time I\u2019d rather spend with patients checking boxes, populating templates, and dialing 800 numbers.\n\nAlso, because of decreasing reimbursements, physicians are now under pressure to see patients more quickly than ever before. A primary care doctor now spends an average of 12 minutes with each patient. That\u2019s not much time in which to see someone with a long list of complex medical problems and medications and numerous questions and complaints \u2014 not to mention a life story, tricky family dynamics, and photos of grandchildren to share.\n\nMore busywork combined with shorter visits make me feel perpetually rushed, which makes both me and my patients unhappy. Studies show that a rushed physician is more likely to make mistakes. A more pernicious effect is that when a doctor is in a hurry he or she is less likely to fully engage a patient.\n\nFor example, not long ago, I met a new patient who had a fairly simple medical history but who\u2019d suffered much pain and loss. I found myself resisting the temptation to save time by not probing those emotions too deeply, even though I knew that doing so would forge a bond between us, a bond that would help me be a better doctor to this patient \u2014 the kind of bond that is, to me, the most satisfying part of medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, I think that while the Daily Beast and others accurately convey, to some extent, the concerns of many physicians, they do so in an overly dramatic and misleading way.\n\nTake the assertion that high suicide rates among doctors reflect decreasing job satisfaction. It\u2019s true that 300 to 400 American doctors kill themselves every year. But high suicide rates among physicians have been noted for decades and have been attributed to uncontrolled depression, not job dissatisfaction. Doctors often feel embarrassed about seeking psychiatric care from their colleagues or fear that the stigma of a psychiatric diagnosis will jeopardize their livelihoods. This fear is well-founded. It\u2019s only recently that most state medical licensing boards have stopped requiring physicians to report whether they\u2019ve ever received mental health care \u2014 information that has been passed along to insurance companies and hospitals.\n\nPhysicians retire early, elect to work part-time, and opt out of practice for many reasons besides \u201cmisery,\u201d including a need to care for family, a desire to explore other interests, and to seek higher salaries to pay off the six-figure debt that medical trainees, on average, incur.\n\nThe tedium associated with current medical practice is irksome, but not entirely new. My dad, who was a solo practitioner in the 1950s through 1980s, did more paperwork than I\u2019ll ever do. He spent hours at home every night dictating notes and letters into a clunky IBM dictaphone. And I\u2019m just old enough to remember the early days of hospital computing systems when gathering a patient\u2019s data involved calling or even walking from lab to lab.\n\nI\u2019m not denying that my colleagues and I are frustrated by changes in medicine, but that frustration is more nuanced and more counterbalanced by joy than most media coverage reflects.\n\nIn a recent conversation with several colleagues about professional burnout I was struck by the fact that different people felt burned out by different things: for some it was filling out forms, for others it was being scrutinized by bureaucrats. For me, it\u2019s being the target of anger and suspicion that seem so prevalent in society today. I appreciate patients informing and advocating for themselves. I don\u2019t appreciate patients arguing with me about anatomy and physiology \u2014 or my motives.\n\nMany of my colleagues said that burnout isn\u2019t an all-or-nothing state, that they felt burned out on certain days but that often, after a vacation or even one meaningful patient encounter, they\u2019re rejuvenated.\n\nInterestingly, a friend of mine who\u2019s a public school teacher told me The Daily Beast piece captured the current mood of her profession. I\u2019ve spoken to people in many fields who feel more pressured and less appreciated in recent years.\n\nI wonder if physicians are really no more burned out than anyone else. Maybe we get written about because people find it fascinating \u2014 or even a little gratifying? \u2014 that highly trained people who do rewarding work with good job security and relatively generous pay can be as unhappy as everyone else.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.4044009053", "eomportal-id": 602595, "description": "The doctor will see you now \u2014 but he or she won\u2019t be happy about it.
