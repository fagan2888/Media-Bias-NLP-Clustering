Poll shows liberals love, or at least really like, John Roberts

John Roberts, liberal favorite?

According to a new Morning Consult poll out Tuesday, 51 percent of self-identified Democratic voters and 57 percent of self-identified liberals approve of the Supreme Court justice’s job performance. Just 19 percent of Democratic voters and 20 percent of liberals expressed disapproval with Roberts.

Roberts, nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed in the Senate by a wide margin in 2005, does not enjoy similar favor with self-identified conservatives and Republicans.

The survey shows that half of self-described Republicans and 55 percent of self-identified conservatives disapprove of the chief justice’s work. His approval numbers among Republicans and conservatives: 29 percent and 23 percent, respectively.

The poll, conducted online, was started just as the Supreme Court handed down two landmark decisions that were lauded by liberals — the affirmation of gay marriage as a constitutional right, and the preservation of a major component of Obamacare.

The streak of left-leaning decisions created a lot of chatter about Roberts’ ideological sensibilities, especially because he wrote the majority opinion for the 6-3 Obamacare ruling in the case known as King v. Burwell.

When respondents to the poll were told that he authored that opinion, the number of Democrats saying they approve of his performance increased to 63 percent, and among Republicans, it fell to 26 percent.

Roberts’ decision in the Burwell case incensed conservatives who might have given him a pass for his 2012 ruling that Obamacare’s individual mandate is constitutional because it is a tax.

Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the decision by Roberts and fellow colleagues, writing that perhaps Obamacare should be renamed “SCOTUScare.”

The poll surveyed 1,976 registered voters from June 26-29, carrying an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
