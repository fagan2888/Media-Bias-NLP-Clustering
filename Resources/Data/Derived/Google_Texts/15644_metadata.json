Don Hill. Hill's statement appears below.\n\nThe move is the latest in the fight over whether the state should extend the health care program for those with disabilities or low incomes under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cKansans oppose expanding Obamacare, a program that has busted budget after budget in states that have expanded it,\u201d House Speaker Ray Merrick said in a statement.\n\nJim McLean of the KHI News Service reports that Merrick hasn\u2019t yet said why he removed the law makers, but Rep. Jim Ward, the ranking democrat in the house, says it was because all three favored expanding Kansas\u2019 medicaid program to cover more poor adults.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only explanation that makes any sense.\u201d\n\nLyon County Democrat Party Treasurer William Ballard states: \u201cRep. Ward believes the move is an attempt to prevent a vote in the committee on Medicaid Expansion.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers removed from the health committee were Rep. Barbara Bollier of Mission Hills, a retired physician; Rep. Susan Concannon, a Beloit Republican and the vice chair, who has a background in rural health; and Rep. Don Hill, an Emporia Republican and a pharmacist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply saddened for the state that three of the most knowledgeable people on health care issues are being removed from all of the policymaking decisions \u2026 on one issue,\u201d Bollier said.\n\nKansas is one of 20 states that have not expanded Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed for the State of Kansas and people in the healthcare industry. Those three people were very knowledgeable,\u201d said Emporia Senator Jeff Longbine. \u201cThat committee handles many other issues than Medicaid expansion and their knowledge was good for the state.\u201d\n\nMerrick, who makes House committee assignments, also moved moderates off key committees dealing with the budget and education Wednesday.\n\nHe said the changes were \u201cin the best interests of our caucus and state.\u201d\n\nOpponents of expansion, including Gov. Sam Brownback, cite concern over costs and skepticism about a federal pledge to pay for most of any expansion. Supporters, including the Kansas Hospital Association, say the state is losing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe push to expand Medicaid seemed to gather a little steam earlier this fall as the Mercy Hospital system closed its Independence, Kan., hospital in part because of the lack of Medicaid expansion. Some lawmakers talked about finding a solution similar to those used by other Republican-leaning states such as Indiana and Arkansas.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Committee is the most likely panel in the House to consider any Medicaid bills.\n\nNew members on the committee are Reps. Willie Dove, a Bonner Springs Republican; Brett Hildabrand, a Shawnee Republican; and John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican who has experience working for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nThe chair of the committee, Rep. Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, said he had not been informed of the changes ahead of the decision.\n\n\u201cI would say the speaker probably has his reasons, but I wasn\u2019t a part of that,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not going to second-guess that.\u201d\n\nConcannon said she found out she had been reassigned to the General Government Budget Committee after returning home from Beloit\u2019s Veterans Day parade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated,\u201d said Concannon, who previously ran a foundation aimed at improving rural health care. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to undermine the chairman. I haven\u2019t done anything to undermine the speaker. I just voiced my opinion on the issue.\u201d\n\nHill and Bollier have both been moved to the elections committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what they have in common \u2014 their no vote on Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Rep. Jim Ward of Wichita, the ranking Democrat on the committee, who contended that expansion had a strong chance of passing out of the committee otherwise.\n\nHill was also removed from the House Appropriations Committee, where he has been an outspoken opponent of the governor\u2019s budget and tax policies. He noted that reassignments like this are unusual when the House is in the middle of a term.\n\nModerates Rep. Diana Dierks, a Salina Republican, and Rep. John Ewy, a Jetmore Republican, were reassigned from the House Education Committee to the elections and transportation committees. Dierks blamed this on their opposition to conservative reforms to education.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking key people and putting us on committees where we can\u2019t, as they say, stir the pot,\u201d Dierks said. \u201cBut trust me \u2026 my voice will be heard.\u201d\n\nStatement from Don Hill:\n\nThe Kansas legislature has a multitude of aspects. It is about place, policy, politics, personalities and, yes, power and pressure. The recent committee reassignments reflect some of all these aspects.\n\nIt is only a matter of hours since these changes were announced and I am still assessing and seeking to understand the action and consequences. During the last several weeks as rumors and speculation were circulating, I suspected I might be removed from the Appropriations Committee. I was one of only two Republicans on the committee who had voted against the tax reduction package in 2012. I have been consistently skeptical about the tax policy and have reached the conclusion that the 2012 package is indeed causing far more risk and harm than reward and benefit.\n\nAs the Appropriations Committee begins work next session on what will be an extraordinarily difficult budget-cutting task, the last thing the Speaker and Chairman need is Representative Peck harping on how anemic the budget cutting effort has been and Representative Hill raising questions about the short sightedness of cutting investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, public safety and children. This may explain why Peck and Hill will have a different committee on which to serve.\n\nThe shakeup on the Health Committee is far more perplexing. The committee lost the four members who had the most actual real life health care experience. Susan Concannon was the vice chair of the Committee. Her husband is a physician in Beloit. Susan has served as the CEO of the Hospital Foundation at her local hospital. She is a regional legislative leader in health policy and currently serves as the Health Chairman of the Mid West region of the Conference of State Legislators. Susan is a recognized expert on the unique challenges of rural health care.\n\nDr. Barbara Bollier is a long time member of the committee. She is a physician who specialized in anesthesiology. Barbara is an expert on medical ethics and women\u2019s health among many other areas. She is active at the national level with legislative peers and is a national leader in the arena of gun safety and gun violence prevention.\n\nBarbara and Susan have been the only two women on the Health Committee. After the Speaker\u2019s reassignments there will be no women on the committee.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Jones has also been removed from the committee. Kevin has training and background in the health care area. He has training as an EMT and first responder and has experience in that area.\n\nMyself, Concannon and Jones all represent rural areas and critical access hospitals. All of the replacement members are from urban areas. It is important to have breadth and balance on all committees to achieve the best opportunity for good policy.\n\nThe Speaker and Committee Chairman successfully stifled debate and possible action on KanCare expansion in the 2015 session. The Governor continues to oppose KanCare expansion. Speaker Merrick has apparently acknowledged the committee changes were related to differences on Medicaid policy.\n\nThe extreme action of removing four members of the Health Committee (all except Jones have been vocal advocates of expansion) ignores the reality that expansion is only a small part of what the health committee is charged to lead the state on.\n\nThe replacements on the committee are fine and honorable men. In my opinion, however, the committee is significantly and unnecessarily diminished.\n\nMore to follow.\n\n\u2014Representative Don Hill", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "local,news,latest_news_and_features", "og": {"site_name": "Emporia Gazette", "description": "Three moderate Republicans who support Medicaid expansion have been removed from a Kansas House committee that oversees health care issues, including Rep.
