On Friday, a sick child in San Francisco stole the Twittersphere's heart after the Make-a-Wish Foundation helped him don superhero garb and "fight crime" on the streets of San Francisco as "Batkid." Even Republican politicians in Washington couldn't resist rooting him on. Ironically, these same elected officials – in particular Senator Ted Cruz and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor – have been crusading for Obamacare's repeal, which would again make it legal for insurers to deny coverage to children like Batkid with preexisting conditions.

1. Sen. Ted Cruz

The Texas freshman forced a government shutdown to fight the president's healthcare law and believes "we must repeal every word of Obamacare."



A heartwarming story of a community coming together to help make a 5-year-old’s superhero dreams come true http://t.co/9KiHecCACj #SFBatKid — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 15, 2013

2. Rep. Eric Cantor

The House majority leader calls Obamacare an "atrocity."

3. Rep. Justin Amash

The Michigan libertarian has taken to the House floor to demand that congress "repeal this unconstitutional law."

4. Rep. Darrell Issa

5. Rep. Paul Cook

9. Rep. Sean Duffy

During the government shutdown fight, the Wisconsin Republican was so hardcore he questioned Ted Cruz' committment to battle to defund Obamacare.

10. Rep. Trey Radel

The Florida freshman complained in April that House Republican newcomers had not been given a chance to vote for Obamacare's repeal. "I want a chance as a freshman to do that," Radel said, "even if it’s just symbolic."
