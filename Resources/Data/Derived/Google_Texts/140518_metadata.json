During an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Brennan said there will be \u201ctremendous costs and consequences\u201d for Iran if it pursues development of a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cIf they decide to go down that route, they know they will do so at their peril,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nThe CIA director\u2019s comments come one day after Secretary of State John Kerry said that significant progress was being made in negotiations with Iran\u2014though he said \u201cimportant gaps remain.\u201d Separately, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters that a nuclear deal was \u201cwithin reach and achievable.\u201d\n\nRelated: Iran Pushes Back Against Senate GOP Letter\n\nThe Obama administration, along with a coalition of other countries, has been in negotiations for months over Iran\u2019s nuclear program to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for easing sanctions against Iran. They have until the end of the month to reach a deal.\n\nBrennan and others are seemingly optimistic about a pending deal. Brennan told Fox News Sunday that the current negotiations are better-positioned than they\u2019ve ever been in the past. \"I think we've gone to school on some of those developments over the last decade or so, so that we can now have a better plan and an opportunity to verify some of the things that they are saying that they're going to do and not do,\" he said.\n\nRelated: Netanyahu\u2019s Five Big Takeaways on the Iran Nuke Talks\n\nIf they can\u2019t cut a deal with Iran by the March 31 deadline, however, the administration has signaled that it will press Congress to impose new sanctions on the country. The reported progress in negotiations comes weeks after 47 Republican senators sent a letter to Iran\u2019s leaders warning that any deal needed congressional approval if the deal was going to last beyond President Obama\u2019s presidency. The current deal does not require congressional approval, and the letter was not received well by the administration and the other countries working the negotiations\u2014including Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, Iran can say to us, \u2018Are your proposals actually trustworthy if 47 senators say that no matter what the government agrees to, we can subsequently take it off the table?\u2019\u201d German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said during a visit to Washington, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe letter was also not received warmly by Iran, which quickly issued a statement demonstrating its dissatisfaction with the Republican senators\u2019 sentiment.\n\n[T]heir letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such \u2018mere executive agreements\u2019 that have been or will be entered into by the US with various other governments,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote in response.\n\nThe letter was largely seen as an embarrassment for the United States, which many worried would slow down negotiations with Iran.\n\nRelated: As Iran Talks Reach Key Phase, Obama Would Walk Away\n\nSeparately, Brennan was asked about Iran\u2019s role in the United State\u2019s fight against ISIS, to which he said, the country isn\u2019t \u201can ally right now.\u201d Though he added that Iran has its own interests in combating ISIS.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, the Iranians are pursuing their interests inside of Iraq, some of which include efforts against Daesh [ISIL] and preventing that phenomenon from growing,\u201d he said.\n\nBrennan also suggested that U.S. efforts have slowed ISIS\u2019s momentum, despite the group\u2019s latest attack at a museum in Tunisia last week, which killed 23 people.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Though U.S.", "title": "If Nuke Deal Fails, Iran Proceeds at Their Own Peril: CIA Director Brennan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/22/If-Nuke-Deal-Fails-Iran-Proceeds-Their-Own-Peril-CIA-Director-Brennan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Iranian_Oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/22/If-Nuke-Deal-Fails-Iran-Proceeds-Their-Own-Peril-CIA-Director-Brennan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Iranian_Oil_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Though U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Though U.S. officials say they are making progress in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, CIA Director John Brennan had a stern warning for the country if the deal falls apart.\n\u201cIf they decide to go down that route, they know they will do so at their peril,\u201d Brennan said.\nThe letter was largely seen as an embarrassment for the United States, which many worried would slow down negotiations with Iran.\nDuring an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Brennan said there will be \u201ctremendous costs and consequences\u201d for Iran if it pursues development of a nuclear weapon.\nThey have until the end of the month to reach a deal."}
