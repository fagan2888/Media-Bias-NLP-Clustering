Bobby Jindal (R), on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Oct. 27, 2013\n\nJindal\u2019s dig at the troubled Affordable Care Act manages also to ding former vice president Al Gore for a statement he made nearly 15 years ago. We\u2019re not trying to pick on Jindal, but Gore did not actually say this, though people may differ about whether he came close to saying this.\n\nAs a lawmaker, Gore did play an important role in fostering public use of the Internet. Nevertheless, here it is, years later, and Gore is still paying penance for an offhand remark, poorly phrased. So how is it that this flub continues to resonate \u2014 and what warnings does Gore\u2019s experience have for other politicians?\n\nThe Facts\n\nIt all started during a March 8, 1999, interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, as Gore was preparing to make a run for the Democratic nomination for president. The clip of Blitzer asking Gore about his vision is embedded below.\n\nHere is the key exchange:\n\nBLITZER: I want to get to some of those substantive, domestic and international issues in a minute, but let\u2019s just wrap up a little bit of the politics right now. Why should Democrats looking at the Democratic nomination \u2014 the process, support you instead of Bill Bradley, a friend of yours, a former colleague in the Senate? What do you have to bring to this that he doesn\u2019t necessarily bring to this process? GORE: Well, I will be \u2014 I\u2019ll be offering my vision when my campaign begins, and it\u2019ll be comprehensive and sweeping, and I hope that it\u2019ll be compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I\u2019ve traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country\u2019s economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our educational system. During a quarter century of public service, including most of it long before I came into my current job, I have worked to try to improve the quality of life in our country and in our world. And what I\u2019ve seen during that experience is an emerging future that\u2019s very exciting about which I\u2019m very optimistic and toward which I want to lead.\n\nAs you can see, the critical sentence just fell amid a bunch of boring verbiage, like a diamond in the rough: \u201cDuring my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.\u201d\n\nHe does not say he \u201cinvented\u201d the Internet, but he does say something about \u201ccreating\u201d it, in the kind of awkward phrasing Gore was known for. But because the sentence was surrounded by a lot of unrelated political blather, it was largely unnoticed. CNN certainly did not highlight it in its coverage of the interview.\n\nThen a writer for Wired, Declan McCullagh, spotted Gore\u2019s statement and poked fun at it, under headline, \u201cNo Credit Where It\u2019s Due.\u201d He noted that the technical basis for the Internet, specifically the Internet working protocols, existed long before Gore entered Congress.\n\nPreliminary discussions of how the ARPANET [Advanced Research Projects Agency Network] would be designed began in 1967, and a request for proposals went out the following year. In 1969, the Defense Department commissioned the ARPANET. Gore was 21-years-old at the time. He wasn\u2019t even done with law school at Vanderbilt University. It would be eight more years before Gore would be elected to the US House of Representatives as a freshman Democrat with scant experience in passing legislation, let alone ambitious proposals. By that time, file copying \u2014 via the UUCP protocol \u2014 was beginning. Email was flourishing. The culture of the Internet was starting to develop through the Jargon File and the SF-Lovers mailing list.\n\nBut to be fair to Gore, his statement referenced what he had done in Congress. The Internet was the commercialization of the work done at DOD, and by most accounts, Gore\u2019s efforts had some impact. He was the prime sponsor of the 1991 High-Performance Computing and Communications Act, generally known as the Gore bill, which allocated $600 million for high-performance computing. Gore, who waged a two-year battle to get the bill passed, popularized the term \u201cthe Information Superhighway.\u201d\n\nThe Gore legislation helped fund the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, where the Mosaic Web browser was first developed by a team of programmers that included Netscape founder Marc Andreessen. While it is sometimes difficult to pinpoint the impact of federal funding, Andreessen said Gore\u2019s bill made a difference during a 2000 interview with the Industry Standard: \u201cIf it had been left to private industry, it wouldn\u2019t have happened, at least, not until years later.\u201d\n\n(The history of the Internet is beyond the scope of this column, but private industry, such as Xerox\u2019s PARC unit, also played an extremely important role. One cannot point to any single development, but to a series of them involving both government and private-industry research, which of course Gore\u2019s statement failed to note. And, as this reprint of a 1988 Washington Post article demonstrates, the term \u201cInternet\u201d was in use before Gore\u2019s bill was introduced.)\n\nBut such details were lost as the Wired article was circulated and staffers working for House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey spotted it. His press aides, Michele Davis and Jim Wilkinson, put out a tongue-in-cheek news release headlined, \u201cArmey Applauds Vice President Gore for Ingenuity, Creativity and Imagination.\u201d\n\nThe news release noted that Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, was started during the Eisenhower administration. \u201cIf the Vice President created the Internet then I created the Interstate highway system,\u201d Armey was quoted as saying in the news release. \u201cBoth were begun during the Eisenhower Administration and I think Ike actually deserves a little credit here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone on our staff referred to it in passing, and we jumped on it,\u201d said Davis, now global head of corporate affairs at Morgan Stanley. \u201cToday, you\u2019d just have to send a couple of tweets and you\u2019d light up social media and TV commentators over it. But then, it took a press release sent to talk radio to start the buzz.\u201d\n\nThe news release did not actually claim that Gore said he invented the Internet. Neither did another tongue-in-cheek statement a day later from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who managed to also poke fun at his fastidious nature: \u201cDuring my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the paper clip. Paper clips bind us together as a nation.\u201d\n\nBut this was the headline on the New York Times article about Lott\u2019s jab at Gore: \u201cInventors of Paper Clips and Tall Tales.\u201d\n\nBy March 15, less than a week after Gore\u2019s interview, USA Today ran an editorial titled \u201cInventing the Internet.\u201d But, the editorial noted, Gore \u201ccan take credit for seeing the emerging power of the Internet when few did, and for making sure that schools and libraries were wired into it.\u201d\n\nMore than a year later, in an article titled \u201cThe Mother of Gore\u2019s Invention,\u201d McCullagh acknowledged: \u201cMy article never used the word \u2018invented,\u2019 but it didn\u2019t take long for Gore\u2019s claim to morph into something he never intended. The terrible irony in this exchange is that while Gore certainly didn\u2019t create the Internet, he was one of the first politicians to realize that those bearded, bespectacled researchers were busy crafting something that could, just maybe, become pretty important.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Gore was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame for being \u201ca key proponent of sponsoring legislation that funded the expansion of and greater public access to the Internet.\u201d But it is worth noting he was listed as a \u201cGlobal Connector\u201d \u2014 people who have made contributions to the growth, connectivity and use of the Internet \u2014 not a \u201cpioneer\u201d or an \u201cinnovator.\u201d\n\nDavis said she is not surprised that Gore\u2019s quote is still remembered 15 years later. \u201cA role is one of many, and doesn\u2019t ignore all the smart people who actually did the amazing technological work. In that quote he makes it a very singular accomplishment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised a self-serving overstatement gets traction because it fits the perception the public has of politicians.\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Fact Checker did not exist back in 1999, but if it had, Gore\u2019s original statement might have earned him a couple of Pinocchios. His statement never said he \u201cinvented\u201d the Internet, but it was so self-centered that it obscured the fact that as a legislator he did help advance funding for research that helped foster the Internet. He also made the statement in the course of a television interview, and we make allowances that people sometimes misspeak on live television. (We hold prepared statements to a higher standard.)\n\nSo why is his comment now remembered as a Four-Pinocchio whopper? Certainly the shorthand description, fostered by the media, made a difference. But the key reason is that the statement fit within an emerging narrative that Gore, fairly or not, was a self-absorbed stretcher of the facts.\n\nA gaffe sticks if it somehow validates preconceived notions about a politician. Gore had a real story to tell about being one of the first politicians to grasp the importance of interconnected computers. But with one awkward phrase, spun up by opponents and misreported by the media, he managed to obscure his accomplishments and instead become a recurring punch line.\n\nPoliticians should also give credit where due, rather than appear to grab it for themselves.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nCheck out our candidate Pinocchio Tracker\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why does Al Gore's gaffe from nearly 15 years ago still resonate?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Why does Al Gore's gaffe from nearly 15 years ago still resonate?", "title": "A cautionary tale for politicians: Al Gore and the \u2018invention\u2019 of the Internet", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/04/a-cautionary-tale-for-politicians-al-gore-and-the-invention-of-the-internet", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/07/25/National-Enterprise/Images/2011-07-20T055210Z_01_CJB01_RTRIDSP_3_MEXICO.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/04/a-cautionary-tale-for-politicians-al-gore-and-the-invention-of-the-internet", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "gore; invention of internet, al gore, gore invented the internet, who invented the internet, wired, armey internet, glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "gore; invention of internet, al gore, gore invented the internet, who invented the internet, wired, armey internet, glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d36\"", "article_summary": "He was the prime sponsor of the 1991 High-Performance Computing and Communications Act, generally known as the Gore bill, which allocated $600 million for high-performance computing.\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll bring in Al Gore, you know, the guy who says he invented the Internet, maybe they\u2019ll fix the Web site [HealthCare.gov].\u201d\u2013 Louisiana Gov.\nAnd, as this reprint of a 1988 Washington Post article demonstrates, the term \u201cInternet\u201d was in use before Gore\u2019s bill was introduced.)\nOne cannot point to any single development, but to a series of them involving both government and private-industry research, which of course Gore\u2019s statement failed to note.\nGore had a real story to tell about being one of the first politicians to grasp the importance of interconnected computers."}
