Pediatric Physicians Organization at Children’s, a pediatric primary care physician organization affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital, said Tuesday it scored $1 million to expand its pediatric behavioral health services.

The grant comes from the Payor-Provider Quality Initiative, a joint venture between Boston’s, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Tufts Health Care and the state’s Medicaid program. The initiative has given PPOC $2 million total to date.

The program would place behavioral health specialists within PPOC practices to help assess pediatric patients there and make necessary referrals. It also would support partnerships with clinicians working in Boston Children’s psychology department.
