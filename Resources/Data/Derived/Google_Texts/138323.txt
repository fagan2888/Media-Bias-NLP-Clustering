Wyatt Larson, 13, caught this 30-pound, 34 1/2-inch catfish at Golden Ponds on Sept. 11, the night before the flood. When Wyatt and his family had to evacuate their Hayden Court home on Sept. 12, he put his iPad and portions of the catfish in his backpack, his mother wrote in an email to the Times-Call.

"The rescuers all called him "Catfish" for the rest of the rescue," she wrote. While the flood took the family's home, cars and belongings, Wyatt said the flood stole his thunder for his biggest catch to date, Nina Larson wrote.
