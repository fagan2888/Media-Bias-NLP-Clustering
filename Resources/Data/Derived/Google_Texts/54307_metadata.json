This N-word:\n\n\u201cIf you go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany. Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, \u2018Accept the Nazis. Yes, they\u2019ll dominate the continent of Europe, but that\u2019s not our problem. Let\u2019s appease them. Why? Because (strength against the Nazis) can\u2019t be done. We can\u2019t possibly stand against them.\n\n\u201cI suspect those same pundits who say (that opposing Obamacare) can\u2019t be done, if it had been the 1940s, we would have been listening to them. Then they would have made television. They would have gotten beyond carrier pigeons and beyond letters and they would have been saying, \u2018You cannot defeat the Germans.\u2019\u201d\n\nI will endeavor to translate: (a) Obamacare is like stuff the Nazis did, and (b) Those who refuse to stop Obamacare are no better than Nazi appeasers.\n\nAh yes, the Nazi metaphor. The last refuge of the demagogue.\n\nCruz, whose lordly self-regard is trumped by the bipartisan loathing he so richly inspires, appears to knows less about governance than a newbie political science student. Most of Obamacare is already funded, and would not be halted by a filibuster. As conservative political analyst David Freddoso has pointed out, \u201cDuring a shutdown, Marines don\u2019t get paid, but Obamacare gets funded.\u201d\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s marathon rant wasn\u2019t about governance anyway. It was classic showhorse behavior. Not a single Senate colleague rose to join him. Obamacare lives on. All he did was gum up the governing machinery for a day.\n\nAs a duly elected member of the chamber (thanks, tea-partying Texans), he has every right to make a spectacle of himself. But Nazi analogies are beyond the pale. It insults our intelligence to insinuate that a law offering health coverage to tens of millions of people is akin to a criminal regime that systematically murdered tens of millions of people. And it\u2019s a tar-brush smear of his fellow Republicans to suggest that their coolness to his crusade is akin to Nazi appeasement.\n\nI wrote here last February that freshman Cruz, just one month into his tenure, was already on track to emulate \u201850s smear artist Joseph McCarthy. The Nazi nonsense is Exhibit A.\n\nMost elected Republicans prefer to voice their disdain for Cruz off the record. But John McCain, to his credit, went on the record yesterday, denouncing Cruz on the Senate floor: \u201cI resoundingly reject that (Nazi) allegation. That allegation, in my view, does a great disservice\u201d to the Americans who fought in the war, including his own father and grandfather.\n\nFurthermore, \u201cTo allege that there are people today who are like those who, prior to World War II, didn\u2019t stand up and oppose the atrocities that were taking place in Europe\u2026is an inappropriate (topic) for debate on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nAnd put your hands together for Republican congressman Peter King, whose on-the-record assessment of Cruz is refreshingly succinct: \u201cHe\u2019s a fraud.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, some Republicans are weighing in. Shortly after Cruz invoked the N-word, strategist Steve Schmidt unloaded on TV: \u201cWe need Republicans, whether they\u2019re running for president, whether they\u2019re in the leadership of Congress, to stand up against a lot of this asininity. You finally saw it with Ted Cruz. Maybe he\u2019s the one who\u2019s got a bridge too far. Maybe we\u2019ll start seeing our elected leaders stop being intimidated by this nonsense, have the nerve, have the guts, to stand up and fight to take conservatism\u2019s good name back from the freak show.\u201d\n\nOr, as U.S. Army lawyer Joseph Welch famously said to Joe McCarthy, when the senator\u2019s smears became too much to bear, \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir?\u201d\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Twitter, @dickpolman1", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz a legend in his own mind said a lot of random stupid stuff Dr Seuss Darth Vader whatever http //www washingtonpost com/sf/national/2013/09/25/transcript sen ted cruzs filibuster against", "title": "Ted Cruz uses the N-word", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "Ted Cruz, a legend in his own mind, said a lot of random stupid stuff (Dr. Seuss, Darth Vader, whatever) during his 21-hour oratorical attack on health reform, but he stooped lowest when he..."}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz, a legend in his own mind, said a lot of random stupid stuff (Dr. Seuss, Darth Vader, whatever) during his 21-hour oratorical attack on health reform, but he stooped lowest when he...", "title": "Ted Cruz uses the N-word", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_ted-cruz_1200x675.jpg", "creator": "@dickpolman1", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-26", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/national-interest/60229-ted-cruz-uses-the-n-word", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Dick Polman", "keywords": "obamacare, would, republicans, stand, people, against, elected, record, can\u2019t, nazis, those, beyond, senate, smear, health, whether, stuff, they\u2019re, allegation, governance", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_ted-cruz_1200x675.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbd2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI suspect those same pundits who say (that opposing Obamacare) can\u2019t be done, if it had been the 1940s, we would have been listening to them.\nMost elected Republicans prefer to voice their disdain for Cruz off the record.\nBecause (strength against the Nazis) can\u2019t be done.\nBut John McCain, to his credit, went on the record yesterday, denouncing Cruz on the Senate floor: \u201cI resoundingly reject that (Nazi) allegation.\nTed Cruz, a legend in his own mind, said a lot of random stupid stuff (Dr. Seuss, Darth Vader, whatever) during his 21-hour oratorical attack on health reform, but he stooped lowest when he invoked the N-word."}
