The report appeared Monday in Pediatrics.\n\nThe first visit should be within 72 hours of a child's placement into foster care, and within 24 hours for children with chronic medical or developmental conditions or who are the suspected victims of abuse. After this initial screening, children should be seen every 6 months, at a minimum. These visits should be more frequent for younger children, with monthly evaluations for babies 6 months or younger, and every 3 months for children ages 6 to 24 months.\n\n\"Ideally, children should have at least three health encounters over the first 3 months of foster care, as they adjust to their new circumstances. This schedule allows the pediatrician to monitor the child's adjustment to placement, to identify emerging needs, and to support the caregiver in helping the child,\" the report said.\n\nThe committee also recommends a full mental health evaluation after the child enters foster care, including screening for suicide risk and acute mental health needs.\n\nChildren should also be screened for signs of physical and sexual abuse, as well as signs of neglect, including:\n\nScanning body surfaces for burns, bruises, scars, and deformities\n\nAnal and genital examination by an expert in childhood sexual abuse, especially for pre-verbal children\n\nHeight and weight (and head circumference for children <3 years) measured and plotted\n\nBMI calculated beginning at age 2\n\nTreatment should include appropriate therapy and trauma-informed care, including education and support to the child's caregivers and caseworker.\n\n\"This is a time of great emotional turmoil for children and a time during which children and caregivers need much support,\" lead author Moira Szilagyi, MD, PhD, of the AAP Council on Foster Care, said in an email to MedPage Today. \"Developmental and mental health assessments are a crucial part of primary care as is connecting children with needs to needed services.\"\n\nIn fact, a number of studies have shown that up to 80% of children and adolescents in foster care have some type of \"mental health need,\" while 60% of those younger than 5 years experience developmental health issues, 40% have educational difficulties, and almost 40% have significant oral health issues.\n\nThe AAP had previously issued a statement about caring for children in foster care, but Szilagyi characterized it as a \"very old\" recommendation. She said that the new information in the updated statement relates to research on \"toxic stress and impact on the developing brain.\"\n\nThe authors noted the adverse effects of early childhood trauma on the neurobiology of a child's brain. They cited a correlation between this trauma and a variety of behavioral difficulties, such as aggression, hyperactivity, impulsivity, as well as insecure attachment disorders.\n\nThese struggles continue through adolescence and even into adulthood. The authors note that foster care children are more likely to be in special education classes and have a history of grade repetition. Only a little over half of adolescents in foster care graduate high school, and the dropout rate is nearly three times higher than low-income children. Only 6% of former foster care children have \"some college education\" and only 1% to 2% graduate with a 4-year degree.\n\nBecause of these lifelong risks, communication with the child's case worker is a critical part of the process. The authors recommend disseminating information from the child's \"personal health record\" (part of the electronic health record) to help improve care coordination for children in foster care. The report recommends enrolling children the state has moved into foster care in Medicaid until age 21, and reminding patients even when they age out of the foster care system, the Affordable Care Act allows them to be covered under Medicaid until 26 years of age.\n\nAnother update to the report is the recommendation that clinicians become involved with advocating for foster care education and resources at the policy level. The authors suggest that pediatricians attempt to coordinate with policy makers when legislation is developed for children in foster care. They also recommend interfacing with state and local child welfare to develop healthcare coordination and oversight plans to help connect children in foster care with pediatric medical homes.\n\n\"There is a role for pediatricians in advising states around this and advocating for states to follow AAP guidelines for their care,\" said Szilagyi.\n\nCommittee members disclosed no conflicts of interest.\n\nReviewed by F.
