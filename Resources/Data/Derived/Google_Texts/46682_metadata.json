Carey and Sayreville Police Chief John Zebrowski.\n\nSix of the students were arrested on Friday. The seventh turned himself in to police on Saturday, according to the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office.\n\n\"On various dates between September 19, 2014 and September 29, 2014 ... one or more of the juvenile defendants either held the victims against their will, while other juvenile defendants improperly touched the juvenile victims in a sexual manner,\" a statement said.\n\nThree of the defendants were charged with sexual assault and hazing, prosecutors said. One of those three and the four others were charged with aggravated assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes.\n\nThe teens, aged 15 to 17, were expected to make a court appearance this week.\n\nAfter the allegations surfaced last week, the school, which has about 1,700 students and is considered a football powerhouse, canceled remaining games for its freshman, junior varsity and varsity football teams.\n\nReported incidents of intimidation and bullying involving football players at the school \"took place on a pervasive level,\" Richard Labbe, schools superintendent for Sayreville borough, said during a press conference.\n\nLocal lawmakers were urging a full investigation and asking how athletic staff could remain unaware of the abuse.\n\n\"Based on what has come out, there needs to be a total house cleaning at the Sayreville athletic department,\" state Senator Raymond Lesniak told NJ Advance Media.\n\nThe Sayreville Bombers varsity football team has won three state sectional championships and the head coach, George Najjar, was inducted into the New Jersey Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame.\n\nNajjar told local media he was not yet ready to issue a statement on the criminal scandal and said he was uncertain of his future with the school.\n\nIt was unclear if there would be more charges or arrests.\n\nIf convicted of the most serious charge of aggravated sexual assault, students could face up to five years in a juvenile detention center.\n\nIf prosecuted as adults, they face up to 20 years in prison.\n\n(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere in Seattle;
