Slavitt's statements outlined action the agency takes in monitoring the co-ops, including corective action:

"CMS regularly uses enhanced oversight plans (EOPs) and corrective action plans (CAPs) as part of our CO-OP monitoring and oversight process, as laid out in the CO-OP loan agreements and recommended by the HHS OIG," he said. "CMS places a CO-OP on an EOP or CAP when it identifies an issue that can be resolved through corrective action."

Slavitt did not specify which or how many co-ops are the subject of such actions.
