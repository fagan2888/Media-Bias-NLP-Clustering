She\u2019s a University of Missouri college student, and she\u2019s skeptical that the tax is a good idea.\n\nFrom the Columbia Daily Tribune:\n\nOn Feb. 28, Jen Henderson, 23, became the sole registered voter living within the community improvement district, or CID, meaning she is the only person who would vote on a half-cent sales tax increase for the district. \u2026 The CID planned to hold an August election to enact a half-cent sales tax, projected to bring in about $220,000 of additional revenue for capital improvement projects. CID Executive Director Carrie Gartner said when CID officials contacted the Boone County Clerk\u2019s Office about holding the election, they found out Henderson registered to vote with her Business Loop address in February. For more than a year and a half, as property owners in the \u201cLoop\u201d area worked to get the CID and tax increases established, they banked on that sales tax vote being their own. When asked if the CID would be financially viable without the sales tax increase, Gartner said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nGertner asked Henderson to forfeit her vote, which didn\u2019t sit right with the 23-year-old student. Now she\u2019s skeptical of the entire plan to hit low-income people with a sales tax just to benefit local businesses (and boost Gertner\u2019s salary):\n\nThe more she researched the situation, Henderson said, things \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem to be as good as they were saying to me at first.\u201d Gartner \u201ctried to get me to unregister, and that\u2019s pretty manipulative,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThe district plan and the district border is manipulative, too.\u201d\u2026 Henderson said she doesn\u2019t plan to give up her right to vote and feels negative about an increased sales tax \u2014 but has not made a decision about how to vote. Henderson said her concerns include vague project outlines, Gartner\u2019s pay, Business Loop improvements she said will help businesses but not nearby residents and how an additional sales tax would affect low-income people purchasing groceries and other necessities. \u201cTaxing their food is kind of sad, especially when\u201d Gartner \u201cis going to be making like $70,000 a year off of this whole deal,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThese people make a quarter of that. They can barely afford to go buy food, and you\u2019re taxing their food.\u201d\n\nI think even a principled anarchist could justify voting if he or she was in Henderson\u2019s shoes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Democracy for the win.", "title": "This Student Is the Only Person Eligible to Vote on Proposed Tax Increase.
