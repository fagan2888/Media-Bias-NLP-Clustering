The court amped up the legal importance of the case by adding a constitutional question: whether Obama\u2019s actions violated the \u2018Take Care\u2019 clause, which commands the president to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2013 Excerpt from a story by Washington Post staff writers Robert Barnes and Juliet Eilperin on January 19, when the Supreme Court announced it would rule on President Obama\u2019s deferred deportation program for immigrants who entered the country illegally.\n\n\u201cThe open-ended nature of the inquiry under the Take Care Clause \u2013 whether a particular exercise of discretion is \u2018faithful\u2019 to the law enacted by Congress \u2013 does not lend itself easily to the application of set formulas or bright-line rules\u2026.Neither the Supreme Court nor the lower federal courts have squarely addressed [the] constitutional bounds\u2026 of the exercise of enforcement discretion generally.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Excerpt from a Justice Department legal memorandum dated November 19, 2014, interpreting the government\u2019s power to set priorities and use discretion in deciding to defer deportation of unlawful aliens. That is the power that is now under review by the Supreme Court in the case of United States v. Texas, to be heard in April.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nWhen the delegates to the Philadelphia convention that drafted the Constitution focused on the powers of the presidency, they wanted to create an office with energy and the capacity to act quickly, but they also wanted to put limits on the use of presidential power to head off any illusions that the holder of that office had the unchecked authority of a king.\n\nThe president was given roles in the legislative process \u2013 proposing measures and signing or vetoing completed bills \u2013 but the Founders included an explicit mandate that the president respect the work of Congress, directing that \u201che shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n\nLike many provisions of the Constitution, the real-world meaning of the Take Care Clause depends upon its interpretation \u2013 especially how it is read by the Supreme Court and the lower courts in actual legal cases. Over the life of the Constitution, there have been many rulings on the duties of executive agencies as they applied the laws under their assigned duties, but none has defined the outer limits of discretion under that constitutional clause.\n\nProbably the most important of the lower-court rulings was a decision in the 1985 case of Heckler v. Chaney. In that case, prison inmates facing death sentences sued because the federal Food and Drug Administration had refused to review the legality of specific drugs that were going to be used in execution by lethal injection. FDA was shirking its duty to carry out federal drug laws, the inmates contended.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the courts simply had no power to judge the FDA\u2019s decision not to enforce those laws, because the question of enforcement had been committed by Congress to that agency\u2019s discretion. The ruling still stands as a broad endorsement of the idea that, if Congress passes a law leaving a lot of leeway to the agency assigned to enforce it, the Take Care Clause is not violated even if the agency refuses to enforce, taking into account all of the factors that it believes should influence the use of its resources.\n\nWhen a court confronts a claim that a law is not being enforced and thus the executive branch has not \u201ctaken care\u201d to execute the law, its review begins with the actual constitutional text. Doing that with the Take Care Clause, one of its words leaps immediately into prominence: the word \u201cfaithfully.\u201d\n\nThat word seems at least to imply a measure of choice, of discretion. What sort of executive implementation of a law passed by Congress is \u201cfaithful,\u201d and what would be \u201cunfaithful\u201d? And, by the way, \u201cfaithful\u201d to what or to whom? (The records of the Philadelphia convention are not much help in answering such questions; the Take Care Clause was talked about very little there.)\n\nStructurally, the word \u201cfaithfully\u201d modifies \u201cexecute,\u201d but isn\u2019t the Founders\u2019 thought behind the phrase that the mode of execution be \u201cfaithful\u201d at least to the words chosen by Congress? And maybe, also, faithful to the purpose Congress had in mind?\n\nThat second question, of course, draws one immediately into the long-standing debate among Supreme Court Justices: are the only clues to what Congress had in mind the words of a law, or should one also take into account how Congress debated the law in order to see what purpose or policy the lawmakers were embracing?\n\nWhen the Supreme Court takes up in April the constitutionality of President Obama\u2019s broad change in immigration law, some Justices will focus only on the words of existing law regarding deportation of illegal aliens, and some will search for the congressional purpose.\n\nThey will then move from those starting points, comparing them to the specific terms of what President Obama\u2019s aides put together in the plan to delay deportation for at least 4 million immigrants. Under the policy, if a given individual is allowed to remain, that person can then get a work permit and will qualify for some public benefits.\n\nThe crucial finding in this comparison will be either that Congress did give the executive branch a good deal of leeway on how to enforce the immigration law so that deferred deportation is \u201cfaithful\u201d to the law, or that Congress made its intent very clear so that little was left to executive discretion, and deferred deportation is \u201cunfaithful\u201d to the law, and thus invalid under the Take Care Clause.\n\nIf the court does get to this constitutional issue (there are also procedural and statutory issues in the case, too, and those might be decisive on their own), the Justices very likely will have to provide a full explanation of what that clause means \u2013 doing that for the first time in history.\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at a big constitutional question in front of the Supreme Court in the case about President Obama\u2019s immigrat...", "title": "Constitution Check: What does the \u201cTake Care Clause\u201d mean?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/02/constitution-check-what-does-the-take-care-clause-mean/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Barack_Obama_calls_Space_Shuttle_Atlantis_crew_2009-05-20.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Barack_Obama_calls_Space_Shuttle_Atlantis_crew_2009-05-20.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-04T11:05:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T11:07:19+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(The records of the Philadelphia convention are not much help in answering such questions; the Take Care Clause was talked about very little there.)\nDoing that with the Take Care Clause, one of its words leaps immediately into prominence: the word \u201cfaithfully.\u201dThat word seems at least to imply a measure of choice, of discretion.\nThat is the power that is now under review by the Supreme Court in the case of United States v.
