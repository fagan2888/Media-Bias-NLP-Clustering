A former teacher at St. Raphael Catholic School and football coach at Trinity High School was arrested after a man told Louisville Metro Police he was sexually abused as a boy.

Philip D. Anderson Jr., 56, was arrested Friday afternoon on charges of sodomy, attempted sodomy and sexual abuse, said Dwight Mitchell, a police spokesman.

The victim told police he was between the ages of 11 and 14 when he was abused by Anderson when he was a student at the parish school in Louisville's Upper Highlands neighborhood, Mitchell said.

Police took Anderson, who now lives in Somerset, Ky., to Metro Corrections after arresting him, Mitchell said.

A Metro Corrections records room worker said Anderson was released late Friday night on his own recognizance. His court arraignment date wasn't immediately known.

Cecelia Price, spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville, said in a statement Sunday that Anderson taught at St. Raphael from 1981 to 1993 and also coached football at Trinity during that time.

"The archdiocese has not received any reports of abuse by Mr. Anderson, and there were no indications in his file of any problems," Price said. "As always, the archdiocese will cooperate with the authorities as they investigate this situation."

Price said the archdiocese encourages victims of sexual abuse to report it to police.

"We hold all victims of abuse in our prayers," she added.
