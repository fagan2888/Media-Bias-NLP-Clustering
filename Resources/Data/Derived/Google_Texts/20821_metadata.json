It\u2019s killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa in recent weeks. In Spain, a nursing assistant is fighting for her life and Wednesday it killed a Dallas man. The startling news has some New Mexican\u2019s asking what if?\n\n\u201cThat was what was gong through my mind is like OK now it\u2019s going to become a crisis because now it\u2019s in our country,\u201d said Maria Valez.\n\nThursday, Ebola expert Dr. Toby L. Merlin addressed Ebola concerns at a University of New Mexico lecture.\n\n\u201cEbola has become all consuming at CDC.\u201d Merlin said.\n\nMerlin is in charge of the Center for Disease Control\u2019s infectious disease emergency response coordination. He says his team is working to contain the disease in Africa. Merlin says if they can do that the likelihood of it spreading to the U.S. and New Mexico is extremely unlikely.\n\n\u201cEbola spreads only by direct person-to-person contact. It doesn\u2019t spread through the air and diseases that spread through the air like measles or influenza are much greater risk,\u201d said Merlin.\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health says if Ebola makes its way into the state they\u2019re prepared. They say if a patient comes into a local hospital with any symptoms of the disease, workers will ask them if they\u2019ve traveled to West Africa lately or if they know someone who did. If the patient says yes, their blood will be sent to the CDC and the patient will be put in isolation until the results come back.\n\nNew Mexicans tell KRQE News 13 they hope they don\u2019t start seeing that happen.\n\n\u201cI just hope it gets cleared up quickly because I know everyone is kind of uncomfortable with it,\u201d said Cristina Gonzales.\n\nThe Department of Health also says the concern is much less in New Mexico because none of the state\u2019s airports have international flights.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection agents are starting to screen passengers arriving from West Africa at five U.S. airports. Those airports including JFK and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare were chosen based off of the number of international travelers they have.\n\nOutbreaks of Ebola Virus", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"359797\" /] ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) - The Ebola virus is making its way around the world.\u00a0It's killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa in recent weeks.\u00a0In Spain, a nursing assistant is fighting for her life and Wednesday it killed a Dallas man.\u00a0The startling news has some New Mexican's asking what if? \"That was what", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.krqe", "og": {"site_name": "KRQE News 13", "description": "ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) \u2013 The Ebola virus is making its way around the world.\u00a0It\u2019s killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa in recent weeks.\u00a0In Spain, a nursing assistant is fighting for\u2026", "title": "New Mexicans prepare for Ebola", "url": "http://krqe.com/2014/10/09/new-mexicans-prepare-for-ebola/", "image": {"width": 652, "identifier": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/ebola.png", "height": 281}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) \u2013 The Ebola virus is making its way around the world.\u00a0It\u2019s killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa in recent weeks.\u00a0In Spain, a nursing assistant is fighting for\u2026", "title": "New Mexicans prepare for Ebola", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/ebola.png?w=640"}, "creator": "@krqe", "site": "krqe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Albuquerque - Metro, Health, Home, National, World, New Mexico, News, SmartTV, Top Stories, Top Video", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Albuquerque News and Weather, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, New Mexico | krqe.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488525050", "fb": {"pages": 98691658081}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://krqe.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8ec5fa807657323809caf8c9db73e4ed?s=16", "application-name": "KRQE News 13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/krqenews", "published_time": "2014-10-10T04:05:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-03T16:38:01+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "D680B65910F40B115B0DE7298B906E56", "google-site-verification": "DybmyJ3qnLleDwi_e3uE6Wh_x8CKcwUamZdUxoElU1M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92ec\"", "article_summary": "Thursday, Ebola expert Dr. Toby L.
