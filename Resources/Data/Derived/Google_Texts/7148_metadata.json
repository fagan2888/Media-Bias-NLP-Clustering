The one hour show will be hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and airs live at 8 p.m eastern.\n\nBut according to a memo sent to faculty and students by GMU Communications and Marketing Vice President Renell Wynn earlier this week, participation in the town hall is by invite only. There are no tickets available to people who are not specifically invited to the event.\n\n\"This is an invitation-only event. No tickets are available,\" the memo states. \"The event is not open to the public.\"\n\nThis means CNN and the White House are completely shaping the narrative for the event by choosing the people who will participate. There's no doubt the White House will also be crafting pro-gun control questions that are asked from carefully selected audience members.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bogus. .05/27/2016 8:32:40AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Bogus.", "title": "Email Shows CNN's Invite Only Gun Control \"Town Hall\" With Obama is a Total Sham", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/01/06/email-shows-cnns-gun-control-town-hall-with-obama-is-a-total-sham-n2100611", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/5/76cc0f08-5caf-44f5-a4c3-00cc19ca1fd9.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Bogus.", "title": "Email Shows CNN's Invite Only Gun Control \"Town Hall\" With Obama is a Total Sham", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/01/06/email-shows-cnns-gun-control-town-hall-with-obama-is-a-total-sham-n2100611", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/5/76cc0f08-5caf-44f5-a4c3-00cc19ca1fd9.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Email Shows CNN's Invite Only Gun Control \"Town Hall\" With Obama is a Total Sham , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "There's no doubt the White House will also be crafting pro-gun control questions that are asked from carefully selected audience members.\nFollowing his executive actions this week, President Obama will participate in what CNN is calling a \"town hall\" style discussion about gun control at George Mason University tomorrow night.\nThis means CNN and the White House are completely shaping the narrative for the event by choosing the people who will participate.\nThe one hour show will be hosted by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and airs live at 8 p.m eastern.\nBut according to a memo sent to faculty and students by GMU Communications and Marketing Vice President Renell Wynn earlier this week, participation in the town hall is by invite only."}
