Zubik and Erie Bishop Lawrence T. Persico, have called for prayer for religious freedom on March 23. On that date oral arguments will be heard by the United States Supreme Court on the Zubik v. Burwell case, an appeal challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 contraceptive mandate. Both dioceses are among the petitioners.\n\nThe \u201cHHS Mandate,\u201d part of the regulations of the Affordable Care Act, requires employers to include contraceptive services, including contraceptive means that could cause abortion, in their employee health care plans.\n\nFaced with opposition from a number of groups on the grounds that the mandate is an infringement on religious liberties, the HHS, which is now headed by Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, issued a very narrow exception which in effect upheld the mandate in most cases.\n\nUnder the exception, non-exempted religious groups could decline to directly provide contraceptive services on their employee health care plans but would be required to report the names of the employees to HHS who would then require health care insurers to provide the services anyway at no charge.\n\nThe religious entities argue this changes nothing because the requirement to report makes the religious employer complicit in the provision of contraceptive services, in violation of their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cSince our diocese is the lead agent in this appeal, it is my duty to be present for those arguments in front of the high court,\u201d Bishop Zubik wrote in his letter to the faithful of the Pittsburgh Diocese. \u201cThis mandate challenges the very core of our religious freedom. Yet there are many voices who simply do not understand the implications that the HHS Mandate has for all people of faith who could be forced to violate their most sacred beliefs and practices. We live in a country founded on the very religious freedoms now threatened.\u201d\n\nBishop Persico, will also be present for the oral arguments, wrote in a letter to his people, \u201cWe are simply arguing that religious organizations should not be required to provide or facilitate insurance coverage for services that violate our religious beliefs. If we do not secure that right, what is to stop the government from using the same arguments to mandate that the Catholic Church provide coverage for abortion?\u201d\n\nAround the country a number of appeals were filed in courts opposing the mandate, and those lower courts ruled either in favor of HHS or in favor of the appellants.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court will have the final say, should its ruling be evenly divided \u2014 as it well might be with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 the decisions of the district courts will hold in their area but will not serve as precedent until a full Supreme Court rehears the challenge.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Bishop Zubik is appealing on behalf of the Roman Catholic Diocese, Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh and the Catholic Cemeteries. In Erie, Bishop Persico is appealing on behalf of the Diocese of Erie, St. Martin Cemetery, Prince of Peace Center and Erie Cathedral Preparatory School.\n\nOther faith-based appellants in the case include the Little Sisters of the Poor, East Texas Baptist University, Southern Nazarene University, Geneva College, Priests for Life and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington.\n\nIn his letter, Bishop Zubik asked that all parishes of the Pittsburgh Diocese make Wednesday of Holy Week, March 23, a day of prayer and that every parish offer eucharistic adoration for a period of time on that date.\n\n\u201cThis is a special opportunity to drop to our knees united in prayer, lifting up our collective petitions to our Heavenly Father,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn his letter to the Erie faithful, Bishop Persico asked \u201cthat all Catholics in the Diocese of Erie pray and fast with the intention that religious liberty be upheld.\u201d\n\nSurely, he wrote, \u201cour government can find a way to allow employers to follow their conscience and live in freedom. Religious liberty protects the right of each of us to pursue the truth, to embrace it and shape our lives around it \u2013 without government interference. I am hopeful the court will uphold religious liberty, one of the essential pillars upon which our country has thrived for centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus often embraced fasting as a prayerful response to great challenges,\u201d Bishop Persico write. \u201cDuring these final days of our Lenten journey, I encourage you to join me in following his example.\u201d\n\nOn March 23, the day of the oral arguments, hundreds of religious women, college students and clergy will participate in a \u201cLet Them Serve\u201d rally in front of the Supreme Court in support of religious freedom. Among them will be former Philadelphian and former spokesperson for the American bishops on life issues, Helen Alvar\u00e9, along with members of the group Women Speak for Themselves.\n\nIn Philadelphia at 10:30 a.m. on that day, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia\u2019s Office for the New Evangelization and Women Speak for Themselves will sponsor a rally on the steps of the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul.\n\nAfterwards, participants will spend time in service at Holy Family Home, a home for the aged conducted by the Little Sisters of the Poor in West Philadelphia, according to Megan Schriever, of St. Norbert Parish in Paoli, the local WST spokesperson.\n\n***\n\nThe Diocese of Pittsburgh suggests Catholics pray the following prayers:\n\nFather of Mercy, in whose hands rest every human heart and the rights of peoples:\n\nInspire, we pray, the Supreme Court justices of our land, so that freedom of religion might be upheld, not simply as the right to worship, but to live our faith in word and deed.\n\nWe ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, and with the help of Mary, our dear Blessed Mother and patroness of our country.\n\nAmen.\n\nOR:\n\nFather of Mercy, who has given us the gift of faith and called us to live it in worship, words and deeds:\n\nInspire, in this hour, the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. May they uphold the rights given by our Constitution, protecting freedom of religion for all people.\n\nMay our country always be \u201cone nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nWe ask this through Jesus Christ, your Son, and with the help of Mary, our dear Blessed Mother and patroness of our country.\n\nAmen.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic Philly", "description": "The bishops of Pittsburgh and Erie are preparing for March 23 when the U.S. Supreme Court hears their appeal in a major religious liberty case.
