The judge was overseeing the prosecution of Blackwater security guards but did not preside in Burke\u2019s separate civil suit against the private security contractor\u2019s employees on behalf of the families of Iraqi shooting victims. The National Law Journal (sub. req.) has a story on Burke\u2019s suit.\n\nBurke says she wonders if there is some connection between the Wikipedia editors who inserted the false information and Blackwater Inc. Part of the reason she suspects Blackwater, she says, is because of friction with the company\u2019s founder, Erik Prince, during a deposition in the civil case.\n\nHer aim, Burke tells the ABA Journal, is to find out who posted the information and whether he or she has any connection to Blackwater or Prince. If there is no connection, Burke said, she might be willing to dismiss the suit.\n\nThe two Wikipedia editors are identified only as Zujua and CapBasics359. According to the NLJ account of Burke\u2019s suit, Zujua edited Burke\u2019s Wikipedia page in 2012. Burke removed the false information, but CapBasics359 removed Burke\u2019s edits several months later to restore the incorrect information, the suit says.\n\nZujua fought Burke\u2019s Wikipedia subpoena and is appealing a lower court\u2019s refusal to quash. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has postponed a Sept. 19 hearing to get additional briefing from the parties, according to The BLT: The Blog of Legal Times.\n\nZujua argues the appeal is allowed under Washington\u2019s law barring strategic lawsuits against public participation. Additional briefing will be on the merits of the judge\u2019s refusal to quash the subpoena.\n\nThe identity of CapBasics359 is still unknown, although Burke\u2019s lawyers know he logged in at a Starbucks in California, the NLJ says.\n\nBurke\u2019s lawyer, William O\u2019Neil, told the NLJ his client filed suit for a couple reasons. \u201cThe frustration of dealing with Wikipedia led her to file the suit, mostly in an effort to find out who was doing it,\u201d O\u2019Neil said.\n\nZujua is represented by Christopher Hajec of The Center for Individual Rights. \u201cWe view this as having the effect of chilling the free speech rights of other Wikipedia editors who will hesitate to edit on matters of public concern for fear of being sued if they make a mistake,\u201d he told the NLJ.\n\nBurke, who was a solo before joining Katz, Marshall & Banks, received a 2013 \u201cWomen Doing Good\u201d award from Self magazine for her legal work on behalf of victims of sexual assault in the military, according a law firm press release. Her work was profiled in a documentary called The Invisible War, which told the stories of service members who reported retaliation for reporting rapes. She is also lead counsel on behalf of Abu Ghraib torture victims, according to her law firm bio.\n\nUpdated on Sept. 20 to provide additional information and on Sept. 23 to include information from an interview with Susan Burke.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "dcterms.description": "A Washington, D.C., lawyer is pursuing a defamation lawsuit that seeks to unmask two anonymous writers who edited her Wikipedia page.Lawyer Susan Burke tells the ABA Journal the anonymous Wikipedia", "description": "A Washington, D.C., lawyer is pursuing a defamation lawsuit that seeks to unmask two anonymous writers who edited her Wikipedia page.Lawyer Susan Burke tells the ABA Journal the anonymous Wikipedia", "application-name": "ABA Journal", "author": "Debra Cassens Weiss", "og": {"site_name": "ABA Journal", "description": "A Washington, D.C., lawyer is pursuing a defamation lawsuit that seeks to unmask two anonymous writers who edited her Wikipedia page.Lawyer Susan Burke tells the ABA Journal the anonymous Wikipedia", "title": "DC lawyer pursues suit to unmask authors who changed her Wikipedia page", "url": "http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/dc_lawyer_pursues_suit_to_unmask_authors_who_changed_her_wikipedia_page/", "image": "http://www.abajournal.com/images/topic_images/trials_litigation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.rights": "\u00a9 2004-2016", "twitter": {"description": "A Washington, D.C., lawyer is pursuing a defamation lawsuit that seeks to unmask two anonymous writers who edited her Wikipedia page.Lawyer Susan Burke tells the ABA Journal the anonymous Wikipedia", "title": "DC lawyer pursues suit to unmask authors who changed her Wikipedia page"}, "robots": "All", "dcterms.creator": "ABA Journal", "keywords": "ABA Journal, legal news, law, States, Trials & Litigation, Internet Law, Tort Law, District of Columbia", "dcterms.contributor": "Debra Cassens Weiss", "dcterms.title": "DC lawyer pursues suit to unmask authors who changed her Wikipedia page"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c46\"", "article_summary": "Home Daily News DC lawyer pursues suit to unmask authors\u2026Internet LawDC lawyer pursues suit to unmask authors who changed her Wikipedia pageA Washington, D.C., lawyer is pursuing a defamation lawsuit that seeks to unmask two anonymous writers who edited her Wikipedia page.\nAccording to the NLJ account of Burke\u2019s suit, Zujua edited Burke\u2019s Wikipedia page in 2012.\nZujua fought Burke\u2019s Wikipedia subpoena and is appealing a lower court\u2019s refusal to quash.\nBurke\u2019s lawyer, William O\u2019Neil, told the NLJ his client filed suit for a couple reasons.\nThe two Wikipedia editors are identified only as Zujua and CapBasics359."}
