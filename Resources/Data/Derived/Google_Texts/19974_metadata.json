This year Alaska is the most expensive health insurance market for people who do not get coverage through their employers, while Phoenix, Albuquerque, N.M., and Tucson, Ariz., are among the very cheapest.\n\nIn this second year of the insurance marketplaces created by the federal health law, the most expensive premiums are in rural spots around the nation: Wyoming, rural Nevada, patches of inland California and the southernmost county in Mississippi, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has compiled premium prices from around the country. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Worst States to Live for Obamacare in 2015\n\nThe most and least expensive regions are determined by the monthly premium for the least expensive \u201csilver\u201d level plan, which is the type most consumers buy and covers on average 70 percent of medical expenses. Premiums in the priciest areas are triple those in the least expensive areas.\n\nAlong with the three southwestern cities, the places with the lowest premiums include Louisville, Ky., Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania, Knoxville and Memphis, Tenn., and Minneapolis-St. Paul and many of its suburbs, the analysis found.\n\nStarting this month, the cheapest silver plan for a 40-year-old in Alaska costs $488 a month. (Not everyone will have to pay that much because the health law subsidizes premiums for low-and moderate-income people.) A 40-year-old Phoenix resident could pay as little as $166 for the same level plan.\n\nThat three-fold spread is similar to the gap between last year\u2019s most expensive area \u2014 in the Colorado mountain resort region, where 40-year-olds paid $483\u2014and the least expensive, the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, where they paid $154.\n\nMinneapolis remained one of the cheapest areas in the region, although the lowest silver premium rose to $181 after the insurer that offered the cheapest plan last year pulled out of the market. Premiums in four Colorado counties around Aspen and Vail plummeted this year after state insurance regulators lumped them in with other counties in order to bring rates down.\n\nCynthia Cox, a researcher at the Kaiser foundation, said the number of insurers in a region was a notable similarity among both the most and least expensive areas. \u201cIn the most expensive areas only one or two are participating,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the least expensive areas there tends to be five or more insurers competing.\u201d She said that other factors, such as whether insurers need state approval for their premiums and the underlying health of the population, may play a role as well in premiums.\n\nRelated: How Obamacare Will Impact Your 2014 Taxes\n\nThe national median premium for a 40-year-old is $269, according to the foundation\u2019s analysis.\n\nAlaska\u2019s lowest silver premium rose 28 percent from last year, ratcheting it up from 10th place last year to the nation\u2019s highest. Only two insurers are offering plans in the state, the same number as last year, but the limited competition is just one reason Alaska\u2019s prices are so high, researchers said. The state has a very high cost of living, which drives up rents and salaries of medical professionals, and insurers said patients racked up high costs last year.\n\nCeci Connolly, director of PwC\u2019s Health Research Institute, noted that the long distances between providers and patients also added to the costs. Restraining costs in rural areas, she said, \u201ccontinues to be a challenge\u201d around the country. One reason is that there tend to be fewer doctors and hospitals, so those that are there have more power to dictate higher prices, since insurers have nowhere else to turn.\n\nBy contrast, in Maricopa County, Phoenix\u2019s home, the lowest silver premium price dropped 15 percent from last year, when Phoenix did not rank among the lowest areas. A dozen insurers are offering silver plans. \u201cPhoenix, during the boom, attracted a lot of providers so it\u2019s a very robust, competitive market,\u201d said Allen Gjersvig, an executive at the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, which is helping people enroll in the marketplaces.\n\nThe cheapest silver plan in Phoenix comes from Meritus, a nonprofit insurance cooperative. The plan is an HMO that provides care through Maricopa Integrated Health System, a safety net system that is experienced in managing care for Medicaid patients. Meritus\u2019 chief executive, Tom Zumtobel, said they brought that plan\u2019s premium down from 2014. The insurer and the health system meet regularly to figure out how to treat complicated cases in the most efficient manner. \u201cWe\u2019re working together to get the best outcome,\u201d Zumtobel said.\n\nClick here to see the 10 worst places to live for Obamacare in 2015.\n\nKatherine Hempstead, who oversees the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s research on health insurance prices, found no significant differences in the designs of the plans that would explain their premiums. \u201cIn most of the plans \u2013 cheap or expensive \u2013 there seemed to be a high deductible and fairly similar cost-sharing,\u201d she said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Kaiser Health News and is part of a partnership that includes NPR and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This year Alaska is the most expensive health insurance market for people who do not get coverage through their employers.", "title": "10 Worst Places to Live for Obamacare in 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/20/10-Worst-Places-Live-Obamacare-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Alaska.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/20/10-Worst-Places-Live-Obamacare-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Alaska.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This year Alaska is the most expensive health insurance market for people who do not get coverage through their employers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91b2\"", "article_summary": "Click here to see the 10 worst places to live for Obamacare in 2015.\nIn health insurance prices, as in the weather, Alaska and the Sun Belt are extremes.\nAlaska\u2019s lowest silver premium rose 28 percent from last year, ratcheting it up from 10th place last year to the nation\u2019s highest.\nPremiums in the priciest areas are triple those in the least expensive areas.\nMeritus\u2019 chief executive, Tom Zumtobel, said they brought that plan\u2019s premium down from 2014."}
