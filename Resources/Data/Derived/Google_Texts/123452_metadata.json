Maxx.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn, N.Y., resident David Dinolfo is also a long-time Loehmann\u2019s loyalist. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no more Filene\u2019s, now no more Loehmann\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t bag any deals on day two of the sale\u2014the store hadn\u2019t marked down the men\u2019s stuff yet, he said\u2014he\u2019ll be back.\n\nMr. Dinolfo said he\u2019s got his eye on a DSQUARED2 jacket, currently marked at $900. \u201cThat was the price it was last week,\u201d before the sales began, he said. He\u2019s looking for a 60% markdown.\n\nSome of the highest-end women\u2019s clothing items hadn\u2019t been marked with the yellow and orange tags yet, either. So early in the sale, most items were between 10% and 20% off.\n\nLoehmann\u2019s Holdings Inc., the owner of the 39-store chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late December. The sale of its merchandise to a group of liquidators was approved Tuesday and sales began Thursday.\n\nIt\u2019s the third designer discounter to liquidate in the past few years. Syms Corp., which owns Filene\u2019s Basement, went down the same path in 2011; Daffy\u2019s Inc. liquidated in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so depressing,\u201d Sarah Bozek of Syracuse, N.Y., said. Ms. Bozek noted she used to live up the street from the Loehmann\u2019s on Broadway and 74th St. and shopped there all the time.\n\nIn town for a business trip, she couldn\u2019t believe it when she saw that Loehmann\u2019s was going out of business and said she couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to shop.\n\nShe purchased jeans, a few shirts, a sweater and a tank top for \u201conly $128,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe\u2019s Jeans! So sad.\u201d\n\nWrite to Stephanie Gleason at stephanie.gleason@wsj.com.
