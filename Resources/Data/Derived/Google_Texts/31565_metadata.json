More than 62 percent of its members said they anticipate nationwide growth in the outdoor living arena to reach $5.7 billion by 2016.\n\nNumbers aside, the outdoor spaces of our homes often receive more use than interior rooms. After all, when was the last time you actually used your dining room?\n\nWith new home communities sprouting up all over the Triangle, builders are on top of the trend, adding fire pits, porches, decks, fencing, patios, landscaping and more.\n\nGreenhouses part of the outdoor landscape\n\nAaron Moore and his family own a custom homebuilding company, but decided two years ago to create a sister company working mostly on outdoor projects, including roofs, decks, fences, porches, patios and now, greenhouses.\n\nMoore, founder of Neighborhood Construction Services, is building his first greenhouse in Wake Forest with several more lined up.\n\nA growing awareness for organic fruits and vegetables combined with a nationwide \u201cfarm-to-table\u201d trend is prompting some homeowners to look for ways to grow their own food year-round.\n\nMoore says it\u2019s a simple structure that will provide a lot of function.\n\n\u201cThe space that we had to work with was about 12 by 16 feet. It\u2019s basically a 2-by-6 wall system with reclaimed windows trimmed out nice,\u201d says Moore, a master carpenter. \u201cWe did a simple shed roof to tie into the house, and we\u2019re going to have a plastic liner on the inside of the wall. It\u2019s going to have two layers of plastic; the air between the layers acts as insulation. Then we put a polycarbonate sheet on the roof. It\u2019s basically an all-season room for your flowers.\u201d\n\nMoore is partnering with Norwood Road Garden Center to finish the interior, which will include a hydroponic garden fed by reclaimed water. The greenhouse sits on a stone patio that Moore completed before the greenhouse work began.\n\nHe expects his greenhouse projects to cost an average of $12,000 and take about 3 weeks to build.\n\nSocial media driving outdoor living trends\n\nFor years, homeowners and buyers have referred to magazines and television to give them ideas about creating inviting outdoor spaces that are modern and fresh.\n\nToday, social media plays a big role as well.\n\n\u201cMost of our buyers spend a lot of time on Pinterest and Houzz,\u201d says Jenn Nowalk, sales and marketing manager for Homes by Dickerson. \u201cWe have an extensive library of images, too, on our website\u2019s picture page. We encourage our pre-sale customers to spend some time on there and bring some ideas to their design appointments.\u201d\n\nHomes by Dickerson is building in eight Triangle locations, including North Raleigh, Wake Forest, Chapel Hill and Durham in neighborhoods such as Croasdaile Farm, Barton\u2019s Grove and Briar Chapel.\n\nWith an average selling price of $525,000, homes range between $300k to over a million. The average home is between 3,200 and 3,500 square feet.\n\n\u201cOur buyers have that extra income to spend on the niceties,\u201d says Nowalk. \u201cJust from an interior perspective, a lot of our homes have tons of windows out the back; everyone wants that natural light coming in. Also, they want to be able to see out the back so we don\u2019t actually put any grills on the rear windows of our homes; it just makes everything feel a lot bigger.\n\n\u201cThe most common feature right now is a fire pit out in the back with a gas line,\u201d continues Nowalk. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of curved and rounded patios\u2014flagstone or permeable pavers.\u201d\n\nOutdoor kitchens are popular in the higher price ranges; spaces include grills, bars, stovetop burners and mini-fridges.\n\n\u201cPeople really like for things to be built in so that it matches the whole look and feel of the house and the existing space,\u201d says Nowalk.\n\nWhat social media might not tell you\n\nHouzz and Pinterest photos usually don\u2019t come with a price tag, which can leave homeowners with sticker shock. Nowalk says she often has to rein in buyers.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when you\u2019re out looking and dreaming about your new home, you don\u2019t always know the materials that were used and how much it costs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may look great, but we\u2019re still trying to accomplish getting buyers what they\u2019re envisioning but also staying within a budget and trying to be practical.\u201d\n\nThe professionals can steer you in the right direction, and there will usually be several options that may cost less.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, if they can\u2019t afford to do a fire pit, they\u2019ll do stone seating on the outside perimeter of the patio to set the stage for gathering spaces,\u201d says Nowalk.\n\nIf a screened porch or covered porch is outside the budget, you could opt for terrace decking or multi-tiered decks to accommodate both grilling and gathering. Pergolas and paver pathways are an option for outdoor landscaping if the budget is too tight for the stone patio you\u2019ve been dreaming about.\n\nAll about porches\n\nHomebuilder Saussy Burbank is building now in Hillsborough, Chapel Hill, Carrboro, Holly Springs and inside the beltline. Most of the homes are mid-sized, from 1,400 to 3,000 square feet\u2014and a few at more than 4,000 square feet\u2014with prices ranging from $200k to $700k in neighborhoods like Briar Chapel, Claremont, Forest Ridge and 12 Oaks.\n\nSales and marketing assistant Katelin McCarthy gets a lot of requests for outdoor amenities, particularly porches and fire pits.\n\n\u201cWe almost always do a front and back porch, and those come standard on a lot of the elevations that we offer,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people do porches off the master\u2014or second-story porches of any sort. That\u2019s an idyllic thing to sit outside on the porch off the master suite and drink your coffee.\u201d\n\nAnd some choose to screen the porches.\n\n\u201cMany people view a screened-in porch as an additional room because it\u2019s closed in at that point and not allowing bugs in,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201cWe do ceiling fans so you can be out there in the dead of summer and not be hot. There are a lot of different ways to make it so it\u2019s a more livable space year round.\u201d\n\nPorch time means you\u2019ll be looking at a view of the yard, so most homeowners invest in landscaping as well.\n\n\u201cWe had a wonderful couple who were second-time homebuyers with us recently who were adamant they wanted these big boulders in their yard,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201cOur construction manager went and bought the boulders and placed them, and they actually look really nice.\u201d\n\nPools\n\nSome homeowners want to add recreation into the mix, investing in pools and hot tubs. Pools require a certain amount of space, and you may want to check with your neighborhood homeowner association covenants. Spas require less space and are usually easy to install. Both require weekly maintenance.\n\nTo continue reading this article and others, please go to www.NewHomesAndIdeas.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-05-16 12:27:00", "description": "With new home communities sprouting up all over the Triangle, builders are on top of the trend, adding fire pits, porches, decks, fencing, patios, landscaping and more.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-18 11:23:52", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14649738|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "With new home communities sprouting up all over the Triangle, builders are on top of the trend, adding fire pits, porches, decks, fencing, patios, landscaping and more.", "title": "\u200bOutdoor living spaces are feeling the love :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/-outdoor-living-spaces-are-feeling-the-love/14649738/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/house_and_home/2015/05/16/14649742/14649742-1431793523-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-16T12:27:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "With new home communities sprouting up all over the Triangle, builders are on top of the trend, adding fire pits, porches, decks, fencing, patios, landscaping and more.", "title": "\u200bOutdoor living spaces are feeling the love :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/-outdoor-living-spaces-are-feeling-the-love/14649738/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/house_and_home/2015/05/16/14649742/184273-proch-750x400.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "Social media driving outdoor living trendsFor years, homeowners and buyers have referred to magazines and television to give them ideas about creating inviting outdoor spaces that are modern and fresh.\nNumbers aside, the outdoor spaces of our homes often receive more use than interior rooms.\nMore than 62 percent of its members said they anticipate nationwide growth in the outdoor living arena to reach $5.7 billion by 2016.\nSales and marketing assistant Katelin McCarthy gets a lot of requests for outdoor amenities, particularly porches and fire pits.\nPergolas and paver pathways are an option for outdoor landscaping if the budget is too tight for the stone patio you\u2019ve been dreaming about."}
