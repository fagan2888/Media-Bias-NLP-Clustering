The Miracle League of Emerald Coast knocked one out of the park with their 100th baseball game at Frank Brown Park and Recreation Friday night.

Miracle League completes 100th baseball game

All members of the team are athletes, ranging in ages from 3 to 60, all with special needs.

"I do like playing with handicap children, I'm handicap myself but could walk, I can walk im not in a wheel chair," said Jason, a member of the Miracle team.

Every person on the team gets a chance to hit, and participate in the outfield.

Those who need assistance, are partnered up with a "buddy" who is a volunteer from the community.

"We've taught a whole generation of kids to be buddy's and instead of pointing fingers and making fun, they reach their hand out and say come on lets play," said Dave Johnson, President of the Emerald Coast Rotary Club.

"I want to scream and yell too and jump, I need to keep my composure, but I want to do the same thing just like them," said Chaz Baxter, a volunteer.

For some local residents, the Miracle League Baseball games are something they look forward to every year.

"I have a grandson with special needs that plays Miracle League in Dothan and I had a nephew that lived with me that passed away, but it means the world to me. It's hard to come out here without shedding a tear, it really is," said volunteer, Bobby Purvis.

Parents, athletes and volunteers can all agree, the bonds formed out on the field, last more than nine innings.

"There's nothing like it, this is the happiest place on earth and to see these kids have so much fun no matter whats going on in their lives, you come out here you forget about everything for a while and you just have as much fun as they do," said Johnson.
