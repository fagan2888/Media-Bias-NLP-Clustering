A customer's credit score still plays a big part in determining their auto insurance premiums.

Good, bad or nonexistent, a customer's credit score still matters when shopping for auto insurance. But the impact isn't always equal across geographies or insurers.

That's the general finding of a new report from personal finance site WalletHub, which set out to make sense of the whole issue in its 2014 Credit Score vs. Car Insurance study. The goal, according to the report's authors, was to determine how transparent insurers are being about their use of credit score information, how big of a role the data plays in underwriting decisions, and how scores are impacting policy premiums on a state-by-state basis.
