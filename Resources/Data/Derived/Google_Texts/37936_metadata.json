There were 9,408 cases that involved neglect, including self-neglect cases.\n\nPhysical abuse cases included reports of a nursing home employee who used a bungee cord to confine a patient to his room, to a caregiver who dragged a vulnerable adult from her bed to the kitchen in her home. One man was choked and strangled by his caregiver.\n\nAnother neglected a vulnerable adult for so long that he was found with rotting skin on his hands, feet, legs and buttocks. He also was malnourished and suffered from severe, painful gangrene.\n\nEarlier this week, two employees of the Arizona Department of Economic Security were involved in a \u201chorrific case of abuse of an elderly individual,\u201d according to a DES press release. Detective Doug Matteson, spokesman for Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said that an 86-year-old woman was found in an \u201cunlivable\u201d house in Mesa. So far, one DES employee identified as Carol Brown was fired after DES learned of the incident. An investigation is underway.\n\nIn hundreds of other cases, money was stolen and used for everything from casino gambling to a motorcycle purchase. One caregiver made more than $36,000 in illegal debit transactions.\n\nThe cases reviewed by Cronkite News are documented on the Arizona DES\u2019s Adult Protective Services registry, made available to the public last year.\n\nAPS investigates cases of all vulnerable adults, which under state law, includes people 18 years of age or older who are unable to protect themselves because of either physical or mental impairment. In 2015, 72 percent of APS clients were over 60 years old.\n\nSome caregivers cashed in Social Security checks. Others added themselves and their own children as beneficiaries on a vulnerable adult\u2019s accounts without consent.\n\nThat\u2019s what Tinna Kay Lujan did.\n\nWhile employed as a Certified Nursing Assistant at Amber Lights, an assisted living facility in Tucson, Lujan, 56, took 87-year-old Donald Hansen out of the facility into her own home, where the vulnerable adult later was found dehydrated and suffering from an infection.\n\nAccording to the court records, at about 11 p.m. on March 23, 2014, Amber Lights staff called Pima County Sheriff\u2019s Department to report the abduction of Hansen.\n\nMinutes before, Hansen telephoned the staff Amber Lights to tell them he was okay. Staff heard Lujan coaching Hansen before she took the phone and said a moving company would be picking up his belongings the following week.\n\nA confused Hansen approached staff earlier that morning. \u201cWhy do I have to move? I don\u2019t know why I have to move,\u201d he said. \u201cI was approached to move into this person\u2019s home who I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\nThat day, Lujan had checked out the keys to Hansen\u2019s apartment.\n\nLujan was immediately suspended. She admitted to her employers that she removed Hansen from the facility, but said he approached her to be his caretaker.\n\nLynn Larson, assistant director of the Division of Aging and Adult Services, part of the Department of Economic Security, says the 2015 caseload is an all-time high.\n\nIn March 2015, APS had 12,767 open cases. Since then, APS has utilized temporary caseworkers to ensure they would be able to tackle the caseload, she said.\n\nLarson said the number of open cases was down to 4,500, as of earlier this month and are now more aligned with the nation\u2019s standards.\n\nAccording to the APS Annual Report, APS reports have increased by 79 percent in the last five years. The report also said the agency has closed 13,394 cases after investigations. In Maricopa County alone, 7,204 elder abuse cases were reported. APS said they closed 6,548 cases of the Maricopa County cases. Only 565 of those cases were reported as substantiated.\n\nShe attributes the increase in cases in the last year to more attention and knowledge of the problem and therefore, more people reporting cases to APS.\n\n\u201cNationally, there is the Elder Justice Act,\u201d Larson said. \u201cThere\u2019s greater attention being paid to that act and insuring that there\u2019s a level of financing for services such as adult protective services throughout the nation, and part of that is just through the Older Americans Act as well.\u201d\n\nThe Elder Justice Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act issued in 2010, is an elder abuse prevention law. The Older Americans Act of 1965 also created the National Aging Network and agencies on aging at the federal and state levels to provide resources and outreach to aging adults.\n\nEven so, Rhonda Coates, deputy assistant director of the Arizona Division of Aging and Adult Services, says abuse still is underreported. According to the National Center on Elder Abuse, only one in 14 cases are reported.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the national aging population is growing expected to be reach 83.7 million in 2050, almost double its estimated population in 2012.\n\nVice President of Programs and Services for Arizona\u2019s Area on Aging Region One, Melissa Elliott, said services haven\u2019t kept up with the growth rate of the national aging population. The Area on Aging works closely with APS to provide resources and programs to enhance the life of vulnerable adults and caregivers in Maricopa County.\n\n\u201cI think that we also need to do a better job of helping people understand what elder abuse looks like,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nHilary Weinberg, Family Violence Bureau chief for the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s office, said there are challenges when prosecuting cases in court.\n\n\u201cSometimes distinguishing from a normal injury versus an actual abuse case can be a little bit tricky,\u201d she said. \u201c[Elders] bruise incredibly easy. It can be something as simple as moving someone from one chair to a wheelchair and they will be completely bruised and marked up and someone seeing that may say, \u2018Oh my gosh, something happened to this person\u2026\u201d when basically their skin tears so easily that even very gentle handling of the person can look like abuse.\u201d\n\nWeinberg said victims who suffer from some sort of dementia is common and will sometimes prevent a victim from giving accurate information.\n\n\u201cFinancial exploitation can be very hard to detect, so I think that we need more skilled people,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cAnd it can\u2019t just be professionals, it has to be people in the first line of defense.\u201d\n\nIn Hansen\u2019s case, Washington Federal Bank staff contacted deputies because they were suspicious when Lujan and Hansen, a long-time customer, visited the bank together. Lujan provided the bank with a \u201cpower of attorney\u201d document dated by Hansen.\n\nLujan requested checks and bank cards from Hansen\u2019s accounts and added Hansen\u2019s \u201cgrandchildren\u201d as beneficiaries. The bank staff knew Hansen had no grandchildren and later learned the beneficiaries were, infact, Lujan\u2019s children.\n\nFinancial abuse is becoming more prevalent, not only in Arizona, but nationwide.\n\nElliott said that the 2008 recession offered a new kind of vulnerability for the older population because resources were already scarce prior to the drop in the economy and so it caused them even more of a struggle.\n\n\u201cPeople who are looking to exploit older adults are capitalizing on two things,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThey are capitalizing on the desperation and the vulnerability but they are also capitalizing on the fact that there are more older adults and more opportunity.\u201d\n\nNationally, older adults lose about $2.9 billion each year through financial abuse and exploitation, according to a 2011 MetLife Study of Elder Financial Abuse.\n\nThere are perpetrators without malintent who are reported. Some caregivers are overwhelmed and overworked and that leads to vulnerable situations.\n\n\u201cWe definitely recognize, especially if the family member or the significant other has been in a caregiving capacity, that there definitely is caregiver fatigue,\u201d Coates said. \u201cIt might have been that the caregiver was the one who abused or neglected the individual but I believe most of the time it\u2019s not done purposefully if it is the caregiver.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, APS reported 30 percent of alleged perpetrators are family members.\n\n\u201cA certain segment of the reporting sources are family members themselves,\u201d Coates said. \u201cThere may be some hesitation there because they don\u2019t want their loved one or a person that they know to be arrested or to go to jail.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2015, Lujan was sentenced to three years probation for \u201cvulnerable adult abuse\u201d and served 15 days in Pima County Jail.\n\nLujan\u2019s plea agreement included special terms prohibiting her from working in a position where she has access to elderly or vulnerable adults and she must inform her employers of this conviction. She also must pay restitution of over $16,000 to Hansen and complete 200 hours of community service at a rate no less than 30 hours per month.\n\nThere is no unique sentencing code for vulnerable adult abuse cases. These cases have the same potential felonies as any other crime in Arizona, Weinberg said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s an elderly person or a vulnerable adult may make it more of somewhat of an aggravating factor that we can use to try to get a court to enhance a sentence because it\u2019s one thing to punch a fairly healthy 45-year-old person, but to do something to someone who may be very frail and in their 80s that becomes a different story,\u201d Weinberg said.\n\nIn her court statement, Lujan said Hansen approached her during January 2014 to be his caretaker and she viewed this as an opportunity to escape from her failed marriage. She admitted to taking advantage of Hansen but said she was unaware of he had contracted an infection under her care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very ashamed I put the victim in harm\u2019s way because of my impulsive actions,\u201d Lujan said in her court statement.\n\nIn Arizona, between 4,600 and 6,900 seniors will experience some type of abuse each year, according to a report by the Arizona Elder Abuse Coalition.\n\n\u201cIt takes more than one state agency to protect these individuals,\u201d Coates said. \u201cIt really takes the larger community, from the community stakeholders to the churches and the faith-based communities to the family and the caregivers and all these different agencies that support these individuals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vulnerable and elderly adults have been the victims of abuse, neglect and fraud in nearly 14,000 cases in Arizona, with the number of cases reported in 2015 increasing 19 percent over the year before, according to a Cronkite News analysis.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Alejandra Armstrong, Cronkite News", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "Vulnerable and elderly adults have been the victims of abuse, neglect and fraud in nearly 14,000 cases in Arizona, with the number of cases reported in 2015 increasing 19 percent over the year befo...", "title": "Abuse of Arizona\u2019s elderly increases as aging population grows", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2016/03/08/abuse-of-arizonas-elderly-increases-as-aging-population-grows/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2016/01/death-care-elderly-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Abuse of Arizona\u2019s elderly increases as aging population growsArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "elder abuse, aging population, elderly, department of economic security, exploitation,aging population,department of economic security,elderly,exploitation", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In Arizona, between 4,600 and 6,900 seniors will experience some type of abuse each year, according to a report by the Arizona Elder Abuse Coalition.\nThe Older Americans Act of 1965 also created the National Aging Network and agencies on aging at the federal and state levels to provide resources and outreach to aging adults.\nThere is no unique sentencing code for vulnerable adult abuse cases.\n\u201cI think that we also need to do a better job of helping people understand what elder abuse looks like,\u201d Elliott said.\nIn Maricopa County alone, 7,204 elder abuse cases were reported."}
