Millennial workers began building nest eggs at a median age of 22, younger than both Generation X, which started at 27, and the baby boomers, who started at 35.\n\nThough many millennial workers say they\u2019re risk-averse and stock-shy as a result of the most severe recession in the post-World War II era, their deeds are telling a different story. That bodes well in the long run for a generation that may have to bear a greater share of retirement costs on its own, even if it means the economy will get a little less consumer spending in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe concern was that they would be like the Great Depression generation,\u201d which shied away from equities, said Sarah Holden, director of retirement and investor research at the Investment Company Institute in Washington. In surveys, millennials \u201cwere saying that they were nervous about the stock market, they were saying that they were less willing to take risk, but the design of the 401(k) plans is really keeping them in equities.\u201d\n\nOf millennials offered 401(k) or similar plans, 71 percent took part, contributing a median 8 percent of their salaries, the Transamerica report said. The survey polled full-time or part-time workers at for-profit companies.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to surveys showing young adults are risk-averse. In 2012, 22 percent of heads of households younger than 35 who owned mutual funds said they would invest only in financial instruments with no or below-average risk even if it meant getting a below-average return, based on a survey by ICI, the mutual-fund industry\u2019s trade association.\n\nThat was more than any other age group except those 65 and older. A separate survey showed that 39 percent of adults 18 to 29 said cash was their preferred investment option for money they didn\u2019t need for at least 10 years, three times the share that picked the stock market, according to a July report from Bankrate.com, a unit of Bankrate Inc.\n\nWhile socking money away now may limit the amount millennials have to spend on things such as clothing, restaurant meals, movies and gym memberships, the total effect should be positive for the economy, said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re saving more, you are spending less \u2014 there\u2019s no question about that, but in the long run, more savings means more investment, and more investment means more growth,\u201d she said.\n\nFor those like Gentry, it\u2019s that concern about the state of Social Security that\u2019s motivating them.\n\nWithout legislative changes, Social Security\u2019s trust funds will be depleted by 2033, according to the program\u2019s board of trustees\u2019 annual report. After that, tax income would be able to pay about 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2088.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019ll be around or not, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot safer to plan on not receiving that once you retire.\u201d\n\nSome 51 percent of millennials don\u2019t think there will be any money left for them in the Social Security system by the time they\u2019re ready to retire, according to a Pew Research Center report published in March. Thirty-nine percent said the program will only be able to provide benefits at reduced levels.\n\nThere are other signs that millennials are paying attention to improving their finances, said William Emmons, a senior economic adviser at the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nWhile millennials have a large amount of student loan debt, they are cutting back on borrowing in other ways by not buying houses or maxing out their credit cards.\n\n\u201cCompared to Generation X, it looks like the millennials are on a lower track of accumulating debt,\u201d Emmons said. Young adults have reduced their debt more aggressively than the generation born between 1965 and 1980, though it\u2019s not clear if it\u2019s voluntary or induced by tight credit conditions, he said.\n\nIn the end, it may be their baby-boomer parents that millennials have to thank for their saving habits.\n\n\u201cMy parents have always preached to save, save, save as much as you can,\u201d Gentry said.\n\nVictoria Stilwell, Bloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Concern about the future of Social Security and the availability of 401(k)s prompt millennials to start saving early.", "og": {"description": "Concern about the future of Social Security and the availability of 401(k)s prompt millennials to start saving early.", "title": "Millennials buy stocks for head start on retirement saving", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-millennials-buy-stocks-for-head-start-on-retirement-saving.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-istock_000018158838large.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/iStock_000018158838Large.jpg", "height": 449}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-12T01:18:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-12T01:18:36Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Millennials buy stocks for head start on retirement saving\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-millennials-buy-stocks-for-head-start-on-retirement-saving.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-istock_000018158838large.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/iStock_000018158838Large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1852977\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-12T01:18:36Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140811-istock_000018158838large.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/iStock_000018158838Large.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-12T01:18:36Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd835\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy parents have always preached to save, save, save as much as you can,\u201d Gentry said.\nIn the end, it may be their baby-boomer parents that millennials have to thank for their saving habits.\n\u201cCompared to Generation X, it looks like the millennials are on a lower track of accumulating debt,\u201d Emmons said.\nWithout legislative changes, Social Security\u2019s trust funds will be depleted by 2033, according to the program\u2019s board of trustees\u2019 annual report.\n\u201cI wanted to take advantage of that to help build retirement from the start,\u201d said Gentry, 24, who has worked as an accountant at Fleet Feet Sports in Carrboro, N.C., for three years."}
