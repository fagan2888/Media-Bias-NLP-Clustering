Authors unite against Amazon

The ongoing dispute between Amazon and the book publisher Hachette has turned into a full-blown war between the online commerce site and the English-speaking world's most well-known authors and intellectuals, as the likes of Philip Roth, Salman Rushdie, V.S. Naipaul and Milan Kundera unite to combat what they see as illegal tactics by Amazon.

The new coalition, Authors United, is lobbying Amazon's board of directors to stop sanctioning Hachette titles, which Amazon has been doing in response to a dispute over pricing. On Monday, The New York Times reported that the group will also lobby the Department of Justice to investigate Amazon for illegal monopoly tactics. That letter, written by Barry C. Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, will be sent later this week.

“It’s very clear to me, and to those I represent, that what Amazon is doing is very detrimental to the publishing industry and the interests of authors,” said Andrew Wylie, the literary super-agent, who represents more than 300 writers who have joined Authors United. “If Amazon is not stopped, we are facing the end of literary culture in America.”

For months, Amazon has been discouraging customers from buying Hachette books by delaying deliveries, reducing discounting or steering customers away from Hachette titles. Authors United says that this "sanctioning" has "driven down Hachette authors' sales at Amazon.com by at least 50 percent and in some cases as much as 90 percent."

Amazon, which has consistently declined to comment on the dispute, did not comment on the latest efforts from Authors United.
