But 20 states, including Alabama, Florida and Texas, have still not expanded Medicaid, leaving residents with too much income to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford the state or federal insurance exchange.\n\nA previous study in Oregon, where uninsured people averaged about five doctor\u2019s visits per year, found that Medicaid coverage improved mental health but not physical health. The new study included more rural parts of the country where doctor visits are less frequent and found that physical health did improve with Medicaid coverage.\n\n\u201cIn the Oregon study, the uninsured had five contacts with a primary care physician per year,\u201d said Dr. Andrea Christopher, a fellow at Harvard Medical School, lead author of the new study.\n\n\u201cThat was dramatically different from what I saw as a primary care physician in Boise, Idaho, when Idaho did not choose to expand,\u201d Christopher told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nThe Portland area may have a more robust safety net than other parts of the country, she said.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers used the 1999 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to compare almost 3,000 adults living below the federal poverty line without insurance coverage, and nearly 1,500 similar adults with Medicaid coverage.\n\nThose with Medicaid were more likely to have at least one doctor\u2019s visit per year and were more often aware of and in control of their high blood pressure status. Those with Medicaid were also more aware of being overweight than those without insurance, Christopher and colleagues reported in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n\u201cPeople who have Medicaid are better off and it\u2019s not even close,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin D. Sommers of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, who was not part of the new study.\n\nBut Medicaid is not a \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d Sommers told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nThere was no association with awareness or control of diabetes or high cholesterol.\n\n\u201cWhereas high blood pressure is relatively easy to control, diabetes is much more complicated,\u201d Christopher said.\n\nLow-income people with diabetes may also lack access to healthy foods or outlets for exercise, she said.\n\n\u201cMedicaid has some limitations in its ability to truly improve access to care, including low physician reimbursement rates, and some providers do not take Medicaid patients,\u201d Christopher said.\n\n\u201cSome pundits point to these to say Medicaid may not be improving access and chronic disease outcomes,\u201d but being without insurance carries even more dangers, she said.\n\nInsurance coverage \u201cimproves the stability and health of the country as a whole,\u201d Christopher said.\n\n\u201cThe most straightforward option is for all states to expand Medicaid,\u201d Sommers said.\n\n\u201cRight now if you\u2019re not expanding Medicaid you are making disparities worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real clear public health case to be made, especially when federal government will pay,\u201d for most of Medicaid expansion, and the money has already been allocated, he said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1MQ3D4Z The American Journal of Public Health, online November 12, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0T627D20151117", "sailthru.author": "Kathryn Doyle", "Author": "Kathryn Doyle", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters Health) -
