Puppies are reportedly going fast at an adoption event held Friday and continuing into the weekend at the Chicago-area animal shelter destroyed when a school bus smashed into it earlier this week.

Wright-Way Rescue, 7136 W. Touhy Ave. in Niles, was struck Wednesday afternoon by an out-of-control school bus and the front of its building was wrecked, leaving the 25 animals inside the shelter in need of a new place to stay and the shelter itself looking for a new home.

The shelter's founder, Christy Anderson, told the Chicago Tribune rebuilding the shelter is "not an option" but described the response from the community as "overwhelming."

Though foster homes were found for all the animals inside the shelter Wednesday, the shelter hastily put together an adoption event beginning Friday for the 75 animals that arrived there in a previously-scheduled shipment from their downstate Illinois facility. Below are some of the pets available at the event, many of whom may have already been adopted:

The event, held in the parking lot outside the shelter, has attracted crowds as many have come to the rescue of the homeless animals.

"We decided we wanted to help the cause and come and rescue him," Beth Bialkowski told NBC Chicago about her new pet she had picked out. "We have another dog at home named Dawson, so we thought it would be a great way to bring a little brother home."

The adoption event will continue from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
