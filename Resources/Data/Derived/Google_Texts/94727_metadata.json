He says he first learned to appreciate art as a child reading comic books, finding himself drawn to particular illustrators and noticing their unique methods.\n\n\u201cIt got me to draw the same pictures, put things on paper, and start falling in love with the way a pencil stroke looked,\u201d Cavin said. \u201cThat lead to me seeing other artists\u2019 signature styles, what made them stand out, and that made me love the art even more.\u201d\n\nHe carried this sentiment over to the way he views his own art now, as a journey of self-exploration.\n\n\u201cArtwork is the journey of finding yourself, and what comes out is a signature,\u201d he said. \u201cI see my art as a progression in finding that signature in myself. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m there yet, and for me, that\u2019s one of the bigger parts of being an artist, never quite being satisfied and always pushing yourself.\u201d\n\nHis journey took him from his childhood appreciation of comic books to winning awards in high school, and then on to receiving college scholarships and earning his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma (USAO). After graduating, he started working as a graphic designer, a career he has continued for 10 years.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s nice working the graphic design job and then coming home to work pencil, paper, paint brush, and canvas,\u201d he said. \u201cI work nine-to-five. After I get home, I will eat dinner with my wife, relax for a bit, then I usually have set aside time to work on whatever grabs me. It is really nice to come in and work with my hands.\u201d\n\nWhen he settles down to his studio, Cavin says his approach is very blue collar. He works, he puts in the time. He picks up whatever strikes him first, whether it\u2019s working with pencil and paper, or getting some canvas out and working with acrylic paints \u201cIt is a process, you have to put the work in. I don\u2019t necessarily know when the piece is done. Some pieces will sit in the studio for three, four, or six months. Other pieces take no time.\u201d\n\nCavin said, in the comic book world, he can see the entire process that goes into the work, from the pencil to the inking to the actual painting of the cover. His own artistic method seems to mirror this hands-on, continuous process with multiple layers.\n\nThe result is a hybrid\u2014an assortment of complimentary and active graphites, inks, paints\u2014a mix of old and new visuals, purposefully designed by artist Dylan Cavin, often worked onto interesting backdrops such as notes, ledgers, and book pages. He works to control the design of his art, but Cavin also appreciates the uniqueness and unplanned expression of each piece.\n\n\u201cArt is something you can\u2019t recreate. With the drips and washes you see in my work, I plan to do it, but I don\u2019t know how it will come out. You can see brush strokes with a gradient you know you will never be able to do again. It is expression, putting in that work, finding that unexpected outcome,\u201d Cavin said.\n\nCavin\u2019s work often shows subjects important to the Choctaw Nation and its heritage, such as the buffalo and historical figures. It is part of his attempt to explore, in himself, what it means to be Choctaw, and what it means to be Oklahoman. He said he feels a responsibility to convey the feelings he gets from such subjects, and a desire to allow the viewer a connection with it.\n\n\u201cFor me, the Native art really hits home for doing something that means Oklahoma to me. A lot of times I relate Native with myself, and that translates into what I find around me, whether it be a bison, or a longhorn, or the scissortail. That\u2019s what comes out,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking forward, Cavin plans to keep pushing his work, showing his art at every possible venue. He said if he is not pushing himself, his art is not being seen. \u201cIf you are not there to talk about your work, then people aren\u2019t going to be as interested about it,\u201d he explained. \u201cOnce you are there and talking about it, it takes on a different story.\u201d\n\nCavin\u2019s artwork is currently on display around the Choctaw Nation. A scissortail flycatcher, made from paints on an old note, is even perched on the wall of the Biskinik offices. A collection of his work is for sale at the Choctaw Welcome Center in Colbert. His work is also spread across the state and globe. Tribes 131 in Norman has shown his artwork. He has had several pieces on display at the University of Oklahoma\u2019s student union on the medical campus. Cavin has shipped artwork around Oklahoma, to Texas, and even to places like Moscow. He has shown art in New York and in Santa Fe. And USAO recently hosted Cavin\u2019s one-man show at the Nesbitt Gallery in Chickasha.\n\n\u201cDoing Native art, especially within the Choctaw Nation, it has almost opened up an extended family I didn\u2019t necessarily know I had,\u201d Cavin said. \u201cBut once you get out there and start showing, it\u2019s a very warm crowd.\u201d\n\nWatch an interview with Cavin below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dylan Cavin is a multimedia Choctaw artist who portrays Native and Oklahoma-oriented subjects in his work in unexpected ways.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/07/video-choctaw-artist-dylan-cavin-shares-story-his-art-158910", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/dylan-cavin-buffalo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Video: Choctaw Artist Dylan Cavin Shares the Story of His Art"}, "abstract": "Dylan Cavin is a multimedia Choctaw artist who portrays Native and Oklahoma-oriented subjects in his work in unexpected ways.", "dc": {"title": "Video: Choctaw Artist Dylan Cavin Shares the Story of His Art"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/07/video-choctaw-artist-dylan-cavin-shares-story-his-art-158910", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Choctaw Nation, Artists, Native artists, Oklahoma", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-03-07T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Video: Choctaw Artist Dylan Cavin Shares the Story of His Art"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ec3\"", "article_summary": "Dylan Cavin is a multimedia Choctaw artist who portrays Native and Oklahoma-oriented subjects in his work in unexpected ways.\n\u201cDoing Native art, especially within the Choctaw Nation, it has almost opened up an extended family I didn\u2019t necessarily know I had,\u201d Cavin said.\n\u201cFor me, the Native art really hits home for doing something that means Oklahoma to me.\nHe works to control the design of his art, but Cavin also appreciates the uniqueness and unplanned expression of each piece.\nIt is expression, putting in that work, finding that unexpected outcome,\u201d Cavin said."}
