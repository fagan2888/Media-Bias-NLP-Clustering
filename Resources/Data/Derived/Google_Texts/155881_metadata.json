The truth is that in today\u2019s uncertain economy, many adult children and grandchildren are struggling with stalled careers, steep college tuition costs and a wide variety of financial difficulties. As a result, they are increasingly turning to parents and grandparents for a helping hand. At the same time, large numbers of us simply don\u2019t know how to say \u201cno\u201d to our kids nor are we very comfortable setting boundaries or fair terms for this financial support. In this new era, it seems that PARENTHOOD NEVER RETIRES.\n\nTo better understand how family financial interdependencies can impact our retirement lifestyles, my firm, Age Wave, in partnership with Merrill Lynch, just completed a landmark survey titled, \u201cFamily & Retirement: The Elephant in the Room.\u201d The survey queried more than 5,400 people age 25 and older to understand how retirement is no longer just an individual matter, but truly a \u201cfamily affair.\u201d You can download the entire report at www.ml.com/retirementstudy.\n\nWe were somewhat startled to discover that 20% of America\u2019s 50+ men and women still have an adult child living with them and a whopping 68% are providing financial support to adult children. Tens of millions of boomers are regularly subsidizing their adult children\u2019s rent or mortgage payments, insurance, cellphone bills, car purchases or leases and tuition expenses. And this assistance is often offered without expecting very much in return. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to get back the money I lent my daughter,\u201d said a focus group participant. \u201cI\u2019m just happy I could help her when she needed it.\u201d\n\nThe amount of this support can be substantial. In fact, family subsidies averaged a total of $9,200 over the past five years among people with less than $250,000 in investible assets, and $19,100 for people with between $250,000 and $500,000 in investible assets. And among the very wealthy (those with more than $5,000,000 in investible assets), the average five-year family outlay was $313,000! As one of our focus group participants commented: \u201cI thought I would be supplementing my grandchildren\u2019s college funds. It turns out, I was the college fund.\u201d\n\nThose lending a hand to family members rarely do so because they expect future help or financial payback. Reflecting an incredibly high level of generosity, older adults are 20 times more likely to say they are helping family members out because \u201cit is the right thing to do\u201d than because they \u201cwill help me in the future.\u201d\n\nThis level of never-ending parenting is heartening, but it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that providing financial support when you\u2019re near or in retirement\u2014maybe a larger amount, or for a longer period of time than you ever imagined\u2014can deplete your own retirement savings. Are you the \u201cfamily bank? Are you sure you can afford to be? While your generosity might be helpful to your family now\u2013will you have enough saved to fund your personal retirement dreams?\n\nKen Dychtwald is a psychologist, gerontologist, author and CEO of think tank/consultancy Age Wave.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Perhaps the biggest area of self-delusion regarding retirement is that \u201cparenthood\u201d retires when you do.", "title": "Your Kids Will Still Ask for Money When You\u2019re Retired", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/12/09/your-kids-will-still-ask-for-money-when-youre-retired/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Your Kids Will Still Ask for Money When You\u2019re Retired", "description": "Perhaps the biggest area of self-delusion regarding retirement is that \u201cparenthood\u201d retires when you do.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "Perhaps the biggest area of self-delusion regarding retirement is that \u201cparenthood\u201d retires when you do.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-09T18:20:07-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/12/09/your-kids-will-still-ask-for-money-when-youre-retired/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-1892", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Perhaps the biggest area of self-delusion regarding retirement is that \u201cparenthood\u201d retires when you do.", "title": "Your Kids Will Still Ask for Money When You\u2019re Retired", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/12/09/your-kids-will-still-ask-for-money-when-youre-retired/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-1892", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-09T18:20:22-05:00"}, "article_summary": "At the same time, large numbers of us simply don\u2019t know how to say \u201cno\u201d to our kids nor are we very comfortable setting boundaries or fair terms for this financial support.\nAnd among the very wealthy (those with more than $5,000,000 in investible assets), the average five-year family outlay was $313,000!\nIn fact, family subsidies averaged a total of $9,200 over the past five years among people with less than $250,000 in investible assets, and $19,100 for people with between $250,000 and $500,000 in investible assets.\nWhile your generosity might be helpful to your family now\u2013will you have enough saved to fund your personal retirement dreams?\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to get back the money I lent my daughter,\u201d said a focus group participant."}
