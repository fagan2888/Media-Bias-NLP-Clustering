They sought to reach low-income immigrants with limited English proficiency, often missed by mainstream efforts, and enrolled over 600,000 Asian Americans (AA), Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) in 41 languages. Still, says Caballero, there is much more work to be done before the next open enrollment period, beginning November 15th.\n\n\u201cWith the federal online application and website available only in English and Spanish,\" he said, \"Asian Americans had to rely on organizations like our own and others to walk them though the complicated enrollment process.\u201d\n\nSome of the lessons learned included the importance of linguistically and culturally appropriate materials, building partnerships with small businesses and ethnic media, engaging people in their communities to build trust, being sensitive to immigration-related concerns especially for families with mixed immigration statuses, and the importance of simply walking people through the application process one at a time.\n\n\u201cWe have shown that reaching the hardest-to-reach AA and NHPI communities is possible though concerted and dedicated efforts from assistors across the country,\u201d said Doreena Wong, project director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice | Los Angeles, an Action for Health Justice partner organization. \u201cYet, even with these efforts, there is still a gap between needs and resources and that\u2019s where state and federal authorities need to step in.\u201d\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obamacare Shuffle: Three Things to Consider 1:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\nSOCIAL\n\nDespite impact of ACA on AAPI communities, more challenges lie ahead. focus on #workforcediversity #PathwaysofChange pic.twitter.com/RAAqJFBRhs \u2014 Colors of Influence (@ColorsInfluence) September 24, 2014\n\nThe type of assistance most useful to #AAPI community members were in-person assisters/navigators - J.
