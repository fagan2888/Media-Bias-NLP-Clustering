Scott DesJarlais had the scariest year of his life in 2014. And it had nothing to do with his brutal re-election campaign.\n\nThe Republican, who represents the sprawling 4th Congressional District that includes much of Columbia, narrowly escaped the GOP primary. He defeated State Sen. Jim Tracy of Shelbyville by 38 votes, one of the closest primaries in Tennessee history.\n\nThe campaign was bruising for the South Pittsburg physician, 51, and his wife, Amy. It was harsh because of embarrassing ethical and moral issues related to his 2001 divorce from his ex-wife and an affair with a former patient.\n\nBut re-election controversies weren\u2019t the toughest part.\n\nIn July, the Tea Party favorite was diagnosed with cancer in his neck. He started treatment three weeks before the primary election. He was unable to campaign actively against Democrat Lenda Sherrell in the November general election. He was unsure if he would live, let alone return to Congress.\n\n\u201cIt really gives you a change of perspective about the big picture in life, when you\u2019re diagnosed with cancer,\u201d DesJarlais said Tuesday. \u201cI have diagnosed and have helped treat patients with cancer, and it\u2019s one of the most difficult moments in life.\u201d\n\nThe three-term congressman said Tuesday he had a checkup with his oncologist in Chattanooga.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cancer free,\u201d he said. \u201cI was lucky. I was blessed to have my wife, Amy, of 13 years at my side. She\u2019s a nurse. We focused on curing the cancer.\n\n\u201cWe had good team in our campaign. They took all of the stress off of us related to the election.\u201d\n\nDesJarlais said his type of cancer has a 30 percent mortality rate over five years. It\u2019s treatable but often unforgiving.\n\n\u201cBeing a physician, I have diagnosed the same cancer on about dozen patients. I know what it can do. As a cancer patient and physician, I know I have to accept death as a possibility.\n\n\u201cThrough radiation and chemotherapy, I was run down and exhausted. Luckily, I have had great support from the district. I receive lots of calls and letters of support.\u201d\n\nOn election night in August 2014, DesJarlais was unsure if he would return to Washington. The cliffhanger was drama for the media and stressful for his supporters.\n\n\u201cThe media crews were at our headquarters, and they kept asking how we were feeling,\u201d DesJarlais said. \u201cWe were in the middle of cancer treatment, so we were so focused on my recovery.\n\n\u201cThe election result wasn\u2019t the most important thing at that moment. We were relaxed and accepting of whatever happened.\u201d\n\nDesJarlais won a one-sided victory over Sherrell in the general election. She tried to capitalize on DesJarlais\u2019 past and never gained traction with voters as Tracy did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised, frankly, people keep opposing me based on the past,\u201d DesJarlais said. \u201cIf other candidates did opposition research, they would find out 92 percent of the people in my district have heard about my divorce. They also would have found out 82 percent do not care. My divorce started in the 1990s. It\u2019s in the past.\u201d\n\nIn the 2014 campaign, Tracy mailed a flyer one month before election day, rehashing DesJarlais\u2019 indiscretions. It backfired. DesJarlais told voters he had changed and been forgiven.\n\n\u201cI know God has forgiven me. I simply ask my fellow Christians and constituents to consider doing the same for me,\u201d he said then.\n\nVoters gave him another chance, and DesJarlais hopes it puts the past to rest.\n\n\u201cMy opponents are still attacking me on issues four out of five voters do not care about. \u201cVoters want to know where we stand on the issues.\u201d\n\nTracy has not said if he intends to challenge DesJarlais again. The congressman said he\u2019s assuming Tracy will run for re-election to the state Senate.\n\nA newcomer has announced his candidacy. Grant Starrett, a 27-year-old attorney from Murfreesboro, started campaigning last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for Congress because the country I love is endangered by the people in power,\u201d Starrett said on his Facebook page. \u201cAmerica is hurting because of the actions and inactions of those who control the federal government, chief among them President Obama. As a result, the United States faces three crises today: a moral crisis, an economic crisis, and a constitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nStarrett called DesJarlais one of the most liberal members of the Tennessee congressional delegation in comments last week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would call me liberal,\u201d DesJarlais said.\n\nIn fact, DesJarlais said he will center his campaign in 2016 on smaller government and the end of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing continued frustration with Washington and big government,\u201d DesJarlais said. \u201cIt is hitting all facets of life. Voters tell me we have to control overbearing federal government and campaign for better paying jobs in Tennessee. Health-care issue comes up quite a bit, too.\u201d\n\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down Obamacare, DesJarlais said he will not cry for the millions who lose health care coverage. He estimated the number at six to seven million.\n\n\u201cThe messaging is already starting: Millions will lose their subsidies,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, Obamacare was a law that was thrust upon us. It\u2019s not something we wanted. There\u2019s a much high percentage of people paying higher insurance premiums and higher deductibles. Those are the people we should be worried about.\n\n\u201cOpponents are trying to demagogue and paint Republicans as being heartless. We will find a solution, but the solution is not Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWhatever political controversies remain on the horizon, DesJarlais plans to keep them in perspective, considering his personal battles with his life and critics.\n\n\u201cI am running on my record. I am proud of the way I voted and represented my district. I have done exactly what I said I would do,\u201d he said.\n\nJames Bennett is editor of The Daily Herald. Contact him at jbennett@c-dh.net.
