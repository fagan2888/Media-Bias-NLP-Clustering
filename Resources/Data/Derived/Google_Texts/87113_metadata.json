Those in favor of ratification swore it would. But many remained skeptical, arguing that the new general government would undoubtedly try to expand its power and that the Constitution would not sufficiently restrain it.\n\nIt only took a decade for the federal government to prove the anti-federalists right.\n\nDuring the summer of 1798, Congress passed, and President John Adams signed into law, four acts together known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. With winds of war blowing across the Atlantic, the Federalist Party majority wrote the laws to prevent \u201cseditious\u201d acts from weakening the U.S. government. Federalists utilized fear of the French to stir up support for these draconian laws, expanding federal power, concentrating authority in the executive branch and severely restricting freedom of speech.\n\nTwo of the Alien Acts gave the president the power to declare foreign U.S. residents an enemy, lock them up and deport them. These acts vested judicial authority in the executive branch and obliterated due process. The Sedition Act essentially outlawed criticizing the federal government \u2013 a clear violation of the First Amendment.\n\nRecognizing the grave danger these act posed to the basic constitutional structure, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison drafted resolutions that were passed by the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 formalized the principles of nullification as the rightful remedy when the federal government oversteps its authority.\n\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts outraged many in Kentucky. Several counties in the Commonwealth adopted resolutions condemning the acts, including Fayette, Clark, Bourbon, Madison and Woodford. A Madison County Kentucky militia regiment issued an ominous resolution of its own, stating, \u201cThe Alien and Sedition Bills are an infringement of the Constitution and of natural rights, and that we cannot approve or submit to them.\u201d Several thousand people gathered at an outdoor meeting protesting the acts in Lexington on August 13.\n\nThe push to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts was not simply the act of opportunistic politicians. It rose out of the passionate demands of the citizenry in Kentucky, as well as Virginia.\n\nJefferson penned the original draft of the Kentucky Resolutions within a month of Congress passing the Sedition Act.\n\n\u201cThat the several States composing, the United States of America, are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government; but that, by a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes \u2014 delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no force.\u201d\n\nAfter outlining each constitutional violation and overreach of federal power, Jefferson called for action \u2013 nullify now!\n\n\u201cTherefore this commonwealth is determined, as it doubts not its co-States are, to submit to undelegated, and consequently unlimited powers in no man, or body of men on earth: that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general government, being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy; but, where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non f\u0153deris) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nJefferson sent former Virginia ratifying convention delegate Wilson Cary Nicholas a draft of the resolution, likely hoping the state legislator could get them introduced in Virginia. In October, 1798, Wilson indicated that state representative John Breckinridge was willing to introduce the resolutions in Kentucky. Breckinridge suffered from tuberculosis and made a recuperative trip to Sweet Springs, Va. late in August of that year. Nicholas likely gave the Kentucky lawmaker a copy of Jefferson\u2019s draft during that trip.\n\nOn Nov. 7, 1798, Gov. James Garrard addressed the Kentucky state legislature, noting the vehement opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts. He said Kentucky was, \u201cif not in a state of insurrection, yet utterly disaffected to the federal government.\u201d And noted that the state \u201cbeing deeply interested in the conduct of the national government, must have a right to applaud or to censure that government, when applause or censure becomes its due,\u201d urging the legislature to reaffirm its support of the U.S. Constitution while, \u201centering your protest against all unconstitutional laws and impolitic proceedings.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Breckinridge announced to the House he intended to submit resolutions addressing Garrard\u2019s message. The following day, the Fayette County lawmaker followed through, introducing an amended version of Jefferson\u2019s draft. Most notably, Breckinridge omitted the word nullification from the actual version considered by the Kentucky legislature, seeking to moderate the tone of the resolution. Removal of the nullification reference apparently didn\u2019t bother Jefferson, and in fact, did little to change the fundamental thrust of the resolution. By declaring the Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional, null and void, the Kentucky legislature voted on a nullification bill, even with the actual word omitted.\n\nThe resolution passed the House on Nov. 10 with only three dissenting votes. The Senate unanimously concurred three days later, and Gov. Garrard signed the resolution on Nov. 16.\n\nKentucky followed up with a second resolution affirming its position in 1799, notably including the word \u201cnullification,\u201d omitted in the final version of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 passed by the state legislature.\n\n\u201cThe several states who formed that instrument (the Constitution), being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infraction; and, That a nullification, by those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.\u201d\n\nJefferson\u2019s principles have endured for 215 years despite relentless attacks and demagoguery. Americans have appealed to the ideas brilliantly articulated in the Kentucky Resolutions to protect free speech, to promote economic justice, to stop military conscription and to protect the rights of blacks during the fugitive slave era. Jefferson\u2019s words leave no doubt \u2013 nullification was the rightful remedy, and it remains so today.\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note: Much of this article was excerpted from \u201cOur Last Hope: Rediscovering the Lost Path to Liberty.\u201d Pick up a copy at the Tenth Amendment Center store HERE.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "November 10, 1798, the Kentucky resolutions passed the State house.
