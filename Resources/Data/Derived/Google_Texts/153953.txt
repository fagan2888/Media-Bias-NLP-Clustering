Mississippi's Presidential primary is Tuesday and tonight Mississippians can make a trip to Madison Central High School to hear directly from Republican candidate Donald Trump.

When it comes to the issues, according to Trump's campaign website, one of the first things Trump plans to do if elected President is to ask Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The Trump campaign site also says the Trump plan will decrease wait times, improve healthcare outcomes, and facilitate a seamless transition from service into civilian life for our veterans.

If you're interested in hearing from Trump directly, you can start entering the Madison Central High School auditorium at 4 pm.

An overflow area to hear Trump will be set up inside of the school's stadium.

Trump's Mississippi Committee Chairman Attorney Mitch Tyner says the auditorium can hold about 2,500 people and the stadium will seat about 9,000. There's no charge to hear Trump speak but tickets must be downloaded from the eventbrite.com website.

Remember, Mississippi voters can vote in the Presidential primary election tomorrow.
