But there are many simple things large companies do that small businesses don\u2019t, but could, to increase their sales and visibility.\n\nThe new State of Small Business Report by Wasp Barcode Technologies is chock full of insights, but here are three simple big business tactics even the smallest businesses can take on.\n\nMaximize your website\n\nLarge businesses think of their websites as an extension of their business, not just a window sign \u2013 which is a mistake many small businesses make. Though 62 percent of small businesses use their website to outline products and services, only 32 percent of them allow visitors to actually purchase goods online.\n\nSetting up a website has become so easy in recent years, there\u2019s no excuse not to have an e-commerce component. And that doesn\u2019t apply only to physical goods. A sales page can also be a place where your customers schedule appointments, request demos, or more information.\n\nFor customers experiencing a problem, 49 percent of small businesses have a website portal to customer service. That\u2019s great, but it means more than half of small businesses don\u2019t have a feedback form, email address, or phone number designated for support clearly displayed on their sites.\n\nRecommended for You Webcast: Hacking SEO: The Fastest Way to Double Your Rankings in 90 Days\n\nIf you don\u2019t offer an online customer service touch-point, you need to \u2013 and it can be as simple as adding a \u201csupport@yourbusiness.com\u201d email address. If you already have a customer care protocol in place, be sure it\u2019s obvious to your visitors.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just for matters of support \u2013 contact info is a basic necessity that some small businesses aren\u2019t providing.\n\nDon\u2019t make finding your business a scavenger hunt\n\nOddly enough, only 51 percent of small businesses have contact information on their websites, which is puzzling indeed, as not having this info renders your business basically invisible online.\n\nConsumers often consult a business\u2019 website before heading to a brick-and-mortar location. If you don\u2019t provide an address, map, directions, or a phone number to call and ask about business hours, for example, they\u2019ll just skip to the next company on their list. You\u2019d never see a large company not include this info on their site, and it costs you nothing to include it on yours.\n\nAnd here\u2019s something else large companies use that costs you nothing \u2013 social media.\n\nStop pretending social media is optional\n\nThough at a certain level social media analytics can become costly, simply having a presence and consistently contributing to the social conversation is free.\n\nLuckily, overall use of social media platforms among small business owners has increased \u2013 80 percent have joined the social revolution. But still, only 34 percent are using social platforms to respond to consumers\u2019 complaints and praise \u2013 which means they\u2019re not making the most of their social presence. It\u2019s not just about having a profile with \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cfollows.\u201d You\u2019ve got to interact, and build relationships with your followers.\n\nUnderstandably, small businesses may not have the budget for the dedicated marketing and social media personnel large companies enjoy. Wasp found that only 12 percent of small businesses outsource their social media marketing, which means most small businesses are trying to manage social media themselves, or not even bothering.\n\nThe latter is not an option. As for the former \u2013 it\u2019s doable, with a little help. There are plenty of affordable (or even free) platforms for managing social accounts \u2013 Hootsuite, Buffer, Brand24, and more. And remember \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be everywhere. It\u2019s better to have a rockin\u2019, active presence on one social media platform than be barely active on a bunch.\n\nBig businesses aren\u2019t easy to compete with, but small businesses needn\u2019t add to their challenges by failing to do the things they CAN do as well as the \u201cbig guys.\u201d The Wasp report has a ton of insights that will benefit small businesses, but even making a few small changes can make a world of difference. And when you start seeing a return from employing the tips above, you can take things to the next level after that.\n\nMaybe before you know it, your small business will be big after all.\n\nIMAGE CREDIT: BEATE", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "small business best practices, small business websites, social media for small businesses", "og": {"site_name": "Business 2 Community", "description": "There are so many differences between how large and small businesses are run on a day-to-day basis, it might not look like the two have a lot in common.
