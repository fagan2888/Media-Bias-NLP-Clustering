It may have been called other names in the past (such as \u2018guaranteed annual income\u2019) but the basic problem remains unchanged: what\u2019s the right role for government vis-\u00e0-vis the poor?\n\nIn 1969, Nixon (with the assistance of his adviser, Daniel Patrick Moynihan) proposed a \u2018Family Assistance Plan\u2019 that would provide direct cash assistance to all poor families \u2013 a form of guaranteed annual income. Nixon believed this was more efficient than doling out assistance through various programs such as food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid (which FAP was supposed to replace).\n\nFAP may have looked good on paper, but then it hit a trifecta of opposition. Unions thought it threatened the minimum wage; liberals thought the payments were too low; conservatives didn\u2019t like the idea of giving cash indefinitely to everyone who wasn\u2019t working.\n\nThus, by his re-election year of 1972, Nixon realized FAP was dead and settled for something smaller. That \u2018something\u2019 was Supplemental Security Income, or SSI.\n\nAlthough administered by the Social Security Administration, SSI is different than the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. SSDI has an eligibility requirement based on work. SSI was designed for poor disabled or elderly people who didn\u2019t meet SSDI\u2019s basic work history requirement. Also, SSI is funded through general revenues, such as your income taxes. SSDI is funded by Social Security payroll taxes.\n\nA mere eight days before the 1972 election, Nixon signed the legislation enacting SSI. His signing statement (no doubt crafted with an eye to next week\u2019s voters) has as its first SSI goal: \u201cto end the gap that separates far too many older Americans from the mainstream of American life.\u201d Welcome to income inequality demagoguery, 1970s style.\n\nNixon\u2019s statement also positively described SSI as replacing complex state-run systems \u2013 each having its own rules, etc.\n\nLastly, Nixon makes a curious reference in his statement to his failure to get Congress to agree to his welfare reform proposals. I suppose he was trying to signal to voters that welfare reform would remain a priority in a second Nixon term, but I wonder what, if anything, Nixon got from Congress in exchange for a huge expansion of the welfare state. Yes, huge. As Nixon admitted, the estimate for the additional federal cost for enacting SSI (that is, additional to pre-SSI federal benefits provided) was $1.5 billion for just 1974 alone. That\u2019s roughly $10 billion in 2014 dollars.\n\nBy the way, for fiscal 2014, SSI is expected to pay out $60 billion in benefits \u2013 thanks to repeated expansions of the program by Congress. Much of the expansion is related to SSI coverage for mood and affective disorders (AKA \u2018crazy checks\u2019) and children\u2019s benefits.\n\nAnd a special note for you Obamacare cheerleaders: the SSI story ought to be a cautionary tale. SSI became operational in 1974, and just two years later, the GAO declared, in effect, that the program was a mess, rife with staffing and data processing problems. So much for Nixon\u2019s hopes of streamlining a bunch of state-run programs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joanne Butler", "description": "Guaranteed-income programs were started in the '70s, and we haven't been able to get rid of them since.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On this, the 101st anniversary of Richard Nixon\u2019s birth, I\u2019m reminded that the issue of \u2018income inequality\u2019 has been around for decades. \u00a0It may have been called other names in the past (such", "title": "Nixon\u2019s lesson on income inequality", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/09/nixons-lesson-on-income-inequality/", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richard-Nixon-Resignation-e1348170560264.jpg", "height": 197}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Guaranteed-income programs were started in the '70s, and we haven't been able to get rid of them since.", "title": "Nixon\u2019s lesson on income inequality Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/09/nixons-lesson-on-income-inequality/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richard-Nixon-Resignation-e1348170560264.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-09 18:35:42", "sailthru.title": "Nixon's lesson on income inequality", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "richard-nixon,joanne-butler", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "joanne butler,richard nixon", "sailthru.description": "On this, the 101st anniversary of Richard Nixon\u2019s birth, I\u2019m reminded that the issue of \u2018income inequality\u2019 has been around for decades. \u00a0It may have been called other names in the past (such", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richard-Nixon-Resignation-e1348170560264.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ec3\"", "article_summary": "4054534On this, the 101st anniversary of Richard Nixon\u2019s birth, I\u2019m reminded that the issue of \u2018income inequality\u2019 has been around for decades.\nAlthough administered by the Social Security Administration, SSI is different than the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program.\nThat \u2018something\u2019 was Supplemental Security Income, or SSI.\nNixon\u2019s statement also positively described SSI as replacing complex state-run systems \u2013 each having its own rules, etc.\nSSDI is funded by Social Security payroll taxes."}
