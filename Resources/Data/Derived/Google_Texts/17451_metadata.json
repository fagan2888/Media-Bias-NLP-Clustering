City Council member and mayoral candidate David Catania is set to release a 126-page book full of his proposals and plans for running the city. (Mary F. Calvert/For The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the six months of his mayoral campaign, David A. Catania has sought to make the case that his long record as a D.C. Council member makes him better qualified than his rivals to lead the city. Now the independent candidate is pivoting to another message: He has better plans, too.\n\nQuality aside, Catania has now laid out a greater quantity of plans than his leading rivals, Democrat Muriel Bowser and independent Carol Schwartz. He is set to release a lengthy platform, a \u201cVision to Secure Our City\u2019s Future,\u201d on Monday in a bid to portray his campaign as more substantive than the competition.\n\nThe release of the 126-page book comes during a crucial period in the campaign, with summer winding down and voters starting to focus on the race and the first major debate, set for Thursday. It offers a more substantial accounting of Catania\u2019s plan for education \u2014 the signature issue of his campaign \u2014 while also sketching out proposals to address affordable housing, employment, public safety and other issues.\n\n\u201cI understand when you put nearly 130 pages of ideas on paper, it\u2019s a way of leading with your chin, because it opens you up to endless criticisms of what you did or didn\u2019t do right, but I\u2019m willing to do that,\u201d Catania said in an interview.\n\nIn one proposal, Catania said he would seek to guarantee paid parental leave for D.C. workers. While federal law guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave, only California, New Jersey and Washington state mandate that employers offer some amount of paid leave to new parents.\n\nThe proposal could be funded, he said, with a small payroll tax. \u201cWhat we are proposing is not revolutionary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been standard operating procedure in the industrialized world for generations.\u201d\n\nThe release of Catania\u2019s platform comes 10 days after Schwartz released a 15-page education plan, one that proposes to make new efforts to retain veteran teachers, increase city oversight of charter schools and take more aggressive steps to combat truancy. Bowser, meanwhile, has sketched out her platform in a series of brief policy papers on education, affordable housing and homelessness.\n\nOn education, Catania promises to pursue focused improvement plans for underperforming schools, fund an ambitious college scholarship program, bring new focus to special education and increase funding for schools serving \u201cat-risk\u201d students.\n\nThe platform makes no mention of the recent process of redrawing D.C. public school boundaries, which Catania, the chairman of the council\u2019s Education Committee, has criticized. But he does propose to address \u201cdisparities in quality and preparedness\u201d between elementary schools that feed into the same middle and high schools, affecting school quality at the higher grades.\n\nHis proposed solution is \u201cgreater vertical alignment and integration\u201d between schools in the same feeder pattern to ensure more equal levels of readiness. To improve individual schools, Catania proposes establishing a \u201clocal performance framework\u201d that incorporates parent and student satisfaction, teacher retention and other evaluation metrics in addition to test scores.\n\nTo address a dwindling supply of affordable housing, Catania pledges to develop a comprehensive housing plan that \u201cmust produce concrete implementation strategies, not simply general timelines and broad ideas.\u201d A housing plan developed under Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), he said, made valuable recommendations but has not been translated into action.\n\n\u201cIf a specific barrier to increasing affordable housing requires legislative action, the housing plan must give a date certain for the introduction of that legislation,\u201d the platform reads. \u201cIf the study determines funding levels of specific programs are inadequate, it must identify the steps to secure those resources.\u201d\n\nExisting housing programs, such as inclusionary zoning and tax credit programs, must be better utilized, he says, and novel approaches \u2014 such as a long-term tax abatement incentive program used in New York \u2014 also should be pursued.\n\nOn transportation, Catania commits to building out the 37-mile streetcar network favored by Gray, saying \u201cthe system must be sufficiently expansive in order to serve as anything more than a novelty or tourist attraction,\u201d while also endorsing dedicated bus lanes, expanded bicycle facilities east of the Anacostia River, and \u201cnew technologies\u201d such as the ride services Uber and Lyft.\n\nOn health care, Catania pledges to renew his focus on initiatives he pursued during his eight-year stint chairing the council\u2019s Health Committee. On public safety, he promises to improve \u201crecruitment and retention strategies\u201d for police officers and \u201crebuild the culture of excellence\u201d at the ailing Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. For senior citizens, he proposes to create new \u201csenior villages\u201d to support older residents in more city neighborhoods.\n\nAnd, with the platform being released on the day of the first Capitol Hill hearing on D.C. statehood in 21 years, Catania promises a \u201cnew and more expansive strategy\u201d to secure congressional voting rights. That would include, he says, reaching out to supportive state legislatures to build support for D.C. democracy and establishing a political action committee to oppose lawmakers who vote against the District\u2019s interests.\n\nSome excerpts from Catania\u2019s platform\n\nOn improving D.C. Public Schools: \u201cAs Mayor, David will accelerate school improvement by creating a local performance framework that measures outcomes of all kinds, not simply test scores. From parent and student satisfaction to teacher retention, the framework will provide an open and accountable way to measure school progress. It will prioritize delivering the resources, flexibility, and autonomy schools require to meet the specific needs of the school and its students.\u201d\n\nOn the University of the District of Columbia: \u201cDavid will make recruiting a top tier president for UDC a priority from the outset of his administration. He will look for someone with energy, boldness of vision, and record of delivering results.. . . . Because UDC has for too long been under resourced, he will invest capital funds to give the University the same quality facilities that other state universities enjoy.\u201d\n\nOn affordable housing: \u201cThe District must develop a comprehensive housing plan that . . . look[s] at the entirety of the District\u2019s housing landscape and develop[s] specific data-driven solutions to identified problems. Further, it must produce concrete implementation strategies, not simply general timelines and broad ideas. . . . Ideas without action will not solve the District\u2019s affordable housing crisis.\u201d\n\nOn the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department: \u201cAs Mayor, David will bring labor and management to the table to improve the Department\u2019s work culture, build an environment of mutual respect, and create a plan for improvement of the Department. . . . And importantly, he will ensure the Department has the leadership to restore a culture of excellence throughout D.C. Fire and EMS.\u201d\n\nOn Metro: \u201cTo ensure that Metro Momentum becomes a reality, the entire region will need to prioritize the plan\u2019s funding. As Mayor, David will ensure that the District leads the effort with our regional and federal partners to create a dedicated funding mechanism for this vital investment in our collective future. Failing to do so will result in a future Metro system that is over-crowded, unreliable, inadequate, and unsafe.\u201d\n\nOn transportation: \u201cFrom Uber and Lyft to Sidecar and Car2Go, District residents are benefiting from the recent expansion of transportation options made possible through mobile technologies. As Mayor, David will support and encourage the growth of these services and at the same time explore ways to reduce unnecessary regulations affecting the competitiveness of the District\u2019s taxi industry.\u201d\n\nOn D.C. voting rights: \u201cBecause Congress continues to be either unwilling or unable to address these issues, it is time to begin building momentum and support for our cause elsewhere. As Mayor, David will pursue a state legislative strategy, identifying and fostering support among like-minded state legislators and legislatures to expand support for statehood and congressional voting representation for District residents. David will lead that effort and will not rest until our goals are achieved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Release of long \u2018Vision to Secure Our City\u2019s Future\u2019 is meant to sow doubts about rivals\u2019 vision for D.C.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Release of long \u2018Vision to Secure Our City\u2019s Future\u2019 is meant to sow doubts about rivals\u2019 vision for D.C.", "title": "With lengthy platform, David Catania says he is the mayoral candidate of substance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/with-lengthy-platform-david-catania-says-he-is-the-mayoral-candidate-of-substance/2014/09/14/e7caa15a-3acc-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/12/Local/Images/BOWSER_7121405127947.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, David Catania, David Catania platform, David Catania vision, David Catania issues, David Catania DC, DC mayor race, Carol Schwartz, Muriel Bowser, DC mayor platforms, DC mayor issues", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e7caa15a-3acc-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, David Catania, David Catania platform, David Catania vision, David Catania issues, David Catania DC, DC mayor race, Carol Schwartz, Muriel Bowser, DC mayor platforms, DC mayor issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd205c\"", "article_summary": "D.C.
