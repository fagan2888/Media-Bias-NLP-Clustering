People were still coming in at 7:30 p.m., even though doors were to be locked at 7:00. There were so many people, Bannock County Democrats decided to let people who just wanted to submit a vote to do it early.

Bernie Sanders supporters definitely dominated the room, taking up their own half.

There's been a number of shouting matches between Sanders camp and Hillary Clinton’s camp.

Some first time caucus goers said they felt the passion from this year’s campaign.

Jared Adams, a Sanders supporter, said, "He's been on the right side of history so far from the, the civil rights movement on up. He's the first person I can support to actually bother to take part."

Jim Moffit, a Clinton supporter, said, "I believe in Hillary, I believed in Hillary eight years ago. I still think a woman should be given the opportunity to try.”

In Bonneville County, it was also busy at Skyline High School.

Those supporting Bernie Sanders had a majority of voters, but there was also a decent number of undecided voters who still aren't sure who they want.

Kade Marquez, an undecided voter, said “I'm just really trying to learn what are the points, the pro Hillary side has, what are the points the pro-Berny side has and I was going to make my decision out of those.”

The voting results are still getting tallied, we'll let you know as soon as we have them.
