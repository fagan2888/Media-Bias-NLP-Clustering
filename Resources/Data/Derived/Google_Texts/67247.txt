Donald Trump

Why is he here? Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has the money to fund his own campaign and is using it. He is the clear front-runner in opinion polls for the Republican presidential nomination.

Strengths: He has tapped into the anti-Washington, anti-immigrant strain of the Republican Party.

Weaknesses: His comments have also turned off large elements of the GOP electorate. In the WMUR Granite State Poll, 29 percent of likely New Hampshire primary voters said they would not vote for him under any circumstances, a higher percentage than any other candidate.

How he can win: Republican voters continue to applaud his outspokeness and willingness to take on the GOP establishment.

Quote: "I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich."
