It\u2019s not the typical water color.\u201d\n\nGerman canoeist Max Hoff lost a 1,000-meter race Saturday that Pimenta won, and said he got tangled in weeds.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Games is the most important race we have all of the year,\u201d Hoff said. \u201cAnd for that, we should have the best conditions we can get.\u201d\n\nHoff also said the lagoon was too shallow __ he estimated 2 meters deep and said rules specified it must be twice that deep - and too windy.\n\n\u201cThey have to make a fence - 1,000 meters long - along both sides of the course, that if there (is) wind starting we can go into this lane,\u201d Hoff said.\n\nCanoeists said they tried to take precautions with the contaminated water, cleaning their paddles and hands and limiting contact with the water.\n\nThe lagoon in central Rio registered the highest viral readings in AP\u2019s study with a low of 17.3 million viruses per liter, and a high just over 1 billion.\n\nWater experts contacted by AP said a level of 1,000 per liter would be considered \u201chighly alarming.\u201d\n\nCarlos Nuzman, head of the Rio organizing committee, said several days ago that viral testing would be done in Rio\u2019s waters. He did not say when.\n\nThis was a reversal after previously saying - along with the International Olympic Committee - that bacterial testing was sufficient.\n\nOrganizers said, however, that they would not move any of the venues no matter what the viral tests showed.\n\n___\n\nTo see the AP\u2019s summary findings and methodology of its study on Rio\u2019s water quality: http://apne.ws/1IFxS9h\n\n___\n\nFilipe de Almeida of AP partner agency SNTV contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nStephen Wade on Twitter: http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "The second day of an Olympic canoeing test event on Saturday brought more complaints about weeds floating in Rio de Janeiro's polluted course, with canoeists saying it was too shallow and needed to be dredged.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The second day of an Olympic canoeing test event on Saturday brought more complaints about weeds floating in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s polluted course, with canoeists saying it was too shallow and needed to be dredged.", "title": "Rio Olympic canoeing test event hit with worries over weeds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/rio-olympic-canoeing-test-event-hit-with-worries-o/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/66a43410ed082927810f6a7067006914.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/66a43410ed082927810f6a7067006914.jpg", "description": "The second day of an Olympic canoeing test event on Saturday brought more complaints about weeds floating in Rio de Janeiro's polluted course, with canoeists saying it was too shallow and needed to be", "card": "summary", "title": "Rio Olympic canoeing test event hit with worries over weeds"}, "Author": "STEPHEN WADE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - The second day of an Olympic canoeing test event on Saturday brought more complaints about weeds floating in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s polluted course, with canoeists saying it was too shallow and needed to be dredged.\n___To see the AP\u2019s summary findings and methodology of its study on Rio\u2019s water quality: http://apne.ws/1IFxS9h___Filipe de Almeida of AP partner agency SNTV contributed to this report.\n\u201cThe Olympic Games is the most important race we have all of the year,\u201d Hoff said.\nIt\u2019s not the typical water color.\u201dGerman canoeist Max Hoff lost a 1,000-meter race Saturday that Pimenta won, and said he got tangled in weeds.\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s clear is that the race course must be cleared,\u201d Portuguese canoeist Fernando Pimenta said."}
