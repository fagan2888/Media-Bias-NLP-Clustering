New hotness: Claiming \u201cbullied\u201d status because of a sales pitch. Department-store clerks have pitched revolving credit accounts at shoppers since I worked at Sears as a teenager, where I got a couple of performance awards for getting the most signups during promotions. Today, however, almost a third of shoppers surveyed by Credit.com consider themselves to having been \u201cbullied,\u201dand almost as many report caving in to the sales pitch:\n\nIt\u2019s almost Black Friday and millions of Americans will flood into stores to buy their big purchases for the holiday season. But, as a recent Credit.com survey reveals, mounting pressure from store clerks to open store credit cards leaves many Americans feeling bullied while holiday shopping. A survey conducted by Credit.com found that 31 percent \u2013 or three in ten Americans \u2013 feel bullied when the store clerk asks if they\u2019d like to open a store credit card to receive a discount. And, customers aren\u2019t a fan of the pressure tactic: Almost half (49 percent) regret their decision to open a store card during the holiday season and more than half (57 percent) of shoppers say they avoid returning to the store where they felt bullied. The November 2014 survey was conducted online among 1,320 Americans ages 18 and older.\n\nBullied? Seriously? Heaven help these wilting lilies if they ever have to buy a car or a house rather than a blender or a sweater. The cash-wrap pitch is hardly a replay of Glengarry Glen Ross, anyway. The stores pitch their cards in order to build customer loyalty, but they don\u2019t want people walking away from their already-selected purchases either. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of these so-called \u201cbullying\u201d tactics for years without having some part-timer twist my arm into opening new lines of credit.\n\nThe source of this survey provides the context. Credit.com is a credit-management service that caters to those who feel as though they are not in control of their own finances. That\u2019s a legitimate industry that helps a lot of people, but it\u2019s also in their interest to paint consumers as victims of cashiers with daydreams of pin money dancing in their heads. Their business is helping people find control of their credit, so highlighting a sense of victimhood plays to their own sales pitches.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us should take this seriously, but the Washington Post\u2019s Michelle Singletary does, even while acknowledging that a firm \u201cno\u201d is all it takes to deal with the pitch. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t feel bullied,\u201d she writes, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have a game plan to avoid the temptation\u201d of opening a revolving credit account to get momentary discounts. She then provides a script for shoppers to use:\n\nThe cashier says: \u201cSign up and save. If you apply today, you can get an additional fill in the blank with the percentage savings off your purchase.\u201d You say: \u201cAre there any other discounts you are offering for the holiday that can save me money that don\u2019t involve me getting more credit I don\u2019t need?\u201d The cashier says: \u201cIt only takes a few minutes to fill out the application.\u201d You say: \u201cBut applying for new credit can result in an inquiry on my credit report, and that can lower my credit score. Do you think that\u2019s a good deal?\u201d The cashier, undaunted, says: \u201cYou really could save a lot of money. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to sign up?\u201d You say: \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but getting new credit can lower my credit score, and that means I have to pay more for other things I may get on credit in the future, such as a home or car.\u201d\n\nThis is probably the worst advice one could give in this instance. If someone wants to avoid the temptation of a sales pitch, asking open-ended questions for more information about the offer is the least effective way to do so. It\u2019s an open invitation to the cashier to trot out an array of arguments designed to overcome your skepticism and wear down your resistance. It may not be quite the equivalent of a red flag in front of a bull, but it\u2019s guaranteed to get the clerk salivating. After all, they certainly think that getting you to fill out a credit app is a very good idea \u2026 for themselves. Why give them the opportunity to extend their pitch at all?\n\nLet\u2019s try this again, this time with an effective strategy:\n\nCASHIER: Sign up and save. If you apply today, you can get an additional fill in the blank with the percentage savings off your purchase. YOU: No, thank you. CASHIER: It only takes a few minutes to fill out the application. YOU: I\u2019m not interested in getting your credit card regardless of how long it takes. CASHIER: You really could save a lot of money. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to sign up? YOU: I heard you the first time. I\u2019m not interested. Either ring this up now or I\u2019ll go somewhere else with my cash money.\n\nThis isn\u2019t brain surgery. You are the customer. You are in control of the situation at all times. No one is required to buy merchandise they bring to a cash register \u2014 or for that matter, to keep a revolving credit account open. If you open one and regret it, close the account and pay off the balance. Save the whining about being \u201cbullied\u201d for those who are truly victims, rather than claim that status because you lacked the fortitude to withstand a silly sales pitch at the register.\n\nUpdate: Corrected a grammatical error.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "N.
