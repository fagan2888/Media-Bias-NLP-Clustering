Asked by CNN anchor Jake Tapper whether he backs Trump, Ryan responded: "I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party. And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee."
