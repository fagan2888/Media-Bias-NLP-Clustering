I saw that, in this country, people trying to make ends meet in such a fashion still had to resort to food-benefit programs and charity. I saw an employee fired for stealing lunches from the break room refrigerator to feed himself. I watched as a co-worker secretly brought her two kids into the store and left them to wander alone for hours because she couldn\u2019t afford childcare. (As it happens, 29 percent of low-wage employees are single parents.)\n\nAt that point, having worked at the State Department for 24 years, I had been booted out for being a whistle-blower. I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen to me next and so took a series of minimum wage jobs. Finding myself plunged into the low-wage economy was a sobering, even frightening, experience that made me realize just how ignorant I had been about the lives of the people who rang me up at stores or served me food in restaurants. Though millions of adults work for minimum wage, until I did it myself I knew nothing about what that involved, which meant I knew next to nothing about twenty-first-century America.\n\nI was lucky. I didn\u2019t become one of those millions of people trapped as the \u201cworking poor.\u201d I made it out. But with all the election talk about the economy, I decided it was time to go back and take another look at where I had been, and where too many others still are.\n\nMy Working Life Now\n\nI found things were pretty much the same in 2016 as they were in 2012, which meant\u2014because there was no real improvement\u2014that things were actually worse.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/walmart_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Peter Van Buren", "description": "When presidential candidate Bernie Sanders talks about income inequality, and when other candidates speak about the minimum wage and food stamps, what are they really talking about?
