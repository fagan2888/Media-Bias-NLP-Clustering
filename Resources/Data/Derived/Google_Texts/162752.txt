Sylvia Mathews Burwell, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is scheduled to visit Palm Beach County on Thursday, according to an email from Deputy County Administrator Jon Van Arnam.

Burwell, appointed by President Obama in 2014, is likely to be visiting to urge people to sign up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act.

Van Arnam told county commissioners that Burwell, whose visit is being coordinated by the Health Council of Southeast Florida, could be available to meet with county officials early in the afternoon.

No firm location has been selected for Burwellâ€™s visit.
