Black said Americans should be free to battle out their political ideas without a government overseer ruling whether what they say is true.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the government (i.e., the Ohio Elections Commission) deciding what is political truth \u2014 for fear that the government might persecute those who criticize it,\u201d Judge Black wrote in his opinion. \u201cInstead, in a democracy, the voters should decide.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: EDITORIAL: Ohio\u2019s ill-conceived political campaign truth squad on trial\n\nThe ruling came the same day that the Republicans in the U.S. Senate filibustered to block a proposed constitutional amendment that would have given Congress and the states powers to restrict election spending by political candidates and to outright ban political spending by corporations.\n\nDemocrats had pushed the constitutional amendment in part to clamp down on what they say is a flood of false attacks paid for by wealthy conservative businessmen.\n\nIn the Ohio case, Judge Black\u2019s ruling closes out a four-year-old lawsuit that began when the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life political group, wanted to post billboards accusing an incumbent U.S. House Democratic lawmaker of having voted to support government funding for abortion because he voted for Obamacare.\n\nThen-Rep. Steve Driehaus vehemently disputed that connection, arguing Obamacare didn\u2019t pay for abortions.\n\nHe challenged the billboards under an Ohio law that declared it illegal to publish or broadcast \u201ca false statement concerning the voting record\u201d of a candidate. The law also gives the power to decide truth and falsehood to the state elections commission.\n\nJudge Black, an Obama appointee to the bench, spotted several problems with the law.\n\nHe said some candidates have figured out ways to manipulate the system and \u201csilence\u201d their political opponents by filing frivolous complaints, which force the opponents to spend money and time fighting before the commission. He also said there\u2019s no urgency on the commission to make quick decisions, which means groups can be silenced just as a campaign is hitting a key time.\n\nBut he said the biggest objection is that in political speech, it\u2019s not always possible to tell truth and falsehood \u2014 and that judgment should be left to voters, not the government.\n\nHe quoted Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d show in making his ruling: \u201cThe more modern recitation of this longstanding and fundamental principle of American law was recently articulated by Frank Underwood in \u2018House of Cards\u2019: \u2018There\u2019s no better way to overpower a trickle of doubt than with a flood of naked truth.\u2019 \u201c\n\nA spokesman said neither Attorney General Mike DeWine nor the lawyers who defended the election commission had a comment on the ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court earlier this year had ruled that the SBA List had standing to sue, which allowed the case to continue.\n\n\u201cAfter four years and a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court, today we finally have a victory for free speech,\u201d said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser.\n\nLast week a federal appeals court issued a similar ruling against a Minnesota law that tried to weed out false political ads.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington on Thursday, Democrats saw their attempt to amend the Constitution to limit campaign speech die at the hands of a GOP filibuster.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid had pushed the amendment as a way to combat what he said was a flood of false ads attacking Democratic senators and paid for by wealthy conservative businessmen.\n\nRepublicans countered that if the amendment were to succeed \u2014 requiring a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate, and three-fourths of states to ratify it \u2014 it would have been the first changes in history to the First Amendment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge struck down Ohio's campaign truth squad Thursday, issuing a significant First Amendment decision that pushes the state out of the business of trying to referee \"political truth\" in campaign advertising.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal judge struck down Ohio\u2019s campaign truth squad Thursday, issuing a significant First Amendment decision that pushes the state out of the business of trying to referee \u201cpolitical truth\u201d in campaign advertising.", "title": "Federal judge rejects Ohio law requiring truth in campaign advertising", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-law-requiring-truth-in-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/11/9_112014_speech8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/11/9_112014_speech8201.jpg", "description": "A federal judge struck down Ohio's campaign truth squad Thursday, issuing a significant First Amendment decision that pushes the state out of the business of trying to referee \"political truth\" in cam", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Federal judge rejects Ohio law requiring truth in campaign advertising"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Timothy S Black, Supreme Court, Frank Underwood, State Elections Commission"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda21a\"", "article_summary": "A federal judge struck down Ohio\u2019s campaign truth squad Thursday, issuing a significant First Amendment decision that pushes the state out of the business of trying to referee \u201cpolitical truth\u201d in campaign advertising.\nLast week a federal appeals court issued a similar ruling against a Minnesota law that tried to weed out false political ads.\n\u201cWe do not want the government (i.e., the Ohio Elections Commission) deciding what is political truth \u2014 for fear that the government might persecute those who criticize it,\u201d Judge Black wrote in his opinion.\nThe law also gives the power to decide truth and falsehood to the state elections commission.\nJudge Black, an Obama appointee to the bench, spotted several problems with the law."}
