Clinton also touted the millions of dollars in exports from New Hampshire small businesses that Ex-Im has supported over the years.\n\n\u201cThey should know better,\u201d she said of the Republicans opposing the bank. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\nClinton previously spoke of her support for the bank at an event in November, where she said Ex-Im helps the United States remain competitive in the global market.\n\n>>> A Key Conservative Group Is Opposing the Export-Import Bank. But Some of Its Members Continue to Support It.\n\nMany of the bank\u2019s backers, including Clinton\u2019s fellow Democratic 2016 candidate Martin O\u2019Malley, argue Ex-Im supports jobs in the United States. But, the argument is often a point of contention for those who believe the bank\u2019s life should end.\n\nA 2011 report from the American Action Forum contended that while Ex-Im creates jobs in specific industries, it \u201credistributes\u201d jobs across the economy. Additionally, a 2013 report from the Government Accountability Office found that Ex-Im\u2019s methodology for calculating job creation makes it difficult to determine how the bank\u2019s financing affects employment.\n\nThe agency\u2019s charter expires June 30, and the issue has become the topic of discussion not only on Capitol Hill, but also on the campaign trail, where a number of Republican and Democratic prospective presidential candidates are addressing Ex-Im\u2019s future.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas is one of Ex-Im\u2019s staunchest opponents. Hensarling, whose committee has jurisdiction over the bank, spoke out against Clinton\u2019s defense of Ex-Im.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is a natural cheerleader for the Export-Import Bank,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAfter all, Ex-Im\u2019s biggest beneficiaries are foreign governments and giant corporations. Conveniently, these just happen to be among the biggest donors to the Clinton Foundation as well as major underwriters of the speaking fees that added millions of dollars to the Clinton bank account.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton joined the debate over Ex-Im's reauthorization today and came out in support of the embattled agency.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton joined the debate over Ex-Im's reauthorization today and came out in support of the embattled agency.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Announces Support for Ex-Im Reauthorization", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150522_HillaryExIm_Quinn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Ak2rTz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton joined the debate over Ex-Im's reauthorization today and came out in support of the embattled agency.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Announces Support for Ex-Im Reauthorization", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150522_HillaryExIm_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-05-22T14:54:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, Martin O\u2019Malley, Jeb Hensarling, House Financial Services Committee, Clinton Foundation, Boeing"}, "article_summary": "Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton joined the debate over the Export-Import Bank\u2019s reauthorization today and came out in support of the embattled 80-year-old agency.\n\u201cHillary Clinton is a natural cheerleader for the Export-Import Bank,\u201d he said in a statement.\nConveniently, these just happen to be among the biggest donors to the Clinton Foundation as well as major underwriters of the speaking fees that added millions of dollars to the Clinton bank account.\u201d\nWhile speaking at the Smuttynose Brewery, Clinton criticized the GOP for jeopardizing 164,000 jobs supported by Ex-Im.\nClinton also touted the millions of dollars in exports from New Hampshire small businesses that Ex-Im has supported over the years."}
