This accusation comes just days after Europe issued a new round of harsh sanctions against Moscow, putting the continent\u2019s economic future in peril.\n\nRelated: Russian Oligarchs Are Tired of Funding Putin\u2019s Land Grab\n\n\u201cThe Russian leader described Washington\u2019s course of ramping up sanctions pressure as counterproductive, causing serious damage to bilateral relations and international stability in general,\u201d the Kremlin in a statement.\n\nThe White House, for its part, saw things differently.\n\n\u201cThe president reiterated his deep concerns about Russia\u2019s increased support for the separatists in Ukraine,\u201d the White House said in a statement of its own. \u201cThe president reinforced his preference for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nUnscripted remarks made by President Obama Friday show just how difficult solving the Ukraine crisis has become. Obama said it was difficult to check Putin because \u201cpeople don't always act rationally,\u201d meaning that Putin is not acting in a way that would promote Russia\u2019s rational interests.\n\nThis is what makes guessing Putin\u2019s next move so difficult. The international community has taken nearly every step at its disposal short of arming Ukraine or sending troops to keep Russia from meddling with Ukraine\u2019s territorial sovereignty. Yet no one knows what he will do next.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Bold Power Play in America\u2019s Backyard\n\nHe has two options; the first is to strike back against the international community. The second is to play dead and live to fight another day in the wake of the anger over the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley say if Putin decides to fight, his primary weapon will be gas.\n\n\u201cWe think Putin now faces a stark choice between a pragmatic response, supporting de-escalation in Ukraine in return for neutrality, decentralization and the lifting of sanctions \u2014 or what we characterize as a \u2018patriotic\u2019 response, in which Putin focuses on support to the pro-Russian separatist movement in Ukraine, which could trigger a further tightening of sanctions and deepen the divide with the West,\" Jacob Nell and Alina Slyusarchuk wrote in a Morgan Stanley research note circulated among clients last week.\n\n\u201cWe think that Russia could block transit of gas through Ukraine to Europe, pending settlement by Naftogaz of outstanding debt and might also allow a decline in oil exports, which could add a geopolitical risk premium to the oil price,\u201d the authors added.\n\nIrrational choice\n\nGiven Russia\u2019s need for European energy supplies, Putin\u2019s rational play would be to keep oil flowing west. However, as Obama suggested, Putin is not acting rationally.\n\nRelated: Did Russia Just Push the World to the Brink of War?\n\n\u201cWe are skeptical at this stage that Russia would block oil exports, given the disruptive impact this would have on the budget (oil accounts for 44 percent of federal budget revenues) and trade (oil accounts for 54 percent of exports),\" Slyusarchuk and Nell wrote.\n\nOthers believe that Russia has too much at stake in Ukraine to back down.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin has invested too much to be able to publicly back down at this stage,\u201d Alisa Lockwood, head of Europe and CIS Country Analysis at IHS Economic and Country Risk said in a note. \u201cHarsher sanctions are likely to bring counter-measures that Russia has until now sought to avoid due to the domestic economic impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis strategy has shown a total lack of understanding of today's globalized world,\u201d added Edward Goldberg, a professor at Baruch College and the New York University Center for Global Affairs. \u201cGrievances and believing that Russia still has a historic need for buffer states have distorted his reality to the point where his actions have dramatically hurt Russia's long-term interests.\u201d\n\nWay to Save Face?\n\nThere could be a deal in the works that would allow both sides to save face. The Independent newspaper in the UK reported Thursday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Putin were close to a deal that would have allowed Russia to keep Crimea in exchange for allowing Ukraine to build economic ties with Europe and a steady, secure supply of energy to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Independent, the deal fell apart after the Malaysian Airline flight went down. Sources close to the deal said that it is now being reconsidered.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The international community has isolated Russian President Vladimir Putin.
