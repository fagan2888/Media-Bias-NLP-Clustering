South Bend saw a bit of sparkle today.

Dozens of little girls and their families gathered at The Well in River Park dressed as princesses.

It was to raise money for a local war veteran, Brian Cuyler, who is fighting stage 4 brain cancer.

4-year-old Milah Cuyler got to be a princess for the day, something she sees in her mom Lauran every day.

Lauran and her family haven't had it easy, after two tours in Iraq, Lauran’s husband Brian is now fighting brain cancer.

“I know that her family through a rough time and I just want Milah to know that she’s special and that this is for her and her family and for her to have wonderful time,” said Princess Fundraiser Organizer Shelby Aemmer.

Lauran’s best friend Shelby Aemmer organized the princess fundraiser to help ease some of those burdens, and show them a good time.

She even dressed like Milah’s favorite princess—Ariel, from “A Little Mermaid.”

A $5 ticket gave guests access to games, karaoke, food and prizes.

All proceeds from the event will go towards the family’s medical bills.

“It’s a blessing because it helps me, I have this big support system so does Brian and it just means a lot to see how many people out there care and it’s just amazing,” Lauran Cuvlar explained.

Many of those who care said they don’t even know the Cuylers, but heard their story, and wanted to help.

“You don’t have to know the family, it’s a great thing to come together and just support. If my family ever goes through something like this, I know I can count on our community,” said South Bend Resident Jessica Trippel.

If you would like to help, a go fund me page has also been set up for the Cuyler family.
