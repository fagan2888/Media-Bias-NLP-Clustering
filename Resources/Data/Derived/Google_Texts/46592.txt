A new ad from U.S. Sen. Mark Udall attacking Congressman Cory Gardner on abortion and birth control ends with a message that seems awfully familiar to gubernatorial hopeful Tom Tancredo.

“You have the right to live life on your own terms, to make your own choices,” Udall says in the spot, which debuted today.

“Oh man, that son of a buck!” Tancredo said with a laugh, when he heard about Udall’s sign off.

That’s because Tancredo’s campaign slogan for months has been “Freedom to live your life.” It’s printed on his campaign T-shirts.

Obviously, Udall, a Democrat, and Tancredo, a Republican — who served together in the U.S. House — don’t agree a lot on issues. But Tancredo had some fun with Udall for, as he said, “borrowing” his campaign slogan.

Meanwhile, the Colorado Republican Party took Udall’s message and put its own spin on it.
