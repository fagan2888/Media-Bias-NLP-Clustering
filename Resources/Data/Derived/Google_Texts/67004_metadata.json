Pasco and Hernando do not. Pinellas has one, which is absolutely amazing, and they want to expand it. We\u2019ve told the state colleges the bottom line is we need to find a way to provide more access.\u201d\n\nThe proposed bill comes the year after the law changed to require that school districts pay tuition costs for students taking free dual-enrollment courses at state colleges. Before that, colleges absorbed the costs. HCC works with the Hillsborough school district to offer more dual-enrollment courses at high schools instead of at the college to alleviate some of the cost, said college spokeswoman Ashley Carl.\n\nNearly 500 Hillsborough high-schoolers are enrolled in dual-enrollment classes at HCC.\n\n\u201cWe would hope any legislation would look at the success HCC and our school district has together in our Collegiate Academy and our dual-enrollment program to benefit students in high school,\u201d Carter said.\n\nWhat sets a collegiate high school apart from a typical dual-enrollment program is that it spans four years, the students go through a competitive applications process to get in, and they have the opportunity to leave high school with a degree under their belts.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nTo enroll, students must pass Algebra 1 and maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Their standardized test scores in math, reading and writing are also considered.\n\nAny student in the school district who meets the requirements can apply.\n\nOnce in the program, they juggle rigorous honors courses with college-level classes at the school\u2019s campus on West Sligh Avenue. To stay in the Collegiate Academy, students must keep their grades up.\n\n\u201cThe rigor is definitely college level,\u201d said Sean Hensley, who oversees Leto\u2019s academy as a lead teacher. \u201cThey learn how to budget, how to take personal time, how to make sure you\u2019re not overworking yourself.\u201d\n\nIn addition to creating a more challenging experience for students, collegiate high schools target students from demographics that are underrepresented in college campuses across the country \u2014 minorities and those from low-income families, for example.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the Leto Collegiate Academy students will be first-generation college students, including Christopher, who says he wants to be a professional baseball player one day and a video-game designer. He said taking college-level classes has been tough but worth it.\n\n\u201cIt challenges us to be more responsible,\u201d he said.\n\nNinth-grader Gleisy Cruz, 15, will also be the first in her family to go to college.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only have to go to undergraduate for two years and we can start our career before anyone else,\u201d Gleisy said.\n\nSchool district spokesman Stephen Hegarty said district officials are talking about expanding collegiate academies to other high schools. Nearly 2,000 students applied for a spot at one of the three sites this school year, so more than half were turned away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very much in demand,\u201d Hegarty said. \u201cNo decisions have been made, but it\u2019s up for serious discussion.\u201d\n\nCollegiate academy also inspires students who aren\u2019t in it, said Shelley Olson, who teaches a vocabulary improvement class in Leto\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018How can I get into this?\u2019 It\u2019s a big motivation to keep their grades up.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: In an earlier version of this story, the last name of Hillsborough Community College spokeswoman Ashley Carl was incorrect.\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7999\n\nTwitter: @ErinKTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 16 Feb 2014 01:01:00 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2013 When Christopher Ruiz finishes high school in a few years, he aims to have an associate\u2019s degree under his belt and be well on his way to graduating from a four-year university", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2013 When Christopher Ruiz finishes high school in a few years, he aims to have an associate\u2019s degree under his belt and be well on his way to graduating from a four-year university", "title": "Legg  pushes for associate\u2019s degrees for high school students", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/senate-bill-calls-for-increase-in-number-of-collegiate-high-schools-in-florida-20140216/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140216/ARTICLE/140219435/AR/0/AR-140219435.jpg", "height": 451}, "updated_time": "2014-02-16T14:05:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2013 When Christopher Ruiz finishes high school in a few years, he aims to have an associate\u2019s degree under his belt and be well on his way to graduating from a four-year universit", "title": "Legg  pushes for associate\u2019s degrees for high school students", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140216/ARTICLE/140219435/AR/0/AR-140219435.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-16T01:01:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-16T14:05:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "collegiate high school"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2322\"", "article_summary": "School district spokesman Stephen Hegarty said district officials are talking about expanding collegiate academies to other high schools.\nArmwood and Lennard high schools also started Collegiate Academies this school year and the three have 190 students enrolled from all over the county.\nTo stay in the Collegiate Academy, students must keep their grades up.\nWhat sets a collegiate high school apart from a typical dual-enrollment program is that it spans four years, the students go through a competitive applications process to get in, and they have the opportunity to leave high school with a degree under their belts.\nAbout 70 percent of the Leto Collegiate Academy students will be first-generation college students, including Christopher, who says he wants to be a professional baseball player one day and a video-game designer."}
