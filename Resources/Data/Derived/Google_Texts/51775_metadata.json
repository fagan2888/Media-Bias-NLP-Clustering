In the old days, he writes, journalists \u201cdealt with political science episodically and condescendingly.\u201d But now, Klein declares, \u201cWashington is listening to political scientists, in large part because it\u2019s stopped trusting itself.\u201d Klein finds that political scientists give better answers to his questions than politicians themselves, because politicians are evasive but scientists are scientists, you know, they deal in \u201cstructural explanations\u201d for political events. So the \u201cyoung political journalists\u201d who are roaring around town in their white lab coats frightening the local bourgeoisie \u201cknow a lot more about political science and how to use it\u201d than their elders did.\n\nHence Klein\u2019s title: \u201cHow Political Science Conquered Washington.\u201d\n\nNearly every aspect of this argument annoyed me. To suggest, for starters, that people in Washington are\u2014or were, until recently\u2014ignorant or contemptuous of academic expertise is like saying the people of Tulsa have not yet heard about this amazing stuff called oil. Not only does Washington routinely fill the No. 1 spot on those \u201cmost educated cities\u201d articles, but the town positively seethes with academic experts. Indeed, it is the only city I know of that actually boasts a sizable population of fake experts, handing out free-market wisdom to passers-by from their subsidized seats at Cato and Heritage.\n\nThe characteristic failing of D.C. isn\u2019t that it ignores these herds of experts, it\u2019s that it attends to them with a gaping credulity that they do not deserve. Worse: In our loving, doting attentiveness to the people we conceive to be knowledgeable authorities, we have imported into our politics all the traditional maladies of professionalism.\n\nThe powerful in Powertown love to take refuge in bewildering professional jargon. They routinely ignore or suppress challenging ideas, just as academics often ignore ideas that come from outside their professional in-group. Worst of all, Washingtonians seem to know nothing about the lives of people who aren\u2019t part of the professional-managerial class.\n\nHow well-known is this problem? It is extremely well known. One of the greatest books of them all on American political dysfunction, David Halberstam\u2019s \u201cThe Best and the Brightest\u201d (1972), is the story of how a handful of poli-sci geniuses got us into the Vietnam War. How political science conquered Hanoi, you might say, except that it didn\u2019t exactly work out like that.\n\nYou can see this dysfunction for yourself in the headlines of recent years. Ever wonder why the foreign policy authorities never seem to change, keep coming back, despite racking up shattering failures like the Iraq War? It\u2019s because of the way Washington worships expertise, and the way these authorities have perched themselves atop a professional structure that basically does not acknowledge criticism from the outside.\n\nEver wonder why the economic experts never seem to change, keep coming back, despite racking up such shattering failures as the housing bubble and the financial crisis and the bank bailouts? Ever wonder why a guy like Larry Summers gets to be chief economist at the World Bank, then gets to deregulate Wall Street, then gets to bail Wall Street out, then almost gets to become chairman of the Fed, and then gets to make sage pronouncements on the subject of\u2014yes\u2014 inequality? It\u2019s for the same bad reasons: Because D.C. worships expertise and because Summers, along with a handful of other geniuses, are leading figures in a professional discipline dominated by what a well-informed observer once called a \u201cpolitburo for correct economic thinking.\u201d\n\nSome people are ignored in this town even though they are often right while others are invited back to the Oval Office again and again even though they are repeatedly wrong\u2014and the reason is the pseudo-professional structure of the consensus. No one has described how it works better than Larry Summers himself. \u201cI could be an insider or I could be an outsider,\u201d Elizabeth Warren says Summers told her, back in the bailout days.\n\n\u201cOutsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don\u2019t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People \u2014 powerful people \u2014 listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: They don\u2019t criticize other insiders.\u201d\n\n*\n\nBack to the main point. It is true that some of the hottest deck chairs on the sinking ocean liner known as the press are number-crunching divisions like The New York Times\u2019s \u201cUpshot\u201d section and Ezra Klein\u2019s own former department, the Washington Post\u2019s \u201cWonkblog.\u201d In these corners of the trade, journalists today are no longer content merely to quote political scientists; they aspire instead to be political scientists. Where they once gave us words, they now deal in charts. Graphs! Diagrams!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ezra Klein and his data brigade think political science will save us.
