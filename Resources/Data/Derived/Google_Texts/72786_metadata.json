(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nGOODHUE \u2013 The bats are starting to come around for Goodhue. And in the process, the Goodhue baseball team is finding success on the diamond.\n\nCollecting a total of 19 hits over two games, the Wildcats split a Hiawatha Valley League doubleheader with Pine Island on Saturday. Goodhue scored four runs in the bottom of the seventh inning for a 7-6 Game 1 victory, followed by a 3-2 win for the Panthers in the nightcap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be swinging the bats; our team is playing well together,\u201d said Goodhue senior Logan Breuer, who went 5-for-8 in the doubleheader. \u201cOur bats are coming along and we\u2019re running the bases well and being aggressive. That fundamental stuff is coming around, which is fueling our offense.\u201d\n\nIn Game 1, the Wildcats stayed within a run of Pine Island before the Panthers scored three runs in the sixth and seventh inning combined to go up 6-3 with three outs remaining.\n\nThe three-run deficit was not enough to deter Goodhue.\n\n\u201cI always feel like we\u2019ve got a chance with the guys we have,\u201d said Wildcats head coach Scott Christianson. \u201cYou never know when you\u2019ll start hitting the ball and put the ball in play.\u201d\n\nJordan Ronnigen got the comeback started with an RBI single, and Jacob Pasch made it a one-run game after scoring on a throwing error. Then with two outs, Breuer worked his way to a full count before hitting a sharp grounder up the middle that scored Jack Gadient and Nicholas Thomforde for the game-winning runs.\n\n\u201cAt first, I was just approaching it acting like it was another at-bat. Then about halfway through it, I\u2019m like, \u2018Jeepers, this could be pretty exciting for me,\u2019\u201d Breuer said. \u201cMy teammates put me in the right position and got on base. It\u2019s a team game, they played really good and got me in position for that.\u201d\n\nChristianson added, \u201cThe last few games, ever since we came back from (Wisconsin) Dells, (Logan) has started to hit the ball pretty well. Now at mid-season, he\u2019s hitting the ball well and seeing the ball well, just making the hits at the (right) time. He\u2019s been making good, solid contact and really driving it.\u201d\n\nPine Island took a 1-0 lead in Game 2 after an RBI double from Colton Pike before the Wildcats responded with a two-run top of the third. Breuer scored on a wild pitch while Buck reached home on a two-out RBI single from Nate Altendorf.\n\nGoodhue pitchers Sam Kyllo and Altendorf managed to hold the Panthers to six hits in Game 2, but Pine Island mounted its own late comeback in the sixth. With two outs, Tucker Hanson and Bryce Hinrichsen hit back-to-back RBI singles to make it 3-2.\n\nThe Wildcats had the opportunity to get another comeback victory as Kyllo stepped up to the plate with one out and the bases loaded. But the Panthers\u2019 defense came up with a 6-4-3 double play to end the game and the twin bill.\n\n\u201cWe hit the ball well and had a lot of guys on base again. Coming back in the second game there with bases loaded, that\u2019s always a tough one,\u201d Christianson said. \u201cI thought for sure we\u2019d get a run in at that point, but their pitching shut us down and they came in, got that double play and took us out.\u201d\n\nKyllo and Altendorf had two hits apiece in both games, and Ronnigen finished 3-for-4 in the opener.\n\nGoodhue (2-9) is back in action Monday at home against Rochester Lourdes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,Baseball,Goodhue Wildcats", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "GOODHUE \u2013 The bats are starting to come around for Goodhue.
