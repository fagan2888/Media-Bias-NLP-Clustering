Under a three year state contract, Qualis will review the care provided to Medicaid enrollees and the the efficiency of each organization\u2019s spending.\n\n\u201cWith the tremendous expansion of Apple Health following implementation of the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s more important than ever to assure health care quality and value for the Medicaid population,\u201d said Jonathan Sugarman, MD, MPH, President and CEO of Qualis Health. \u201cWith these contracts, we are partnering with the State of Washington to ensure that healthcare system performance is objectively evaluated, and that the results of our external review are used for public accountability and on-going improvement.\u201d\n\nThe largest share of Qualis Health\u2019s market revenue, 35 percent, comes from its consulting work with Medicaid programs across the nation. It reviews quality and efficiency for Medicaid programs in Alaska, Alabama, the District of Columbia, Idaho, and New Mexico. 53 percent of its client work involves case management.\n\nWithin case management lies utilization management which locates areas of \u201coveruse, misuse, and underuse of health services\u201d in private and public sector companies. Qualis also co-developed a Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) transformation framework in 2008 which was tested in 65 health care practices across the nation.\n\nAccording to the HCA, the state is interested primarily in ensuring quality outcomes for its enrollees which currently equals 1,200,000 Washingtonians. Qualis\u2019s contract with the DSHS Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery will include measuring the care provided by Regional Support Networks that provide community-based mental health services.\n\nQualis Health publishes much of its general findings in an annual Report to the Community.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington's Health Care Authority (HCA), Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) selected Qualis Health to perform quality reviews of Apple Health.", "og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "With cuts to Medicaid reimbursement tightening the budget, the Washington state Health Care Authority (HCA) and Department of Social and \u2026", "title": "WA: HCA selects external reviewer to streamline Apple Health", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dorothy-teeter.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-05T10:33:17+00:00", "url": "http://stateofreform.com/issues/medicaid/2015/02/hca-selects-qualis-health-apple-health-quality-review/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington's Health Care Authority (HCA), Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) selected Qualis Health to perform quality reviews of Apple Health.", "creator": "@StateofReform", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dorothy-teeter.jpg", "title": "WA: HCA selects external reviewer to streamline Apple Health - State of Reform", "site": "@StateofReform", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 17821687}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/stateofreform/", "section": "Featured", "published_time": "2015-02-02T14:42:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-05T10:33:17+00:00"}, "OBKey": "12RjP7ip2KRyl5dliGRkEQ==", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2076\"", "article_summary": "With cuts to Medicaid reimbursement tightening the budget, the Washington state Health Care Authority (HCA) and Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) has selected Qualis Health, a Seattle-based nonprofit population health agency, to perform external quality reviews of Apple Health, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, and state mental health services.\nQualis Health publishes much of its general findings in an annual Report to the Community.\nWithin case management lies utilization management which locates areas of \u201coveruse, misuse, and underuse of health services\u201d in private and public sector companies.\nQualis\u2019s contract with the DSHS Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery will include measuring the care provided by Regional Support Networks that provide community-based mental health services.\n\u201cWith the tremendous expansion of Apple Health following implementation of the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s more important than ever to assure health care quality and value for the Medicaid population,\u201d said Jonathan Sugarman, MD, MPH, President and CEO of Qualis Health."}
