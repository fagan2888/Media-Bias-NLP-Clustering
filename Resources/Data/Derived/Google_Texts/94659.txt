County public health officials notified the Board of Supervisors this week that they had abruptly ended contracts with two drug and alcohol counseling clinics — the first for allegedly trying to defraud the taxpayer-funded Drug Medi-Cal program and the second because staff “engaged in inappropriate behavior with minors.”

The Department of Public Health’s Substance Abuse Prevention and Control director, John Viernes, said his office severed ties with Pride Health Services in the Crenshaw area in August, after an investigation found it had doctored records to inflate its patient numbers.

Pride Health Services was among the subjects of an exposé by CNN and the Center for Investigative Reporting entitled “Rehab Racket,” which revealed unscrupulous drug and alcohol counseling clinics were taking advantage of lax government oversight to bill for “ghost patients” — foster kids brought in by the van load to serve as patients when they did not have any substance addictions.

The journalists interviewed counselor Tamara Askew, who said Pride billed for patients who never came, were in jail or had died. She said her boss, Godfrey Nwogene, ordered her to falsify documents to justify the charges.

The federal and county governments fund the Drug Medi-Cal program, while the state is responsible for certifying the clinics.

Currently, the county has nearly $100 million worth of contracts with 143 drug and alcohol clinics serving 30,000 participants under Drug Medi-Cal. The Affordable Care Act would multiply the number of eligible participants to about 400,000 by next year.

Viernes also broke off deals with Southland Outpatient Recovery Center, which has clinics in Compton that benefit from the Drug Medi-Cal program, after a June audit “identified multiple occasions where the contractor’s staff allegedly engaged in inappropriate behavior with minors.”

Viernes did not provide details, and the audit was not immediately available.
