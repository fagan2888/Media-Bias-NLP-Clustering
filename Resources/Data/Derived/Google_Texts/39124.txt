Venture capital investment continued its surge in the second quarter with $13.84 billion invested, the most since the fourth quarter of 2000, as investors piled into later-stage financings.

The amount was 21% higher than in the strong first quarter of this year and 60% higher than in the second quarter of last year, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.

First-half venture investment was $25.25 billion, on pace to easily eclipse last year’s total investment of $34.94 billion and already surpassing the entire amount invested in 2009.

Later-stage rounds garnered $9.24 billion, a 91% increase from a year earlier.

In a further sign of a supercharged investment climate, VentureSource reported that the median pre-money valuation for the second quarter was $58.3 million, the highest on record by far.

Median round sizes grew across the board as the number of deals failed to keep pace with investment growth. The median later-stage round was $12.4 million, up from $10 million in the first quarter, and some deals far exceeded that.

Topping the list was a $1.2 billion financing for ride service Uber Technologies Inc. Backers included BlackRock Private Equity Partners, Fidelity Investments and Summit Partners, the kinds of growth, public-market and private equity investors who are fueling the investment boom.

The hot investment pace, however, remains well below dot-com levels. The fourth quarter of 2000 saw $18.3 billion flow into venture-backed companies and total investment that year was $94 billion.

Furthermore, venture investors aren’t financing nearly as many companies as they did during the dot-com peak. Overall, the number of deals increased only modestly in the second quarter of this year, to 917 from 885 in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2000, venture investors backed 1,759 companies.

This time around, much of the investment is going to a handful of highly valued, pre-IPO companies such as Uber. The valuation data reflect this, although it can be tricky to interpret because of its volatility quarter-to-quarter.

The median pre-money valuation of $58.3 million came on the heels of a first-quarter median of $28.4 million. The median for the half was $50.3 million, far higher than the median of $18.8 million for all of last year. Median valuation in 2000 was $25 million.

Reflecting the intense investor interest in companies such as Uber, room-rental service Airbnb Inc., and scrapbooking website Pinterest Inc., the consumer services segment saw a huge inflow of capital. The industry accounted for $3.88 billion of second-quarter investment, up 107% from the first quarter of 2014 and 164% from the second quarter of 2013. The number of deals barely budged, with 171 financings compared with 165 in the first quarter and 178 a year ago.

The health-care sector, which has seen a string of biotechnology IPOs this year, attracted strong investor interest with $3.01 billion flowing to 201 companies. Investment was up 33% from the first quarter. Within the industry, medical software and information services saw a 129% jump from the first quarter with 41 companies drawing $655 million.
