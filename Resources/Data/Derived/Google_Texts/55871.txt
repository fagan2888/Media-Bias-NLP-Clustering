FORT COLLINS — It was apparent that this was going to be the case after Rashard Higgins mostly was an innocent bystander in the pre-game warmups, but the Rams’ prized sophomore wide receiver isn’t playing against Hawaii.

Higgins was out with his teammates for the shorts- and T-shirts preliminary warmup, but didn’t run routes then, and the same was true when he was in full uniform for the regular pre-game warmup.

He spent most of his time watching his teammates and playing catch.

And, yes, when the Rams took possession following the opening kickoff, Higgins remained on the sideline. The Rams drove 75 yards in seven plays, with Garrett Grayson hitting Higgins’ replacement, Elroy Masters Jr., with an 8-yard touchdown pass.
