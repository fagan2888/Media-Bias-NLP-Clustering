Anthony list, indicates that Planned Parenthood has reported excess revenues by the millions over the past 10 years.\n\nIn an investigative report by PolitiFact, the question of whether \u201cexcess revenue over expenses\u201d is actually considered \u201cprofit\u201d was debated between different nonprofit management experts hailing from universities such as Harvard and Indiana University.\n\nIn a statement provided to PolitiFact, Beth Gazley, an assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said, \u201cThe government funded parts of the [Planned Parenthood] budget would not be generating a \u2018profit\u2019\u2014they would be used in full each year. This means any excess of revenues over expenses [AKA \u2018profit\u2019] would have come from other sources\u2014private donations, endowment income, etc.\u201d\n\nTerri Renner, a lecturer at Indiana University and CPA, told PolitiFact, \u201cAny time an organization of any kind has revenue that exceeds expenses\u2014it\u2019s making a \u2018profit.\u2019 NPOs don\u2019t like that word\u2014so they use different vocabulary [\u2018revenues over expenses\u2019].\u201d\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2014 annual report, the organization was granted $528.4 million from government grants and reimbursements and $391.8 million from private contributions and bequests.\n\nMallory Quigley, spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, also associated with the Charlotte Lozier Institute, said in an interview with PolitiFact, \u201cWe\u2019re not saying nonprofits shouldn\u2019t have a profit, but rather wish to point to excess in profit and question why this organization would need to be supplemented by American taxpayers.\u201d\n\nNonprofit organizations categorized as 501(c)(3) receive designated tax breaks and are required to reinvest their profits from the fiscal year back into the services of the company.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is currently facing allegations that it is selling aborted fetal body parts, calling into question its taxpayer funding.\n\nSpokespersons for Planned Parenthood have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and the Charlotte Lozier Institute did not immediately return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute shows that Planned Parenthood has reported excess revenues by the millions over the past 10 years.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute shows that Planned Parenthood has reported excess revenues by the millions over the past 10 years.", "title": "Report: Planned Parenthood's Annual Excess Revenue in Millions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150916_PPReport_Jones.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T21:51:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NydBb1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute shows that Planned Parenthood has reported excess revenues by the millions over the past 10 years.", "title": "Report: Planned Parenthood's Annual Excess Revenue in Millions", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150916_PPReport_Jones.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-09-18T15:33:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T21:51:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Charlotte Lozier Institute, Planned Parenthood, funds, excess revenues"}, "article_summary": "Planned Parenthood and the Charlotte Lozier Institute did not immediately return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\nPlanned Parenthood is currently facing allegations that it is selling aborted fetal body parts, calling into question its taxpayer funding.\nSpokespersons for Planned Parenthood have denied any wrongdoing.\nA report released on Sept. 15 by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B.
