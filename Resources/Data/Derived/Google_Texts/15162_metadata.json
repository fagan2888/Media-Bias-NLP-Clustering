And here we go again.\n\nBut what really amazes me about the latest set of stories is the promise that Ryan will finally deliver the Republican Obamacare alternative that his colleagues in Congress have somehow failed to produce after all these years. No, he won\u2019t \u2014 because there is no alternative.\n\nOr maybe I should say that there is no alternative to the right. Alternatives to the left do exist. True socialized medicine \u2014 an American NHS \u2014 would be feasible economically; so would single-payer, in the form of Medicare for all. The reasons we aren\u2019t doing those are political.\n\nBut on the right, is there a more free-market, more privatized system that could replace the Affordable Care Act without causing the number of uninsured to soar? No, as some of us have tried to explain many times.\n\nOnce again: a useful starting point is the problem of people with pre-existing conditions. How can they be offered affordable insurance? You can prohibit insurers from discriminating on the basis of medical history \u2014 community rating. But if that\u2019s all you do, only sicker people will sign up; many will wait until they get sick to buy insurance; and so costs will be high due to a bad risk pool.\n\nSo non-discrimination must be combined with an individual mandate, the requirement that everyone get insurance. But what about people who can\u2019t afford it? There must be subsidies to lower-income families, so that they can.\n\nWhat you end up with, then, is community rating + individual mandate + subsidies \u2014 that is, with Obamacare. There\u2019s nothing arbitrary about it, and you can\u2019t pick and choose from the elements: it\u2019s a three-legged stool that needs all three legs to stand. And it can\u2019t be made cheaper, either \u2014 the subsidies are already on the low end, requiring that the allowed policies can involve higher deductibles than they really should.\n\nAnd all this, in turn, is the reason Republicans haven\u2019t come up with an alternative. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re timid, or lazy, or stupid (they may be all these things, but that\u2019s not why they\u2019ve come up short). It\u2019s because there is no alternative that wouldn\u2019t involve taking coverage away from tens of millions.\n\nSo no, Ryan isn\u2019t going to roll out a magical solution to this problem in the next couple of months. Even if he were the policy wonk he pretends to be, he couldn\u2019t do the impossible.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160411073212, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 11, 2016", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/The Obamacare Replacement Mirage ( 20160411 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Republicans will never find it.", "title": "The Obamacare Replacement Mirage", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/the-obamacare-replacement-mirage/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Republicans will never find it.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 11, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1460374332, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2016-04-11T11:32:12-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20160411113212, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160411, "pdate": 20160411, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Republicans will never find it.", "title": "The Obamacare Replacement Mirage", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/the-obamacare-replacement-mirage/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/the-obamacare-replacement-mirage/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Obamacare Replacement Mirage", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Even if he were the policy wonk he pretends to be, he couldn\u2019t do the impossible.\nWhat you end up with, then, is community rating + individual mandate + subsidies \u2014 that is, with Obamacare.\nSo no, Ryan isn\u2019t going to roll out a magical solution to this problem in the next couple of months.\nTrue socialized medicine \u2014 an American NHS \u2014 would be feasible economically; so would single-payer, in the form of Medicare for all.\nOr maybe I should say that there is no alternative to the right."}
