Rob Neu, the Oklahoma City schools superintendent who is supposedly "out of the office" right now, is in San Diego where he is scheduled to speak at an education conference Tuesday, sources told News 9.

Rumors started circulating a week ago that Neu was going to resign, but after a special meeting of the district board Thursday, officials would only say that Neu was "out of the office" and that the associate superintendent would be assuming his duties, for now.

Sources confirmed seeing Neu Monday at the conference and the agenda showed him being part of a panel discussion Tuesday morning on the impact of the Every Student Succeeds Act on Innovation.

A spokesman for Oklahoma City Public Schools seemed unaware of Neuâ€™s participation in the conference and said there was no indication that his trip was paid for with district funds.
