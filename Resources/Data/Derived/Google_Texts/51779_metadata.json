Less than two months later, Chris Kyle was dead: On February 2 of this year, he and Chad Littlefield were shot to death at a shooting range about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth. Eddie Routh, an Iraq war veteran, will stand trial for their murders.\n\nBut the increasingly contentious court case initially filed in February 2012 lives on, with Chris\u2019s widow Taya now the defendant. She has already failed at her attempt to move the federal case to Dallas, so she could be closer to home and her kids during the trial. (Ventura\u2019s attorneys claimed that moving the case here would have given Kyle home-field advantage, because in Dallas, they wrote, \u201cChris Kyle is revered as a hero.\u201d)\n\nBut once more she\u2019s attempting to convince the course to dismiss the suit.\n\nThis week Kyle\u2019s attorneys filed yet another motion for summary judgment, which spends some 40 pages detailing the few pages in the book involving the alleged scuffle between Chris Kyle and Jesse Ventura, who is referred to solely as \u201cScruff Face\u201d in the book. (Ventura\u2019s identity was made public only during subsequent interviews Chris Kyle did to promote American Sniper.)\n\nLong story short, says the motion: Kyle\u2019s legal team has interviewed numerous witnesses who witnessed the bar fight and can corroborate the sniper\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cChris Kyle\u2019s account is essentially that Ventura loudly criticized the Iraq war and American leaders, that Ventura told Kyle \u2018you deserve to lose a few\u2019 and made aggressive gestures towards Kyle, and that Kyle punched him,\u201d says the motion. \u201cSubstantial evidence supports Kyle\u2019s account. Ventura\u2019s disputes \u2014 whether over specific details or choice of language or what details are or are not included in every recounting of the events \u2014 do not alter the substantial truth of the witnesses\u2019 consistent core accounts. Ventura cannot meet his burden of proof simply by disbelieving or discrediting Kyle\u2019s evidence.\u201d\n\nThe motion for summary judgment is below, along with depositions from witnesses who say they can corroborate Chris Kyle\u2019s account of the bar fight \u2014 including a woman who says Ventura\u2019s \u201centire presence that night seemed pretty offensive to me.\u201d\n\nNo doubt the legal documents below will be joined in coming days by a response from Ventura\u2019s legal team, which has already accused Taya Kyle of looking to the court for a \u201cplea for sympathy\u201d when she tried to transfer the case from Minnesota to Texas.\n\nTaya Kyle Dec 2013 Motion to Dismiss\n\nSupporting Docs in Ventura v Kyle", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEyL2NocmlzLWt5bGVzLXdpZG93LXRheWEtb25jZS1tb3JlLWFza3MtZmVkZXJhbC1qdWRnZS10by1kaXNtaXNzLWplc3NlLXZlbnR1cmFzLWRlZmFtYXRpb24tc3VpdC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "On December 20, 2012, United States District Judge Richard Kyle denied American Sniper Chris Kyle's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought by wrestler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura over a passage in\u2026", "title": "Chris Kyle\u2019s widow Taya once more asks federal judge to dismiss Jesse Ventura\u2019s defamation suit", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2013/12/chris-kyles-widow-taya-once-more-asks-federal-judge-to-dismiss-jesse-venturas-defamation-suit.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-21T10:35:00Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd828\"", "article_summary": "(Ventura\u2019s identity was made public only during subsequent interviews Chris Kyle did to promote American Sniper.)\nLong story short, says the motion: Kyle\u2019s legal team has interviewed numerous witnesses who witnessed the bar fight and can corroborate the sniper\u2019s story.\nLess than two months later, Chris Kyle was dead: On February 2 of this year, he and Chad Littlefield were shot to death at a shooting range about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth.\nOn December 20, 2012, United States District Judge Richard Kyle denied American Sniper Chris Kyle\u2019s motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought by wrestler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura over a passage in Kyle\u2019s bestselling 2012 book involving an alleged bar fight after a funeral.\nBut the increasingly contentious court case initially filed in February 2012 lives on, with Chris\u2019s widow Taya now the defendant."}
