Terry McAuliffe.\n\nBurnett is a former Newport News School Board member and 25-year veteran of the city's police department. She has also run for mayor and sheriff in the past 10 years.\n\nClift can be reached by phone at 757-247-7870.\n\nHouse of Delegates, 95th District\n\nMarcia Price, D: 75.8 percent\n\nPricillia Burnett, I: 23 percent", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Price takes 95th District seat", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "Democrat Marcia \"Cia\" Price will be the next 95 t h District delegate, easily defeating Independent Pricillia Burnett, with nearly 76 percent of the vote to succeed\u00a0retiring Del.
