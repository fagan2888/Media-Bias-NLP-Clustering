Not to mention that she has already mounted a presidential bid once before, during the 2008 Democratic primary. With quite a following among Democrats -- particularly women -- and an expert campaigner as a husband, Clinton is one of the frontrunners for the 2016 nomination. In fact, if the Iowa caucuses were held today, a Public Policy Polling survey found she would win 58 percent of the vote, outstripping the runner-up, Vice President Joe Biden, by a margin of 41 percent. Now the question is whether or not Clinton will decide to throw her hat in the ring in 2016. After her term as secretary of state ends this year, she has declared her intention to take a year off from politics entirely. And after that? Clinton says that she does not want to run in 2016, but that hasn't quashed hopes to the contrary. -- Sarah Bufkin", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that if Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2106, she would be more prepared for...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-23 11:01:20 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that if Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2106, she would be more prepared for...", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Hillary Clinton Would Be More Prepared For White House Than Obama, Bush", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/22/nancy-pelosi-hillary-clinton_n_3971843.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366693/images/o-NANCY-PELOSI-HILLARY-CLINTON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that if Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2106, she would be more prepared for...", "creator": "jbendery", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366693/images/o-NANCY-PELOSI-HILLARY-CLINTON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Hillary Clinton Would Be More Prepared For White House Than Obama, Bush", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-22 11:01:20 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3971843", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "elections 2014,video,nancy pelosi joe biden,hillary clinton 2016,Nancy Pelosi,Nancy Pelosi Hillary Clinton,Hillary Clinton,Joe Biden,joe biden 2016", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "elections 2014,video,nancy pelosi joe biden,hillary clinton 2016,Nancy Pelosi,Nancy Pelosi Hillary Clinton,Hillary Clinton,Joe Biden,joe biden 2016", "published_time": "2013-09-22 11:01:20 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-22 11:08:05 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Clinton says that she does not want to run in 2016, but that hasn't quashed hopes to the contrary.\nNow the question is whether or not Clinton will decide to throw her hat in the ring in 2016.\nAfter her term as secretary of state ends this year, she has declared her intention to take a year off from politics entirely.\nWith quite a following among Democrats -- particularly women -- and an expert campaigner as a husband, Clinton is one of the frontrunners for the 2016 nomination.\nNot to mention that she has already mounted a presidential bid once before, during the 2008 Democratic primary."}
