Kids who try their best but aren\u2019t as good as other 6-year-olds who succeed simply based on their natural ability may lose interest and give up. And just as important, the natural may rest on his/her laurels, not try their best and be devastated when they fall behind.\n\nThe goal of any sports program for young kids should simply be to create a safe place where they can have fun and learn. I would prefer that leagues didn\u2019t give out trophies. However, if they are going to give them out, they should be awarded to all.\n\nBob Bernstein; Nashville\n\nI am not a big fan of James Harrison, but he is right about pretend trophies. In competition, some people win, and some people lose. That\u2019s why we compete in sports. It teaches all of us the meaning of effort, teamwork, intelligence and physical attributes. Not successful? Work harder. Still not successful? Try something else. Success in something is out there for those who are willing to make the sacrifices to achieve it.\n\nLouis Lagrave; Cave Creek, Ariz.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not about to raise two boys to be men by making them believe that they are entitled to something just because they tried their best.\u201d James Harrison\n\nComments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with James Harrison. Sports teaches that winning and losing come with effort. Sometimes, your best efforts result in a loss. But you at least made the effort to win. Why teach kids that winning is just \u201cparticipating\u201d when it is not?\n\n\u2014 Ross Murphy\n\nWe are talking about 6-year-olds, not teenagers. I am a parent of kids this age, and the effort it takes to get them to show up, let alone compete, is tremendous.\n\nWe reward the effort because many of these leagues do not keep score. Rewarding the effort makes them want to try harder and become better at the sport.\n\nTelling them that they are not good enough at such a young age pushes kids out early from youth sports.\n\n\u2014 Sean Thomas\n\nWhen very young, my son always wanted a trophy for the effort he put in to something. I accepted it but told him that is not what you play for.\n\nI told him you will forget the trophy but remember the great wins and tough losses, how hard you tried, the lessons you learned and the people you played with. In the end, that is all that matters.\n\n\u2014 Bill Drescher\n\nParticipation trophies should end the same time grades start in school.\n\nYou don\u2019t get an A in school because you sit near someone who gets an A. You have to study hard and earn that A.\n\n\u2014 Anthony Fuda\n\nI\u2019m sure that along with returning these trophies, Harrison also has a general parenting style that allows his kids to fail and learn how to respond to failure in all aspects of life.\n\nParticipation trophies aren\u2019t the biggest problem; it\u2019s just the most tangible aspect of a parenting philosophy that has started to become the norm. Kids today are growing up without a work ethic. They get what they want, and they don\u2019t have to work for it.\n\n\u2014 Justin Garver\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1EdPQmT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Steelers linebacker James Harrison recently posted on Instagram that he was returning his sons\u2019 participation trophies.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Steelers linebacker James Harrison recently posted on Instagram that he was returning his sons\u2019 participation trophies.", "title": "Some trophies teach wrong lesson: Your Say", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/08/23/participation-trophies-teach-wrong-lesson-say/32241999/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Steelers linebacker James Harrison recently posted on Instagram that he was returning his sons\u2019 participation trophies.", "title": "Some trophies teach wrong lesson: Your Say", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/437e309bdeb6f620613eace616db7d0ebf8eec40/c=0-193-2988-3181&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Parenting", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Parenting", "title": "Some trophies teach wrong lesson: Your Say", "author": "USA TODAY", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18d6989333d6454f2f10b27a9f9af4f5e9ddb12e/c=0-249-2988-4234/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab06222746c94620f6d1145114290e1ec9b3dd3f/c=0-193-2988-3181/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b0027f161538ee3e28ddf96038893fa4f1bf5e1/c=0-357-2988-2604/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b537c239457c1e841239b42ecdacc0abdf61d530/c=0-533-2988-2221&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-23T20:05:53.890000-04:00", "shorthed": "Some trophies teach wrong lesson: Your Say", "articleid": 32241999, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7b95e31297843edece2fb04c772dd25a30b795e/c=0-533-2988-2221/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c57800217b669a9c7746e6c4bca3c2bb3e50aee0/c=241-0-2761-4500/local/-/media/2015/08/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635759547493687361-AP-Vikings-Steelers-Football.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "participation trophies, parenting, sports, youth sports, entitlement, James Harrison, Pittsburgh Steelers, NFL, children, teaching, lesson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b7c\"", "article_summary": "Bob Bernstein; NashvilleI am not a big fan of James Harrison, but he is right about pretend trophies.\nJames Harrison (Photo: Don Wright, AP)Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison recently posted on Instagram that he was returning two participation trophies given to his sons, ages 6 and 8, because they weren\u2019t \"real.\"\nThe goal of any sports program for young kids should simply be to create a safe place where they can have fun and learn.\nArmour fails to consider the harm it might do to kids when trophies are only awarded to the \u201cbest\u201d players or winningest teams.\nLetters to the editor:Columnist Nancy Armour and other \u201cno trophies for participation\u201d proponents address only half the issue and thus have it all wrong (\u201cArmour: James Harrison is right, you shouldn't get a prize for showing up\u201d)."}
