Moving away from religious objections and scriptural bars, Amalaha relied on a series of experiments to \u201cprove\u201d that same-sex attraction is not only against the laws of God \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s against the laws of nature, too. In spite of the evidence suggesting otherwise, he argues that homosexuality does not exist.\n\nThe Nigerian research effort comes in response to the UK\u2019s recent threat to cut all aid if the country proceeds with legislature that would jail same-sex couples for up to 14 years. According to Amalaha, his latest findings are not only backed by his university, but by God himself. The Lord, he says, has given him the \u201cwisdom to use science as a scientist to prove gay marriage wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked myself why should a man be marrying a man and a woman marrying a woman, does it mean that there is no more female for a man to marry or there is no more male for a woman to marry?\u201d he explained, speaking to This Day Live. \u201cAnd recently, Britain told Nigeria to legalize gay marriage of forfeit international aid. I thank God for our lawmakers who refused to sign the bill legalizing gay marriage.\u201d\n\nTo fortify his country\u2019s decision to outlaw gay marriage, Amalaha designed a series of scientific experiments that he claims contradict same-sex attraction. While the program invokes a variety of disciplines, most originate in the same basic principle of physics. The emblematic experiment, which can be performed by anyone age 4 and older, concerns the fundamental interaction of electromagnetism.\n\n\u201cI used two bar magnets in my research. A bar magnet is a horizontal magnet that has the North Pole and the South Pole and when you bring two bar magnets and you bring the North Pole together you find that the two North Poles will not attract,\u201d Amalaha elaborated. \u201cThey will repel, that is, they will push away themselves showing that a man should not attract a man.\u201d\n\nFor additional evidence, Amalaha cited the truism that two identical chemical agents do not yield a reaction, as well as the fact that he\u2019d never seen a lion have sex with another lion. The next step, he says, is to publish the findings in an international journal. He believes his work is worthy of the Nobel Prize.\n\nHe said, \u201cmy ambition is to go beyond the sky.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "student disprove homosexuality with magnets, chibuihem amalaha, marriage equality, nigeria, gay marriage", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctoral candidate Chibuihem Amalaha claims to have used magnets to prove that homosexuality is invalid.", "title": "Nigerian Student 'Debunks' Homosexuality With Magnets", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nigerian-student-debunks-homosexuality-magnets-university-lagos-doctorate-uses-science-prove-gay", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/15/magnets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctoral candidate Chibuihem Amalaha claims to have used magnets to prove that homosexuality is invalid.", "title": "Nigerian Student 'Debunks' Homosexuality With Magnets", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nigerian-student-debunks-homosexuality-magnets-university-lagos-doctorate-uses-science-prove-gay", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/15/magnets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/15/magnets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-09-15T17:03:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-15T17:07:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctoral candidate Chibuihem Amalaha claims to have used magnets to prove that homosexuality is invalid."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedec\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd recently, Britain told Nigeria to legalize gay marriage of forfeit international aid.\nI thank God for our lawmakers who refused to sign the bill legalizing gay marriage.\u201dTo fortify his country\u2019s decision to outlaw gay marriage, Amalaha designed a series of scientific experiments that he claims contradict same-sex attraction.\nChibuihem Amalaha says that God has given him the \u201cwisdom to use science as a scientist to prove gay marriage wrong.\u201dChibuihem Amalaha says that God has given him the \u201cwisdom to use science as a scientist to prove gay marriage wrong.\u201d drab makyo CC By 2.0On Sunday, opposition to marriage equality jumped up a notch when doctoral candidate Chibuihem Amalaha announced that he had successfully disproved homosexuality.\nAccording to Amalaha, his latest findings are not only backed by his university, but by God himself.\nThe emblematic experiment, which can be performed by anyone age 4 and older, concerns the fundamental interaction of electromagnetism."}
