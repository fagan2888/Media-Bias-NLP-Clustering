FOX 4 identified the men as Michael Magovern with the Strawn City Marshall\u2019s Office and Milford police officer Cameron Beckham.\n\nThey said the man behind the counter didn\u2019t say anything other than, \u201cWe don\u2019t serve police officers.\u201d They opted to go to Dairy Queen instead, FOX 4 reported.\n\nThe officers said they believe this is an isolated incident and doesn\u2019t reflect the overall mantra of the fast food chain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it on social media. We heard it on the news. 17 years as a firefighter and now as a police officer this is the first time this has ever happened to me,\u201d Magovern told FOX4. \u201cIt really strikes a nerve personally.\u201d\n\nWhataburger responded on Twitter saying, \u201cWe would never condone this action and this is completely unacceptable. We are working hard to address this as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe company also released a full statement: \u201cWe were appalled to hear of an employee refusing service to two officers, as we have proudly served first responders across our system for decades. As soon as we heard of this isolated incident, we began our own internal investigation overnight. The employee that refused service is no longer employed with Whataburger. We\u2019ve also invited the officers back today so we can apologize in person and make this right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA5L3doYXRhYnVyZ2VyLWVtcGxveWVlLXJlZnVzZXMtdG8tc2VydmUtdHdvLXBvbGljZS1vZmZpY2Vycy10dWVzZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWluLWxld2lzdmlsbGUtb2ZmaWNlcnMtc2F5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tasha Tsiaperas", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "[This post has been updated to reflect a statement from the company.] Staff writer Nicholas Friedman reports: An employee at a Lewisville Whataburger has been fired after reportedly telling two\u2026", "title": "Whataburger employee fired after refusing to serve two police officers Tuesday night in Lewisville", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/09/whataburger-employee-refuses-to-serve-two-police-officers-tuesday-night-in-lewisville-officers-say.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-16T13:31:25Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a18\"", "article_summary": "Staff writer Nicholas Friedman reports:An employee at a Lewisville Whataburger has been fired after reportedly telling two off-duty police officers they couldn\u2019t order food at the restaurant Tuesday night.\nThe officers were in uniform working an off-duty security job at a construction site near Interstate 35E when they went into Whataburger.\nThe employee that refused service is no longer employed with Whataburger.\nThe officers said they believe this is an isolated incident and doesn\u2019t reflect the overall mantra of the fast food chain.\nWe\u2019ve also invited the officers back today so we can apologize in person and make this right.\u201d"}
