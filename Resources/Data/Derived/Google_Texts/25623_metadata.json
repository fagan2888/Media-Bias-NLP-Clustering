They saw him as their savior, the vessel of their anger and fears for our country. Once he announced his intention to run for the presidency, millions rallied to his candidacy. Most of us knew he could not make it to the nomination \u2013 he is too soft-spoken and too entirely without guile. We knew he was too good to be true. We knew the media and the hated \"establishment\" would take him down. And they did. As the campaign began, millions of people supported Dr. Carson. He was an anti-politico, a genuine good man, a breath of the freshest air. He was the one-man moral and intellectual hero among the candidates running for the presidency as a Republican. And then he had to suffer the horrific verbal assaults, and they were vicious verbal assaults indeed, from Donald Trump \u2013 verbal assaults too vile to repeat here. Dr. Carson did not fight back, depending on the intelligence of the populace to see through the villainy and lies of Trump's egregious attacks.\n\nIt does not take a historian or a scholar to see Trump for what he is: an intimidating thug, a goon who takes out his opponents any way deemed necessary. The things he said about Dr. Carson, over and over again, are so horrific, so below the belt, Mr. Trump revealed himself, over and over again, to be a man of the lowest character. Dickens did not invent him, but he knew men like him and based many of his characters on them. Dickens and the Founders, not to mention Locke, Burke, Montesquieu, warned us about people like Donald Trump. So why on Earth did Dr. Carson endorse Trump? The man we all believed Carson to be could never have endorsed Trump. So is he not the man we believed him to be, or is he tragically naive? He cannot, at this point in the campaign, possibly believe that Trump is qualified to be the president of the United States. Trump knows nothing about the Constitution. He knows nothing about foreign policy, the terrorist threats we face, about Cuba, the Middle East, especially Israel. He knows nothing about the military, the wholesale ruination of higher education by the tyranny of political correctness, the ridiculous dictates of multiculturalism, safe spaces, trigger warnings, the nonsense of \"microaggressions.\" He knows nothing about the infantilization of our millennials. If they, our millennials, absorb and capitulate to all this nonsense, they will never be fit to function in the real and ever changing world. They will run crying out of the room the first time they are chastised, criticized, or reprimanded by an employer \u2013 that is, if they find a job. Donald Trump is aware of none of this. He is a deal-maker, a negotiater, a rich man. Being rich is the primary component of his identity. He may care about the country, but he knows nothing about the principles, the morality, about the conservatism, the liberty promised by a limited government, the Constitution or the rule of law that made it the greatest nation on earth. Ben Carson knows this about Trump, so why on Earth did he endorse him?
