The outlook for him pitching anytime soon was \u201cnot good,\u201d according to a major league source. And after double-checking MRI results Sunday afternoon, doctors found a torn ulnar collateral ligament.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel it pop or anything,\u201d Diaz said Sunday morning. \u201cIt just feels weird.\u201d\n\nDiaz said he was worried the injury is serious. He pitched wildly Saturday against San Diego, allowing three runs on three hits. Six batters into the inning, he threw a 97-mph fastball and two 90-mph sliders to Alexei Ramirez. But he followed with eight consecutive balls \u2014 and his fastball sank to 86 mph.\n\n\u201cThe last hitter, especially, he didn\u2019t look right,\u201d Colorado manager Walt Weiss said.\n\nColorado acquired Diaz in a trade before the 2015 season with the Los Angeles Angels. He pitched 19 innings in 21 games for the Rockies last season, with a 2.37 ERA. He battled wildness at times, but his 18 strikeouts against six walks seemed promising.\n\nDiaz was set to battle with Scott Oberg, Justin Miller, Miguel Castro and Carlos Estevez for a spot in the bullpen. The elbow reconstruction surgery facing Diaz usually requires 12 to 16 months of recovery and rehabilitation.\n\nThe Rockies have another reliever, closer Adam Ottavino, currently recovering from Tommy John surgery after he injured his elbow early last season.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies reliever Jairo Diaz needs Tommy John surgery after injuring elbow", "title": "Rockies reliever Jairo Diaz needs Tommy John surgery after injuring elbow", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/06/rockies-reliever-jairo-diaz-needs-tommy-john-surgery-after-injuring-elbow/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306_104016_jairo-diaz.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306_104016_jairo-diaz.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T10:46:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:29:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies have another reliever, closer Adam Ottavino, currently recovering from Tommy John surgery after he injured his elbow early last season.\nDiaz injured his right elbow in a game Saturday.\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Hard-throwing Jairo Diaz, the 24-year-old right-hander on the verge of breaking into the Rockies\u2019 bullpen, will need Tommy John surgery after tearing a ligament in his right elbow, the team said.\nThe elbow reconstruction surgery facing Diaz usually requires 12 to 16 months of recovery and rehabilitation.\nHe pitched 19 innings in 21 games for the Rockies last season, with a 2.37 ERA."}
