Ryan does hope Republicans across the country will run on the ideas they develop, to provide a contrast with Democrats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you vote on everything,\u201d said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who met with Ryan Thursday during a meeting with leaders of conservative and moderate caucuses. \u201cYou come up with your wish list \u2014 your top five things \u2014 immigration and defense, so you have a national security component. Then you\u2019ve got welfare reform, health care reform and tax reform. There\u2019s no way you can do all five of those in one year, let alone do it before the convention.\u201d\n\nThe execution of the GOP agenda will be a central topic of conversation next week, when Republicans gather in Baltimore for their annual legislative retreat. Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) are seeking to discern the priorities of the House Republican Conference as they enter the new year. Some items might get a vote, but the most ambitious legislation is unlikely to come to the floor.\n\nRyan has been holding endless meetings with Republicans about how to proceed. Former Speaker John Boehner was often criticized for lacking a vision and lurching from crisis to crisis. Ryan has been widely praised so far by House Republicans for pushing the party to be ambitious in its thinking.\n\nRyan is intent on consulting the entire party before he makes any final decisions. But several aides and lawmakers involved in legislative planning say they highly doubt most of the newly formed GOP agenda will hit the floor for a vote. Of course, going that route could help Republicans avoid internal squabbling over details and tough votes for some members.\n\nRyan conceded Thursday that the agenda items \u201caren\u2019t going to be things we\u2019ll be able to get done this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will require a new president,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut if we want a mandate to do big things, if we want the mandate from our fellow Americans to fix this country\u2019s problems and get us back on the right track, we\u2019re going to have to offer a real agenda to the country. And we\u2019re going to do that soon. This is what 2016 is all about for me. Go big on ideas. Get the country back on track. Restore a confident America.\u201d\n\nAsked about specific votes, Ryan said, \u201cEverything\u2019s an option because what we\u2019re going to do is make this decision by consensus in our conference.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just say one thing,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cYou think Barack Obama\u2019s going to sign a bill repealing Obamacare? You think he wants to lower tax rates for all families, individuals and businesses? No he doesn\u2019t. So we know that we\u2019re going to have to go to the American people with a mandate, with an agenda so that they can choose. That\u2019s what this is all about. The stakes could never be higher.\u201d\n\nOf course, not voting on some of these agenda items could expose the party to criticism. During their quest for the House majority in 2010, Boehner, McCarthy and former Majority Leader Eric Cantor promised they would release a replacement for Obamacare. They still have not. People close to Ryan say the party will put forward a health care proposal this year.\n\nStill, GOP leadership aides say they're not concerned about not holding roll calls, because the plans they release will be specific enough to draw a contrast.\n\nCoupled with a long-term highway bill and a rewrite of the No Child Left Behind education law that were signed into law late last year, Republican leaders believe they are giving their candidates a positive agenda to run on.\n\n\u201cIn one bucket, you're going to have some very specific items that we will take up,\u201d Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in an interview. \u201cIn the other bucket, you're going to have more general issues that may not have been fully developed. It depends on the issue and on the committee.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Paul Ryan's ideas may remain just that.", "title": "House GOP likely to avoid votes on big policy plans", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/gop-policy-plan-votes-217475", "image": "http://static.politico.com/33/05/cfc6e10b4cf28345c4e99f61ddfa/20160107-paul-ryan-3-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Paul Ryan's ideas may remain just that.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Getty House GOP likely to avoid votes on big policy plans Paul Ryan's ideas may remain just that.\nRyan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)\nare seeking to discern the priorities of the House Republican Conference as they enter the new year.\nRyan has been widely praised so far by House Republicans for pushing the party to be ambitious in its thinking.\nPeople close to Ryan say the party will put forward a health care proposal this year."}
