However, the distrust of the police among people of color \u2014 a topic that\u2019s recently gained national attention thanks to widespread protests over police killings of unarmed black men \u2014 may compel them to forego emergency care in these life-threatening situations, a new study shows.\n\nDuring interviews with residents of low-income Latino communities in Denver, researchers found that many didn\u2019t call 911 in cases of cardiac arrest because of their suspicion of law enforcement, the possibility of language barriers with first responders, and misconceptions about the costs of ambulatory care.\n\n\u201cResidents of low-income, minority neighborhoods have two strikes against them: The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is much higher than average and rates of bystander CPR are below average,\u201d study lead author Dr. Comilla Sasson, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said in a journal press release.\n\nThese new findings come on the heels of previous research that provides a glimpse in the difficulties that Latinos, regardless of their immigration status, experience in their interaction with authorities. According to a 2013 study conducted by national group Policy Link, more than 40 percent of Latinos said they felt isolated from police officers sworn to protect and serve.\n\nNearly 44 percent of Latinos in the Policy Link study said they are less likely to report crimes out of fear that police would ask them or their loved ones about their immigration status. Seven out of 10 undocumented immigrants surveyed also said that they wouldn\u2019t contact law enforcement if they were victims of a crime.\n\nThe issue has been exacerbated in the years since local police departments have become more involved in federal immigration matters. Latino distrust in in American institutions \u2014 also confirmed by a depletion of funds for health care centers that provide care to undocumented people and negative experiences with health care providers \u2014 has complicated efforts to bridge racial gaps in health care, especially in the weeks before and during the Obamacare enrollment period.\n\n\u201cA lot of Latino people don\u2019t come because they\u2019re afraid,\u201d Ruben Acosta, a Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles, told Yahoo News in March shortly after he and his wife took a leap of faith and applied for health insurance. Despite the White House\u2019s assurances that information collected during enrollment would not be transferred to immigration officials, Acosta said he remained skeptical of the outreach to Latinos. \u201cObama promised that [applicants\u2019 immigration status] information won\u2019t be shared, but he also promised he\u2019d pass immigration reform [long ago.]\u201d\n\nLess than half of Latinos in the U.S. knew about their state\u2019s health exchange, compared to 68 percent of blacks and 69 percent of whites, according to a survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund before the current enrollment period began. In February, The National Alliance for Hispanic Health, an organization that at one point reported fielding 4,000 Obamacare-related phone calls, told CNN that counselors often encountered mixed-status families \u2014 groups that had at least one undocumented immigrant.\n\nHealth officials say that people of color stand to benefit the most from adequate emergency, preventative, and specialized care, which count among some of Obamacare\u2019s offerings. In the long run, access to these amenities could help underserved populations tackle other ailments like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Sasson said part of fulfilling that goal requires better addressing Latinos\u2019 distrust of law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe need to do a better job of overcoming the significant barriers to timely medical care for Latinos suffering cardiac arrest,\u201d Sasson said. \u201cCulturally sensitive public education about cardiac arrest and CPR is a key first step. Future research will [also] need to be conducted to better understand how targeted, culturally sensitive public education campaigns may improve the provision of bystander CPR and cardiac arrest survival rates in high-risk neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nDistrust of the police doesn\u2019t only hamper Latinos\u2019 efforts to receive emergency care. Black women abused by their significant others also weigh the consequences of reporting instances of violence out of fear about how the police will treat their spouse. Building trust among this demographic also proves difficult since the staff at battered women\u2019s shelters don\u2019t reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A new study suggests that many low-income Latinos are too wary of the police to call 911.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A new study suggests that many low-income Latinos are too wary of the police to call 911.", "title": "Why People Of Color Don\u2019t Call For An Ambulance", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/15/3603690/distrust-police-emergency-care/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_155606165.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study suggests that many low-income Latinos are too wary of the police to call 911.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_155606165-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why People Of Color Don\u2019t Call For An Ambulance", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_155606165.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_155606165.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-15T13:09:02+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd38b\"", "article_summary": "Health Why People Of Color Don\u2019t Call For An Ambulance CREDIT: ShutterstockWhen cardiac arrest strikes, every second counts when it comes to preventing death.\n\u201cObama promised that [applicants\u2019 immigration status] information won\u2019t be shared, but he also promised he\u2019d pass immigration reform [long ago.\n\u201cCulturally sensitive public education about cardiac arrest and CPR is a key first step.\n\u201cWe need to do a better job of overcoming the significant barriers to timely medical care for Latinos suffering cardiac arrest,\u201d Sasson said.\nBuilding trust among this demographic also proves difficult since the staff at battered women\u2019s shelters don\u2019t reflect the diversity of the communities they serve."}
