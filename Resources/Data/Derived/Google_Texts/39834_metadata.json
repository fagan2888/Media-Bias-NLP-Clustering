This final installment looks at how consumers can use calorie counts to their advantage.\n\nCalorie counts are soon to appear on chain restaurant menus across the country, but many experts are worried that consumers won\u2019t know how to make use of them. The only information mandated by the Affordable Care Act that must be published directly next to the menu item is the calorie count for the dish itself. Because the mandate doesn\u2019t require any other information, such as daily nutritional requirements or information beyond calories, many experts are worried that people won\u2019t get much use out of the labels.\n\n\u201cIn part, if you don\u2019t put the context there, then why did you mandate it in the first place, because the purpose was to help people manage their calorie count,\u201d asked nutritionist Gayle Timmerman, PHD, RN, of the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nA Step in the Right Direction\n\nOther researchers agreed that context and other aids to help people understand what they\u2019re reading will be necessary, but all acknowledged that just getting the calorie counts on menus is a big step.\n\n\u201cMy initial perception is that there\u2019s always going to be a better mousetrap that we can build, but I\u2019m not yet as much of a skeptic of menu labeling as many people are,\u201d said Jason Block, MD, professor of population medicine at Harvard University.\n\nBecause certain cities, including New York City, have already implemented calorie count mandates, there have been some studies to test their effectiveness. Christina Roberto, PhD, a psychologist and epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, said she found the results of those studies to be largely inconclusive.\n\n\u201cThe media coverage traditionally paints a picture that it doesn\u2019t work, and that\u2019s really frustrating, because it\u2019s much more mixed,\u201d she said, noting that there are studies that show menu labeling does do work and studies that suggest it doesn\u2019t.\n\nDr. Block recently conducted a study to see how people estimated the calories they were consuming at fast food restaurants, including McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Subway. The study, published in the British Medical Journal in May 2013, will serve as a basis for Block to compare consumers\u2019 calorie estimations before and after the implementation of the ACA-mandated menu calorie counts, he said. His initial research found that people tend to underestimate the calorie count of what they\u2019re consuming by 175 to 259 calories, and consumers\u2019 estimations were even farther off when they ate at chains that marketed themselves as healthier, such as Subway.\n\nOne thing that Block noted was that right now, calorie information is in fact available at almost every chain restaurant, even if it isn\u2019t posted on the menu \u2014 it's on posters, napkins or food wrappers. But almost no one actually takes the time to look at it.\n\nThis didn\u2019t surprise Roberto, who once conducted a study counting how many people walking into chain restaurants actually sought out calorie information. She and her team observed 4,000 people for the study, but only six actually looked for the information \u2014 0.1 percent.\n\n\u201cIt has to be staring you in the face \u2014 people are not going to make the effort,\u201d she said.\n\nUnfortunately, according to Timmerman, people are \u201chorrible\u201d at understanding calorie counts. Block added that, research-wise, \u201cno one has really looked in depth at the effect of people\u2019s understanding of calorie counts.\u201d Roberto said there may be more intuitive ways to present the information, since people often make decisions about what to order very quickly.\n\nMargo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that numeric information can still be helpful. \u201cThe main way people use nutrition labels on packaged foods is to make comparisons,\u201d she said, citing choices like whether to buy Triscuits or Wheat Thins, or Breyers or Haagen-Dazs ice cream. \u201cI think that will be easy for people to just see,\u201d she said, making up a hypothetical choice between a 580-calorie chicken ranch sub or a 480-calorie Italian sub. \u201cThat will be eye-opening for some people.\u201d\n\nContext Counts, Too\n\nOther research has suggested that calorie counts are particularly effective when the number is put in context. Roberto, for example, conducted a study in which individuals were presented with options that included calorie counts and information on how many calories a person should eat in a day. Other participants were given only the calorie counts. Having calorie counts available led people to make healthier choices, but the biggest surprise came later. The researchers were also monitoring what people consumed later, after the study, and they found that those who had been told how many calories a person should eat during the entire day picked healthier options later, on their own. \u201cMaybe that reminder keeps them in check,\u201d Roberto suggested.\n\nAnother study, conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina and published in Appetite, looked at how people reacted to labels that just gave calorie counts versus labels that also explained how far a person would have to walk to burn off those calories. Adding any sort of nutritional information reduced the number of calories ordered by about 100, but people with access to the information on how far they\u2019d have to walk cut their orders down by another 100 calories. Among the participants, 82 percent said they preferred the physical activity-based labels.\n\nAdditional information such as how many calories a person should eat in a day, or how calories translate to exercise, is \u201cgood for education, but to put it on a menu would be impossible,\u201d given space restraints, Wootan said. Adding it as supplemental information that could be found online or in on-site brochures would probably mean it would get the same attention as calorie counts before the mandate \u2014 almost none.\n\nRoberto suggested that a simple system, such as traffic light labels (green for healthy food, yellow for moderately healthy food, and red for unhealthy food), would add a lot of value to the labels. With the implementation of calorie count posting already delayed, researchers noted that it may take some time to figure out how to post the information to best help consumers.\n\nHow You Can Use Menu Calorie Counts\n\nIn the meantime, here are some tips to help you navigate the calorie counts that are coming:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "none", "description": "Some experts worry that if individuals don't know basic facts about how many calorie counts a person should eat in a day, calorie counts could be ineffective.", "og": {"site_name": "EverydayHealth.com", "description": "Some experts worry that if individuals don't know basic facts about how many calorie counts a person should eat in a day, calorie counts could be ineffective.", "title": "Calorie Counts Need More Context, Experts Say", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/calorie-counts-need-more-context-experts-say-8332.aspx", "image": "http://images.agoramedia.com/EverydayHealth/video/video-default-image-722x406.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some experts worry that if individuals don't know basic facts about how many calorie counts a person should eat in a day, calorie counts could be ineffective.", "title": "Calorie Counts Need More Context, Experts Say", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/calorie-counts-need-more-context-experts-say-8332.aspx", "image": "http://images.agoramedia.com/EverydayHealth/video/video-default-image-722x406.jpg", "site": "@everydayhealth", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 135346036490186}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc63c\"", "article_summary": "How You Can Use Menu Calorie CountsIn the meantime, here are some tips to help you navigate the calorie counts that are coming:\n\u201cThat will be eye-opening for some people.\u201dContext Counts, TooOther research has suggested that calorie counts are particularly effective when the number is put in context.\nCalorie counts are soon to appear on chain restaurant menus across the country, but many experts are worried that consumers won\u2019t know how to make use of them.\nThis final installment looks at how consumers can use calorie counts to their advantage.\nHaving calorie counts available led people to make healthier choices, but the biggest surprise came later."}
