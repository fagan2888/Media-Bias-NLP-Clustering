America will be over if we don\u2019t stop Hillary\u2026uhm Bernie\u2026uh Hillary!\n\nSound familiar? It should. I could also toss in the same bits for the midterm elections of 2006, 2010, and 2014 \u2013 and for pre-2004 election cycles. And it\u2019s all wrong. There is no one \u201cmost important election of our lifetimes\u201d. Hyperbole is a very poor substitute for substance.\n\n\u201cConservatives\u201d are today every bit as caught up in cults of personality as progressives and Democrats have been during the age of Obama. Donald Trump\u2019s cult is built around \u201cHe fights!\u201d, and \u201cHe\u2019s anti-establishment!\u201d, even though his record across decades indicates something much different. Ted Cruz\u2019s cult is built around \u201cOnly he is for the Constitution!\u201d, except the Senator has this annoying habit of pushing social/moral statism for which there are no enumerated powers in, you know, the Constitution. There\u2019s even a John Kasich cult (stop laughing!). Yes, there are really people who believe delegates at the Republican Convention will coalesce around him.\n\nIf November 2016 winds up being a contest between the current front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton can\u2019t you just wait to make a voting decision between a big government-loving, influence peddling and purchasing progressive and\u2026Hillary Clinton?\n\nI had occasion to remark as follows on Facebook: \u201cA choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like being offered poison, and being offered a choice between arsenic and strychnine.\u201d\n\nElecting one person, or winning one single election cycle\u2014or for that matter, defeating one candidate in one cycle\u2014will change absolutely nothing long term. History tells us this: focusing on a single person at a single moment provides false hope. Calvin Coolidge\u2019s presidency wound up being a minor speed bump to progressivism during the 1920s. Ronald Reagan provided even less of an application of brakes on expansive government in the 1980s.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m about ready to write off 2016. We\u2019ve moved beyond the circular firing squad, and have totally surrendered reason to rhetoric.\n\nMaking it all about winning on November 8, 2016 causes everyone to lose sight that we need to win on Tuesday, November 5, 2060 (or beyond) \u2013 and work backwards with winning strategies and tactics from there, which includes \u201cHow do we win in 2058, 2056, 2054, 2052, \u2026 ,2024, 2022, 2020, 2018, and now?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a huge amount of irony in conservatives and Republicans claiming to want Washington, DC to have less import in our daily lives, or at least to pay more attention to the people and states (e.g. Ted Cruz, #MakeDCListen\u201d), but every two years when a national election rolls around, the focus is entirely on Washington.\n\nIsn\u2019t \u201cour side\u201d supposed to be for bottom-up action and responsibility, not top-down authority? As my friend Taylor Millard recently noted, \u201cour side\u201d is all-too-susceptible to the \u201call-encompassing state\u201d as the solution. We tend to be fine with statism, so long as it accomplishes an end we approve of, and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nI had Hot Air\u2018s Ed Morrissey on my Their Finest Hour program Saturday night (4/23/2016) to talk about his book Going Red: The Two Million Voters Who Will Elect the Next President\u2014and How Conservatives Can Win Them. It was a great conversation, and I encourage you to listen. One of the themes of Going Red we kept coming back to is the need for the Republican Party to engage locally much more than nationally. Messaging that doesn\u2019t sell nationally isn\u2019t going to sell locally, and vice versa. That applies far beyond this election cycle, which may well already have been decided by what has preceded it.\n\nElection Day 2016 isn\u2019t an end; it\u2019s a means to an end.\n\nWhat\u2019s a much more important election than 2016? How about 2017? Are you upset at the GOP? Think they ignore the grass roots? Can\u2019t stand the \u201cestablishment\u201d? In 2017, there will be thousands of local elections across America when local, county, and state-level GOP committee members will be chosen. The makeup of the \u201cestablishment\u201d is up to you.\n\nMirror check: you have the Republican Party you have either asked for or failed to influence when given the direct opportunity. The \u201cestablishment\u201d is you.\n\nDo you want to start winning? Do you want to have lasting victories, and lasting, positive, change in the direction of liberty and limited government?\n\nStart there.\n\nAllan Bourdius is a co-founder of Vigilant Liberty Radio and the founder and Editor of Their Finest Hour.
