CREDIT: In The Land Of The Free\n\nSolitary confinement has been called a \u201cliving death,\u201d cruel and unusual, and torture. Studies of the prison practice of placing inmates in a solitary, often concrete windowless cell for 23 hours a day with almost no human contact, have found that the psychological impact is dramatic after just a few days.\n\nA University of Michigan neuroscientist suggested Friday that the physical impact on the brain could be just as significant if not moreso, and could \u201cdramatically change the brain\u201d in just a matter of days. Speaking on a panel about solitary confinement, neuroscientist Huda Akil said inaccess to inmates has prevented much formal study on brain changes while held in confinement. But she said a number of other studies have documented how each of the factors involved in solitary confinement change the physical shape of the brain. The lack of physical interaction with the natural world, the lack of social interaction, and the lack of touch and visual stimulation alone are each \u201cby itself is sufficient to dramatically change the brain,\u201d Akil said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting.\n\nShe said particular parts of the brain that are subject to extreme stress can \u201cactually shrink,\u201d including the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory, spatial orientation, and control of emotions.\n\nRobert King, a member of the \u201cAngola 3\u201d who was held in solitary confinement for years before his conviction was overturned in a racially charged murder case based on flimsy evidence, said his eyesight and physical orientation are permanently impaired. \u201cMy geography is way off,\u201d he said. \u201cI get lost sometimes in my own neighborhood. I believe that this is a result of my solitary confinement.\u201d Two of King\u2019s fellow defendants remained in solitary, one until just days before his death in October.\n\nOther psychological impacts documented by psychology professor Craig Haney include \u201cextreme paranoia, self-mutilation, hypersensitivity to sound, light and touch, and severe cognition dysfunction among prisoners.\u201d\n\nOne recent psychological study concluded, \u201cThe restriction of environmental stimulation and social isolation associated with confinement in solitary are strikingly toxic to mental functioning.\u201d And prisoners, many of whom are later released, have described developing rage and violent tendencies while confined.\n\n\u201cTo me, the separation of the mental and physical is highly artificial, because there are definitely physical consequences of these experiences,\u201d said Akil.\n\nThe prolonged, isolated confinement of inmates has been held unconstitutional as applied to the mentally ill, and at least two courts have now held that indefinite, unreviewed confinement is also unconstitutional. But the practice remains common, and has not been invalidated outright. At least 80,000 U.S. prisoners are held in solitary confinement by some estimates, and it is frequently used not to segregate dangerous prisoners, but as a means of social control, or mental health treatment. In California, more than 500 inmates have reportedly been kept in confinement for 10 to 28 years.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Researchers have long known that solitary confinement has severe psychological impacts in just a matter of days.
