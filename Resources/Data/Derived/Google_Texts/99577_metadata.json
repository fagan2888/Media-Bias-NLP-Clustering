Follow on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAnybody who has dabbled in drugs knows that social media is a great way to reach a user.\n\nAddicts spend a lot of time transfixed online, looking for both nothing and everything. It\u2019s a way to pass the time when you\u2019re really not sure what the hell you\u2019re doing.\n\nSo news that the Indiana Department of Public Health has launched a social media campaign as part of its plan to battle a massive HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana makes good sense, experts agree.\n\nBut will just any campaign do? What\u2019s the best way to reach a poor, white addict in a rural, southern Indiana community steeped in bigotry and the Bible?\n\nJoe Schrank is a social worker and operates a recovery house called Loft 107 in Brooklyn. He also founded The Fix, a website offering news and resources about addiction. Its brand: \u201cAddiction and recovery, straight up.\u201d\n\nSchrank doesn\u2019t hold anything back. In an interview with Imstilljosh, he explained why an effective social media campaign needs to be void of the sort of thinking permeating the Religious Freedom law, one that screams of judgment or mandates by God.\n\n\u201cIt would be great to say, to stop the spread of HIV to heroin users, \u2018OMG, the Lord doesn\u2019t like it, stop. But from a public health perspective, let\u2019s slay this beast.\u201d\n\n\u2018You Are Not Alone\u2019 Not Very Sexy\n\nSo far, the state\u2019s campaign appears to be very generic and void of any real personality. Experts interviewed for a story that appeared on Healthline said a general approach to prevent infections makes sense in the early days of an epidemic.\n\nThe campaign is called \u201cYou are Not Alone.\u201d Currently on the Indiana home page is an image of a shadowy faced woman cast against a dark background.\n\nCertain words of \u201cYou are Not Alone\u201d are in red, so as to say \u201cYou are Not One\u201d at a quick glance.\n\nClick on the image and it takes you to U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) links about HIV, STDs, and needle disposal/disinfection.\n\nIt also includes information about how to sign up for Healthy Indiana. Indiana did participate in the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Many low-income people can qualify for health insurance even with a minimum wage job under the expansion.\n\nThe problem is that there is only one doctor in town, and the nearest HIV clinic is 30 miles away in Louisville. In a compelling \u2018on the ground\u2019 piece, The New York Times reported Monday that of the three (out of more than six dozen confirmed infections) people who have been referred to treatment, zero showed up to their appointments in Louisville.\n\nREAD MORE: Healthline: Activists Blame HIV Outbreak on Officials\u2019 Ignorance About the Disease\n\nDrug Culture \u2018Boundary-Less\u2019 When Fix Needed\n\nJust as The Fix offers addiction and recovery news \u201cstraight up,\u201d Schrank said the same approach needs to be taken in Scott County.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be public demonstrations, from medical professionals not Jesus\u2019 friend,\u201d he told Imstilljosh. \u201cThe message needs to be \u2018Be a responsible drug user.\u2019 People interpret that as permission to use drugs. My take on that is that they are not going to ask for your permission.\u201d\n\nThat includes immediately rolling out the temporary needle exchange that the governor approved for that county and explaining it to people. The fact that it ends in 30 days means it probably won\u2019t make much of a difference anyway most experts agree.\n\nAs of Friday, nowhere does information about the needle exchange appear when you click on the \u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d logo. The temporary needle exchange only has been approved for Scott County. There is a link that provides more detailed information by county.\n\nInjectors won\u2019t think twice about sharing a needle if that\u2019s the easiest way to get the job done at the moment, Schrank said. \u201cThe drug culture is boundary-less. They are willing to inject a substance smuggled into the country up someone\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nA Big \u2018F\u2014You\u2019 to Injectors at Risk for HIV?\n\nSchrank said cities in some countries actually provide \u201csafe rooms\u201d where people can go inject in private, safely disposal of the needle, and be done with it.\n\nHe said people in the U.S. don\u2019t look at preventing HIV among drug addicts as that much of a priority. \u201cIt\u2019s just not that compassionate in a Western society. It\u2019s, \u2018Well, fuck you, you shouldn\u2019t have used drugs and maybe you\u2019re gay.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the context of the newly passed Religious Freedom Law in Indiana, this makes being an impoverished drug addict with HIV even more inhospitable. As Schrank said in an interview with Healthline, \u201cIndiana is an absurd place. Being HIV-positive is looked at as\u2026you\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoorly educated white people\u2026there\u2019s got to be a deeper level of shame of being HIV-positive, that people don\u2019t want to ask for help,\u201d Schrank told Imstilljosh. \u201cHIV still has that stigma.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "HIV, AIDS, HIV Outbreak, HIV Indiana, You Are Not Alone, Josh Robbins, HIV Activists, HIV AIDS, HIV Drug Abusers, Social Media Indiana HIV", "og": {"site_name": "I'm Still Josh | HIV Blog | HIV Positive Activist", "description": "Experts say stopping the HIV epidemic will mean taking the outreach to drug injectors to make a difference in Indiana-- on social media.", "title": "Social Media for HIV Poz Slammers: Make It Powerful", "url": "http://www.imstilljosh.com/social-media-for-poz-slammers-make-it-powerful11513/", "image": "http://www.imstilljosh.com/wp-content/uploads/HIV-indiana-social-media-campaign-you-are-not-alone-1024x512.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Experts say stopping the HIV epidemic will mean taking the outreach to drug injectors to make a difference in Indiana-- on social media.", "creator": "@Davidheitz", "url": "http://www.imstilljosh.com/social-media-for-poz-slammers-make-it-powerful11513/", "image": "http://www.imstilljosh.com/wp-content/uploads/HIV-indiana-social-media-campaign-you-are-not-alone.jpg", "title": "Social Media for HIV Poz Slammers: Make It Powerful", "site": "@Imstilljosh", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1412951968942377, "pages": "content=\"307398006027050\""}, "keywords": "HIV,AIDS,HIV Outbreak,HIV Indiana,You Are Not Alone,Josh Robbins,HIV Activists,HIV/AIDS,HIV Drug Abusers,Social Media Indiana HIV,aids,David Heitz,featured,hiv,HIV Social Media,Indiana HIV,Living with HIV: Josh's words,Social Media,Social Media HIV Activist", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshuarobbins"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Experts say stopping the HIV epidemic will mean taking the outreach to drug injectors to make a difference in Indiana-- on social media."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1632\"", "article_summary": "Experts say stopping the HIV epidemic will mean taking the outreach to drug injectors to make a difference in Indiana\u2013 on social media.\nAnybody who has dabbled in drugs knows that social media is a great way to reach a user.\nSo news that the Indiana Department of Public Health has launched a social media campaign as part of its plan to battle a massive HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana makes good sense, experts agree.\nIn an interview with Imstilljosh, he explained why an effective social media campaign needs to be void of the sort of thinking permeating the Religious Freedom law, one that screams of judgment or mandates by God.\nHe said people in the U.S. don\u2019t look at preventing HIV among drug addicts as that much of a priority."}
