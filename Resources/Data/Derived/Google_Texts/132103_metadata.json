It is an all-too-common occurrence in the modern world for a company to begin using social media with high hopes, only to find that it isn\u2019t making much of a difference.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nThis happens because they\u2019re using it wrong. Followers on social media accounts don\u2019t want to feel as though they are being advertised to nonstop. Instead, they want to feel connected to companies and professionals on a deeper level. If you can successfully make them feel connected, you can generate a type of customer loyalty like nothing else can. Customers will grow to think of your business as a good friend instead of just another place to sell products. There are two important aspects to creating this:\n\nKeeping your social media accounts active Going about it the right way\n\nReady to find out how you can do this? Just follow these six simple steps to keep your social media accounts relevant. Check out the additional tips and tricks at the end for more \u2018how-to\u2019 information.\n\nStep One: Craft A Post Daily\n\nCrafting a well thought out social media post will literally take you five minutes or less. Although creating a post strictly for advertising purposes is fine once in a while, the vast majority should be aimed towards engaging with your audience. The best way to do this is simply ask a question. If you\u2019re stuck on what to write or ask about, try something very basic, like this:\n\n\u201cThe weather\u2019s bright and sunny here today! What\u2019s the weather like where you live?\u201d\n\nThis super simple post will engage with your audience simply because you\u2019ve asked a question. In order to remain professional about it, however, you need to remember a few things. Always double check for spelling, grammatical errors, and typos. Also avoid abbreviations, which are not only unprofessional but also incredibly annoying.\n\nStep Two: Like All Comments From The Previous Day\n\nLiking all comments left on your posts from the previous day is simple, and takes almost no time at all. Even if you had over 500 comments, it is entirely plausible that giving each of them a like will take you no more than about ten minutes. The \u2018why\u2019 behind doing this is that it makes your customers feel as though you actually care about what they have to say. This is a big part of forming that strong customer loyalty we talked about in the introduction.\n\nStep Three: Personally Respond To At Least Five Comments\n\nWhile it may be near impossible \u2013 or at least horribly time consuming \u2013 to respond to every comment you receive, you should be personally responding to at least five of them each day\u2026 per social media account. Even if it\u2019s nothing more than a simple \u201cthank you.\u201d This helps solidify the idea that your company cares about what it\u2019s customers have to say.\n\nRecommended for You Webcast: Hacking SEO: The Fastest Way to Double Your Rankings in 90 Days\n\nStep Four: Share Something\n\nIn addition to one personally crafted post each day, you should also be sharing something. Try to share items that are relevant to your customers. Preferably, these would be posts or articles written by businesses you have connected with on some level. Why? It would serve two purposes. First, it keeps your social media accounts active and relevant. Second, it prompts other companies and professionals to share your posts in return.\n\nStep Five: Connect With At Least One New Person\n\nTake just a second to connect with at least one new person each day. This will help to ensure your list of professional contacts slowly but steadily grows over time. Your professional contacts are incredibly important, because they serve numerous purposes. Primarily, it offers you a sharing network. If you share their stuff, they\u2019ll share yours. Your professional contacts may also be able to offer advice, tips, tricks of the trade, and additional contacts to tap into.\n\nStep Six: Repeat For Each Social Media Account\n\nNow simply repeat the above five steps for each social media account you have.
