Rick Scott\u2019s push for $1 billion in tax breaks, a proposed $3 billion gambling deal with the Seminole Tribe, the always contentious state budget, and politics \u2013 which has gotten intensely personal after a court redistricting ruling last month reshaped Senate boundaries and could force some incumbents to run against each other.\n\nSens. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, and Joe Abruzzo, D-Wellington, are among those potential clashes, with each eyeing a southwestern Palm Beach County district.\n\nBut how recent bad history plays out in the Legislature is also an unknown. Last year, the House and Senate spent more time in conflict than cooperation.\n\nThe Senate pushed a plan to expand health insurance for low-income Floridians under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, triggering a standoff with the more conservative House, which gained an ally in Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nThe regular session ground into a budget impasse \u2013 with the House even adjourning three days early \u2014 sending a clear thumb-nose to the Senate.\n\nWith a government shutdown looming July 1, a special session was needed in June to approve a $78 billion state budget.\n\nLawmakers later returned for sessions on congressional and Senate redistricting, which also collapsed amid tension between the House and Senate, leaving Democrats angered, but gloating a bit at the failures of the Republican-led chambers.\n\n\u201cYou can only hope that leadership has learned its lessons from last year,\u201d said House Democratic Leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach.\n\nBut a major hurdle already emerging is Scott\u2019s business-dominated tax-cut package, which would eliminate the corporate income tax for manufacturers and retailers, along with the sales tax applied to manufacturers\u2019 equipment purchases.\n\nScott\u2019s fellow Republican leaders in the Legislature are wary of permanently erasing $1 billion in tax revenue flowing into the state. Losing such cash could hamstring state government going forward, critics said, while also limiting the ambitions of legislative leaders.\n\n\u201cThere certainly are competing priorities,\u201d said Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, whose district includes northern Palm Beach County and is set to become Senate president following next year\u2019s elections.\n\nHe has already outlined plans to push $1 billion more toward state universities by 2018.\n\nThe governor, though, is certain to make the tax breaks a key part of his State of the State address, which he is slated to deliver to lawmakers about 11 a.m., Tuesday, shortly after the Legislature convenes.\n\nScott has already launched a campaign-styled effort to pressure lawmakers into approving the reductions. His political committee, Let\u2019s Get to Work, is spending $1 million on a TV spot airing around the state that features Scott and business professionals touting the tax cut.\n\nScott also plans to conduct a whistle stop tour of several cities this week, including Boca Raton on Thursday, to promote the state\u2019s robust job-growth numbers.\n\nScott sees the tax break as central to keeping the Florida economy firing.\n\n\u201cI want to diversify this economy,\u201d Scott told a House committee last month, in a rare appearance before a legislative panel. \u201cI want more small businesses to be able to grow to big businesses.\n\n\u201cI want everybody to say I have to live in Florida, because I know that if I live in Florida, I can get a good paying job. This tax reduction package is an investment in every family in our state,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 200 Palm Beach County officials and leaders will have a ringside seat for early action this week \u2013 converging Wednesday on the Capitol for the annual Palm Beach County Day.\n\nMayor Mary Lou Berger will be among five county commissioners expected to attend, along with school board members, representatives of the county\u2019s economic council, Florida Atlantic University, Palm Beach State College and businesses, including Palm Beach Kennel Club, which has a stake in the proposed gambling deal now before lawmakers.\n\nThe county has a range of priorities. Budget items for the Glades, road and environmental improvements, sober home legislation and authorizing slot machines at PBKC are just some of the items county officials are promoting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to make our case,\u201d said Todd Bonlarron, the county\u2019s lobbyist, of the meetings scheduled with legislative leaders and budget chiefs. \u201cThis is where it all starts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida Legislature opens the 2016 regular session, after a contentious year marked by divisions over health care and redistricting.", "author": "By John Kennedy - Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/as-florida-session-opens-lawmakers-try-to-get-alon/npz6b/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/15/55/d3/455128225.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Legislature opens the 2016 regular session, after a contentious year marked by divisions over health care and redistricting.", "title": "Florida Legislature 2016: Lawmakers open session seeking harmony"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/10/15/55/d3/455128225.jpg", "description": "State lawmakers open the 2016 legislative session this week, and for Floridians, the fate of school dollars, tax cuts, and a host of government programs may hinge on whether a handful of elected leaders can get along.", "card": "summary", "title": "As Florida session opens, lawmakers try to get along"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "mypbp", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/as-florida-session-opens-lawmakers-try-to-get-alon/npz6b/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3200673/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/as-florida-session-opens-lawmakers-try-to-get-alon/npz6b/", "keywords": "newsfeed,allpbc,Legislature", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "More than 200 Palm Beach County officials and leaders will have a ringside seat for early action this week \u2013 converging Wednesday on the Capitol for the annual Palm Beach County Day.\nMaria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, and Joe Abruzzo, D-Wellington, are among those potential clashes, with each eyeing a southwestern Palm Beach County district.\nWith a government shutdown looming July 1, a special session was needed in June to approve a $78 billion state budget.\n\u201cYou can only hope that leadership has learned its lessons from last year,\u201d said House Democratic Leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach.\n\u201cThere certainly are competing priorities,\u201d said Sen.
