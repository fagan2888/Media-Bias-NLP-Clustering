PHILADELPHIA — Darrun Hilliard scored 15 points and Josh Hart added 13 to help No. 7 Villanova avenge its worst game of the season with a 69-53 win over No. 24 Georgetown on Saturday.

The Hoyas thumped the Wildcats (21-2, 8-2 Big East) by 20 points in the first game on Jan. 19. In the second matchup of the longtime conference rivals, the Wildcats raced to a 17-point lead and never looked back in their fourth consecutive win.

L.J. Peak scored 15 points for the Hoyas (15-8, 7-5 Big East), who, with losses this week to Providence and Villanova, are sure to fall out of the Top 25.

They’ve won eight of nine and have played up to their billing as the preseason Big East favorite.

Villanova upset Georgetown in the 1985 national championship game and wore ‘85 throwback uniforms for a game that featured selected highlights from that “Perfect Game” playing on the big screen.

The Wildcats made a few more for this season’s reel. Hilliard and Dylan Ennis hit consecutive 3-pointers for a 12-7 lead that sparked the rout.

With a packed house at the Wells Fargo Center adding to the big-game feel, the Wildcats quickly squashed any thoughts of a Georgetown sweep. Hilliard converted a four-point play early before the 3-point barrage started.

The Wildcats came in shooting 36 percent from 3-point range and were nailing them with the ease of fastbreak layups. Ennis hit one for a 10-point lead, Ryan Arcidiacono made it 27-13 with his and the Wildcats finished 7 of 13 in the half.

The Hoyas never got untracked offensively. They missed 7 of 8 3s in the half and received no meaningful production from leading scorers D’Vauntes Smith-Rivera and Joshua Smith. Smith-Rivera was scoreless in the first half and Smith only scored two points on a combined 1 of 6 shooting.

In the first game, Smith-Rivera scored 17 points for the Hoyas, who pulled away early with a 17-0 run on the way to a 42-20 halftime lead. Georgetown shot 60 percent in the first half and 51 percent for the game.

With a cold offense, the Hoyas never made a serious attempt at a second-half comeback.

Kris Jenkins kept the good times rolling for the Wildcats in the second half. He hit consecutive 3-pointers for a 51-29 lead and made the Wildcats 10 of 18 from 3-point range.
