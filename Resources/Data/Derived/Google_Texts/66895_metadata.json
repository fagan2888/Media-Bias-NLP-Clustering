Moore remains in legal limbo as he fights the buildings condo association over allegations his apartment is illegal.\n\nFrank Marciano, Moore\u2019s lawyer, says the 1000 Hudson Street Condominium Association is using \u201cfalse allegations\u201d to sidestep the law and zoning laws \u201cas a sword to cut the landlord-tenant relationship. And they are not allowed to do that.\u201d\n\nMoore, 51, who works for the film industry as a location scout, said he\u2019s been fighting the eviction since 2012 and has received numerous eviction notices.\n\nThe condo association took Moore and his wife to court in August 2013, but the case was dismissed. They\u2019ll all be back in court Monday when a judge will issue a ruling whether the condo association can move forward with eviction proceedings.\n\nThe building\u2019s board of directors claim there is no evidence that Moore\u2019s apartment and two other basement apartments \u2014 where an elderly couple and a live-in superintendent reside \u2014 actually exist.\n\nThere is \u201cno mention ... of the basement apartments in the master deed and there is no tax record for them,\u201d according to a Dec. 17, 2012, email from Lori Turoff, then-president of the condo association\u2019s board of directors, to Hoboken Zoning Officer Ann Holtzman.\n\nThe condo association\u2019s board wants the tenants out so the basement can be converted into a \u201ccommon area\u201d and a \u201clegal apartment for a live-in super,\u201d Turoff said in a 2012 email.\n\nThe city sided with Turoff and the condo\u2019s board.\n\nIn a Jan. 25, 2013 letter, Holtzman concurs that there are no records of the basement apartments with the city. These units, Holtzman wrote, \u201care not acknowledged by or registered as legal units in the Master Deed for 1000 Hudson Street Condominium.\u201d\n\nMoore, his wife and the elderly couple were given 60 days to vacate their homes, according to Holtzman\u2019s letter. Marciano says the condo association board\u2019s claims are bogus.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t evict a tenant unless you have good cause,\u201d Marciano said, \u201cand there is no good cause to evict these people.\u201d\n\nMarciano says he has evidence, including property records dating back to 1941, that show the basement apartments have long been acknowledged.\n\nTuroff, who still sits on the condo association\u2019s board, and is a spokeswoman for Arthur Edwards Inc., the management company that owns the building, refused to comment.\n\nA response from Hoboken issued through city spokesman Juan Melli made no mention of the numerous city documents citing the basement apartments.\n\n\u201cThe zoning officer explained to the board that three\n\nunits in the building are not legal and that they had various options for resolving the situation (eviction, relocation, or seeking Zoning Board approvals to make the units conform to code),\u201d Melli said in an email.\n\nMoore moved into the apartment with a roommate in the mid-1980s and moved out in the early 1990s, but his roommate continued to live there. Moore returned to the apartment, which he said has \u201cnostalgic and sentimental qualities,\u201d in 2003 and took over the apartment.\n\nMoore\u2019s apartment is located in one of the three connected buildings that make up at 1000 Hudson St. The five-story brick buildings are located in a quiet neighborhood and across the street from Elysian Park.\n\nThe 700-square foot apartment, with pipes running along the ceiling of the kitchen, has four rooms connected by a narrow hallway.\n\nMoore said if he loses his battle, he and his wife would be forced to leave the city they call home.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t just be giving up the apartment, we would probably be giving up Hoboken,\u201d Moore said. \u201cMy wife and I both love Hoboken.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hoboken", "title": "Hoboken man back in court soon over condo association trying to kick him out of basement apartment", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hoboken man back in court soon over condo association trying to kick him out of basement apartment\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/03/hoboken_man_back_in_court_soon.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/03/14526094-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12489910\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-22T07:04:55Z\", \"author\": \"Mike D\\u0027Onofrio | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hoboken\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/03/14526094-small.jpg", "description": "Tommy Moore has lived in a rent-controlled apartment in the basement of a multimillion-dollar condominium building in Hoboken for years, but he is now fighting to keep his home.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, March 22, 2014,  3:04 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/03/14526094-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"MikeDonofrio\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike D\\u0027Onofrio | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11537027\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Tommy Moore has lived in a rent-controlled apartment in the basement of a multimillion-dollar condominium building in Hoboken for years, but he is now fighting to keep his home.", "title": "Hoboken man back in court soon over condo association trying to kick him out of basement apartment", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/03/hoboken_man_back_in_court_soon.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, March 22, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Mike D'Onofrio | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "Tommy Moore has lived in a rent-controlled apartment in the basement of a multimillion-dollar condominium building in Hoboken for years, but he is now fighting to keep his home."}, "article_summary": "They\u2019ll all be back in court Monday when a judge will issue a ruling whether the condo association can move forward with eviction proceedings.\nThe condo association took Moore and his wife to court in August 2013, but the case was dismissed.\nMoore remains in legal limbo as he fights the buildings condo association over allegations his apartment is illegal.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t just be giving up the apartment, we would probably be giving up Hoboken,\u201d Moore said.\nMarciano says the condo association board\u2019s claims are bogus."}
