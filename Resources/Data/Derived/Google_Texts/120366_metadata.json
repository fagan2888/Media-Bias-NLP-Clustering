It left some people unsure if they completed the process in time. MNsure has had several problems with it\u2019s website from the start this fall.\n\nPeople signing up last minute shared frustrations online. Looking at MNsure\u2019s Facebook page, frustrated comments came in from people claiming to have been on hold for more than three hours and then hung up on. Others complained the website was still not working.\n\nMNsure officials have faced a lot of heat for problems with the exchange and internal leadership since this fall, when it began under the Federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nLate last week, 50,000 people had completed applications to buy private health plans but hadn\u2019t completed enrollment because of website problems or if they just didn\u2019t continue on in the process. Close to 20,000 people had completed enrollment as of Dec. 27, 2013.\n\nThousands more Minnesotans have until March 31 to sign up, so they aren\u2019t penalized for not having insurance. State officials have encouraged people to sign up before the January 1 deadline to kick off the New Year with insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the new year began at midnight, so did benefits for thousands of Minnesotans who signed up for MNsure.
