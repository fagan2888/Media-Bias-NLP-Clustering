She said the restaurant closed Tuesday partly because of increased competition in the area and partly because of changes with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe decision was difficult and was not made lightly,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cUnfortunately, the competition in the area had increased, and other restaurants were offering a breakfast menu at a price that made it difficult to compete with and remain profitable.\u201d\n\nSullivan went on to write that the restaurant was not able to lower its prices without a negative effect on quality and service \u2013 \u201cboth of which Mr. [Dick] Portillo was not willing to compromise.\u201d She added that the additional costs and changes that are necessary under the Affordable Care Act \u201cwould have undermined our efforts to turn the store around.\u201d\n\nThe breakfast and lunch place opened at 521 N. Randall Road in August 2010. The greeting on the restaurant\u2019s answering machine says \u201cwe regret to inform you that this location has closed\u201d and says calls and messages left at that location will not be returned. Honey-Jam Cafe locations still are operating in Downers Grove and Bolingbrook, according to the answering machine.\n\nBatavia Mayor Jeff Schielke said he was surprised to hear that the restaurant closed because he was there twice in the past 10 days and the restaurant seemed very busy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of dumbfounded by it, really,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been such a good business to have in town, a good staple and was very popular with people in town. I\u2019m sure there are going to be a lot of people disappointed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Kane County Chronicle", "og": {"url": "http://www.kcchronicle.com/2013/10/31/honey-jam-cafe-in-batavia-closes/abym1ra/", "image": "http://www.kcchronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/ro4nyobqnlsspdfkq7do0njtckta01", "site_name": "Kane County Chronicle", "description": "BATAVIA \u2013 The Honey-Jam Cafe in Batavia has closed, restaurant officials said Thursday.", "title": "Honey-Jam Cafe in Batavia closes"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kcchronicle", "image": "http://www.kcchronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/ro4nyobqnlsspdfkq7do0njtckta01", "description": "BATAVIA \u2013 The Honey-Jam Cafe in Batavia has closed, restaurant officials said Thursday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Honey-Jam Cafe in Batavia closes"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1089016044", "tout": {"article": {"id": "0cf93ad9-711e-4ea3-99d9-dc6814f99fba"}}, "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2412\"", "article_summary": "BATAVIA \u2013 The Honey-Jam Cafe in Batavia has closed, restaurant officials said Thursday.\nPatty Sullivan is a spokeswoman for the Portillo Restaurant Group, which owns Honey-Jam Cafe.\nHoney-Jam Cafe locations still are operating in Downers Grove and Bolingbrook, according to the answering machine.\nBatavia Mayor Jeff Schielke said he was surprised to hear that the restaurant closed because he was there twice in the past 10 days and the restaurant seemed very busy.\nShe said the restaurant closed Tuesday partly because of increased competition in the area and partly because of changes with the Affordable Care Act."}
