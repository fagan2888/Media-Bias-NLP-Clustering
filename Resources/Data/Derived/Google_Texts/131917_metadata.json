Congress has remained a roadblock even in the face of widespread public support for Obama\u2019s past calls for universal background checks or bolstered mental health support, with near uniform opposition from Republicans and a split on the issue among Democrats.\n\nObama will sit down with Cooper at 8 p.m. ET for the event, titled \u201cGuns in America.\u201d The event\u2019s timing coincides with the fifth anniversary, this Friday, of the shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, in a rampage that left six dead and 13 others wounded.\n\nIn addition to discussing gun issues with Cooper, Obama will also take questions from the audience on the issue.\n\nObama has repeatedly expressed his frustration with Congress\u2019 inability to pass new gun laws, and has frequently spoken out about increased gun control in the wake of mass shootings.\n\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s town hall, Obama plans to meet Monday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss options for tougher gun restrictions. He is also expected to announce in the coming days a new executive action with the goal of expanding background checks on gun sales.\n\nPlans for the action are not yet complete, and those familiar with the process warn that unforeseen circumstances could delay an announcement. But gun control advocates are expecting the new actions to be revealed next week, ahead of Obama\u2019s annual State of the Union address, set for January 12.\n\nGun control advocates and White House officials say the focus remains on the so-called \u201cgun show loophole,\u201d which allows certain sellers of guns \u2014 at gun shows and elsewhere \u2014 to avoid conducting background checks before making sales.\n\nCongress would still need to act in order to make background checks fully universal. But advocates and administration lawyers have struck upon a provision in the law that could allow for Obama to expand the background check requirement to additional sellers.\n\nA spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said the White House hasn\u2019t contacted them about potential new legislation yet.\n\n\u201cThe administration has not communicated with us, and we have not been briefed. We will consider options once we have information, but what seems apparent is none of these ideas would have prevented the recent atrocities,\u201d said AshLee Strong, the Ryan spokeswoman. \u201cOur focus should be on the consistent causes of these acts \u2014 mental illnesses and terrorism \u2014 rather than infringing on law-abiding Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nGun control advocates are also anticipating that the administration will bolster regulations on the reporting of lost and stolen guns. Currently, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is only required to investigate a gun theft if 10 or more guns are stolen and one of them is used in a crime. The administration is expected to tighten those requirements by reducing the minimum number of guns stolen that would prompt an investigation, and potentially eliminating the requirement that one of the guns is used in a crime.\n\nObama foreshadowed his actions in his weekly address.\n\n\u201cChange, as always, is going to take all of us,\u201d Obama said in his address. \u201cThe gun lobby is loud and well organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone. The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well organized in our defense of our kids. That\u2019s the work of citizenship \u2014 to stand up and fight for the change that we seek.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that we can\u2019t stop every act of violence,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut what if we tried to stop even one? What if Congress did something \u2014 anything \u2014 to protect our kids from gun violence?\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s move comes as Republican presidential contenders threaten to undo any executive actions he takes on guns if they replace him in the Oval Office.\n\nDonald Trump vowed Saturday in Mississippi to \u201cunsign\u201d anything Obama implements.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an assault on the Second Amendment. You know Obama\u2019s going to do an executive order and really knock the hell out of it,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cYou know, the system\u2019s supposed to be you get the Democrats, you get the Republicans, and you make deals. He can\u2019t do that. He can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo he\u2019s going to sign another executive order having to do with the Second Amendment, having to do with guns. I will veto. I will unsign that so fast.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s not the only Republican 2016 candidate making such threats.\n\n\u201cAll these executive orders he\u2019s gonna come out with tomorrow that are going to undermine our Second Amendment rights \u2014 on my first day in office, they\u2019re gone,\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said at a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday morning.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Obama \u201cwants to act as if he is a king, as if he is a dictator.\u201d\n\n\u201cFact is, if he wants to make changes to these laws, go to Congress and convince the Congress that they\u2019re necessary. But this is going to be another illegal executive action, which I\u2019m sure will be rejected by the courts and when I become President will be stricken from executive action by executive action I\u2019ll take.\u201d\n\nAnd former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Obama should take his case to Congress \u2014 rather than imposing new measures himself.\n\n\u201cHis first impulse always is to take rights away from law-abiding citizens, and it\u2019s wrong. And to use executive powers he doesn\u2019t have is a pattern that is quite dangerous,\u201d Bush said.\n\nCarly Fiorina told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Obama \u201chas been lawless in his use of executive orders.\n\n\u201cIt is delusional, dangerous, not to mention unconstitutional, for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to continue talking about climate change and gun control in the wake of a Paris terrorist attack, in the wake of a San Bernardino terrorist attack, instead of how we can defeat ISIS,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nStill, Democrats have rallied to Obama\u2019s side.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Obama has little choice but to act alone to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.\n\n\u201cI would prefer that we could have bipartisan support, but the truth is Republicans aren\u2019t interested in doing anything on gun safety,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she\u2019s \u201cespecially concerned (about 2016) because I know what a Republican president would mean.\u201d\n\nShe argued a GOP president would repeal executive actions on Day 1, \u201cincluding one that we expect (Obama) to make in the next weeks to try to do more to have background checks for more gun buyers by requiring more sellers to do them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "38.829971;-77.307549", "description": "FAIRFAX, Virginia -- President Barack Obama is mounting a final-year push to make gun control part of his legacy despite Republican opposition and is expected to announce unilateral action soon.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "6234caa106890daf4037e63d88245e14"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX6Now.com", "description": "FAIRFAX, Virginia \u2014 President Barack Obama is mounting a final-year push to make gun control part of his legacy despite Republican opposition and is expected to announce unilateral action soo\u2026", "title": "\u201cGuns in America:\u201d President Barack Obama to take part in one-hour live town hall on gun control", "url": "http://fox6now.com/2016/01/03/guns-in-america-president-barack-obama-to-take-part-in-one-hour-live-town-hall-on-gun-control/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/guns-checks.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/guns-checks.jpg?w=240", "site": "@fox6now", "card": "summary", "creator": "@fox6now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334682375", "fb": {"pages": 7010901522}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox6now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6c174f1af90d3de8afc154eb8bcd6c4a?s=16", "application-name": "FOX6Now.com", "ICBM": "38.829971, -77.307549", "keywords": "news, gun control, guns in america, president barack obama", "google-site-verification": "iXLB9DCJ8o44w3SHddEhtmvCXRUfxQCVRXXMHkyL6jI", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox6news", "published_time": "2016-01-03T23:28:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-03T23:28:20+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox6news"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3608\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 \u201cGuns in America:\u201d President Barack Obama to take part in one-hour live town hall on gun controlFAIRFAX, Virginia \u2014 President Barack Obama is mounting a final-year push to make gun control part of his legacy despite Republican opposition and is expected to announce unilateral action soon.\nBut this is going to be another illegal executive action, which I\u2019m sure will be rejected by the courts and when I become President will be stricken from executive action by executive action I\u2019ll take.\u201dAnd former Florida Gov.\nHe will join CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Thursday, January 7th for an exclusive one-hour live town hall on gun control at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, in hopes of mounting a final pitch to the public.\nBut gun control advocates are expecting the new actions to be revealed next week, ahead of Obama\u2019s annual State of the Union address, set for January 12.\nObama has repeatedly expressed his frustration with Congress\u2019 inability to pass new gun laws, and has frequently spoken out about increased gun control in the wake of mass shootings."}
