Heart disease, the country\u2019s leading killer, worried only 2 percent of respondents, less of a fear than statistically less lethal cancer (10 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut concern about \u201cgovernment interference\u201d in health issues grew the fastest, rising from 2 percent in 2012 to 9 percent now. That\u2019s a similar sentiment relative to November 2010, when President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform first passed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans forgot about flu and bioterrorism, considerable concerns in past years, but remembered mental illness, possibly thanks to mass shootings and media coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll comes at a troubled time for Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. The healthcare.gov website has infamously seen technical glitches, and thousands of Americans may lose insurance coverage, despite Obama\u2019s past promises that people could mostly keep their coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Gallup poll last week, Americans expressed disapproval of the Affordable Care Act, with 55 percent disapproving of the law versus 40 percent approval. That\u2019s a change from November 2012, the last time more Americans approved than disapproved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the ACA\u2019s rollout is still in progress, \u201cit is hard to assess how the legislation is changing Americans' perceptions on these core points,\u201d according to Gallup. \u201cIt appears the verdict thus far is mixed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a conference of CEOs earlier this week, Obama said extreme U.S. health care costs are a major fuel for public debts and deficits. But he added that health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth care accounted for 18 percent of the U.S. economy in 2010, according to a Kaiser Foundation report from last year. The U.S. spends about 90 percent more on health care than other industrialized countries, including OECD countries.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "health care, healthcare, health care reform, healthcare reform, obamacare, health care gallup, healthcare gallup, gallup polls, obamacare polls, aca", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The proportion of Americans concerned about health care costs beat the slice worried about health care access for the first time since 2007.", "title": "US Healthcare: Gallup Poll Finds Costs, Access & Obesity Are Top Concerns", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/us-healthcare-gallup-poll-finds-costs-access-obesity-are-top-concerns-1481138", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/08/13/hospital-surgery-nj-2007.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The proportion of Americans concerned about health care costs beat the slice worried about health care access for the first time since 2007.", "title": "US Healthcare: Gallup Poll Finds Costs, Access & Obesity Are Top Concerns", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/us-healthcare-gallup-poll-finds-costs-access-obesity-are-top-concerns-1481138", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/08/13/hospital-surgery-nj-2007.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2013/08/13/hospital-surgery-nj-2007.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2013-11-21T15:07:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T00:31:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The proportion of Americans concerned about health care costs beat the slice worried about health care access for the first time since 2007."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s the first time since 2007 that health cost concerns overtook fears about limited access to health care.\nThat\u2019s a similar sentiment relative to November 2010, when President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform first passed.\nAlmost a quarter of Americans say cost is the top health problem facing the nation today, after limited access to health care and obesity, according to a Gallup poll released Thursday.\nBut he added that health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.\n23 percent of those polled thought cost was the country\u2019s most urgent health problem, compared to 16 percent who said access."}
