The answer to the title question is Fox News’ Fox & Friends Co-Host Brian Kilmeade’s new book, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed America. In Kilmeade’s new pop-history book, he takes the reader on a narrative journey of America’s first war, and some could argue the beginning of the War on Terror.

Taking a page from Bill O’Reilly’s Killing series, Kilmeade has successfully tapped into the pop-history genre in this follow up to his bestseller from last year, George Washington’s Secret Six: The Spy Ring That Saved the American Revolution. The result is a page-turner about the true story of how America fought off the Barbary Pirates, showing the world that America had muscles it could flex militarily.

In our interview below with Brian Kilmeade, in his actual “Kilmeade & Friends” radio studio in NYC, he tells us about how he came up with the idea to write the book, his writing process, why the story of the Barbary Pirates is not taught more in schools, one of his favorite moments on Fox & Friends, and what he does for fun. Check out the amazing one-on-one interview with Brian Kilmeade!
