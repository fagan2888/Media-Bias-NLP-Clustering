Brookings, SD

A Brookings resident is now the proud owner of a patent for a new kind of sailboat that can be disassembled for easy transportation.



Patent records show Al Heuton has invented a "portable wind-powered sailing vessel." The boat is 10 foot wide and 18 foot long, has no bolts and only three pins that hold up the mast stays. Its parts slip together and can be brought apart for transportation or storage purposes.



Heuton tells The Brookings Register he spent considerable time working around the sailboat's connections in an effort to make it as simple to assemble as possible. He says he wants to be able to put it together in less than 10 minutes by himself.



Fully assembled, the sailboat weighs 138 pounds and has a 20-foot mast.
