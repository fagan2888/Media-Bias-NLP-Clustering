For every $100 spent at a non-locally owned business, $43 remains in the local economy, and $57 leaves.\n\nCarlos Valencia has worked at Rustic Candle Co. on Fourth Avenue for five years. His second cousin is the owner of the shop, and without the support of the local community, a small business just cannot succeed, Valencia said.\n\n\"More of your dollar goes towards the community,\" said Valencia. \"A lot of the money we do it, we do put back in the community.\"\n\nThe shop is constantly finding ways to give back to Tucson, he said. In October, the shop made a series of unique, handmade skull candles and sold them at the All Souls Procession, and all the proceeds went straight to that organization.\n\n\"The community knows they make a better impact for them and their own families too,\" said Valencia.\n\nWith the addition of the Sun Link street car, Fourth Avenue has begun to see more clientele, but Valencia said they still need more support, especially around the holidays.\n\n\"It hasn't improved quite like we wanted to,\" said Valencia. \"But we're definitely hoping that in the future people do keep local businesses in mind when they're shopping.\"\n\nThe 'Buy Local Month' campaign runs through Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\nFor Local First Arizona's directory of locally owned businesses, click here.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
