Thankfully, no one was hurt, but people there worry it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone is.\n\nThe staff at Gateway said they\u2019re tired of people driving recklessly and hitting their building.\n\n\"When they come off there, sometimes they're coming pretty fast and sometimes it's raining and they seem to make that turn and they slide into the building,\" Vice President of Facility Operations Raphael Thomas said.\n\nThe most recent point of impact was in someone's office.\n\nA woman would have been hit if she hadn't gotten up moments before, they said.\n\n\"She could have been killed and anyone in the building that they are not sectioned that are coming through. We have clients in there. They can be injured and killed very easy with a car coming through, especially when you have trucks, big trucks coming through, they can slide right through that wall,\" said Thomas.\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation put up signs indicating a tight turn and changed the lines on the road to better direct traffic, but the Gateway staff want more done.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to happen again, you know. It's already happened three times. It's going to happen again, so we need something in there, a barrier or guardrail to protect the, not the building, but the clients in the building,\" said Thomas.\n\nGateway is repairing the most recent damaged office, and .some of those repair costs are coming out of pocket.\n\nThey have been working to get Public Works to put up a guardrail. If the city doesn't, then Gateway will do what they can to try to keep its staff and clients safe.\n\nCopyright 2015 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/25/Gateway%20Bldg%20Hit_1448481950421_645315_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Ashley Mitchem", "description": "Cars coming off Interstate 10 and Stockton Street have crashed into the Gateway Rehab facility on Stockton Street three different times in a matter of 18 months.", "author": "Ashley Mitchem", "og": {"site_name": "WJXT", "description": "Cars coming off Interstate 10 and Stockton Street have crashed into the Gateway Rehab facility on Stockton Street three different times in a matter of 18 months.", "title": "Local rehab center hit 3 times by cars wants city to help", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/news/a-local-rehabilitation-center-hit-3-times-by-cars-wants-the-city-to-help", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/25/Gateway%20Bldg%20Hit_1448481950421_645315_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cars coming off Interstate 10 and Stockton Street have crashed into the Gateway Rehab facility on Stockton Street three different times in a matter of 18 months.", "title": "A local rehabilitation center hit 3 times by cars, wants the city to help", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/news/a-local-rehabilitation-center-hit-3-times-by-cars-wants-the-city-to-help", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/25/Gateway%20Bldg%20Hit_1448481950421_645315_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@wjxt4", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-25T20:57:41+0000", "sailthru.title": "A local rehabilitation center hit 3 times by cars, wants the city to help", "sailthru.tags": "News,Top Stories", "fb": {"app_id": 196517170397638}, "keywords": "News,Top Stories", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-11-25T20:57:41+0000", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T20:57:41+0000", "author": "http://www.news4jax.com/author/ashley.mitchem"}, "news_keywords": "News Story Template - DO NOT PUBLSH", "content_id": 136897200, "sailthru.description": "Cars coming off Interstate 10 and Stockton Street have crashed into the Gateway Rehab facility on Stockton Street three different times in a matter of 18 months.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/25/Gateway%20Bldg%20Hit_1448481950421_645315_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "They can be injured and killed very easy with a car coming through, especially when you have trucks, big trucks coming through, they can slide right through that wall,\" said Thomas.\nIf the city doesn't, then Gateway will do what they can to try to keep its staff and clients safe.\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Cars coming off Interstate 10 and Stockton Street have crashed into the Gateway Rehab facility on Stockton Street three different times in a matter of 18 months.\nThe staff at Gateway said they\u2019re tired of people driving recklessly and hitting their building.\nThe Florida Department of Transportation put up signs indicating a tight turn and changed the lines on the road to better direct traffic, but the Gateway staff want more done."}
