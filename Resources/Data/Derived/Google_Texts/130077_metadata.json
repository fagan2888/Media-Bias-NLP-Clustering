The county posted a request for bids on Tuesday.\n\nCentene officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe contract for processing claims is large. The Tribune previously reported that the deal with IlliniCare, which began in July 2014, was worth up to $1.8 billion over five years.\n\nThe role also is critical for Cook County because the health system has taken on the risk of insuring more of its patients. The health system started its own managed care plan in 2012 to enroll patients who gained insurance through the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe health plan, known as CountyCare, provides coverage for more than 170,000 Cook County residents, including traditional Medicare beneficiaries. And for the first time in its history, the health system has to compete for patients.\n\nOne of its competitors is IlliniCare, which runs a managed care plan for Medicaid recipients in Cook, DuPage, Lake, Kane, Kankakee and Will counties.\n\nThe competition became a conflict for the county. The health system \"believes that CountyCare would be best served by a TPA (third-party administrator) that does not operate a competing plan moving forward,\" spokeswoman Alexandra Normington said in a statement.\n\nThe timing of such a big change could be disruptive, as the health system finds itself on solid financial footing for the first time in decades. The public system has long been the safety net for the low-income, uninsured population in Cook County, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in uncompensated care every year and becoming a drain for taxpayers.\n\nIn the last fiscal year ended Nov. 30, uncompensated care fell to $340 million, from more than $500 million the year before. Nearly two-thirds of county patients were insured last year, up from 45 percent before Obamacare.\n\nTo keep the momentum going, the health system has to keep a close eye on costs, and that's where a third-party administrator comes in, providing data analysis and risk management services.\n\nCook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin, D-Evanston, said he was not bothered by the abrupt cancellation of IlliniCare's contract.\n\n\"In the long run this is probably good for our system because it will give us a little more control in what is a constantly changing market situation,\" Suffredin said. \"I don't think we're going to lose ground.\"\n\nasachdev@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @ameetsachdev", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Cook County health system to replace claims administrator", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Cook County's public health system is looking for a new company to process insurance claims after it canceled a contract with the firm it hired just a year ago.", "title": "Cook County health system to replace claims administrator", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-centene-cook-county-health-0807-biz-20150806-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55c3d172/turbine/ct-centene-cook-county-health-0807-biz-20150806", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Cook County Health and Hospitals System, IlliniCare, Centene, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Medicaid", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84158302", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-06", "Description": "Cook County's public health system is looking for a new company to process insurance claims after it canceled a contract with IlliniCare Health, which was hired just a year ago.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Cook County Health and Hospitals System, IlliniCare, Centene, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Medicaid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe185f\"", "article_summary": "A spokeswoman at Cook County Health and Hospitals System confirmed Thursday that it plans to replace IlliniCare Health, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Centene, as its third-party administrator.\nThe health plan, known as CountyCare, provides coverage for more than 170,000 Cook County residents, including traditional Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe role also is critical for Cook County because the health system has taken on the risk of insuring more of its patients.\nCook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin, D-Evanston, said he was not bothered by the abrupt cancellation of IlliniCare's contract.\nCook County's public health system is looking for a new company to process insurance claims after it canceled a contract with the firm it hired just a year ago."}
