Mary Landrieu (D-LA), listens to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar testify during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on May 18, 2010 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n3861968\n\nRepublican Sen. David Vitter is slamming his fellow lawmakers for \u201clying\u201d and telling their constituents that there is no such thing as an Obamacare exemption for members of Congress and their staff members.\n\n\u201cSome are lying, trying to mislead the public about the Obamacare exemption for Congress,\u201d Republican Sen. David Vitter said in a statement Thursday. \u201cPresident Obama recently issued a special rule for Congress and congressional staff to get a special subsidy to purchase health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange unavailable to every other American at similar income levels. That\u2019s an exemption, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nVitter has been leading the Republican fight in the Senate with an amendment that kills federal Obamacare subsidies for lawmakers and their staff. It would require that all members of Congress, the president, vice president, and Obama administration appointees to purchase health insurance on the Obamacare exchange without taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\nTo show that lawmakers are \u201cdenying\u201d the existence of the exemption, Vitter\u2019s office on Thursday released to the media a letter that fellow Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, sent to a constituent. She said the notion they are getting special treatment \u201ccould not be further from the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, let me assure you that there is no exemption for Members of Congress and their staff in the [Affordable Care Act], nor will I ever support an \u2018exemption\u2019 for myself of my staff,\u201d Landrieu wrote.\n\nVitter\u2019s office provided a copy of the letter he sent to the same constituent: \u201cSenator Landrieu is trying to mislead you, to put it kindly. Others might say she is lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you have no doubt read, President Obama recently issued a special rule for Congress only. Under it, Congress and congressional staff get a special subsidy to purchase health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange unavailable to every other American at similar income levels,\u201d he said. \u201cThat special subsidy is worth approximately $11,000 per family.\u201d\n\nVitter\u2019s office also released a graphic that he says proves his point:\n\nThe Obamacare fix for lawmakers and staff was made because the Affordable Care Act includes an amendment from a Republican senator that changes how the government currently covers most of the cost of health-care premiums for members\ufffc and their staffers. The new law mandates that members and staff must enter into exchanges or be covered by insurance \u201ccreated\u201d by law.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management announced in August that it plans to provide a subsidy of about 75 percent of the cost\ufffc for the healthcare of members and staff.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'Trying to mislead the public'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Republican Sen.
