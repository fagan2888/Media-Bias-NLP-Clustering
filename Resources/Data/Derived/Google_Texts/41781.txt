The Senate Special Committee on Aging scheduled a meeting to begin contempt proceedings against Michael Pearson, the outgoing CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a company under investigation by the committee.

Pearson, who is remaining in his position until the company names his successor, did not comply with a subpoena to attend a deposition Monday related to the committee’s investigation into drug prices, said Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), the respective chairwoman and ranking member of the committee.

“His actions and those of Valeant are central to the investigation pursued by this Committee,” they said in a joint statement. “Therefore, it is our intent to initiate contempt proceedings against Mr. Pearson.”

The committee launched an investigation into prescription drug prices last year. Last month it held a hearing focused on Turing Pharmaceuticals, and subpoenaed a former official and current employees, including Interim CEO Ron Tilles, to testify about the company’s business practices.

Pearson was subpoenaed to appear before the committee for a hearing on April 27.

Valeant released a statement Monday saying the company had asked Pearson to comply with the subpoena.

“The Board has requested Mr. Pearson’s cooperation in connection with a subpoena for deposition from the Senate Committee on Aging prior to the Committee’s scheduled April 27 hearing,” the statement said. “The Board understands that Mr. Pearson is in dialogue with the Senate Committee on Aging regarding his deposition and that those discussions are ongoing.”
