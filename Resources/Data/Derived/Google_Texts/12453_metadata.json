And it quickly became apparent that not everyone at Starbucks was super excited to talk about it.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 Senior Vice President of Communications, Corey DuBrowa, bore the brunt of the mockery. From Mediaite\u2019s roundup of some highlights:\n\n@nashwakay @coreydu How do you think this is a good idea? How could a barista be expected to deal with the complexity of race relations\u2026 \u2014 Bartosz Scheller (@BartoszScheller) March 17, 2015\n\n@coreydu why do you think i want to hear what a white barista with matted dreads thinks about race \u2014 hugh honey (@fkabiggs) March 17, 2015\n\nDuBrowa apparently could not take the heat. First he started blocking people who tweeted to him:\n\nthat was quick @coreydu pic.twitter.com/aXqWwCtHI8 \u2014 hugh honey (@fkabiggs) March 17, 2015\n\nAnd at midnight he deleted his account. A swimming start for a national \u201cconversation\u201d about race!\n\nBy now the account is back up again, and DuBrowa has authored a post at Medium explaining why he pulled it:\n\n\u2026 last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity. I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted. Most of all, I was concerned about becoming a distraction from the respectful conversation around Race Together that we have been trying to create. To be clear, Race Together isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about we: and having heard first-hand the number of stories our partners (at Starbucks we call our employees \u201cpartners\u201d) shared with us in the open forums of the past few months, I have thought long and hard about the passion, concerns and painful experiences our people across the country have endured, and wanting to make sure they felt supported by their company.\n\nAs for why he\u2019s back, DuBrowa says he\u2019s \u201creaffirming my belief in the power of meaningful, civil, thoughtful, respectful open conversation \u2014 on Twitter and everywhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only one guy, and I do actually sleep occasionally (and definitely needed to last night), but I personally will answer the challenge to participate where it\u2019s uncomfortable, and to do so with integrity, openness, and empathy,\u201d he says. Does \u201copenness\u201d to \u201cuncomfortable\u201d conversations mean no more blocking accounts?
