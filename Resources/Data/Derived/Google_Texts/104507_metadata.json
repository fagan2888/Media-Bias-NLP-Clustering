Marco Rubio. Not only that, but a recent CNN poll of GOP voters nationally put him at 49 percent support, an eye-popping 33 percentage points ahead of Rubio, his closest challenger.\n\nIt was a fact Trump flaunted to the more than 7,500 supporters in attendance here at Valdosta State University.\n\n\u201cEvery single online poll, every single event I\u2019ve been No. 1,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New Yorker drew an enthusiastic and at times rowdy crowd to the university\u2019s basketball stadium. He was met with deafening cheers from the audience, which held up signs saying \u201cbuild that wall\u201d and \u201cthe silent majority stands with Trump.\u201d It cheered so loudly when Trump said he would scrap Obamacare and Common Core that the bleachers shook.\n\nAt least another 12,000 supporters were outside, he said, unable to get into the event.\n\nTrump asked for the crowd\u2019s support Tuesday and promised a strong showing.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win at every single level. We are going to win with health, with education, at the borders, with our military. We\u2019re going to win, win, win, win,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump otherwise delivered his stump speech, touching on immigration, free trade, his business record, guns and the Pope.\n\nHe drew fans from central and southern Georgia, as well as some Floridians and curious VSU students.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cpowerful\u201d persona is what\u2019s been driving such large levels of support, said Lorra Baccili, 54-year old union laborer from Perry.\n\n\u201cHe is a powerful individual. His strength in his voice speaks for the country,\u201d she said.\n\nLori Tompkins from Turner County, who assists medical patients without insurance, said Georgians in particular are flocking to the billionaire because of his business savvy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s helping us stand up for our country again, to try and improve business. Georgia, especially this part of Georgia, is an extremely poor area and we would love to see manufacturing come back to this country, especially here in Georgia,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rally also drew its share of anti-Trump protestors, who were roped off across the street from the venue. The crowd inside the building booed a protestor Trump kicked out of the event. The Des Moines Register\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs also reported that upwards of two-dozen black VSU students were kicked out of the rally.\n\nBREAKING: About 30 Valdosta students kicked out of Trump rally.
