LANSING, Mich. (WOOD) -- While Michigan doctors will soon have to release breast density information to women, how patients pay for follow-up tests -- should they decide to get further screening -- is still up in the air.

A recommended yearly mammogram may not always detect cancer in women who have dense breast tissue. Women who learn their breast tissue is dense may want further testing to ensure they don't have cancer.

But that extra testing can be expensive. The question often becomes this: 'How much is peace of mind worth to you?'

Laurie Lucas said she never had a choice. She got her first annual mammogram when she turned 40 and never missed one.

But what several mammograms missed could now kill her.

Lucas didn't know she had dense breasts and the fibrous tissues makes it harder for a mammogram to spot cancer.

"If I had known that, I would have pushed for an ultrasound then. But nobody ever told me that," Lucas said.

Lucas had an abnormal mammogram in 2013. Her doctor ordered another mammogram and an ultrasound. After the second mammogram was considered 'normal,' her doctor canceled the ultrasound.

"You trust what your doctor tells you," Lucas said. "If a doctor comes out and says, 'We don't need to do further testing. You're fine,' you believe that."

Now, less than two years after her doctor cleared that second mammogram and canceled the follow-up ultrasound, Lucas has stage four breast cancer, which has metastasized -- it's spreading.
