Jim Bob Duggar tells TheBlaze he expects Obamacare to harm American health care – primarily advancements in medicine.

“Obamacare will cost $3 trillion and it really will not insure that many people than what we have right now,” the co-star of TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting” told TheBlaze Friday. “It will add all kinds of regulations on business, it will fine people.”

Duggar was in Washington, D.C. for this weekend’s conservative Values Voter Summit. One of his sons, Josh Duggar, is executive director of FRC Action, the political arm of the Family Research Council, which sponsored the summit.

“Obamacare is going to diminish the wonderful health care system that we have because anytime the government gets involved it becomes more expensive,” Jim Bob Duggar said.

“You think about quality. You think about in Canada anyone who wants to have surgery, he has to be on a waiting list for like three months, where in America, if you feel like you need to have something done, you can have it done immediately. When you have the best health care system, it’s going to be hard for the government to improve it. Free enterprise, private health care, is really what enhances technology and research and development, and I really think it’s going to put a damper on the health of America.”

Duggar said the annual Values Voter Summit is crucial for reminding the country of what’s always been important to Americans.

“I think people have drifted away from living the values that they were taught as a child and I think that today the world’s media and culture is pushing to the left,” Duggar said. “I think it’s so important that people are seeing trends that are self destructing and…really looking for answers to their lives. And if we really believe the Bible is the owner’s manual for our lives, it really has all the answers to life’s questions, so we should encourage people to go back to that firm foundation of God’s word.”
