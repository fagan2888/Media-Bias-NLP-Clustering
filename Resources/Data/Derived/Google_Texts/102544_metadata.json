John Thune (R-SD) probably wishes that he\u2019d thought twice before debuting a new attack on the Affordable Care Act on Twitter.\n\nThis month, the Supreme Court is expected to decide King v. Burwell, a case which asks the justices to read one sentence of the law out-of-context in order to render millions of people\u2019s health insurance unaffordable. The lawsuit is funded by a conservative organization, promoted by conservative think tanks and conservative law professors, and backed by many top Republicans including several of Thune\u2019s Republican colleagues. Though only a minority of lower court judges have sided with the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, all of them are Republicans. Only Republican-appointed justices are expected to vote for the plaintiffs when the decision is handed down, though it is far from clear that all of the Court\u2019s Republican appointees will do so. The lead attorney for the plaintiffs boasted that he does not plan to \u201close any Republican-appointed judges\u2019 votes\u201d when his argument was being considered by a lower court.\n\nNevertheless, Thune offered this assessment of who would be to blame if the Republican-controlled Supreme Court sides with the plaintiffs in King:\n\n\n\nSix million people risk losing their health care subsidies, yet @POTUS continues to deny that Obamacare is bad for the American people. \u2014 Senator John Thune (@SenJohnThune) June 8, 2015\n\nAlmost immediately, Thune became an object of ridicule for this tweet. Huffington Post\u2019s Sam Stein quoted the tweet and responded \u201cthis makes no sense.\u201d The Week\u2019s Ryan Cooper mocked it with an historic quote \u2014 \u201cStand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!\u201d The New York Daily News\u2019s Josh Greenman wrote just one word: \u201cUm.\u201d The National Review\u2019s Charles C.W. Cooke described Thune\u2019s tweet in twice as many words: \u201cSo dishonest.\u201d\n\nMy own contribution to this genre quoted the tweet with the preface \u201cIn which a United States Senator reminds you that he thinks you are stupid.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s David Weigel quipped that \u201cCongress should pass a simple, one-page bill allowing @SenJohnThune to amend that tweet.\u201d\n\nShould the King plaintiffs prevail, it should be noted, the consequences will go far beyond the mockery Thune experienced. An estimated 9,800 Americans will die every year who otherwise would have lived if the Republican-appointed justices do what so many of Thune\u2019s fellow Republicans have asked them to do.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Sen.
