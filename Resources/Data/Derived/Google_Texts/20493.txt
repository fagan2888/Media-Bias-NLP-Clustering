Ted Cruz explained his decision to attend a fundraiser for his presidential run instead of voting against Loretta Lynch’s confirmation as Attorney General by saying that that his vote wouldn’t have mattered anyway — and besides, he had participated in the more important, parliamentary vote to stop her nomination earlier.

Cruz told Caffeinated Thoughts’ Shane Vander Hart that he had “led the opposition to Loretta Lynch from day one,” voting against her in the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling on GOP leaders to stop her confirmation, writing columns about her being unqualified for the position, and voting against her on cloture last week.

“Cloture was the vote that mattered,” he said, “it was the 60-vote threshold where if Republicans stood together, she would not have been confirmed.” When reporters later informed him that Senate Democrats had lowered the threshold to a simple majority in 2013, Cruz responded, “fair point,” but insisted that “under the Senate rules, absence is the equivalent of a ‘no’ vote.”

His fellow Republican Senator from Texas, Ted Cornyn — who voted in favor of cloture but against her confirmation — disputed Cruz’s logic. “The only vote to confirm somebody is actually the vote on the nomination, not cloture,” he told Politico’s Burgess Everett.
