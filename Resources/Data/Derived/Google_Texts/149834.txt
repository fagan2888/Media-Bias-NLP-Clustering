Midcap core mutual funds, which invest in both growth and value stocks, have outperformed the other midcap styles in the past 10 years. A $10,000 investment in the average midcap core mutual fund made on June 30, 2005, would have grown to $26,231 by July 10 this year, according to Morningstar Inc. The same investment would have grown to $25,736 in the average midcap growth fund, $22,632 in the midcap value version and $21,530 in the S&P 500.

But midcap growth mutual funds have been closing the gap this year, climbing 6.7% vs. 3.3% for core funds, 0.6% for value funds and 1.9% for the S&P 500.

Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund has risen an average annual 11.06% the past 10 years vs. 7.78% for the S&P 500, which is a proxy for the broad stock market. This year the $668 million fund is up 12%, while the S&P 500 is up 2%.

Recent holdings of the fund, which has been managed by Neil Hennessy since 2003 and Brian Peery since 2011, include JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Centene (CNC) and Skechers (SKX), Sealed Air (SEE) and Mohawk Industries (MHK).

Goldman Sachs Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund , managed by Steven Barry since 2005 and Daniel Zimmerman since 2014, has risen an average annual 11.66% the past 10 years and has handed investors a 9% gain this year. The $2.9 billion fund’s recent holdings include Ulta Beauty (ULTA).

The beauty supplies chain’s earnings have risen at a 25% annual pace the past three years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 19% in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31 and 19% next year.
