The Veterans Day Parade lined a downtown Wichita street with hundreds of people who were honoring military veterans.

Before the parade began, Black Hawk helicopters landed in a field near the parade route for spectators to see.

"This is just a great day to come out and give honor and thanks to our veterans that fight for our freedoms," said one spectator.

Veterans day has been on November 11 since 1919, although it was called by a different name until the mid-50's.
