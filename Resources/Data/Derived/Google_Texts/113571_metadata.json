But there\u2019s been a recent wave of trademark applications inspired by the health-care plan nicknamed after him\u2014everything from a television talk show to undergarments.\n\nIn recent months, half a dozen trademark applications with the word \u201cObamacare\u201d were filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Some were registered by insurers or human resources professionals for educational purposes, while others target Americans fervently opposed to the law. The \u201cObamacare Calculator,\u201d a tool that appears designed to help people navigate the plan\u2019s complex options, was filed in August by Trendsetter, a Rockwall, Tex.-based human resources firm. Meanwhile, \u201cObamacare. Run For Your Life,\u201d a proposal for sports clothing and events, has already been abandoned. But lawyers expect more. \u201cTrademark filings always mirror pop culture,\u201d says Lara Pearson, a trademark attorney in Incline Village, Nev.\n\nOne of the most provocative applications was filed in July for \u201cDestroy Obamacare\u201d T-shirts. The slogan is surrounded by a stethoscope attached to a stick of dynamite. The shirts are already being sold by Damon Kirin, an attorney in New Orleans, for $20 each \u2014 $2 of which will be donated to St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital in Memphis until the government shutdown ends. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a particular desire to have Obamacare destroyed or saved,\u201d he says. In fact, Kirin promises that a \u201cSave Obamacare\u201d shirt is also in the works. \u201cI like helping people express their view,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much rhetoric about it. Look what\u2019s just happened: The federal government has shut down because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave Obamacare\u201d shirts are being sold by Damon Kirin, an attorney in New Orleans.\n\nSome filers say they hope the trademarks will help Americans sign up for insurance. Fiorella\u2019s \u201cObamacare Enrollment Team,\u201d a marketing banner for agents to help consumers, is already up and running. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming lack of understanding on health-care reform as a whole,\u201d says Cory Lloyd, vice-president of operations at Fiorella. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize they will have to carry health insurance and that there are subsidies out there for them.\u201d Only one-quarter of Americans understand Obamacare \u201cvery well,\u201d according to a Pew Research Center poll last month. A trademark application for \u201cHow Obamacare Works,\u201d a proposed TV talk show broadcast, was filed by a lawyer in Zionsvile, Indiana.\n\nAnother more serious filing registered with the Patent and Trademark Office is an interactive learning tool: \u201cAffordable Care Act University.\u201d The tool was launched in March for the 32,000-strong members of the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, a non-profit educational association in Brookfield, Wis. \u201cWe decided that it was such an important issue for our membership base that we would provide them a 24/7 resource for Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Michael Wilson, CEO of the International Foundation. The virtual \u201cuniversity\u201d has webcasts, white papers, surveys and question-and-answer sections about how Obamacare impacts the health care plans of its members.\n\nUnder trademark law, however, most of these applications might not hold up, legal experts say. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act University could work, but the only way you can register trademarks like \u201cObamacare\u201d that consist of a living individual\u2019s name is to get their express consent,\u201d says Michael De Biase, intellectual property lawyer in Fort Lauderdale. As the latter references the president, he says, that might prove difficult. Pearson agrees. The Affordable Care Act University could be allowed though with a disclaimer stating that, because those words are so common, others should be able to use them as part of their trademarks too.\n\nThere have been some recent precedents blocking Obama-related trademarks. In 2010, the Trade Trial and Appeal Board refused to register a collection of nightwear and briefs under the names \u201cObama Bahama Pajamas,\u201d \u201cObama Pajama\u201d and \u201cBarack\u2019s Jocks.\u201d The triple-threat trademarks were filed by Richard Hoefflin, a Westlake Village, Calif. litigation attorney. (Hoefflin was unavailable for comment.) \u201cI am surprised by the number of attorneys who file applications for Obama marks when the rules clearly state that this is not allowed,\u201d Pearson says. But this in itself doesn\u2019t prevent the production of Obama Pajamas. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use the term,\u201d De Biase says. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have exclusive rights to it.\u201d\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "There\u2019s been a recent wave of trademark applications inspired by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s nickname\u2014everything from a television talk show to undergarments.", "creator": "@Quantanamo", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM534_pfobam_MG_20131004132823.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Quentin Fottrell", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "There\u2019s been a recent wave of trademark applications inspired by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s nickname\u2014everything from a television talk show to undergarments.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/race-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-trademarks-2013-10-07", "author": "Quentin Fottrell", "parsely-title": "Backers and opponents both trademark \u2018Obamacare\u2019", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-07T08:31:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "There\u2019s been a recent wave of trademark applications inspired by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s nickname\u2014everything from a television talk show to undergarments.", "title": "Backers and opponents both trademark \u2018Obamacare\u2019", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/race-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-trademarks-2013-10-07", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM534_pfobam_MG_20131004132823.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM534_pfobam_MG_20131004132823.jpg"}, "article.id": "E8BA2ED2-2D1C-11E3-BFAB-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e8a\"", "article_summary": "In recent months, half a dozen trademark applications with the word \u201cObamacare\u201d were filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\u201cTrademark filings always mirror pop culture,\u201d says Lara Pearson, a trademark attorney in Incline Village, Nev.One of the most provocative applications was filed in July for \u201cDestroy Obamacare\u201d T-shirts.\nBut there\u2019s been a recent wave of trademark applications inspired by the health-care plan nicknamed after him\u2014everything from a television talk show to undergarments.\nA trademark application for \u201cHow Obamacare Works,\u201d a proposed TV talk show broadcast, was filed by a lawyer in Zionsvile, Indiana.\nThe virtual \u201cuniversity\u201d has webcasts, white papers, surveys and question-and-answer sections about how Obamacare impacts the health care plans of its members."}
