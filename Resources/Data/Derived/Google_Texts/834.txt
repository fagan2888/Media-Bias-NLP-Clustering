Washington state officials announced Thursday they will offer a 60-day special enrollment period on its Obamacare exchange for same-sex domestic partners whose unions were converted to marriages at the end of last month.

Because the batch of conversions emanating from a 2012 same-sex marriage law are considered qualifying life events, the state said its enrollment session through Aug. 28 is justified.

“It’s important that same-sex couples whose domestic partnerships have been recently converted are aware of this special opportunity to access health insurance coverage through Washington Healthplanfinder,” said Richard Onizuka, CEO for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. “With the next open enrollment period more than four months away, this is a great chance for couples to explore their options and see if they qualify for financial help to pay for a Qualified Health Plan.”

After completing a form on the Washington HealthPlanfinder website, applicants will have to supply documents that prove their partnership has been converted to marriage.

Officials noted that all newly wedded couples can enroll outside of the standard sign-up window if they apply within 60 days of their marriage.

“The summer months are traditionally the most popular time of year for Washingtonians to get married,” Mr. Onizuka said. “Any newlywed same-sex or heterosexual couple can take advantage of the opportunity to find free or low-cost coverage outside of the standard open enrollment period.”
