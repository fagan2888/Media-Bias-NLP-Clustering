It\u2019s no longer a neighborhood health care place,\u201d said Chris Shea, the chief executive officer. \u201cWe still want to maintain that neighborhood connection, but emphasize that we have a full array of services that people can benefit from.\u201d\n\nCherry Health is the largest federally qualified health center in Michigan, serving uninsured and underinsured individuals who have a hard time find medical care. It has seen steady growth over the past two decades, opening a new site every two years, on average. It now operates in 23 locations with a $60 million budget.\n\nIts sites include the Heart of the City Health Center that opened in 2011 at 100 Cherry St. SE.\n\nIts most recent addition is the Barry Community Health Center in Hastings, which opened in 2013.\n\nThe growth is driven by Cherry Street\u2019s mission, Shea said.\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while, I meet people who are in desperate need of health care and can\u2019t get it from any source,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on the outside.\u201d\n\nThe center\u2019s goal is to serve not only the patients who come to the center, but those who can\u2019t come there \u2013 through clinics that reach other parts of the community.\n\nThe agency provides primary health care, dental and vision care, pharmacy services, and counseling and behavioral health care. It also operates four school-based health centers in Grand Rapids.\n\nIt has applied for funds to open a clinic at the Cedar Springs Public Schools campus, Shea said. It is contemplating a new clinic in Charlotte in Eaton County. And it is doing research in six West Michigan counties to see if there is need for new clinics to serve low-income, underserved residents.\n\nCherry Street serves as the lead navigator for the region for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace. Staff members helped more than 20,000 people with information or direct assistance with online enrollment in the past year, and they are planning to provide help again when the second year of enrollment begins Nov. 15.\n\nStaff has also helped residents enroll in Healthy Michigan, the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program.\n\nThe effect of the Affordable Care Act is evident in the patients who seek care at Cherry Health\u2019s Clinics, Shea said.\n\nMany of the new enrollees in Medicaid and Healthy Michigan are seeking care through Cherry Health. And the center is seeing far fewer uninsured patients. About 15 percent more patients have Medicaid coverage than in the past.\n\n\u201cI think the bias of many people is that people who have Medicaid overuse services. It\u2019s simply not true. I think they tend to be very sparing about services they use.\n\n\u201cHowever, people who are newly enfranchised with Healthy Michigan and who were uninsured before are very much seeing that they can now afford to use the services they need too.\u201d\n\nThe biggest numbers of increase are in dental and medical services. But on a percentage basis, vision care has also increased significantly, Shea said.\n\nGoing forward, Shea said Cherry Street will provide more comprehensive care to more patients. In the past, patients often would come for a single service. Now, the clinics are concentrating on providing the full range of medical services to patients.\n\n\u201cWe want this to be their health care home,\u201d Shea said.\n\nCherry Street has benefited from grants made under the Affordable Care Act for federally qualified health centers, but funding remains a concern, Shea said. The bulk of the agency\u2019s funds come from Medicaid reimbursements for care.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s difficult about the business model in a community health center is if it was so profitable to provide the kinds of services that we have, someone would have done it a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cEach time we serve more people, we have to find some new way of coming up with resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nWorkforce development also is a challenge, Shea said. In the past, the center could rely on those willing to take a salary cut to serve the mission of providing care to those in need.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of used up that 10 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be more competitive in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe name change represents a milestone in the 26-year history of the organization, Shea said.\n\n\u201cIt emphasizes the fact that we are a system of care and that for our patients we can do more than just one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to emphasize health instead of sickness.\u201d\n\n\n\nSue Thoms covers health care for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
