Though they've butted heads on everything from the Iraq War to Obamacare to gas prices, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) got emotional when talking about his friendship with Vice President Joe Biden.

In an interview with The Huffington Post published Friday, the South Carolina senator visibly choked up when talking about his relationship with Biden and the death of Biden's son Beau in June.

"He's the nicest person I think I've ever met in my whole life," Graham said.

"We don't agree on much, but I think he's been dealt a really gut blow," Graham said, referring to Beau's death.

Graham also expressed gratitude for Biden's speech at Graham's retirement party from the Air Force Reserve.

Biden and Graham's relationship has been well documented. In 2013, Biden told Graham that he would do whatever it took to get Graham reelected, despite the fact that they were from opposite parties.

Earlier this year, Biden teased Graham about his presidential bid, pretending not to swear in Graham during an official ceremony in the Senate.
