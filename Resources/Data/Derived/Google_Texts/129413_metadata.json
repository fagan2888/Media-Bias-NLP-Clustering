And when you learn at the same time that your country\u2019s new military ally may be the pariah state of North Korea, well, go ahead and insert your own cheap vodka joke here.\n\nThat\u2019s the position, sadly, that the Russian people find themselves in this week. As the country\u2019s economy continues to crumble, the Kremlin recently acted on a promise to cut taxes on the popular liquor, dropping the price as ordinary Russians watch the cost of virtually everything else soar.\n\nRelated: Putin Just Sent Nuclear Bombers Over the English Channel. Seriously.\n\nThe move came just a day after a senior Russian military official announced the Kremlin is planning to expand its contacts with other countries\u2019 militaries, something he said could include joint training exercises with the forces of North Korea.\n\nThe Russian people\u2019s purchasing power has been practically halved due to the declining value of the ruble and a regimen of international sanctions. Those sanctions were imposed because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula as well as its continued support of the armed revolt in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nWhile the move to lower the price of vodka could be seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s means of damping social unrest, the truth is likely more related to the country\u2019s finances. The plan to lower vodka prices has been in the works since late last year. It follows a failed attempt to improve public health by reducing alcohol consumption fueled partly by sharp increases on vodka taxes.\n\nHowever, the effect of the tax increase, according to Russian authorities, was an equally dramatic surge in the popularity of bootleg vodka, and a sharp decline in the government\u2019s tax revenue. According to the state-owned media outlet ITAR-TASS, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin estimated that the Russian government was losing somewhere between $450 million and $760 million in tax revenue because of the surge in illegal liquor sales.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Eroding Economy Risks Putin\u2019s Economic Union\n\nThat might not have mattered as much to Russian leaders a year ago, when the price of oil \u2013 Russia\u2019s primary export \u2013 was over $100 a barrel. But with prices at between $45 and $55 per barrel these past several months, losing the revenue has had real fiscal impact.\n\nThe decision to pursue a military relationship with North Korea is harder to explain. The two countries share a relatively tiny border, and allying with a regime known for subjecting its people to what amounts to a perpetual famine while spending lavishly on its nuclear-armed military is hardly raising Russia\u2019s profile on the global stage.\n\nTaken together, the moves paint a picture of a Russian government struggling to find answers to an increasingly toxic combination of economic and political problems. A government facing a citizenry that has suffered massive losses of economic power at the same time that it is increasingly isolated on the international stage is not in a position of power. Neither cheap liquor nor alliances of convenience are likely to protect it for long.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The best news everyday Russians got this week is that vodka prices are falling.
