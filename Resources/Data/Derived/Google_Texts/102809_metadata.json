I eat a lot of onions,\u201d says the Tarrant resident. \u201cI pray a lot.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cWe\u2019re still in touch with my great-grandmother\u2019s American Indian [medicinal] recipes.\u201d\n\nElisa goes to such lengths because she remains uninsured despite the Affordable Care Act. She is one of an estimated 300,000 Alabamians who make too little to qualify for subsidies under so-called Obamacare but earn too much for Medicaid in Alabama. She also is one of a growing number of people and organizations who are pressing Gov. Robert Bentley to expand Medicaid.\n\nIn a nutshell, ACA was designed to provide Medicaid for people whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level and subsidies for insurance coverage for many whose income is higher. Federal money is available to states to cover the cost of expanding Medicaid, but a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states to not expand. Bentley has chosen not to expand the program.\n\nMedicaid expansion proponents cite statistics from two studies done by the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2012 and the University of Alabama this year. Both studies conclude that Alabama would see tremendous economic gains if Medicaid was expanded.\n\nThe UA study, which expounds on the UAB study, concludes that 308,000 people would be added to the Medicaid rolls. The study says more than 30,000 jobs would be created because of the need for new healthcare workers and the overall economic impact of the expansion. Those jobs would have earnings of $1.26 billion and create overall business activity of $3.5 billion.\n\nThe UA study concludes that the total cost to the state between 2014 and 2020 would be $772 million.\n\nA separate study by the Manuel H. Johnson Center for Political Economy at Troy University in 2013 had a different conclusion. That study states that \u201cthe cost of expanding Medicaid will outpace the benefits.\u201d\n\nOrganized support for Medicaid expansion appears to be growing. Save OurSelves: A Movement for Justice and Democracy, made up of about 40 faith-based groups, held a rally at the Alabama State Capitol May 31. According to published reports, organizers presented signatures of more than 10,000 Alabamians who do not qualify for Medicaid because it has not been expanded.\n\nA substitute teacher for the Tarrant City Schools, Elisa is frustrated by Bentley\u2019s decision not to provide coverage for her and others like her. \u201cGovernor Bentley, it\u2019s a Hippocratic oath, not a hypocrite\u2019s oath,\u201d she says, referring to the oath Bentley had to take as a physician.\n\nElisa, a divorced mother with two children still at home, would have to earn $19,600 a year to qualify for a subsidy. She makes about $1,200 a month during the school year but doesn\u2019t get paid during the summer, putting her far below the limit. Her children receive Medicaid because of different rules for children under 19.\n\nAt 42, Elisa would like to work on a teaching degree so she could become a teacher and qualify for benefits, but she says she has been unable to because she has to support her children.\n\nAdriane McIver, a Montgomery resident, understands Elisa\u2019s predicament. McIver, 56, had a career as an administrator at a water authority and a university before health problems led to her going on federal disability in October 2012. That meant her employer-provided health insurance ended.\n\n\u201cYou have a two-year waiting period [after getting disability] until you can get Medicare. Because he [Bentley] didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, I have no insurance,\u201d McIver says. She will qualify for Medicare in October.\n\nMcIver is a patient at Medical Outreach Ministries in Montgomery, where a doctor sees her about every 60 days. But she needs to see specialists, who often don\u2019t see patients who are uninsured. \u201cI have so many things that I need checked or assessed that it\u2019s ridiculous. \u2026 If I need immediate care, I do have to go to the emergency room,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost demoralizing. \u2026 You feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong. I\u2019ve worked all my life and I expected that something would be there when I needed help.\u201d\n\nDrivers on the Red Mountain Expressway have been seeing billboards advocating Medicaid expansion since last week. Two electronic billboards \u2013 which display the message for 10 seconds every minute \u2013 were placed there by Engage Alabama, an organization started by Dough Hoffman and his wife, Pat Vandermeer.\n\nHoffman, who retired as finance director of Children\u2019s of Alabama, served as a navigator helping people sign up for the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI was the first certified navigator in the state. I enrolled hundreds of people and I heard story after story after story,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to turn down about half of the people I met with because they didn\u2019t meet the income qualifications.\u201d\n\nHoffman says he and his wife decided to start Engage Alabama \u201cto engage the citizens of Alabama in civic issues we feel are important. Our first issue \u2013 and we are going to stick with this issue as long as it takes \u2013 is expanding Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAbout 15 percent of Alabama adults would benefit from Medicaid expansion, he says, but he doesn\u2019t think the general public is aware of the issues involved. \u201cOur overarching goal is to get a billboard campaign going from Huntsville in every city down to Mobile\u2026to raise the public\u2019s awareness of this issue,\u201d he says.\n\nEngage Alabama is currently raising money to pay for billboards across the state. Hoffman says the organization will use all the money that is raised to pay for billboards and also will provide the first $100 for any billboard sponsored by other like-minded groups. On average, a billboard costs about $1,000, he says.\n\nHoffman believes even those who have insurance have reasons to support Medicaid expansion. \u201cEveryone\u2019s premiums in the state are higher because of uncompensated care. Everyone who has to go to a hospital ER and can\u2019t pay, that cost is shifted to higher [insurance] premiums. Expanding Medicaid would actually reduce our private premiums,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn order to fund all this Medicaid expansion, the federal government is collecting our tax dollars,\u201d Hoffman adds. \u201cIf we choose not to use those tax dollars, that money will be spent in other states. We are passing up $1.7 billion every year we don\u2019t do it and we will never get it back. \u2026 That\u2019s just bad government.\u201d\n\nA coalition of organizations called Alabama\u2019s BEST (Better Economy Starts Today) is working to get Bentley to change his mind. Alabama Arise, which focuses on issues affecting the poor, is one of those organizations.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, people are suffering because they could have gotten health coverage as of Jan. 1, but the governor has denied them that protection. \u2026 We have estimates that vary but 300,000 is a good number,\u201d says Jim Carnes of Alabama Arise. \u201cThe majority of them would be hardworking people.\u201d\n\nCarnes says the majority of those who have fallen in the gap make minimum wage. \u201cThink of all the people who we see every day who make minimum wage. \u2026 We don\u2019t stop and think about their health coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama Hospital Association is a participant in Alabama\u2019s BEST. Rosemary Blackmon, the association\u2019s chief operating officer, says the AHA did a survey of state hospitals in December.\n\n\u201cForty-one are operating in the red. Already, you have hospitals that are struggling financially,\u201d she says. The problems will get worse because the federal government already has cut reimbursement to hospitals for Medicare patients and will cut that for Medicaid patients in 2015, she says.\n\nIf Alabama expanded Medicaid, the hospitals could make up revenue by having more patients who were covered by the program, she says. Without the expansion, the uninsured go to hospital emergency rooms. \u201cThe hospital ends up absorbing the cost,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn some of the rural areas of the state\u2026up to 70 percent of patients are Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Medicaid expansion warn that some hospitals, especially those in rural areas, might not survive their revenue shortfalls. Blackmon agrees that is possible, saying, \u201cIt is safe to say there are hospitals that are struggling. \u2026 They would do anything they could to keep from closing. At some point, there is no more room to cut without sacrificing care.\u201d\n\nGreater Birmingham Ministries, which provides aid for low-income people, is also part of Alabama\u2019s BEST.\n\n\u201cOur board voted to join Alabama\u2019s BEST the last Thursday in May. We are just getting actively involved,\u201d says Scott Douglas, GBM\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe do know that there are a number of our clients who would benefit\u201d from Medicaid expansion.\n\nHe says Medicaid not being expanded \u201cis doubly painful in Jefferson County with the mess that is around Cooper Green. Medicaid expansion would go a long way to ease the burden for the indigent in Jefferson County.\u201d\n\nBentley\u2019s office was asked for comments from the governor about the Medicaid expansion issue. In an email to Weld, Jennifer Ardis, the governor\u2019s communications director, wrote, \u201cThe governor\u2019s focus now is reforming the current Medicaid system and not expanding the broken system.\u201d She provided links for news releases and other items about Medicaid reform.\n\nBentley focused on Medicaid in his 2014 State of the State address. He said the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion were taking the nation deeper into \u201cthe abyss of debt.\u201d He said expansion is essential to Obamacare and that Medicaid accounts for 35 percent of the state\u2019s general fund.\n\n\u201cUnder Obamacare, Medicaid would grow even larger \u2013 bringing millions more people to a state of dependency on government, and saddling our state and our nation \u2013 the taxpayers \u2013 with the enormous expense.\n\n\u201cHere in Alabama alone, an estimated 300,000 more people would be added to the Medicaid roll, to a system that by our own admission is absolutely broken and flawed.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe federal government has said they will give us money to expand. But how can we believe the federal government will keep its word? The anything but Affordable Care Act has done nothing to gain our trust.\u201d\n\nBentley said \u201cnothing is free. The money the federal government is spending with wild abandon is not federal dollars \u2013 those are your dollars, your hard-earned tax dollars. There is no difference between federal money and your money.\n\n\u201cOur great nation is $17.2 trillion dollars in debt and it increases by $2 billion every single day. That is why I cannot expand Medicaid in Alabama. We will not bring hundreds of thousands into a system that is broken and buckling.\u201d\n\nThe hospital association\u2019s Blackmon hopes Bentley now will reconsider. \u201cWe feel like we are doing our part. We are certainly working with the leadership\u2026to reform the system and coordinate care,\u201d she says. \u201cHopefully he will change his mind.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cEverybody is working to move ahead with the reform. \u2026 The Medicaid expansion would significantly help. I think we would have a system that would care for those individuals.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Medicaid expansion question whether the issue will become a political one in coming months. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Parker Griffith, who is also a physician, favors expansion. Supporters also say a poll earlier this year showed that two-thirds of Alabamians are in favor of expansion.\n\n\u201cThe governor has to make a difficult choice between saving lives and saving face. \u2026 I think everyone agrees it was a political decision,\u201d Greater Birmingham Ministries\u2019 Douglas says. \u201cI just hope he\u2019ll do the right thing and save lives.\u201d\n\nTo read the UAB and UA studies about the effects of Medicaid expansion, click here.
