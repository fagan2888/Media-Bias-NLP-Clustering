Two people were arrested after investigators discovered a drug operation while on the scene of a vehicle fire with toxic fumes. It caused safety concerns for firefighters since the vehicle was so close to the house.They conducted a safety sweep inside the home, according to Cape Coral Police, of the home in the 2000 block of NW 25 Place to warn residents of the potential danger when no one answered the door.After entering the resident, they were unable to find anyone inside but they did find an elaborate marijuana grow operation.Narcotics detectives were summoned once a search warrant was issued to conduct an investigation regarding the renters.They found out the two renters, identified as Guillermo Abreu and Meivys Escano rented the home about two months ago. Escano has a 10-year-old child but the child is staying with the father in Fort Myers."It places the child in danger because of the people who gravitate towards this lifestyle and activities," said Dana Coston, Cape Coral Police.Abreu and Escano were charged with marijuana cultivation, other drug related charges and using the home for drug manufacturing with a minor present.Both were held on $69,500 bond however both Abreu and Escano posted bond.The vehicle fire was reported to be suspicious. The fire call came in about 9:30 Saturday night.Residents say they were questioned that evening if they knew the family who lived in the home."This is a big business here right under my nose and everyone else living here," said Mary Blank Stuart. "It's a quiet community and a very good cover for anyone that's trying to make a lot if money in this drug craze world.""The amount that they are doing is not minor but the kind if operation that that is is definitely gonna draw some bad elements and that definitely puts everybody in danger," said Dana Coston, Cape Coral Police.
