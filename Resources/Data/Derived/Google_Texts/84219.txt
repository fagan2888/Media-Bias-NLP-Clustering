Sioux Falls, SD

In a race that attracted national attention, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Rick Weiland said in his concession speech the fight to "take it back" is far from over.

During the speech, he talked about his campaign and the South Dakotans he met along the way.

“Some people think that maybe I was going to collapse after 18 months and going to every town in the state. It's strange, I feel energized I feel like I did accomplish something in this campaign. We shed some light on big money and its control on our government, control of our politicians and how we just can't give up. I believe in the promise of America which is an equal opportunity for everyone. I think that opportunity has been slipping for some time. The powerful and the privileged have bought congress. They get their way on public policy and we need to take that back. That's what my campaign was all about,” Weiland said.

Weiland said later, “I don't think this fight is over. The fight to take back our country from the big money that seems to be running the show. I don't think that can ever be over until we win. Winning to me is a constitutional amendment that would give us an opportunity to overcome and overturn Citizens United and regulate what is unregulated right now. I heard the other day that $14 million was spent on this senate race. I didn't spend $14 million but it came in from all over the country. And that's what citizens united, the Supreme Court has put on the people. Money isn't speech. It never was. And the people that do, you just better pay some attention because it's destroying our democracy and we need to take our country back from that. “

Weiland says this race was supposed to be a walk in the park for the Republicans, but his camp turned it into a race because the Democrats have the issues of their side.

He also praised South Dakota for voting to raise minimum wage and hopes to see more acceptance of the Affordable Care Act in the future.
