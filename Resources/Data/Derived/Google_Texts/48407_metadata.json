It will also receive an estimated $50 million from the network, which could go towards the purchase of equipment, renovating operating rooms and enhancing services.\n\nFor the last two years, Hackensack University Medical Center and Palisades, both non-profits, have shared clinical privileges \u2013 Hackensack specialists have treated many pediatric and neonatal cases from Palisades. The new deal expands into other areas of care, including neurology, orthopedic surgery and oncology.\n\n\u201cThis new venture will place our hospitals on the cutting-edge of medicine and healthcare delivery for our patients,\u2019\u2019 said Robert C. Garrett, president and CEO of Hackensack University Health Network.\n\nThe Hackensack network includes two other hospitals, both for-profit \u2013 HackensackUMC at Pascack and HackensackUMC Mountainside.\n\nAcross the state, more hospitals are joining networks as reimbursements decline and changes in the Affordable Care Act shift the fee-for-service model to one that provides incentives to keep patients healthy and out of the hospital. Joining networks also allows hospitals to save millions on billing, purchasing, insurance negotiations and to implement new efficiencies such as electronic record keeping.\n\nMany hospitals in New Jersey are foregoing their standalone status or seeking buyers to remain open \u2013 The St. Barnabas health system acquired Jersey City Medical Center earlier this year. Prime HealthCare Services, a California-based for profit-company, recently took over St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Passaic. The chain also purchased the Denville-based St. Clare\u2019s Health System and is awaiting approval from the state health commissioner. It is also seeking to buy St. Michael\u2019s Medical Center in Newark.\n\nBy extending its network into Hudson County, Hackensack expects to attract patients who may otherwise seek specialized care in Manhattan for cancer, orthopedics and other treatment, Garrett said.\n\n\u201cWe want patients to stay in New Jersey for higher level care,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPalisades includes a 202-bed hospital and The Harborage, a 245-bed nursing home and rehabilitation center that could receive patients from Hackensack. By joining the network, cancer patients at Palisades will have access to an array of clinical trials underway at Hackensack, which opened the John Theurer Cancer Center nearly four years ago and treats 50,000 patients annually.\n\n\u201cThis affiliation will give our patients access to world-class physicians and the best specialty care programs available,\u2019\u2019 said Bruce J. Markowitz, president and CEO of Palisades Medical Center.\n\nThe agreement leaves the existing management team at Palisades in place, officials said.\n\nPalisades is in the midst of constructing a 50,000 square-foot building next to the hospital that will contain three floors of physician offices and two floors of parking. Construction is expected to be completed later this year at a cost of more than $20 million, Markowitz said.\n\nEmail: layton@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The Hackensack University Medical Center health system is acquiring Palisades Medical Center, a deal that pumps $50 million into the North Bergen hospital and expands Hackensack\u2019s ever-growing network into Hudson County.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "MARY JO LAYTON", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/hackensack-university-medical-center-health-acquires-palisades-medical-center-1.1084973", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Hackensack University Medical Center health system is acquiring Palisades Medical Center, a deal that pumps $50 million into the North Bergen hospital and expands Hackensack\u2019s ever-growing network into Hudson County."}, "title": "Hackensack University Medical Center health acquires Palisades Medical Center", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "MARY JO LAYTON", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Hackensack University Medical Center health acquires Palisades Medical Center"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda47e\"", "article_summary": "The Hackensack University Medical Center health system is acquiring Palisades Medical Center, a deal that pumps $50 million into the North Bergen hospital and expands Hackensack\u2019s ever-growing network into Hudson County.\nFor the last two years, Hackensack University Medical Center and Palisades, both non-profits, have shared clinical privileges \u2013 Hackensack specialists have treated many pediatric and neonatal cases from Palisades.\nIt is also seeking to buy St. Michael\u2019s Medical Center in Newark.\nPalisades includes a 202-bed hospital and The Harborage, a 245-bed nursing home and rehabilitation center that could receive patients from Hackensack.\n\u201cThis affiliation will give our patients access to world-class physicians and the best specialty care programs available,\u2019\u2019 said Bruce J.
