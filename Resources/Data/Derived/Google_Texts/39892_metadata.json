And 60 percent of state-funded student financial aid would be reserved for students attending private, independent colleges and universities.\n\nKU spokesman Tim Caboni, who sat through the conference committee talks, called it a good deal.\n\n\u201cFlat tuition for students is a win for the parents and families in Kansas,\u201d Caboni said. \u201cThe Legislature agreed to work with us to keep tuition flat for our students and at the same time not target us with cuts. For this point in the process, it\u2019s a very good outcome.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate could vote on the package as early as Thursday.\n\nThe original Senate plan cut $9.4 million from KU\u2019s general operating budget over the next two years, and it cut $2.1 million from K-State\u2019s budget in the upcoming fiscal year. It also called for reserving 75 percent of the state-funded \u201ccomprehensive grants\u201d for students who attend private colleges and universities in Kansas.\n\nState Goverment Click here for recent statehouse stories\n\nBut after several rounds of talks, the Senate agreed to drop the cuts to KU and K-State and to accept a 60-40 percent split in financial aid between private and public universities.\n\nIn exchange, the Senate asked for a two-year freeze on tuition at the Regents universities.\n\nThe budget deal was struck just as state universities and the Kansas Board of Regents were beginning to discuss tuition rates for the upcoming academic year.\n\nCaboni said that even though KU would not take a budget cut under the plan, the overall flat funding compared with last year combined with a tuition freeze amounts to a cut. But he gave assurances that KU would not try to raise student fees and other campus charges, which are not part of the proposed freeze, as a way to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t shift expenses to fees. That violates the spirit of this,\u201d Caboni said. \u201cI think what we\u2019ll have to have conversations around is, if we\u2019re going to hold tuition flat, and if there are extras we want to do as an institution, how do we generate the resources to do that. Is it through public-private partnerships? Is it through fundraising? It won\u2019t be through tuition.\u201d\n\nAnother part of the deal is that the House agreed to put funding for the Kansas judiciary in a separate bill, something the Senate has wanted since the beginning of the budget process.\n\nThe full House has not yet voted on a budget bill, in part because Republican leaders were not sure they could muster the 63 votes needed for passage. Some conservatives have wanted deeper cuts in state spending.\n\nIn addition, though, a full floor debate would allow for the possibility of amendments that could have included expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOverall, when the compromise bill is combined with the school funding bill passed earlier, and the judicial branch budget that will be done later, the combined budget package calls for spending about $6.3 billion from the state general fund for each of the next two years.\n\nBut even if that package passes both chambers, lawmakers will either need to find additional revenues to fund the budget or identify additional cuts when they return in late April to pass the final budget.\n\nAccording to the most recent projections from the Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan Research Department, the budget calls for spending $224 million more than the state expects to have available in the fiscal year beginning July 1 and $172.3 million more than the projected revenue for the following fiscal year.\n\nAnother variable hovering over the budget situation is the ongoing school finance lawsuit.\n\nThe school funding bill that Gov. Sam Brownback signed into law last week is now the subject of new litigation because it repeals the funding formula that had been in place since 1992 and replaces it for two years with a system of block grants. Plaintiffs in the ongoing school finance suit argue the change will leave the state\u2019s 286 school districts unconstitutionally under-funded.\n\nThe next hearing in that lawsuit is scheduled for May 7.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
