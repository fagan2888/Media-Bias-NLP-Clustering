Right on the House floor, the chairman of an important committee (she won't say who) strode toward her with a bill and a list of other freshmen who had signed on as sponsors, and said, \"Here, sign this.\"\n\n\"I said, 'Do you have a copy of the bill? Could I look at it?'\" recalls the self-described conservative, who, at 36, is among some of the youngest members of Congress. \"He looked at me and said, 'I don't have a copy. Just sign.'\" Though she'd only served a month\u2014still early enough to cement a reputation within her party that could haunt her for the duration of her tenure\u2014she told him she wouldn't sign until she'd had a chance to read the bill. The payoff was not immediate. \"I thought, Oh, great. I've been here a month, and I'm winning friends and influencing people. But you know what? He never pushed me again. In this town,\" she explains, \"you have to set your boundaries early on.\"\n\nThat kind of dauntlessness has been a hallmark of Herrera Beutler's career. The daughter of a second-generation Mexican-American father, she and her five siblings (three of whom were adopted) were homeschooled by their mother.\n\nI love being a young Hispanic mother who's a Republican, because it breaks through a lot of stereotypes.\n\nHer congressional races have been hard fought, but Herrera Beutler's toughest challenge wasn't political, it was personal. In 2013, pregnant with her first child, she learned that the baby had Potter's syndrome\u2014the child's kidneys were not properly developing, causing low amniotic fluid, which, in turn, inhibited the growth of the lungs. The condition is almost always fatal. Even in this, Herrera Beutler refused to take no for an answer. \"I just had to decide that this baby is going to be a miracle,\" Herrera Beutler says. \"I'm sure it confused people, because they'd come up and say, 'I'm so sorry for your loss,' and I would be like, 'Thank you, but I believe she's going to be OK.' \"\n\nOnce Herrera Beutler went public with the news of her pregnancy, she heard from a father whose child, suffering from low amniotic fluid, had received experimental but lifesaving injections of saline to the amniotic sac. Herrera Beutler found a doctor at Johns Hopkins Medicine who was willing to give her the injections, and in July 2013, her daughter, Abigail (named for first lady Abigail Adams), was born, 12 weeks premature and weighing less than 3 pounds. She is believed to be the first baby to have survived being born without either of her kidneys. Abigail still needs a kidney transplant, which she will likely receive from her father. \"She's thriving,\" Herrera Beutler says.\n\n...\n\nThough decidedly conservative\u2014she is pro-life and voted to repeal Obamacare\u2014Herrera Beutler says she has little patience for party extremists. \"I wouldn't call myself a moderate, but I would call myself an adult,\" she says. By way of example, she points to her friendship with Suzanne Bonamici, the Oregon Democrat whose district includes famously liberal Portland. \"We ride the same plane,\" Herrera Beutler says. \"We don't agree on everything policy-wise, but there are things we do agree on, and that allows us to collaborate.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "04-23-15", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/JaimeHerreraBeutler042315%282%29.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Meet Jaime Herrera Beutler, the Republican Spitfire Who's Rewriting the Rules\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2015\\/04\\/23\\/meet-jaime-herrera-beutler-republican-spitfire-whos-rewriting-rules\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/JaimeHerreraBeutler042315%282%29.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-23T18:14:47-04:00\",\"identifier\":\"75524\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "By Karen Schwartz, Marie ClaireIt&#039;s a whole new game for women in the GOP.In her first month of serving in Congress four years ago, Jaime Herrera Beutler faced a test,", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.subject": "By Karen Schwartz, Marie ClaireIt&#039;s a whole new game for women in the GOP.In her first month of serving in Congress four years ago, Jaime Herrera Beutler faced a test,", "description": "By Karen Schwartz, Marie ClaireIt&#039;s a whole new game for women in the GOP.In her first month of serving in Congress four years ago, Jaime Herrera Beutler faced a test,", "prism.section": "nation", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "Meet Jaime Herrera Beutler, the Republican Spitfire Who's Rewriting the Rules", "dcterms.created": "04-23-15", "og": {"site_name": "FoxNation.com", "description": "By Karen Schwartz, Marie ClaireIt&#039;s a whole new game for women in the GOP.In her first month of serving in Congress four years ago, Jaime Herrera Beutler faced a test,", "title": "Meet Jaime Herrera Beutler, the Republican Spitfire Who's Rewriting the Rules", "url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/04/23/meet-jaime-herrera-beutler-republican-spitfire-whos-rewriting-rules", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/JaimeHerreraBeutler042315%282%29.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "By Karen Schwartz, Marie ClaireIt&#039;s a whole new game for women in the GOP.In her first month of serving in Congress four years ago, Jaime Herrera Beutler faced a test,", "dc.date": "2016-05-26", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Meet Jaime Herrera Beutler, the Republican Spitfire Who's Rewriting the Rules\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2015\\/04\\/23\\/meet-jaime-herrera-beutler-republican-spitfire-whos-rewriting-rules\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/JaimeHerreraBeutler042315%282%29.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-23T18:14:47-04:00\",\"post_id\":\"75524\"}"}, "article_summary": "In her first month of serving in Congress four years ago, Jaime Herrera Beutler faced a test, one the Republican from Washington state remembers vividly.\nEven in this, Herrera Beutler refused to take no for an answer.\n\"We ride the same plane,\" Herrera Beutler says.\n\"I just had to decide that this baby is going to be a miracle,\" Herrera Beutler says.\n\"She's thriving,\" Herrera Beutler says."}
