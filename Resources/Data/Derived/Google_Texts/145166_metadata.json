You may feel relieved to finally have those years of schooling and training behind you. But then reality sets in and you wonder how you are going to deal with the medical school debt that you\u2019ve accrued.\n\nAccording to the American Medical School Association1, 86 percent of medical school graduate carry educational debt and that the median debt burden is $155,000 for public school graduates and nearly $185,000 for private school graduates.\n\nHow can a young physician balance the financial stresses of overwhelming medical school debt with buying their first home, saving for retirement, buying a new car, and at the same time enjoying life?\n\nLet\u2019s approach this with a specific plan of action with some principles that can help any young physician. I have broken down the prioritization based upon two different case studies- one for a primary care physician and the other for a specialty physician in case studies one and two below.\n\nSpecialist physicians on average, have more income than a primary care physician. Due to the extra wiggle room, there are some significant differences between the two case studies. For example, we bump up retirement savings and a down payment for the purchase of a first home.\n\nTo develop a plan, you will need to take some time to ponder and reflect upon your situation. The best time to do that is now, early in your career. Here are some things to consider as you do that.\n\nCase Study# 1 Primary Care Physician Income $ 150,000 Taxes3 $ 26,537 Rent $ 18,000 Living Expenses $ 60,000 Student Debt $ 11,600 Rainy Day/ Further Debt Paydown $ 12,000 Save for First Home $ 15,000 Retirement/ 401k $ 6,863 Expenses $ 150,000\n\nCase Study# 2 Specialist Physician Income $ 220,000 Taxes3 $ 53,073 Rent/ Mortgage $ 18,000 Living Expenses $ 80,000 Student Debt $ 11,600 Rainy Day/ Further Debt Paydown $ 21,000 Save for First Home $ 23,000 Retirement $ 13,327 Expenses $ 220,000\n\nStrategies for Student & Consumer Debt & The \u201cRainy Day\u201d Fund\n\nIn my opinion, one of the most important things you need to do is to lower and eliminate their consumer and educational debts as well as to establish your \u201crainy day\u201d fund.\n\nNow that you have your first job as a physician, make sure for the first few months to set aside money for the \u201cstuff happens\u201d factors in life like the car breaking down or the furnace going out. I call this the \u201crainy day\u201d fund.\n\nFor any physician, I suggest a minimum saving $6,000 within the first few months. If you make over $200,000, double that. Continue to save that amount annually to keep building up for the rainy day.\n\nKeep these funds in a money market or checking account until you have more than $15,000. Then, consider a low-risk investment account where you can pull out ALL of your money without any penalty, if necessary.\n\nBeyond the cash cushion, focus on reducing your debt.\n\nFirst, make sure that you consolidate and lock-in the interest rates for your student and consumer debt. We are at all-time interest rate lows. Interest rates are not likely to get any lower. As a matter of fact, interest rates are likely to rise within the next two to three years.\n\nConsider signing up for automatic payments to knock off 0.25 percent or more on your debts.\n\nSecondly, while in residency or fellowship, consider either deferring your loan (where interest will compound) or forebearing through an income-based repayment plan (IBR) or through an pas- as-you earn repayment plan (PER). Note that an PER requires a lower monthly commitment than an IBR, but extends the life of the loan.\n\nNext, consider debt-forgiveness programs that are available through federal or state sources.\n\nAlso, find out what it would take to pay back your student loan in 10 years or 15 years instead of 30 years. Consider that 30 years of interest on a 5%, $150,000 student loan amounts to nearly $140,000 worth of interest! If you pay back the loan over 30 years, you\u2019ve just nearly doubled the total amount that you\u2019ll have to pay. Whereas using only 15 years reduces the total interest to nearly $64,000. That $76,000 interest savings could buy you the cabin or RV (or 5 European vacations!) you want in retirement.\n\nAt a minimum, consider putting at least an extra $500/month to an extra $1,000/month or more towards your debts.\n\nLastly, your student loans are not likely to be tax deductible (since you will be making over $90,000), pay them down before you pay down a mortgage. However, other consumer debt like credit cards and car loans typically have higher interest rates. Pay off consumer debt (or even better, don\u2019t have consumer debt!) before paying down student loans.\n\nFocus on how paying-off one debt or another by balancing interest rates versus your cash flow. If you have a huge interest rate difference between debts \u2014 let\u2019s say 4 percent or more \u2014 pay off the higher interest rate debt. Also, if you only have $5,000 or more left for a debt, consider focusing on that debt to have it paid off and increase your monthly cash flow.\n\nEnjoying a Reasonable Lifestyle & Saving for Retirement\n\nWhat is a reasonable lifestyle? Although this means different things to different people, I consider it to mean that you aren\u2019t just squeaking by. Perhaps you are able to eat out frequently, go on a vacation, or do things you enjoy while still being committed to keeping your expenses within limits. To help keep an eye on your living expenses, use free budgeting and wealth management tools such as Mint.com, Emoneyadvisor.com and creditkarma.com.\n\nNext, how do you balance all of this with saving for retirement?\n\nFirst, contribute to your 401k. It not only counts towards retirement, but it lowers your income taxes.\n\nSecondly, make sure to contribute at least up to the maximum match that your employer provides. If your employer matches dollar for dollar, this is like an automatic 100 percent return. Even if your employer matches 50 cents or 25 cents on the dollar, that is still like a 50 percent or 25 percent return just for contributing.\n\nLastly, if you are a highly compensated specialist get close to maxing out your maximum contribution in order to lower both your federal and state income taxes. If you are under 50 years old, the maximum you can put in the 401k is $17,500 in 2013.\n\nBe Smart About Big-Ticket Items\n\nAfter years of living in small houses or apartments or driving older vehicles, many young physicians feel they\u2019re more than ready to purchase a new home or car when they finally get their first \u201creal\u201d job.\n\nInstead of rushing out to buy such big-ticket items, take a moment and think about how those purchases might affect your ability to achieve your long-term financial goals. And bear in mind that your lifestyle can change as you pay off your debt.\n\nHere are a few of things to consider when you are ready to make those purchases:\n\nWhen buying a home, make sure you can put at least 20 percent down on the property. If you put only 5 or 10 percent down, you may be required to have private mortgage insurance (PMI), the cost of which could raise your monthly payment by a couple of hundred dollars.\n\nNote that there are some physician specific loan programs that may not require PMI. However, getting in the practice of savings towards a goal is a wonderful form of financial discipline.\n\nRemember that cars are depreciating assets. The second you drive a new car off the lot, you typically lose $5,000 to $10,000 of the value. Why put a significant chunk of your hard earned dough in something that you know you will lose money on?\n\nInstead of buying a new car, consider buying a used one and holding onto it as long as possible. Financially speaking, buying a low-mileage used car (say with 20,000 to 50,000 miles on the odometer) and holding it for five years or more makes much more sense than leasing or buying new.\n\nI strongly suggest paying cash for a car. If you already have a high-interest car loan, consider paying it off as soon as possible. If you do decide to get a new car, remember that buying can be a better deal than leasing, especially if you hold on to the car for five years or more. If you lease a $20,000 car over three years at 6 percent interest and pay $1,000 down, the total cost over three years will be $12,600 plus the down payment.\n\nAt the end of the lease, you will have paid $4,200 toward the principal of the loan and can either purchase the car or return it to the dealer. If you purchased the same $20,000 vehicle with the same down payment and finance it at 6% interest, you would pay $7,500 per year ($22,500, plus the down payment over three years). At the end of the loan period, you will own the car.#2\n\nIf you look at the cost of leasing over 10 years (let\u2019s say that you renew your lease every three years) and get the latest model car, the costs for leasing will be at least $42,000 plus down payments. Whereas, if you bought the car and held on to it, the cost will have been $22,500 plus regular maintenance. Buying rather than leasing would save you nearly $20,000.\n\nPhysicians have big hearts and big dreams. They may want to pay for their kids\u2019 college education, buy the cabin or second home, buy a boat or RV, or give lots of money to worthwhile charities.\n\nMy advice: Hold off on these things until you are debt-free. Remember that once your debts are paid, you\u2019ll have the cash to fund these other projects.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs a physician, you\u2019ve made a commitment to helping others and your community.\n\nNow you need to make a similar commitment to your finances.\n\nIf, as a young physician, you focus on paying off your debts, save for a rainy day, live within your means and put money away for retirement, you can then do the things you\u2019ve long dreamed of doing and be well down the road to financial independence.\n\n###\n\nDave Denniston, CFA is a professional wealth manager and financial advisor located in Bloomington, MN.
