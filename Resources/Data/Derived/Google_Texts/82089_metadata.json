He doesn\u2019t bring bait or a pole. When he gets to a known catfish hole, he steps in the water and shoves his hands in trying to grab a fish.\n\nJosh Coleman sat mesmerized as the Iowa State coaching staff relayed the story. The art of noodling hit home with the avid fisherman as a thought popped into his head.\n\nI have to meet the Cyclones that do this. That\u2019s pretty amazing.\n\nIt\u2019s in that moment that ISU reeled in Coleman, a 250-pound defensive tackle from Jacksonville, Fla. Sixty-one percent of ISU signees under coach Paul Rhoads are from California, Florida or Texas. The challenge is getting those athletes on campus, shrinking the distance between their homes and the university.\n\nISU\u2019s central recruiting philosophy is to get a player in town. The coaches will use anything they can \u2014 a fishing story, recruiting near locations with cheap flights, identifying specific players that will fit in around Ames \u2014 to hear the four words they were after from Coleman.\n\nI want to visit.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get them here,\u201d defensive backs coach Maurice Linguist said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing. If you took all the logos off of every school and you just saw the facilities for what they are, Iowa State could hold its own with a lot of places. When they see it with their own eyes, that is when they start listening to you.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWanting to recruit in California, Florida or Texas isn\u2019t revolutionary. It\u2019s a staple of programs across the country. Rhoads did it as a Cyclone assistant in the 1990s.\n\nRhoads believed it was a key part to ISU\u2019s glory years under Dan McCarney. Rhoads believed it would be a key part to his success upon getting hired in December 2008.\n\nBut those who grow up in the south hear about the ACC or the SEC. The Big 12, let alone ISU, can be an afterthought. There are similar issues with California and for non-Big 12 teams in Texas.\n\nThere are an abundance of schools within driving distance for a player and his family in those areas. It\u2019s common for ISU coaches to run into Florida players who never left the area. A Midwestern state half a country away might as well be a foreign land, even if it may be a short flight away. Parents can hesitate sending their babies so far from home.\n\nWhy take the time to visit ISU with so many other options nearby? It\u2019s a question, regardless if it\u2019s asked or not, that must be overcome.\n\n\u201cThey have to fly over a lot of schools and a lot of people that are closer to them that can get their hands on them to get them here,\u201d ISU defensive tackles coach Shane Burnham said.\n\nGerrit Chernoff didn\u2019t know much about the Cyclones before joining Rhoads in Ames. Chernoff, ISU\u2019s director of player personnel, quickly discovered the importance of getting players on campus. Those who made it to town committed in high numbers. Securing official visits in the fall and winter, or unofficial visits over the summer, became a central recruiting priority.\n\n\u201cWe are able to get people here and show them something they didn\u2019t expect,\u201d Chernoff said. \u201cThat is why we have such a high success rate (of getting commitments) when we get people on campus.\u201d\n\nThe campus is beautiful \u2014 outside of the winter. The academics are good, especially engineering, agriculture and business. The Bergstrom Football Complex and its 14,242-square foot weight room can get a recruit\u2019s attention.\n\nThe gameday experience, with near sellouts and 50,000-fans filling up Jack Trice Stadium over the last six years, can be a sight to see during a period where most programs struggle with attendance figures.\n\n\u201cWe have a product to sell if we can get the right people on campus,\u201d Rhoads said.\n\nBut those players don\u2019t always know who the Cyclones are or can\u2019t tell you anything more than a few basic facts. Before coaches can start recruiting someone, they need to introduce them to the university.\n\nBurnham can tell them all they\u2019ll need to know. He has the pitch down, but he doesn\u2019t use it. Instead, he asks if the recruit follows him on social media. When they do, he directs them to specific links.\n\n\u201cI can try to picture things in a 1,000 words,\u201d Burnham said, \u201cbut videos work better.\u201d\n\nThe Cyclones have a video for everything.\n\nInterested in campus? Here\u2019s a video.\n\nWhat is game day like? Here\u2019s a video.\n\nWant to see the weight room? Here\u2019s a video.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, a recruit can know more about some parts of ISU than those who live 10 minutes away.\n\nThe more ways they can make ISU appealing the better. The foundation of recruiting isn\u2019t changing. Everything is predicated on relationships. Social media, though, can serve as a digital version of a targeted direct mailer.\n\nChernoff doesn\u2019t care how many retweets or favorites his posts get. He\u2019s not interested in securing 5,000 followers. All the videos and personal messages are sent out with specific recruits in mind, trying to increase the odds of landing that precious visit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about getting the Iowa State name across Texas,\u201d Chernoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the Iowa State brand awareness for five kids down there.\u201d\n\nTeenagers are fickle. Getting, and keeping their attention, is hard. It\u2019s an issue for advertisers, not just recruiters.\n\nISU needs to stand out. It\u2019s why Chernoff hosts a golden ticket day, a camp for elite prospects over the summer. It\u2019s designed to make players feel special, like getting VIP access to a club, while seeing a campus the Cyclones believe isn\u2019t a hard sell.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nOn his way from class to class Coleman bumped into a college football coach. It was the first coach Coleman saw in person. The coach said \u201cHey.\u201d\n\nThe moment stuck with the eighth-grader.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel like a big shot,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nHe never forgot his interaction with an ISU coach. It\u2019s why he always kept one eye on the Cyclones \u2013 \u201cEven with the losing record, I always liked them,\u201d he said. \u2013 while dreaming of playing college football. It never went much beyond that, though.\n\nColeman didn\u2019t play much as a junior. He wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s recruiting radar until he put together a Class 2A all-state season. He made 21 tackles at University Christian High School.\n\nHis name started spreading among local coaches. That\u2019s how Linguist heard about him last December. Early reports were positive. Burnham liked Coleman\u2019s film.\n\nThere was one problem. The recruiting season was winding down. There would only be a few weeks to get to know him and try to secure one of the few remaining weekends left for an official visit.\n\n\u201cIt was an accelerated pace,\u201d Linguist said. \u201cA lot had to happen fast.\u201d\n\nWhen Linguist reached out, Tennessee State and Idaho were at the top of Coleman\u2019s list. Missouri, Penn State and Wake Forest would also come calling.\n\nLinguist quickly stood out because the first thing he mentioned was graduation rates and education, not football. It was a priority for Coleman and it allowed them to quickly build a bond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in academics because I want to take advantage of whatever they have to offer,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI can use them instead of them using me.\u201d\n\nColeman was intrigued by the coaches, by the noodling, by the university and by a program with a need at defensive tackle.\n\nHe told the Cyclones just what they wanted to hear. He would make an official visit in January.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nRhoads loves Iowans. He can go into a five-minute speech on why he thinks the values they bring match the Spartan, blue-collar work ethic that\u2019s the foundation of his program.\n\nThere\u2019s one problem. A state with a population of 3.1 million isn\u2019t littered with them. ISU averages 3.3 in-state prospects per year over Rhoads seven recruiting classes.\n\nThere isn\u2019t enough local talent to fill a roster. The Cyclones must look elsewhere. Surrounding states are good, but ISU can run into a similar problem. Either there isn\u2019t an abundance of players or it can be tough recruiting in a state with one flagship program.\n\nThe Cyclones know they\u2019ll need to sign players that aren\u2019t ready made stars. Some will be too small. Others may not be fast enough. A few may change positions. In a state such as Florida, which produces Division I players at a rate Middle Eastern countries can export oil, there are enough prospects for a program 1,000 miles away to find what they\u2019re seeking without always facing in-state competition.\n\n\u201cThis is where we can get some diamonds in the rough compared to some other states,\u201d Chernoff said.\n\nThe distance causes problems, though.\n\nRecruiting those half a country away costs money.\n\nAn Ames Tribune study of Big 12 recruiting budgets over the last six years places ISU third, averaging $524,044 per year. The information was obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests. Baylor and TCU, which are private schools, were not included in the study. The Cyclones spent $644,214 in 2013-14, a 27 percent increase from 2009.\n\nRhoads cites the cost of flights and hotel rooms, as well as ISU focusing more on newer recruiting areas such as Mississippi and Georgia, as the reasons for the escalation.\n\n\u201cRecruiting budgets need to be in place to allow you to go get the kids, and (ISU athletic director Jamie Pollard) recognizes that,\u201d Rhoads said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the money recruiting-wise to get to where we need to go and do the things we need to do to give us a chance.\u201d\n\nBut is it money well and efficiently spent?\n\nRhoads said yes. He added that coaches are on budgets when traveling, and that he judges how wisely ISU is allocating recruiting resources based on how many official visitors become Cyclones.\n\n\u201cOur percentage of signing kids is pretty high,\u201d Rhoads said. \u201cI think that is a pretty reflective piece of spending the money efficiently.\u201d\n\nThe recruiting process, especially for out-of-state prospects, begins with the spring evaluation period. At its conclusion, the coaches review film and put together a list of recruits to target. The list fluctuates as players commit elsewhere and new players are discovered.\n\nThe Cyclones are after a player who fits Rhoads\u2019 ideal version of the program and will feel at home in central Iowa. An urban player being recruited by urban schools likely isn\u2019t a fit for ISU.\n\nThose who like fishing and hunting will feel at home in the ISU locker room - and in the local tree stands. Those who grew up around agriculture or are country kids tend to like what the Cyclones offer, Rhoads said.\n\nAnd, yes, he can find those players in Florida or California.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of stuff away from the skyline with all those states,\u201d Rhoads said.\n\nIdentifying the right player, with the right values, isn\u2019t always enough. Recruiting can get harder when a team wins five total games in two years. Rhoads will admit as much.\n\nFive players decommitted in the 2014 class. The Cyclones know other coaches will use the lack of success against them, and it can make recruits hesitant. It\u2019s how college football operates.\n\nThe response \u2013 until the season starts and wins can serve as a cure-all for most recruiting problems \u2013 is to be on the lookout for recruits getting swayed and remind them why they looked at or committed in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing is being aware and having the knowledge early and being able to defend yourself and your program and what you\u2019ve got before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Rhoads said.\n\nLong-distance recruiting can hinge on so many factors, and it\u2019s the unexpected ones that can cause the biggest problems.\n\nBurnham oversees a large swatch of Florida, from the panhandle in the north to Naples in the southwest along the Gulf of Mexico. When he got to ISU in 2009, he focused on the panhandle. It\u2019s where his connections were best. Things were looking up.\n\nBurnmah would convince recruits ISU was in their best interests. Then they\u2019d look at the airfare costs. Up to four-figure plane rides were too expensive. Recruits didn\u2019t have the money to visit for camps. Parents couldn\u2019t afford to accompany their sons on official visits.\n\nCalvin Pryor, a 2015 NFL first-round pick and Class of 2011 prospect, brought the issue up. The cheapest flight available required a lengthy drive across the northern part of the state. Pryor ended up at Louisville.\n\n\u201cIt was an objection we came across in the panhandle,\u201d Burnham said.\n\nThe answer was Allegiant Air, a discount travel company with cheaper direct flights from Florida to Iowa. In part, because a cheap airplane ticket mattered, Burnham started looking a little more at spots where Allegiant or fellow airlines such as Southwest were more common.\n\nIn recent years, the Cyclones started recruiting Atlanta because of Linguist\u2019s connections. It helped that there were cheaper options from there to Iowa.\n\n\u201cPart of the decision making there was it was an affordable flight,\u201d Burnham said.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Coleman long to see why ISU fights to get players on campus. He connected with the coaching staff and players. The academic options were better than he hoped. The football facility stood out.\n\n\u201cI thought everybody would be mean,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI think the word is docile, that is a good way to describe them. It was all good. They made me feel pretty good there.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough for a commitment. Coleman made the trip by himself. He didn\u2019t feel right committing without input from his mother or grandfather.\n\nISU\u2019s fears about recruits being unable to bring family along was playing out. Complicating matters, Coleman planned to visit Missouri the next week.\n\nThe Cyclones didn\u2019t want to lose him. So, Rhoads and most of the defensive staff flew to Jacksonville for an in-home visit. Family got to meet the coaches. Grandpa laughed about the noodling stories. Mom liked everyone. It was all Coleman needed.\n\nHe never made it to Missouri. He committed shortly after the visit.\n\n\u201cThey had great chemistry with my family,\u201d Coleman said.\n\nIt turns out a good noodling story can do wonders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man heads out fishing.
