Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa), says Tagtow will \u201cdo great things\u201d but Americans have reason to wonder.\n\nAs CNPP boss Tagtow will oversee the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), but unlike all others in that position she has not earned a PhD. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in Dietetics from the University of Northern Iowa and a master\u2019s in Family and Consumer Sciences Education from Iowa State. Though soft on qualifications, Tagtow is fully on board with USDA mission creep.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe mission of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is to make sound nutritional recommendations based on the best scientific research. In recent years, nutrition has taken a back seat to \u201csave the planet\u201d zealotry. On that theme, Tagtow appears to be all in.\n\nShe previously served with the Minnesota Institute for Sustainable Agriculture. She is also the founder of Environmental Nutrition Solutions a consulting firm that promotes \u201csustainable, ecologically sound, socially acceptable\u201d food systems.\n\nTagtow is on record that \u201cdietetic education and practice must encompass the ecological, political, social and economical implications of a healthy diet.\u201d She further believes that \u201cpolicy dictates everything\u201d and has called for \u201cfood system reform\u201d to accompany the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nSchools and offices should be \u201cfast-food free zones,\u201d where workers \u201cshare information on recyclable disposables in place of foam and plastic,\u201d and her \u201cgood food\u201d checklist calls for locally grown vegetables and \u201cless meat to conserve natural resources.\u201d Foods should not be sprayed with pesticides. The new CNPP boss touts \u201corganic methods,\u201d reusable cloth bags, food cooperatives, cloth napkins, and so forth.\n\nTagtow wants those in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) to use their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card to buy vegetable seeds and purchase \u201cseasonal produce.\u201d So she will likely attempt to reconfigure welfare benefits in line with her agenda. This represents an escalation of already expansionist policy.\n\nThe USDA and HHS are conscripting federal nutrition policy to elevate the \u201clong-term health of the planet\u201d over the health of Americans. As head of CNPP Angie Tagtow now spearheads that effort. By all indications she will incorporate her non-nutritional activism in the final implementation of the guidelines.\n\nLegislators should ensure that the guidelines are based on the best available scientific and medical knowledge, not on questionable studies and biased information. In the spirit of transparency, all subcommittee meetings should be open to the public and available online. All research cited by the committee should be made public.\n\nFor their part, Americans are well aware that federal government agencies hold no monopoly on nutritional information, which abounds from multiple sources. Americans can easily verify that a high-fat, high-sodium, high-sugar diet will do them no good. And they might remain skeptical about the need for the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, especially one headed by Angie Tagtow.\n\nAmericans should also be realistic. An administration that creates vast new entitlements and launches new federal agencies is not going to trim the bureaucratic fat. But elections are in the works and Americans have every right to pose hard questions to their candidates.\n\nShould Washington dictate what Americans eat? How much of Americans\u2019 private lives is the federal government going to colonize? What will candidates do to trim bloated, wasteful government?\n\nVoters in Iowa might ask Rep. Latham if he shares Angie Tagtow\u2019s belief that government policy \u201cdictates everything.\u201d For many Americans, it\u2019s sure starting to look that way.\n\nBillingsley is policy fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif., publisher of Plowshares and Pork Barrels: The Political Economy of Agriculture.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "In recent years, nutrition has taken a back seat to \u201csave the planet\u201d zealotry.", "description": "In recent years, nutrition has taken a back seat to \u201csave the planet\u201d zealotry.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "In recent years, nutrition has taken a back seat to \u201csave the planet\u201d zealotry.", "title": "USDA deploys a zealot", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/212870-usda-deploys-a-zealot", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/212870-usda-deploys-a-zealot", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-22T10:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Lloyd Billingsley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-22T10:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/212870-usda-deploys-a-zealot", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "In recent years, nutrition has taken a back seat to \u201csave the planet\u201d zealotry.", "card": "summary", "title": "USDA deploys a zealot"}, "dcterms.title": "USDA deploys a zealot"}, "article_summary": "The USDA and HHS are conscripting federal nutrition policy to elevate the \u201clong-term health of the planet\u201d over the health of Americans.\nAs head of CNPP Angie Tagtow now spearheads that effort.\nAnd they might remain skeptical about the need for the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, especially one headed by Angie Tagtow.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has selected \u201cgreen\u201d food activist Angie Tagtow as executive director of the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP).\nThough soft on qualifications, Tagtow is fully on board with USDA mission creep."}
