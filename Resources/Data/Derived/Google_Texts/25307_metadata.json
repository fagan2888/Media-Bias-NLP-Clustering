And at least one safety expert said that federal investment in train-speed technology would have prevented the accident that killed eight people.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAre you really going to ask such a stupid question?\u201d Boehner said at a news conference, cutting off a reporter as she asked about criticism that railways aren\u2019t adequately funded.\n\nThe back-and-forth was part of a Republican drive to push back against the notion that inadequate funding contributed to the crash, either through faulty tracks or old equipment. The debate focused sharply on whether money would have helped Amtrak install Positive Train Control, a safety technology that was not activated on the stretch of track where the derailment occurred.\n\nSome GOP aides and conservative news outlets seized on comments by Amtrak CEO Joe Boardman suggesting that the passenger rail service had in fact installed the equipment on that section of track. But the National Transportation Safety Board was unequivocal in a Wednesday briefing that the technology was not yet active there.\n\nBoehner had a harsh response Thursday to the allegations of congressional stinginess.\n\n\u201cListen, you know, they started this yesterday, it\u2019s all about funding, it\u2019s all about funding. Well, obviously it\u2019s not about funding,\u201d Boehner added. \u201cThe train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds are there, no money\u2019s been cut from rail safety and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak, and authorize a lot of these programs. And it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that people take the bait on some of the nonsense that gets spewed around here.\u201d\n\nDemocrats called the speaker\u2019s logic nonsense. They pointed out that speed-control technology, known as positive train control, exists and said it could have prevented the crash that killed eight people \u2014 echoing a National Transportation Safety Board member\u2019s take a day earlier.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Boehner\u2019s comments are patently false,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cExperts have made clear that positive train control [technology] could have prevented the tragedy in Philadelphia. It is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation of PTC, and to deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality.\u201d\n\nUnder a 2008 law, positive train control technology needs to be installed on railroads by the end of this year, but some Democrats maintain that more funding could have sped up its installation.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt argued that the technology would have prevented Tuesday\u2019s crash.\n\n\u201cBased on what we know right now, we feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,\u201d Sumwalt told reporters Wednesday evening. Sumwalt, who is leading the crash probe, spoke hours after the House Appropriations Committee voted down a Democratic amendment that would have offered $825 million for the technology known as positive train control.\n\nOn Thursday, some conservative outlets tried to steer the attention back to Amtrak\u2019s equipment. The Washington Examiner ran a story saying the railroad had the technology installed on the tracks where the derailment happened, but that it \u201cwasn\u2019t switched on.\u201d\n\nAmtrak has acknowledged that the equipment has indeed been installed, but that it hadn\u2019t been activated because testing is still required before it can go live.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, speaking during a press conference at Camp David on Thursday, said the fatal accident shows the need for investment in infrastructure.\n\nWhile Obama said it\u2019s still not clear what caused the crash, he said the United States is a growing economy that needs infrastructure funding \u201cnot just when bad things happen, like a bridge collapsing.\u201d ?\n\nThis year has already seen a series of deadly passenger rail accidents, including a rush-hour collision between a commuter train and an SUV that killed six people in Valhalla, New York, a deadly train-truck crash in Oxnard, California, and an Amtrak crash with a tractor-trailer in North Carolina that injured dozens of people. Railroad fatalities have also been on an upswing: Last year\u2019s preliminary total of 813 deaths was 20 percent higher than just three years ago, partly reversing a sharp decline since the early 1990s, according to statistics from the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\nCongress is just 18 days from the expiration of the law that authorizes federal spending on highways, bridges and mass transit \u2014 and the biggest debate in the Capitol is whether to provide patchwork funding to either July or December. The latest \u201creport card\u201d from the American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation a D-plus on the state of its transportation infrastructure.\n\nIn the meantime, the debate over federal funding and train safety is likely to intensify. Earlier this week, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) accused Democrats of exploiting the crash for political gain by invoking the funding argument. \u201cYou have no idea, no idea, what caused this accident,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t use this tragedy in that way. It was beneath you.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats say it\u2019s common sense that more robust funding for train safety would make a difference.\n\n\u201cYou could certainly say that if you had positive train control, this wouldn\u2019t have happened, and if you had enough funding \u2026 you would have put in positive training control already,\u201d said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif), who sits on the House Transportation Committee. \u201cYou can certainly connect those two.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle and Kathryn A. Wolfe contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "He says it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d to ask whether cuts in Amtrak funding were to blame for the deadly train derailment.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He says it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d to ask whether cuts in Amtrak funding were to blame for the deadly train derailment.", "title": "Boehner's 'stupid' comment stokes Amtrak crash debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/john-boehner-amtrak-funding-philadelphia-derailment-stupid-questions-117952.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/14/150514_john_boehner_ap_160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Congress,Amtrak,Transportation,House,John Boehner", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0fa\"", "article_summary": "Boehner's 'stupid' comment stokes Amtrak crash debateSpeaker John Boehner\u2019s said Thursday it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d to blame federal funding of Amtrak for the deadly train crash in Philadelphia.\n\u201cExperts have made clear that positive train control [technology] could have prevented the tragedy in Philadelphia.\nIt was beneath you.\u201dBut Democrats say it\u2019s common sense that more robust funding for train safety would make a difference.\nThe debate focused sharply on whether money would have helped Amtrak install Positive Train Control, a safety technology that was not activated on the stretch of track where the derailment occurred.\nIn the meantime, the debate over federal funding and train safety is likely to intensify."}
