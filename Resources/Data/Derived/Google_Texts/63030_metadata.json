Mr. Scanzoni saw the waves being made by digital video recorders, transforming viewer behavior. He inked a major deal based on three days of time-shifted viewing and effectively made C3 the industry standard for television ad deals.\n\nGroupM, citing data from RECMA, says it accounts for 25% of the U.S. TV market.\n\nNow, with talk that C7 might supplant C3, CMO Today asked Mr. Scanzoni for his thoughts on this year\u2019s upfront.\n\nCMO Today: What struck you about the program lineups presented this year?\n\nI think that clearly one of the things we\u2019re seeing is the advent of a more limited series. That\u2019s kind of an interesting development. Instead of picking up a series and running it as long as it continues to perform, it\u2019s a series that has a beginning or end. It might have 10 episodes and then it\u2019s completed. I think it keeps things fresh, which helps drive ratings a bit. That\u2019s kind of a new trend that seems to be taking hold across most of the networks, where traditionally they develop pilots and produce programs and keep them on their schedule as long as they keep performing.\n\nWhat does that mean for advertisers?\n\nThere is churn in the schedule and there are new programs that come on. I think it reflects the fact that we\u2019re in a very cluttered media environment today with a lot of choices. I think it\u2019s harder and harder for viewers to make long-term commitments to programs. Putting on programs that have a start and a finish over a shorter period of time is an interesting way to draw in viewers and refresh the content over time.\n\nDo you think that C7 will replace C3 this year as the main deal-making metric?\n\nIt all comes down to economics. Clients are obviously getting that audience when people play back their programs post-three days, if they\u2019re not fast-forwarding the commercials, that exposure exists. Ultimately I do see the business going onto a C7 metric because as we try to drive the business to a cross-platform metric, you probably need a longer time frame than the C3 window to optimize that. We will eventually be going there. It\u2019s a matter of working out the economics initially to make the transition one that\u2019s acceptable to both sides.\n\nThe digital ad space is already steeped in automated technology. Will TV head in the same direction?\n\nIn terms of what\u2019s going on in the digital front where there is trading done by machines and algorithms, I think that will evolve to the TV space, but it will only apply probably to secondary inventory like VOD, dynamically inserted ads in VOD post three days, and local cable avails. Places where there is an abundance of inventory and there isn\u2019t a strong demand curve to support that inventory. I think there will be more intent to put that kind of inventory into some sort of an automated marketplace. Now whether that will be real time bidded or not, I doubt it. It would probably be based on some kind of reserve pricing.\n\nFor the core business I don\u2019t see that happening any time soon. The television transaction system at least for national television is relatively efficient.\n\nWhat do you and your clients care about right now?\n\nWhat\u2019s important to us and our clients and the vendor community is the ability to measure across different devices as people are migrating their viewing to other devices. I think that\u2019s critical for the health of the medium and to maximize value to the advertisers. That is a challenge right now. Television measurement is pretty much restricted to the linear TV stream and DVR playback that isn\u2019t commercially-skipped. Tablets are not being measured, computer viewing is not being measured \u2014 it\u2019s being measured as a separate entity. As people are migrating to these different platforms, we need a holistic measurement system that can capture it all. That\u2019s an important objective for us and for the industry.\n\nBut Nielsen and comScore are in a heated battle to deliver just that.\n\nWe\u2019ll see. We have this highly fragmented TV marketplace and we\u2019re still relying on about 20,000 homes to measure it. As we now get involved in more complex measurement on a lot of these devices, I think that\u2019s more of a challenge. The industry is hopeful but at the same time I think there is concern that the current methodology is somewhat challenged to measure this complex environment.\n\nHow healthy will the upfront market look this year?\n\nThe upfront market is a very hard one to estimate because it\u2019s basically a futures market. We look at the total market. I think you\u2019re going to see some growth, but it\u2019s going to be relatively moderate, low single digit, and somewhat consistent with GDP growth. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be falling off of a cliff, but we\u2019re probably looking at a relatively moderate growth in television demand.\n\nAnything else interesting?\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019re probably at a point where at least the four major networks in primetime are at relatively equal delivery levels, give or take a couple of percent points. In the past there\u2019s been a much wider spread between the strongest delivery network and the weakest one.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "GroupM\u2019s Rino Scanzoni: Here\u2019s What Media Buyers Cared About This Upfront", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/05/19/rino-scanzoni-upfronts/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CV974_rinosc_G_20140519143257.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "GroupM\u2019s Rino Scanzoni: Here\u2019s What Media Buyers Cared About This Upfront", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Steven Perlberg", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-05-19T19:09:04-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/05/19/rino-scanzoni-upfronts/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-598", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/05/19/rino-scanzoni-upfronts/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CV974_rinosc_G_20140519143257.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article", "title": "GroupM\u2019s Rino Scanzoni: Here\u2019s What Media Buyers Cared About This Upfront"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-598", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-19T19:09:04-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce88e\"", "article_summary": "GroupM, citing data from RECMA, says it accounts for 25% of the U.S. TV market.\nAs we now get involved in more complex measurement on a lot of these devices, I think that\u2019s more of a challenge.\nI think that\u2019s critical for the health of the medium and to maximize value to the advertisers.\nThat\u2019s kind of an interesting development.\nNow, with talk that C7 might supplant C3, CMO Today asked Mr. Scanzoni for his thoughts on this year\u2019s upfront."}
