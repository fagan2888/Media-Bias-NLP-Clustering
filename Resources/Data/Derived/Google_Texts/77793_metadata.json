And then we wrap them up individually for them,\u201d she added.\n\nHiba Abu-Haltam, one of the board members of the project, said, \u201cIt\u2019s really fun, we always get together and just make food together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever I go there, like this morning I went and they wrote me a thank you letter and it was really nice,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to the same source, Muslim students in the United States often mobilize in different ways to address the needs of the poor or to simply to raise awareness about Islam.\n\nMuslim students believe it is not necessary to take drastic measures to affect change.\n\nHowever, only with good will and solidarity can Muslims show the true image of their religion and act in accordance with the teachings of Islam.\n\nIn accordance with the Islamic teachings, Muslims should engage in generous acts of charity and care for the needy: \u201cWe feed you for the sake of God alone, no reward do we seek, nor thanks.\u201d (Holy Qur\u2019an, 76:9).\n\nCreated in 2006, Project Downtown was launched to combat the rising rates of homelessness in the US.\n\nEdited by Timothy Filla\n\nJoin the Conversation.
