Fearful of the answers, Europeans are doing what they seem to do best, which is dithering. It can\u2019t hold much longer as deadlines approach.\n\nHere is my list of questions:\n\n\u2022 Can Athens, Brussels, and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt\u2014and the Merkel government, to get straight to the point\u2014reach a deal that allows Greece to pay its debts (some far-off day) and return to economic health?\n\n\u2022 Will any such deal require a significant rethink of repayment terms as they now stand? If so, how significant will \u201csignificant\u201d turn out to be?\n\n\u2022 Absent any such agreement, is Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone inevitable even if few are yet prepared to say so? Is Grexit, indeed, shaping up as desirable?\n\n\u2022 Finally, the big one, the one we should all think about: Is the European Union capable of accommodating an alternative economic model, one at variance with the prevailing neoliberalism, among its members?\n\nRelated: Greece Quells Default Fears, Pledges to Meet \u2018All Obligations\u2019\n\nWe can look at these one at a time, but here\u2019s my executive summary: Things have gone badly\u2014or nowhere, maybe\u2014since Alexis Tsipras and Syriza, his vigorously anti-austerity party, formed a government in January. In consequence, it\u2019ll be best for all concerned if Greece bails out of the eurozone.\n\nDon\u2019t dare call this pessimism. Better to look for the optimism buried within the apparent pessimism, and there is some.\n\nLast Thursday, after ransacking its cupboard, Athens made a scheduled payment of $476 million, to the International Monetary Fund. The bond markets exhaled deeply; yields on 10-year notes tumbled 18 basis points.\n\nBut this still prices 10-year Greek debt at 11.03 percent, and Athens has bought very little time: It faces a total of $22.5 billion in payments this year. The numbers make the point: The status quo is not tenable no matter how you slice the souvlaki. Leave things as they are and you have a nation of 11 million no-hopers.\n\nQuestion 1: Yes, the E.U. and Athens can reach a deal, if only in theory. But this isn\u2019t a technocratic question. It\u2019s a political question and has been from the first.\n\nRelated: German Economy Minister Not Clear How To Keep Helping Greece\n\nUnable to bend even a tick in Greece\u2019s direction in recognition of the economic and social calamity current bailout terms have created, European ministers have taken to calling for Tsipras to ditch his left wing and form a centrist government\u2014roughly along the lines, let\u2019s say, of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s in Italy.\n\nThis sort of intervention is unseemly, reflecting far worse on the E.U. than on Tsipras and the many hues of red and pink in his party. In effect, Europe is saying it accepts democratic process among member states only when it finds the result agreeable. Preposterous.\n\nQuestion 2: Yes, getting Greece back on its feet within the eurozone requires a very big rethink, and it\u2019s no good shoving the entire obligation on the Greeks. At this point Brussels and Frankfurt must acknowledge error and alter course, too. For the 55th time, this is a European crisis, not Greece\u2019s crisis alone.\n\nLast week, none other than Reza Moghadam, formerly head of the IMF\u2019s European department and now a vice-chairman at Morgan Stanley, suggested a way to make this possible. Strip back \u201cconditionality\u201d to a few essential reforms, he wrote in an opinion-page essay for the Financial Times, refinance debt due immediately until summer\u2019s end, and negotiate a restructuring of the rest in the interim.\n\nRelated: Greece Needs Deal on with Lenders on April 24\n\nGiven the E.U. prefers to dither rather than accept even this, the conversation has to take a new turn.\n\nQuestion 3: No, a Greek exit from the eurozone isn\u2019t inevitable, but\u2014and this is a first for this column\u2014it shapes up as desirable.\n\nVal\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, one of the euro\u2019s architects, made this argument months ago. \u201cThe fundamental question is whether or not the Greek economy can recover and prosper with a currency as strong as the euro,\" the former French president said in a February interview with Les Echos, the Paris business daily. \u201cThe answer is clearly negative. Greece needs to be able to devalue its currency.\u201d\n\nGiscard called for \u201ca friendly exit,\u201d leaving the door open to a reentry under more propitious circumstances at some future date. \u201cIt would be absurd to say this is a failure of Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cGreece still has its place in the European Union.\u201d\n\nGiscard\u2019s opinion rests on Greek competitiveness. Mine\u2019s more purely political. If the E.U. requires the Tsipras government either to accept punishing bailout terms or to remain answerable to his electorate, he must choose the latter\u2014for the sake of Greeks and the rest of Europe, as well.\n\nRelated: Greece Tells Creditors It Will Run Out of Cash on April 9\n\nA European project that, stripped bare, operates in opposition to democratic values is of no use to anybody. And given the current climate on Europe\u2019s southern rim, it doesn\u2019t have a prayer in the long term. Herein lies my optimism: Better to shut this down, if it comes to it, and preserve Europe\u2019s democratic tradition: It\u2019s simply nonnegotiable.\n\nQuestion 4: Sometimes a philosophic inquiry bears very practical consequences, and this is one of them. At this point, the E.U. proves unable to accept a member state\u2019s alternative to the neoliberal orthodoxy entrenched among the technocrats and politicians in Brussels and Germany.\n\nCredit to Martin Sandbu, the FT\u2019s Free Lunch columnist, for marinating the question last week. As he points out, Tsipras has so far operated on the \u201cyes\u201d side: Yes, we can serve Greeks a m\u00e9lange of Keynesian stimulus and left social democracy and remain in the eurozone.\n\nJames K. Galbraith, the U.T. Austin professor and a close friend of Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, wants to think the \u201cpragmatic interventions\u201d of Chancellor Merkel \u2014 \u201csomeone for whom I don\u2019t ordinarily offer a great deal of effusive praise\u201d\u2014 signal an imminent turn in European thinking.\n\nWell, Tsipras has so far broken his pick in his talks with the Europeans. They\u2019ve gone nowhere, even as Greece teeters. And to Galbraith I offer that famous last line in Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises: \u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty to think so?\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Slower than a roller coaster but faster than a glacier, Europe advances toward a denou", "title": "Why Greece Should Consider a Eurozone \u2018Grexit\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/13/Why-Greece-Should-Consider-Eurozone-Grexit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10112011_Greece_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/13/Why-Greece-Should-Consider-Eurozone-Grexit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10112011_Greece_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Slower than a roller coaster but faster than a glacier, Europe advances toward a denou", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca327\"", "article_summary": "In consequence, it\u2019ll be best for all concerned if Greece bails out of the eurozone.\nQuestion 2: Yes, getting Greece back on its feet within the eurozone requires a very big rethink, and it\u2019s no good shoving the entire obligation on the Greeks.\n\u2022 Absent any such agreement, is Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone inevitable even if few are yet prepared to say so?\nQuestion 3: No, a Greek exit from the eurozone isn\u2019t inevitable, but\u2014and this is a first for this column\u2014it shapes up as desirable.\nRelated: Greece Needs Deal on with Lenders on April 24Given the E.U."}
