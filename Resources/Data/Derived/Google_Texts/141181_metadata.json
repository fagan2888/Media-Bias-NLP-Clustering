While some of the plans on the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange have the potential to reimburse fairly well, it seems likely that reimbursement rates in general are going to decrease.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got to be really good at squeezing every bit of waste and excess cost from the system that we can,\u201d said Brannman.\n\n\u201cAll hospitals are looking at lower reimbursement and we\u2019re looking at costs increasing, and that\u2019s for the insured,\u201d said Alan Olive, CEO, Northern Nevada Medical Center (NNMC). \u201cSo what we have to do then as a provider whether it be a hospital, a physician, a clinic, a health plan, we have ownership in the lowest cost, the highest quality and the highest patient experience.\u201d\n\nOlive suggests hospitals learn to work together rather than as competitors, working collaboratively to find things they can do to reduce costs and address care models in their communities.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) didn\u2019t take anybody by surprise. Hospital administrators have had time to plan. Renown Regional Medical Center CEO Greg Boyer said the hospital has been taking a triple aim, trying to reduce costs, improve patient experience and improve the health of the population as the changes in healthcare come into play.\n\nThough it may not have been a surprise, ACA did do away with some healthcare offerings. A program for indigent patients through Clark County Social Services disappeared overnight, said Lawrence Barnard, CEO, University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC), and that program paid 30 percent above Medicaid.\n\nWhile it may be too early to understand how the ACA will effect hospitals and healthcare providers, hospitals are preparing for the influx of patients who will now have health insurance and access to care. Saint Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center and Medical Group staff in Reno are working with Access to Healthcare, a non-profit network that helps those at federal poverty level find and manage healthcare.\n\n\u201cOne of the difficulties for patients that have not had insurance before and are accessing healthcare for the first time is just navigating through it,\u201d said Helen Lindholm, CEO, Saint Mary\u2019s.\n\nPreparation includes growing the primary care network rapidly, expanding facilities for primary care outpatient throughout the Truckee Meadows to meet the needs of the population, said Lindholm. Saint Mary\u2019s is looking to venture into obstetrical clinics targeting women who are just gaining access to Medicaid.\n\nOne of the problems mandatory healthcare coverage has created is that many people who received Medicaid insurance under the plan are accessing emergency rooms for primary care needs, said Olive. \u201cSo what that\u2019s done is increased utilization of emergency rooms across the state, which is inappropriate and the highest cost model you can use.\u201d\n\nSince 80 percent of healthcare needs can be met outside the hospital, NNMC will focus on extending its outpatient presence. The second part of the solution is a model of integrated healthcare where the hospital system purchases a health plan.\n\nCentennial Hills Hospital in Southern Nevada is expanding their women\u2019s services including labor and delivery suites and a neonatal intensive care unit, in response to community needs.\n\nIn Southern Nevada there\u2019s not much focus on expansion as hospital growth out-paced the population during the economic downturn when residents didn\u2019t always end up populating new developments. \u201cIn some areas of the county, you\u2019ve got more beds than patients,\u201d Brannman said. In other areas hospitals have become victims of their own success: emergency rooms are overflowing and there aren\u2019t enough beds. So St. Rose Hospitals have an active expansion underway in Henderson, doubling the size of the ER and adding some 110 beds.\n\nAt Southern Hills Hospital and Medical Center administration identified a community need for mental health services. After determining that the demographic needing the services were at retirement age, the hospital created a geriatric program that includes NICHE certification \u2013 the Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders program.\n\nNew and Improved\n\nGroundbreaking new technology arrives daily, but do hospitals need all of it? Everybody wants a robot because advertising is driving up consumer demand, Brannman indicated, but that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone needs one.\n\n\u201cRobotics certainly has a lot of potential for the future, but currently it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d said Brannman. \u201cA lot of folks have invested in it because they don\u2019t want to be the only hospital or system that doesn\u2019t have a robot.\u201d Eventually he expects demand will grow, but in the meantime hospitals have laid out a great deal of money and may only be using robots for a dozen cases.\n\nWith a lot of new technology, hospital administrators are waiting to see how applicable it is. \u201cThe technology is changing so quickly the prudent CEO will weigh the benefits and costs of the new technology with the improved care and safety,\u201d said Kimball Anderson, CEO, Southern Hills Hospital.\n\nHow the technology is used is also important \u2013 Southern Hills\u2019 new 64 slice CT scanner is going into the emergency room so there\u2019s no need to take emergency patients back to an imaging department.\n\nRenown administrators take into account the costs of new technology for the nonprofit hospital. While the hospital has surgical robots, its not trading in its 64 slice CT scanner for a 128 slice scanner to gain two seconds of time. \u201cYou have to spend your money wisely,\u201d said Boyer.\n\nToday\u2019s imaging technologies allow doctors to avoid many exploratory surgeries. Doctors at Centennial Hills can access imaging devices right in OR during spine surgery, and have access to some of the most technologically advanced imaging equipment, said Sajit Pullarkat, CEO/managing director, Centennial Hills Hospital, Valley Health System.\n\nPrime Healthcare Services, which owns Saint Mary\u2019s, invested $50 million in new technology over the last few years. \u201cWe are well ahead of the curve, not just for our region, but nationally,\u201d said Lindholm.\n\nNNMC\u2019s TeleStroke program, allows rural physicians access to on-call neurologists when dealing with stroke patients. The neurologist reviews patient data remotely. E-visits allow patients to use technology similar to Skype \u2013 \u201cSkype on steroids,\u201d said Lindholm \u2013 for virtual doctor\u2019s appointments without traveling to the office when sick.\n\nUMC is a safety net hospital, so while there\u2019s always cutting edge technology that could be had, it\u2019s more important to hire the right physicians and staff. \u201cAt the end of the day, a hospital is just a building,\u201d said Barnard. \u201cWe can pick up trauma and take it off campus, if trauma were to be destroyed. It\u2019s about the people, not the technology,\u201d he added.\n\nWhatever other changes hospital administrators are dealing with, electronic healthcare records are giving them the most headaches. ACA made participation mandatory and hospitals are scrambling to comply.\n\nIdeally patients fill out paperwork one time and healthcare providers share. But federal privacy laws mean each provider uses a portal to transmit information, an awkward system that is particularly difficult for small rural hospitals that don\u2019t have huge IT staffs, according to Joan Hall, president, Nevada Rural Hospital Partners.\n\nOn the Wish List\n\nNew technology and healthcare coverage aside, on the wish list of every administrator is a healthy population.\n\n\u201cWe know for a fact that we will have more patients that are insured and have some kind of healthcare coverage,\u201d said Lindholm.\n\nThat\u2019s a plus. The goal is to have a healthy population. With well care and coordinated healthcare, the hope is patients will go to the hospital only in the event of catastrophic illness.\n\nWhich actually leads to a slightly different consideration: that patients accessing hospitals in the future may be much sicker than those entering hospitals now. Healthcare is evolving from hospital-based services to same-day, minimally invasive surgical procedures in outpatient facilities. That may mean patients won\u2019t be still convalescing in hospital on day eight after laparoscopic gall bladder removal. It also means those patients who need to be inpatients are a lot sicker. So while the change has led to more hospitals creating or acquiring outpatient procedure units, it means \u201cthe intensity has increased, and you have to figure out how to optimize your facilities for that,\u201d Brannman said.\n\nHospital administrators are also working to reduce re-admissions by providing a continuum of care so the patient is discharged and goes on working with sub-acute care facilities and outpatient services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added an outpatient therapy center that\u2019s located in the medical office building right next to the hospital, and that provides physical, occupational, speech and pulmonary therapy to the community extension of the healthcare continuum,\u201d said Pullarkat.\n\nBoyer compared today\u2019s healthcare environment to the HMO days. \u201cBut what\u2019s different now is there\u2019s a quality component and financial motivation to get there, so we\u2019re adjusting our care from episodic care to management care of patients on a preventative basis. I think the hospitals of the future will have a lot of preventative programs to manage chronic conditions and to keep people healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can get people to start focusing on their own health, it will help healthcare in the city overall,\u201d said Barnard. \u201cIt\u2019s changing that mentality of people coming into this hospital only when they need to, at the point of dire sickness and dire health, and some of that is avoidable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital administrators are working very closely with purchasers of care and insurance carriers, to needs while striving to be competitive with costs.", "og": {"site_name": "Nevada Business Magazine", "description": "Hospital administrators are working very closely with purchasers of care and insurance carriers, to needs while striving to be competitive with costs.", "title": "Hospitals in Nevada: An Industry in Transition", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 619, "identifier": "https://www.nevadabusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/07-14-bn-619x263.jpg", "height": 263}, "updated_time": "2014-06-30T14:18:45-07:00", "url": "https://www.nevadabusiness.com/2014/07/hospitals-nevada-industry-transition/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "NC_os-83w0gjbGT2Fm1x_1aQGclHifhqFIwd_sxky1A", "article": {"section": "Building Nevada", "tag": "Valley Health System", "published_time": "2014-07-01T00:14:48-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-30T14:18:45-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With a lot of new technology, hospital administrators are waiting to see how applicable it is.\nPrime Healthcare Services, which owns Saint Mary\u2019s, invested $50 million in new technology over the last few years.\nSome things that don\u2019t change in healthcare: the importance of patient outcome, patient experience, patient compliance and patient ability to pay for services.\nAt Southern Hills Hospital and Medical Center administration identified a community need for mental health services.\nOn the Wish ListNew technology and healthcare coverage aside, on the wish list of every administrator is a healthy population."}
