Lt. Lakesha Burton with JSO said PAL's goal is for women officers to encourage the young girls to love who they are and fulfill their dreams.\n\n\"Tonight is about uniqueness, because we know that 99.9 percent of all of us have the same DNA,\" Burton said. \"0.1 percent that's unique. So we're just going to tap into that and get these young girls to know what's unique about them.\"\n\nPAL said young girls are becoming increasingly involved in criminal activities. The event was designed to help girls appreciate their differences and tackle life's challenges.\n\nCopyright 2015 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/12/11/PAL%20slumber%20party_1449894259683_1234291_ver1.0_160_90.png", "sailthru.author": "News4Jax.com Staff", "description": "WJXT Positively Jax", "author": "News4Jax.com Staff", "og": {"site_name": "WJXT", "description": "WJXT Positively Jax", "title": "Police Athletic League hosts all girl slumber party", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/positively-jax/police-athletic-league-hosts-all-girl-slumber-party", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/12/11/PAL%20slumber%20party_1449894259683_1234291_ver1.0_1280_720.png", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WJXT Positively Jax", "title": "Police Athletic League hosts all girl slumber party", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/positively-jax/police-athletic-league-hosts-all-girl-slumber-party", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/12/11/PAL%20slumber%20party_1449894259683_1234291_ver1.0_1280_720.png", "height": 720}, "site": "@wjxt4", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-12T04:26:06+0000", "sailthru.title": "Police Athletic League hosts all girl slumber party", "keywords": "Positively Jax,Community", "fb": {"app_id": 196517170397638}, "sailthru.tags": "Positively Jax,Community", "article": {"section": "Positively Jax", "published_time": "2015-12-12T04:26:06+0000", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T04:26:06+0000", "author": "http://www.news4jax.com/author/news4jax.comstaff"}, "page-type": "article", "content_id": 167341650, "sailthru.description": "WJXT Positively Jax", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/12/11/PAL%20slumber%20party_1449894259683_1234291_ver1.0_1280_720.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "News Story Template - DO NOT PUBLSH"}, "article_summary": "PAL hosts first all girl slumber party - Women with the Police Athletic League hosted its first all girl slumber party, designed to help local girls bond with female police officers.\nThe All Girl Overnight Slumber Party started at 6 p.m. Friday and ends 9 a.m. Saturday.\nThe event was designed to help girls appreciate their differences and tackle life's challenges.\nSo we're just going to tap into that and get these young girls to know what's unique about them.\"\nPAL said young girls are becoming increasingly involved in criminal activities."}
