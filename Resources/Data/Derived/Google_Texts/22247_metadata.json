Fellow receiver Demarcus Robinson threw a key block down the field that allowed Callaway to score.\n\nThe Gators (4-0, 2-0 SEC) started celebrating wildly. The Volunteers (2-2, 0-1) were stunned.\n\nStill, Tennessee had one final chance. Josh Dobbs, who led the Vols in passing, rushing and receiving, moved them into field-goal range.
