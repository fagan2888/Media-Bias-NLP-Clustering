Ed Krayewski reported last week on some bull-goose loony fall-of-civilization style violent rioting on the part of French cabbies mad that someone dare try to outcompete them in the field of driving for hire, in this case a new Uber service called UberPOP.

The heads of the American companyâ€™s European and French operations were being held in custody last night by traffic police. The timing of the arrests will be interpreted as an attempt to appease registered taxi drivers who overturned and burned Uber cars and blocked airports and railway stations during a strike on Thursday. The arrested men, both French, were named as Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, director general of Uber in Europe, and Thibaud Simphal, director-general of Uber in France
