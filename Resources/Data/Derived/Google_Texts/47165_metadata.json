They are also practicing Mennonite Christians who seek to \u201cintegrate their faith into their daily lives, including into their work.\u201d For them, paying for abortifacient coverage for their employees would be a violation of their deeply held beliefs about the sanctity of life. Tomorrow, the Obama administration will argue in front of the Supreme Court of the United States that they should have to do so anyway.\n\nThe government\u2019s position is that the Hahns do not have the right to run their company in accordance with their values and convictions. It says there is a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d to ensure all women have access to contraception, and it apparently can think of no less burdensome way of accomplishing that end than by stepping in to dictate the terms of contract between a family of religious business owners and the women they employ.\n\nAccording to SCOTUSblog\u2019s Lyle Denniston, this creates \u201ca direct conflict between the interests of some employers against those of their female workers of child-bearing age.\u201d Yet it\u2019s in the interests of everyone -- no less women than anybody else -- that people not be forced by the strong arm of the law to take actions that violate their consciences.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Catholic contraception controversy.]\n\nThe polling bears that out: A December 2013 survey from CBS News and the New York Times found just 37 percent of Americans saying all employers should be required to cover the full cost of birth control for their female employees. A 55-percent majority disagreed, saying employers should be able to opt out based on religious or moral objections.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "home/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Don't Sacrifice the First Amendment for Obamacare's Birth Control Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Sacrificing the First Amendment to ensure access to contraceptives is a bad deal.", "title": "Too Steep a Price", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/stephanie-slade/2014/03/24/dont-sacrifice-the-first-amendment-for-obamacares-birth-control-mandate", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/dc/1f/1c76b46146978ca25f7680c2fda8/140224-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Sacrificing the First Amendment to ensure access to contraceptives is a bad deal.", "card": "summary", "title": "Don't Sacrifice the First Amendment for Obamacare's Birth Control Mandate"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "date_published": "March 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Stephanie Slade,abortion,health care reform,politics,contraception,birth control,women's health,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Sacrificing the First Amendment to ensure access to contraceptives is a bad deal."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd172\"", "article_summary": "A 55-percent majority disagreed, saying employers should be able to opt out based on religious or moral objections.\nThe Hahns are the owners of a cabinet manufacturing company called Conestoga Wood.\nThe polling bears that out: A December 2013 survey from CBS News and the New York Times found just 37 percent of Americans saying all employers should be required to cover the full cost of birth control for their female employees.\nThe government\u2019s position is that the Hahns do not have the right to run their company in accordance with their values and convictions.\nTomorrow, the Obama administration will argue in front of the Supreme Court of the United States that they should have to do so anyway."}
