Bush\u2019s administration mid-way into his second term.\n\nLazear presents these reforms as an alternative to Obamacare, pointing to the recent findings in the Congressional Budget Office report showing that employment will drop by 2.5 million full-time workers because of the disincentives created by health insurance subsidies in the law. He explains that the 2007 reforms would have made healthcare more cost-effective and efficient. What\u2019s more, it would have made health insurance more accessible to Americans who couldn\u2019t afford coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Bush 2007 plan achieves these goals,\u201d Lazear wrote. \u201cThe basic structure is to offer all Americans a standard tax deduction, in 2007 set at $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals. The deduction would apply to payroll tax \u2014 both employee and employer contribution \u2014 as well as to income tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, the size of the deduction would be independent of the amount spent on the plan. Any taxpayer who has a plan that includes catastrophic coverage gets the full deduction, irrespective of the plan\u2019s cost,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is important because it creates the incentives to choose efficiently.\n\nLazear explains that the problem with the current system is that it\u2019s tied to employment. Instead, he argues, that offering tax credits to individuals would create \u201cappropriate incentives to shop around.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther features of the Bush proposal,\u201d Lazear notes, \u201cinclude allowing the purchase of plans across state lines to enhance competition and reform of medical liability to reduce the amount of defensive medicine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily all that should be included in a healthcare reform proposal, but it\u2019s a solid proposal and a helluva lot better than Obamacare. Similar policy ideas have been proposed by Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) and, separately, the Republican Study Committee Obamacare alternative.\n\nBut Lazear\u2019s column begs this question: Why didn\u2019t the Bush administration make healthcare reform a priority sooner than 2007?\n\nThink about it, folks. Democrats had just routed Republicans and won control of both chambers of Congress and President Bush\u2019s approval rating was stuck somewhere between 30% and 40%, both of which were largely because the United States was mired in an unpopular and unnecessary war in Iraq.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, President Bush had the opportunity to address healthcare reform in 2003, before his political capital had withered to the point at which it was virtually nonexistent.\n\nInstead of pushing healthcare alternatives that would have expanded coverage and shifted coverage away from employment, the administration instead expanded Medicare, adding hundreds of billions to budget deficits over the next decade to an already broken entitlement program.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the administration did win some noble healthcare reforms in otherwise fiscally irresponsible Medicare expansion bill, mostly related to expanded health savings accounts (HSA). But those reforms could have been passed on their own or as a part of a comprehensive healthcare reform bill that empowered Americans and delinked health insurance from employment.\n\nInstead, President Bush expanded one broken entitlement while paving the path for another: Obamacare. By the time his healthcare reforms were presented to the public, he was too politically damaged to enact any significant domestic policy without congressional Democrats signing off on it.\n\nNone of this is to disparage the healthcare reforms offered by the Bush administration as described by Lazear, because they\u2019re worthy of discussion. It\u2019s just that this op-ed is a reminder, whether Bush-era Republicans realize it or not, of one of the biggest domestic policy failures of his presidency.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "alternatives,Democrats,Edward Lazear,employer-based health insurance,employers,George W.
