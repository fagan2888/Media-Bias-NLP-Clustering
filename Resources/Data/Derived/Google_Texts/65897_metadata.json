The deal is expected to close, assuming regulators approve, no sooner than year\u2019s end.\n\nLovelace CEO Ron Stern said in an interview Monday that Lovelace Health Plan became too small to survive when it lost its bid earlier this year to provide managed care to Medicaid recipients through the state\u2019s new Centennial Care program, which commences Jan. 1. Lovelace stood to lose 84,000 Medicaid managed care members, leaving it with just its 108,000 insured members in its commercial and Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nLovelace sold its Medicaid business to Molina Healthcare of New Mexico in August.\n\nStern said Lovelace will focus on and reinvest in its \u201ccore business\u201d of hospitals, pharmacies and clinics.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico CEO Kurt Shipley said customers, including Medicare Advantage plan customers, who own a Lovelace insurance policy at the time of the sale will receive the same benefits at the same price for the remaining term of the policy once the sale is completed.\n\nMedicare Advantage customers are in the middle of their enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. Shipley said Medicare beneficiaries who already have selected Lovelace insurance will receive the same coverage and premium in 2014 from BCBSNM.\n\nThe companies also entered into what Stern described as a \u201cvery, very long term\u201d provider agreement that will allow Blue Cross and Blue Shield members to use Lovelace hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.\n\nThe deal also heals last year\u2019s spectacular falling out between Lovelace and ABQ Health Partners when the companies couldn\u2019t reach a new provider agreement. Thousands of Lovelace members had to choose whether to keep their Lovelace insurance or leave Lovelace in order to keep their ABQ HP medical care providers.\n\nLovelace Health Plan does not include ABQ HP in its network, but the practice\u2019s physicians and other staff still work in Lovelace Health System hospitals, and ABQ HP accepts Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance. Lovelace members when they become Blue Cross and Blue Shield members will be able to use ABQ HP providers, Shipley said.\n\nLovelace had been rumored to be negotiating a new provider agreement with ABQ HP for several months. Stern would not confirm the rumor, but he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a warming relationship with ABQ Health Partners. Their physicians continue to work in our hospitals. We value the quality of their care.\u201d\n\nStern said about 300 people work for Lovelace Health Plan, and the company \u201cis going to work extremely hard\u201d to place those who want them into jobs at BCBSNM and in the Lovelace Health System. Those who cannot be placed will receive \u201cappropriate severance packages.\u201d\n\nBCBSNM has been on a hiring binge to meet Centennial Care requirements. Shipley said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of those jobs have been filled. He said BCBSNM has hired 300 to 400 new employees recently.\n\nShipley said the Lovelace transaction will increase BCBSNM membership from 400,000 covered lives to about 500,000. With Centennial Care enrollment under way, Shipley estimated the company will have 550,000 members in the coming year.\n\nPresbyterian Health Plan has about 270,000 commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and other members, according to its latest filing with the Office of the Insurance Superintendent.\n\nAbout 70 percent of BCBSNM members live outside of the Albuquerque area. Shipley said the deal will significantly increase the company\u2019s presence in the state\u2019s largest metropolitan area. \u201cWe would always have loved to have a bigger presence in Albuquerque,\u201d Shipley said.\n\nLovelace began offering insurance through a health maintenance organization it formed in 1973, when Lovelace was still a physician-owned multi-specialty medical practice.\n\nArdent Health Services, a Nashville-based hospital company, bought Lovelace in 2002 and along with it the Lovelace insurance operation. At that time the insurance plan had 167,700 commercial, Medicare and Medicaid members.\n\nShipley said the companies have worked together for years, but they began discussing ways they could help each other during last year\u2019s ABQ Health Partners flap.\n\nStern said the rapidly change health care environment, including changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act, will force many health plans to face the decision Lovelace faced.\n\n\u201cA health plan of modest size over time will be challenged in product development, sophistication, technology, the ability to hire talent and in their ability to take their business relationships with hospitals and doctors into the future,\u201d Stern said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Companies planning afternoon news conference to announce more details of the deal", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Winthrop Quigley | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/299027/blue-cross-blue-shield-of-nm-buying-lovelace-health-plan.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/abluecross.jpeg", "type": "website", "description": "Companies planning afternoon news conference to announce more details of the deal", "title": "Updated: Blue Cross Blue Shield of NM buying Lovelace Health Plan"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lovelace Health Plan does not include ABQ HP in its network, but the practice\u2019s physicians and other staff still work in Lovelace Health System hospitals, and ABQ HP accepts Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance.\nLovelace members when they become Blue Cross and Blue Shield members will be able to use ABQ HP providers, Shipley said.\n.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Lovelace Health System has agreed to sell its insurance operation \u2014 with 108,000 members \u2014 to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico for an undisclosed price.\nWe value the quality of their care.\u201dStern said about 300 people work for Lovelace Health Plan, and the company \u201cis going to work extremely hard\u201d to place those who want them into jobs at BCBSNM and in the Lovelace Health System.\nArdent Health Services, a Nashville-based hospital company, bought Lovelace in 2002 and along with it the Lovelace insurance operation."}
