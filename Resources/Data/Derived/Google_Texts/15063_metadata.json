PAUL \u2013 After a controversial no-call in his semifinal match, Joey Majerus tried to find the will to move one with the wrestleback portion of the individual state tournament.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy process for the Zumbrota-Mazeppa junior, who escaped further damage in the consolation semifinals with a 7-5, triple-overtime victory over Osakis\u2019 Trenton Coyer. And even after clinching third place for the third time in his career (2011, 2012, 2014), Majerus left the mat with nary a smile. His signature on the 113-pound, Class A scoring sheet was his last act before heading into an offseason that will once again be aimed at being one-match better.\n\n\u201cHe showed a lot of character, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll talk to him about once I\u2019m alone with him,\u201d said Z-M head coach Link Steffen. \u201cI told him, when he lost that semifinal match, sometimes champions are defined in the face of defeat. And how do you respond to that? Joey obviously did very well today. He won two matches after a very tough call, and he beat two very tough kids \u2026 Joey really stepped up to the plate when a lot of guys would cash it in.\u201d\n\nIn the final match of his junior season, Majerus took control early, taking a 4-1 lead after the first period. With an 8-3 lead after two, it was mostly a matter of not getting caught by an aggressive Esteban Teigen. And with the exception of a late reversal, the Spectrum sophomore had little luck against the cautious, yet aggressive Cougar.\n\n\u201cWe knew the kid wrestled in spurts, an explosive-style wrestler where he can score four, five, six points in a matter of five, 10 seconds,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cJoey was able to slow that down and weather the storm. He had four of five of those bursts throughout the match, but Joey\u2019s experience and good technique, he came out of it and never gave up.\u201d\n\nThe draw of a state tournament is something a wrestler can do nothing about. Lake City junior Shane Siewert had that reminded to him a couple of times over the weekend.\n\nSiewert ended up taking fifth place in the 152-pound Class A bracket, with losses coming to top-ranked Logan Peterson of Atwater-Cosmos-Grove City in the quarterfinals, and second-ranked Paden Moore of Jackson County Central in the third-place match.\n\nDespite the result, Siewert is keeping in mind that the finish is an improvement on his fifth-place showing in 2013. And facing the top two wrestlers in his class has given the junior Tiger something to aim for over the summer.\n\n\u201cFirst would have been nice as the overall goal, but it\u2019s improved from last year. So that\u2019s getting better. We\u2019ll set the goal high for next year,\u201d Siewert said.\n\nAnd to achieve that goal, Siewert said he has to work harder between his ears.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few little moves that can help you, but mostly it will just be mental, knowing that you just have to keep going if you want to be better,\u201d Siewert said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,wrestling,Zumbrota,Mazeppa,Lake City Tigers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kyle Stevens", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "ST.
