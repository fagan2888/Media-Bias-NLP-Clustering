They are a real boon to efforts to implement the law, which means they\u2019re a target for Republican efforts to derail Obamacare and create more problems for the administration.\n\nTo wit, Dylan Scott reports for Talking Points Memo, Senate Republicans are using the lack of a federal background check for navigators\u2014the groups themselves are responsible for vetting their employees\u2014to attack the entire program as a vector for felons, identity thieves, and other criminals. \u201cAmericans who\u2019ve lost their insurance and find themselves forced onto the exchanges\u2014the last thing they need is to worry about some felon stealing their identity,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticizing the community groups that have stepped in to help confused consumers. Likewise, here is Texas Senator John Cornyn:\n\n\u201cIt is simply astounding that the administration is urging the American people to give their Social Security numbers and sensitive personal information to people who have not been properly vetted,\u201d Cornyn said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe need to also dismantle the navigators program before it unleashes a wave of fraud and corruption.\n\nFor my part, I\u2019m both astounded by GOP efforts to smear groups like the United Way, and unsurprised. If Republicans have shown anything over the last four years, it\u2019s that they\u2019ll do anything to stop the Affordable Care Act, even if it amounts to legislative sabotage.\n\nIndeed, what\u2019s frustrating about the current conversation over Obamacare is the extent to which there\u2019s been collective amnesia regarding the GOP\u2019s categorical opposition to the law. Pundits who see the problems with Healthcare.gov as an indictment of \u201cbig government liberalism\u201d\u2014or, as Ross Douthat put it, evidence of \u201cThe welfare state\u2019s ability to defend itself against reform\u201d\u2014neglect to grapple with the concrete consequences of the GOP\u2019s monomaniacal crusade against the Affordable Care Act. How would the status quo look if Republican states embraced the Medicaid expansion and worked to build their own exchanges (see the success in Kentucky, for instance)? What if, instead of casting endless repeal votes, GOP lawmakers worked with Democrats to fix problems in the law? And what does the political situation look like in a world where Republicans don\u2019t attack the Affordable Care Act as a step on the road to serfdom?\n\nIn this alternate world where conservatives care about governing, Obamacare has its issues, but\u2014with working state exchanges and a full Medicaid expansion\u2014it\u2019s more stable and popular than it is now. Or, put another way, the problems with the law are far more a function of politics than \u201cliberalism\u201d or any other ideological concern.\n\nNone of this is to say Republicans should support the law like Democrats. But disagreement doesn\u2019t require the quasi-massive resistance of the last few years. It was\u2014and is\u2014possible for Republicans to oppose key parts of the law, and work for reforms that move the ideological needle in their direction. For instance, in Arkansas, Republicans (led by a Democratic governor) are using funds from the Medicaid expansion to extend subsidies to lower-income residents, so that they can purchase insurance on the exchanges. Yes, the state is unwilling to expand a government program, but it will do more to subsidize private health insurance.\n\nIn other words, there's nothing that substantively precludes other Republican states from using the law\u2019s flexibility to pursue their own ends. If conservatives could let go of their Obama hatred and partisan pique, they might see the real opportunities that exist for center-right health reform. Of course, given the last two months of political drama\u2013including the month-long game of chicken over defunding the Affordable Care Act\u2014I'm not about to hold my breath.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201311181710, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Before we blame the problems with HealthCare.gov on \u2018big government\u2019 or \u2018liberalism,\u2019 we should remember that the Affordable Care Act needed GOP cooperation to succeed.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Without Massive Republican Opposition, Obamacare Would Be in Better Shape", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Without Massive Republican Opposition, Obamacare Would Be in Better Shape\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/18/without-massive-republican-opposition-obamacare-would-be-in-better-shape.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/18/without-massive-republican-opposition-obamacare-would-be-in-better-shape/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46160723.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/18/without-massive-republican-opposition-obamacare-would-be-in-better-shape\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-18T17:10:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-18T17:10:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/18/without-massive-republican-opposition-obamacare-would-be-in-better-shape", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Before we blame the problems with HealthCare.gov on \u2018big government\u2019 or \u2018liberalism,\u2019 we should remember that the Affordable Care Act needed GOP cooperation to succeed.", "title": "Without Massive Republican Opposition, Obamacare Would Be in Better Shape", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/18/without-massive-republican-opposition-obamacare-would-be-in-better-shape.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/18/without-massive-republican-opposition-obamacare-would-be-in-better-shape/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1384821707770.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc651\"", "article_summary": "Of course, given the last two months of political drama\u2013including the month-long game of chicken over defunding the Affordable Care Act\u2014I'm not about to hold my breath.\nCollective AmnesiaBefore we blame the problems with HealthCare.gov on \u2018big government\u2019 or \u2018liberalism,\u2019 we should remember that the Affordable Care Act needed GOP cooperation to succeed.\nIn other words, there's nothing that substantively precludes other Republican states from using the law\u2019s flexibility to pursue their own ends.\nTo help people sign up for coverage, the Affordable Care Act provides federal dollars for \u201cnavigators,\u201d community-based groups that help individuals enroll in the exchanges.\nAnd what does the political situation look like in a world where Republicans don\u2019t attack the Affordable Care Act as a step on the road to serfdom?"}
