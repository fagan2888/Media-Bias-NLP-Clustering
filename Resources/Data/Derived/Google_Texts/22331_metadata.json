Roger Wicker. | AP Photo Congress Senate GOP polling shows upside to SCOTUS blockade\n\nSenate GOP leaders are making the case to their members this week that their decision to ignore President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee is not just a principled stance, but a politically beneficial one, too.\n\nMajority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), according to GOP sources, is quietly circulating a four-page memo throughout the Senate Republican Conference on the public\u2019s views on filling the high court\u2019s vacancy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe memo, obtained by POLITICO, makes the case that a majority of voters would prefer to keep deceased Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat empty \u2014 for a year or even longer \u2014 rather than allow Obama to nominate a liberal justice that would move the court to the left.\n\n\u201cThe survey found almost unanimous awareness of the death of Justice Scalia, strong support for originalist intent in interpreting the Constitution, and concern over President Obama appointing a liberal justice who would tip the ideological balance of the court,\u201d Republican pollster Greg Strimple wrote in the memo.\n\nStrimple found that 54 percent of those surveyed were more concerned about a liberal justice being chosen to replace Scalia, compare to the nearly 41 percent of respondents who were more worried about the seat being open for a year or more.\n\nNot surprisingly, Republicans were much more concerned about the potential shift in ideological balance. But Strimple\u2019s findings showed that 53 percent of independents said a liberal justice was the bigger concern, compared to 41 percent who said a prolonged vacancy was the larger issue.\n\nA majority of those surveyed \u2014 54 percent \u2014 said they believed Obama would nominate a liberal justice and that his pick would tip the balance of the Supreme Court. And nearly 56 percent said justices should follow the original intent of the Constitution, in the mold of Scalia.\n\n\"Our findings show that a majority of U.S. voters share the concerns of the GOP in regard to tipping the ideological balance of the Court and the need for the next Justice to strictly interpret the Constitution,\" the memo reads.\n\nThe poll surveyed 600 likely voters between Feb. 27 and Feb. 29.\n\nBut Republicans have also faced statistics that show the public has largely aligned against them with their decision to block Obama\u2019s future nominee. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 55 percent of voters disapprove of the GOP strategy, though whether the public agreed or not fell largely along party lines.\n\nAnd a poll by the firm Public Policy Polling commissioned by the liberal group Americans United for Change found that 56 percent of voters preferred Obama make the Supreme Court appointment, while 40 percent said it should remain empty.\n\nSenate Republicans have been aggressively pushing a confirmation blockade, even as Democrats continue to hammer away at the GOP for refusing to even give Obama\u2019s not-yet-named nominee a hearing.\n\n\u201cIt's absolutely clear to me that Senate Republicans stand firmly behind the idea that the people should have a say in this critical issue \u2026 when they vote in November because there is a lot at stake here,\u201d Cornyn said in a floor speech this week. \u201cA lot.\u201d\n\nCornyn, like the vast majority of his 54-member conference, has been adamant that Scalia not be replaced until a new president has been elected. But he\u2019s been taking hits from Democrats, particularly after this week when Cornyn warned that any Supreme Court nominee is likely to become a political \u201cpi\u00f1ata.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s comparing a Supreme Court nominee to a children\u2019s party favor that gets smashed repeatedly with a baseball bat,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) complained Wednesday. \u201cThat is nothing more than a thinly-veiled threat from Senator Cornyn, serving notice of a coming assault on the President\u2019s nominee.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a business meeting later Thursday to discuss lower court nominations, but the Supreme Court vacancy controversy is also expected to be a big issue .", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The memo makes the case that a majority of voters would prefer to keep deceased Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat empty.", "title": "Senate GOP polling shows upside to SCOTUS blockade", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/senate-supreme-court-scalia-220552", "image": "http://static.politico.com/7e/ef/a19ff6174f368ae82ff16047b5bb/20160309-mcconnell-cornyn-1-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The memo makes the case that a majority of voters would prefer to keep deceased Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat empty.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo Congress Senate GOP polling shows upside to SCOTUS blockadeSenate GOP leaders are making the case to their members this week that their decision to ignore President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee is not just a principled stance, but a politically beneficial one, too.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, center, speaks to reporters as he is joined by, from right to left, Majority Whip John Cornyn, Sen.
