But guess who\u2019s the big loser on Obamacare.\n\nIn Texas, insurers lost a combined $377 million in the first year of HealthCare.gov, according to claims in a federal risk-sharing program. In California, insurers contributed over $180 million in profit to the same program.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days for the Affordable Care Act, and about two-thirds of insurers lost money in 2014.\n\nCalifornia is an outlier, generating half the total profits nationwide. But Texas is an outlier, too, just in the other direction. And the divergence is no accident, because the nation\u2019s two biggest states took much different approaches.\n\nWhile Texas leaders fought Obamacare and railed against it at every turn, the Golden State embraced the law and created its own exchange, Covered California.\n\nIt opted to become an \u201cactive purchaser,\u201d negotiating with carriers, standardizing benefits and picking plans for the exchange. California also required policyholders to move into the new marketplace even though many resisted.\n\nWhen HealthCare.gov had its disastrous kickoff two years ago, President Barack Obama said people could keep their existing plans rather than buy new ones on the exchange. That affected insurers, because it didn\u2019t force everyone \u2014 healthy and sick \u2014 into the same pool.\n\nConsumers facing expensive claims could sign up for plans with better benefits and bigger networks. If they were healthy, they could stay with their skinny plan and pay less. In 35 states, including Texas, many re-upped before the end of 2013 to take advantage.\n\nCalifornia rejected Obama\u2019s proposal and took some heat. But that \u201cshort-term political sacrifice\u201d produced long-term market stability, researchers for Covered California wrote in the Health Affairs blog.\n\nThat decision helped create a more diverse mix of customers. And \u201cCalifornia had the healthiest risk pool of all 50 states,\u201d an actuary for Blue Shield of California told the Los Angeles Times this month.\n\nLoss claims top profits\n\nThe California Blue contributed $107 million into the temporary risk corridors program. That program collects insurer profits above a certain threshold and pays out to carriers with excessive losses.\n\nFor 2014, loss claims topped profits by $2.5 billion, and Texas insurers accounted for 15 percent of them. Consumers may not shed any tears for money-losing insurance companies, but it\u2019s one sign the market is shaky.\n\nAnd you know what comes next. For 2016, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the state\u2019s largest insurer, dropped its individual PPO and offered only a more limited HMO \u2014 with premiums rising an average of 19 percent.\n\nScott & White increased exchange premiums by over 32 percent. Humana\u2019s up 21 percent, and Cigna and UnitedHealth, over 16 percent.\n\nHigher rates affect about 1 million Texans who buy coverage on HealthCare.gov and also increase federal subsidies that offset the costs.\n\nIn California, exchange premiums are increasing by a weighted average of 4 percent next year. California has also been a leader in reducing the uninsured, extending coverage to many more people than Texas.\n\nSeveral key trends improved in California in 2015, researchers wrote, indicating the exchange \u201chas enrolled enough people, and enough healthy people, to stabilize premiums.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding Texas\n\nIn Texas, many factors led to insurance losses. Start with pent-up demand after millions of residents went without insurance for years \u2014 or with plans so skimpy they didn\u2019t dare go to the doctor.\n\nOnce they got affordable coverage in 2014, many flocked to providers for everything from routine physicals to costly knee replacements, dialysis and transplants.\n\nTexas politicians didn\u2019t help the situation. They put up hurdles for federal navigators who helped customers select plans, and they\u2019ve never encouraged enrollment. Not surprisingly, fewer Texans get coverage on the exchange: just 31 percent of those eligible compared with 47 percent in California, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIf Texas matched the participation rate in California, over half a million more residents would buy insurance. That wouldn\u2019t fix everything, but it would be a start.\n\n\u201cThe problem has been getting healthy people in,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, project director for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.\n\nIn Texas, insurers are raising premiums, restricting prescriptions, narrowing provider networks and eliminating most out-of-network benefits. Will that lead to a sustainable market?\n\nThe parent company of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas is projected to be profitable again in 2016, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services. Yet the ratings agency still has a negative outlook on the company.\n\nTwo risk-protection programs, including risk corridors, expire after 2016. That implies the industry will have reached a steady state with Obamacare, but the results tell another story.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is increasingly likely that it will take more than three years for the market to stabilize,\u201d S&P wrote.\n\nUnlike California, Texas won\u2019t be ahead of the curve.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@MitchSchnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Texas, insurers lost $377 million in the first year, while in California they contributed over $180 million in profit.", "og": {"description": "In Texas, insurers lost $377 million in the first year, while in California they contributed over $180 million in profit.", "title": "Schnurman: Texas loses on Obamacare while California embraces it", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151225-schnurman-texas-loses-on-obamacare-while-california-embraces-it.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-obamains.ece/BINARY/original/obamains", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-12-26T04:44:35Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-12-26T01:49:06Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Schnurman: Texas loses on Obamacare while California embraces it\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151225-schnurman-texas-loses-on-obamacare-while-california-embraces-it.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-obamains.ece/BINARY/original/obamains\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2591589\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-26T01:49:06Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-obamains.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/obamains", "publishtime": "2015-12-26T01:49:06Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "In California, exchange premiums are increasing by a weighted average of 4 percent next year.\nUnlike California, Texas won\u2019t be ahead of the curve.\nFor 2014, loss claims topped profits by $2.5 billion, and Texas insurers accounted for 15 percent of them.\nIn Texas, insurers lost a combined $377 million in the first year of HealthCare.gov, according to claims in a federal risk-sharing program.\nWhile Texas leaders fought Obamacare and railed against it at every turn, the Golden State embraced the law and created its own exchange, Covered California."}
