His 3-pointer at the top of the key tied the game at 70 with 57 seconds left.\n\nAfter McCarron hit 1-of-2 free throws to give Metro State a one-point lead, White pulled up just inside the arc and hit the bottom of the net to put the Mountain Lions back in front.\n\n\u201cThose are the kind of shots All-Americans make,\u201d Clark said.\n\nBut the last shot went to Rayer. And it brought a league title.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Metro State\u2019s Eric Rayer makes shot that beats CU-Colorado Springs", "title": "Metro State\u2019s Eric Rayer makes shot that beats CU-Colorado Springs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/metro-states-eric-rayer-makes-shot-that-beats-cu-colorado-springs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228__Eric-Rayerp1.jpg", "height": 538}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150228__Eric-Rayerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T21:30:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T23:34:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe carried us all night,\u201d Metro State coach Derrick Clark said of Kay.\nMetro State guard Eric Rayer, a former Coronado High School standout, buried a game-winning jumper with 1.2 seconds left to give the No.\nThe victory also gives Metro State (24-4, 19-3) the No.\nLeave it to a kid from Colorado Springs to put the dagger into the hearts of that town\u2019s rising basketball team.\n18 Colorado-Colorado Springs and a share of the Rocky Mountain Conference Athletic title."}
