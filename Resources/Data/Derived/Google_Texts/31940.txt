The 2016 Presidential campaign is getting interesting as more candidates announce their running (and no, we’re not talking about Waka Flocka). The most recent Republican candidate announcement came from Detroit-native Ben Carson this past Monday (May 4).

The extra-blunt orator made a grand entry into the race with his official announcement being accompanied by a gospel choir singing a soulful medley and Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.” The retired neurosurgeon is certain that he’s what America needs to get up and hit the ground running again. Carson—who prides himself on not being a politician—may have an upper hand over his competition which includes (second-timers) Rick Santorum and Rick Perry and Ran Paul.

“I’m probably never going to be politically correct because I’m not a politician,” Carson said to a crowd of estimated thousands. “I don’t want to be a politician. Because politicians do what is politically expedient — I want to do what’s right.” This same straightforwardness and unfiltered opinion, however, is also a double-edged sword. While many may love and respect honesty from a politician, it also can hinder him from moving forward in the race and teetering the line of being a liability to the GOP.

Even a few conservative Republicans found his comparisons of Obamacare and slavery and the United States to Nazi Germany a little too much. However, the GOP knew to get the minority vote they’ll have to do something drastic and a Black non-politician may be drastic enough.

We’re curious to see how this race shapes out, but more importantly, if Carson will be taking his choir on his state-to-state tour with him.
