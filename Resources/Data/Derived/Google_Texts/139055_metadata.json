Harry Reid did the dirty work.\n\nReid, the Senate Democratic leader who announced his retirement Friday, cut the back-room deals and shoved Obama\u2019s legislation through the chamber\u2019s parliamentary thicket. With biting sarcasm and a former boxer\u2019s love for the fight, Reid protected Obama\u2019s legislative accomplishments from Republicans.\n\nThe main initiatives of Obama\u2019s first term -- the 2009 economic stimulus, Obamacare and regulation of the financial industry -- all bear Reid\u2019s stamp and were the product of his willingness to charge ahead with little or no Republican support.\n\nReid\u2019s decision to change the Senate\u2019s rules in 2013 filled the federal courts with Obama nominees who hold lifetime appointments and signaled the transformation of the Senate from clubby to combative.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been one of my best partners and best friends,\u201d Obama said on a radio show on KNPR in Nevada with Reid on Friday. \u201cHarry is unique. He\u2019s got that curmudgeonly charm that is hard to replace. I\u2019m going to miss him.\u201d\n\nReid, a thin 75-year-old prone to mumbling and whispering, often stands slightly hunched when he speaks. He\u2019s the rare politician who doesn\u2019t try to appear more physically imposing than he is.\n\nHe announced his retirement after health scares both for himself and his wife, Landra. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. He injured himself Jan. 1 in an exercise accident.\n\nRelative Anonymity\n\nReid worked in relative anonymity outside of Washington and his native Nevada. In a Gallup poll last year, a third of Americans either hadn\u2019t heard of him or had no opinion about him. Reid rarely appeared on cable television or Sunday morning talk shows.\n\nInstead, Reid worked from inside the Capitol, at his apartment in the Ritz-Carlton in Washington and at Democratic fund-raising events across the country, knitting his caucus together and advancing his home-state political machine.\n\nReid grew up poor near Nevada\u2019s rural southern tip, in a small town called Searchlight about 60 miles from Las Vegas that he mentioned often during his Senate speeches. His early work in the Capitol was as a police officer, and he used the money to put himself through law school.\n\nHe was Nevada\u2019s lieutenant governor and then chairman of its gaming commission. Reid returned to Washington after he won a U.S. House seat in 1982 and ascended to the Senate in the 1986 election.\n\nHe spent much of his Senate career as a moderate Democrat from a state that voted for Republican presidential candidates in 1988, 2000 and 2004. Earlier in his career, Reid opposed abortion and voted to define marriage as between a man and a woman.\n\nDemocratic Base\n\nReid took over the Democratic leadership in 2005 -- he moved up when Tom Daschle lost re-election -- and was rarely out of step with the party\u2019s base.\n\nIn 2010, he helped lead the effort to repeal the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d rule for gay members of the military. Just this month, he delayed an anti-human-trafficking measure with broad support because it contains limits on abortion funding.\n\nReid\u2019s policy legacy includes blocking use of a site at Yucca Mountain in his home state as a nuclear waste repository.\n\nReid became majority leader in January 2007, after Democrats capitalized on President George W. Bush\u2019s declining popularity to retake the Senate. That promotion made him the most powerful Mormon in the country\u2019s history.\n\nControlling Agenda\n\nIn the Senate, the majority leader controls the agenda, deciding which legislation will come to a vote and what amendments will be allowed. Reid used that power extensively, stopping Republicans from offering alternatives or forcing votes that could embarrass Democrats.\n\nThe result was often gridlock. Republicans increasingly blocked legislation, taking advantage of rules requiring Democrats to amass 60 votes out of 100 to advance legislation.\n\nEach side blamed the other for the escalation.\n\nReid will be remembered as one of the toughest leaders in Senate history, says Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University in Washington.\n\n\u201cFor legislative process geeks like me, Reid may be best remembered as someone who really clamped down on the minority, unparalleled in blocking amendments and limiting debate,\u201d Huder said.\n\nIn 2009, Democrats expanded their majority, first to 58 votes and then to the magic threshold of 60 when Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania switched parties and Al Franken won after a long vote count in Minnesota.\n\nObamacare Vote\n\nThat cushion allowed Reid to push Obamacare through the Senate without a single Republican vote -- which he did on Christmas Eve 2009 after weeks of negotiations with recalcitrant Democrats including Nebraska\u2019s Ben Nelson.\n\nThen, what looked like a setback -- a Republican victory in a Massachusetts special election -- just gave Reid an opening for more procedural gamesmanship.\n\nIn March 2010, Senate Democrats infuriated Republicans by passing the final part of Obama\u2019s health-care law with a budget procedure called reconciliation that required a simple majority vote.\n\nThat 2009-2010 era was the \u201cmost important period of progressive legislating\u201d since the 1960s, John Kerry, who was a Massachusetts senator in that period, said in a statement Friday.\n\n\u201cNone of what he has accomplished was easy or preordained,\u201d said Kerry, now secretary of state. \u201cBut again and again, in his own unique way, without flash or puffery, Harry just went out and found the strategy and the votes -- even when everyone said it couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nReid Attacks\n\nReid\u2019s unique way, as Kerry called it, meant that he often put his foot in his mouth.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, Reid contended that an anonymous investor in Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s company had told him that Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for 10 years. While Romney insisted it was untrue and also released some of his tax returns, Reid didn\u2019t back down. He never produced information to back up his claim.\n\nIn 2005, Reid apologized after telling high school students in Las Vegas that President George W. Bush was \u201ca loser.\u201d That year he described Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, as \u201cone of the biggest political hacks we have in Washington.\u201d\n\nOnce Republicans took over the House of Representatives in January 2011, Reid\u2019s role changed.\n\nStopping Republicans\n\nHe stopped Republicans from making almost any changes to Obamacare or the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. He won a few concessions, including the January 2013 law that led to tax increases for individuals earning more than $400,000 a year and married couples making more than $450,000.\n\nHis most lasting change to the Senate as an institution is the one that infuriated Republicans the most.\n\nAfter years of Republican delays in confirming Obama\u2019s executive-branch and judicial nominees, Reid in November 2013 decided to drop the 60-vote threshold for confirming most of those nominees. That action was labeled the \u201cnuclear option\u201d because of the partisan discord it was expected to create.\n\nMitch McConnell, the Republican leader, had said that if Reid went through with threats to change the rule, he would \u201cbe remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, of Kentucky, said in a statement Friday that Reid was often underestimated.\n\n\u201cHis distinctive grit and determined focus nevertheless saw him through many challenges,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThey continue to make him a formidable opponent today.\u201d\n\nSarah Binder, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says Reid\u2019s tough battles demonstrated two key talents.\n\n\u201cHe knew how to build sturdy coalitions from within his caucus, and he never lost sight of his party\u2019s policy goals,\u201d she said. \u201cNo box canyons for Harry Reid.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Reid, was, obamas, muscle", "pubdate": "2015-03-27T17:42:30", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Barack Obama gave the speeches and set the Democratic Party's direction.
