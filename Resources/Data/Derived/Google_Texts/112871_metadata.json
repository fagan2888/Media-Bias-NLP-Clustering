During the annual Easter Egg Roll celebration at the White House on Monday, President Barack Obama watched helplessly as a gaggle of children were mercilessly attacked by a swarm of bees.\n\nI kid. The \u201cattack\u201d seemed harmless enough, and the high-strung children in attendance were likely fine. They were, however, clearly nervous about the prospect of being shot through with paralyzing amounts of bee venom.\n\n\u201cOh no, it\u2019s a bee. That\u2019s OK, guys. Bees are good, they won\u2019t land on you. They won\u2019t sting you, they\u2019ll be OK,\u201d Obama joked amid the terrified screams of the assembled children.\n\n\u201cHold on! Hold on! You guys are wild things!\u201d the president added in reference to the book he was reading to the children. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be scared of bees when you\u2019re a wild thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe South Lawn features its own beehive, and the White House uses honey from it in the kitchen, including in its Honey Porter and Honey Ale beers,\u201d http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/obama-bee-attack-easter-children-screaming-116704.htmlreported.\n\nIf even one child had succumbed to a bee sting as a result of allergies, the White House would probably have been compelled to revisit the wisdom of keeping an apiary on the grounds. Fortunately for craft brew enthusiasts across the country, it seems like all the kids made it off the South Lawn alive.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Ignore Obama\u2019s protests.", "title": "Watch: Children scream in terror amid bee attack at White House", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/06/watch-children-scream-in-terror-amid-bee-attack-at-white-house/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-07T02:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T20:14:35+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, easter egg roll,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d54\"", "article_summary": "They won\u2019t sting you, they\u2019ll be OK,\u201d Obama joked amid the terrified screams of the assembled children.\nWatch: Children scream in terror amid bee attack at White Houseposted at 10:01 pm on April 6, 2015 by Noah RothmanA bit of a palate cleanser for the end of the day.\nDuring the annual Easter Egg Roll celebration at the White House on Monday, President Barack Obama watched helplessly as a gaggle of children were mercilessly attacked by a swarm of bees.\nIf even one child had succumbed to a bee sting as a result of allergies, the White House would probably have been compelled to revisit the wisdom of keeping an apiary on the grounds.\nYou guys are wild things!\u201d the president added in reference to the book he was reading to the children."}
