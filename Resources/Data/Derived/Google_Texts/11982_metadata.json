Twenty percent of medical professionals interviewed found themselves questioning their own professional competence, while 15 percent admitted to feeling anger toward their team as a whole. For 80 percent of those interviewed, the error remains fixed in their memories.\n\nWhile most of those surveyed reported the error caused them to increase vigilance while caring for patients, the study also found more than half of the medical professionals tried to minimize the error during interviews.\n\nThis echoes warnings about the repercussions of a \"toxic culture of perfection\" among medical professionals that encourages them to conceal errors, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nA 2013 study indicates that medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States, making it more pressing than ever for the medical community to address the impact and prevention of such mistakes.\n\nLaurent suggested that the solution starts at the top, telling MedicalResearch.com that creating a supportive workplace goes a long way toward encouraging medical professionals to admit errors and learn from them.\n\n\"The seniors and heads of departments have an important role to play in this climate of confidence because it is essential that the error be discussed without fear and without fear of judgment, a reprimand or professional disqualification,\" she said. \"An ICU culture that encourages caregivers to acknowledge and take responsibility for their errors empowers them in situations that can initially be perceived as hopeless and out of control.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPhysician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors high\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nCA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errors\n\n5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice risk\n\nBetter handoff communication reduces medical errors", "article_metadata": {"description": "While errors made by medical professionals are known to have a profound impact on patients, a new\u00a0study\u00a0finds that such missteps also are a major source of trauma for doctors and nurses.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "While errors made by medical professionals are known to have a profound impact on patients, a new\u00a0study\u00a0finds that such missteps also are a major source of trauma for doctors and nurses.", "title": "Medical errors traumatize doctors and nurses", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/medical-errors-traumatize-doctors-and-nurses/2014-11-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "culture of perfection,error reporting,intensive care units,medical errors,Patient Care & Outcomes,psychological trauma", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the study- read the articleRelated Articles:Physician \"culture of perfection\" keeps medical errors highHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.CA senator demands hospitals reduce rampant medical errors5 ways the ACA may affect malpractice riskBetter handoff communication reduces medical errors\nWhile errors made by medical professionals are known to have a profound impact on patients, a new study finds that such missteps also are a major source of trauma for doctors and nurses.\nThis echoes warnings about the repercussions of a \"toxic culture of perfection\" among medical professionals that encourages them to conceal errors, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nLaurent suggested that the solution starts at the top, telling MedicalResearch.com that creating a supportive workplace goes a long way toward encouraging medical professionals to admit errors and learn from them.\nTwenty percent of medical professionals interviewed found themselves questioning their own professional competence, while 15 percent admitted to feeling anger toward their team as a whole."}
