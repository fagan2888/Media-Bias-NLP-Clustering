Military support for President Obama is at its lowest point since he took office.

According to a new poll, since 2009, Obama has incurred a 57 percent drop in his approval rating by military personnel.

At the same time, Obama’s support among the civilian population is improving, as his overall approval rating jumped five points from last month to 47 percent, his highest such rate since June of last year.

The poll of military personnel, conducted by the Military Times between July 8 and Aug. 7, showed that Obama’s approval rating among men and women in uniform has dropped from 35 percent in 2009 to 15 percent today.

Meanwhile, 55 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Obama, up from 40 percent in the same time span.

Other data reveals that, in 2009, 91 percent of respondents believed that their quality of life was “good or excellent.”

That figure has shrunk to 56 percent in 2014.

The poll is based on responses of nearly 2,300 active-duty service members.

“When nearly every category surveyed reveals a significant dip from 2009 to today, we must all take notice and ask, why is morale so low and what can we do to fix it,” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told the Military Times after reviewing the numbers.
