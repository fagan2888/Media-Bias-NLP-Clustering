Could be that this is just standard partisan alarm-sounding after a supposed bellwether: Just as Karl Rove\u2019s warning Republicans not to get cocky and assume that ObamaCare alone will deliver the Senate on a silver platter, Matthews wants Dems to fear the reaper and go on offense over the minimum wage, voting rights, etc. Both are motivational tactics. Maybe we can settle this by turning to a dispassionate election observer, RCP\u2019s Sean Trende, who\u2019s been modeling this fall\u2019s Senate elections based on Obama\u2019s job approval and who thinks the GOP is overstating how important Jolly\u2019s win over Sink in FL-13 was.\n\nTrende\u2019s verdict: Yep, sure looks like the Senate is going, going, gone.\n\nRepublicans need six seats to claim a majority. Obama hasn\u2019t seen an approval rating north of 45 percent in RCP\u2019s average since early August of last year, before the Syria \u201cred line\u201d fiasco and the the Healthcare.gov meltdown. You do the math. Trende himself now gives Republicans somewhere in the ballpark of an 80-85 percent chance of capturing the seats they need to get to 51. Matthews isn\u2019t out on a limb here.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t answer Rove\u2019s strategic question. If ObamaCare is an advantage but not a decisive advantage for the GOP, what other issues should the party emphasize? Here\u2019s a clue from a new poll of Louisiana, where Mary Landrieu is rocking a 42/52 approval rating.\n\nOf course, Obama might take that issue out of Republicans\u2019 hands by approving the pipeline before November, but don\u2019t underestimate the ability of especially dumb liberals to tie his hands on it. There may not be enough of them willing to turn out to stop the GOP this fall, but there are certainly enough of them to make Obama\u2019s life difficult if he tacks too far towards the center to better position the party for the midterms. Thank heaven for small favors.\n\nExit question via WaPo: Democrats keep saying they want to \u201cfix\u201d ObamaCare. \u201cFix\u201d it how, exactly? What does that mean, beyond the standard blather of extending the enrollment deadline for another month or waiving the mandate penalty that\u2019s already effectively been waived? It\u2019s a meaningless soundbite designed to appease angry voters by suggesting that they\u2019re kinda sorta angry too. Let\u2019s hear some specifics.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cI think the Senate goes.\u201d", "title": "Chris Matthews: Let\u2019s face it, Democrats are going to lose the Senate", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/13/chris-matthews-lets-face-it-democrats-are-going-to-lose-the-senate/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/st.jpg", "height": 409}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-13T19:21:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-13T17:40:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "Chris Matthews, landrieu, lose, red state, scarborough, Senate,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1ea\"", "article_summary": "Trende\u2019s verdict: Yep, sure looks like the Senate is going, going, gone.\nIf ObamaCare is an advantage but not a decisive advantage for the GOP, what other issues should the party emphasize?\nIt\u2019s a meaningless soundbite designed to appease angry voters by suggesting that they\u2019re kinda sorta angry too.\nHere\u2019s a clue from a new poll of Louisiana, where Mary Landrieu is rocking a 42/52 approval rating.\nTrende himself now gives Republicans somewhere in the ballpark of an 80-85 percent chance of capturing the seats they need to get to 51."}
