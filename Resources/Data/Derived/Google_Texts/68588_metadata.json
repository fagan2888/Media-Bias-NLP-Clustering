The day is extra-special because Andi\u2019s mother Rose will be there.\n\nThe bride-to-be smiles during the event, which was held exactly a week before her wedding. \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to get involved in a cause or advocacy. This one is perfect for me because I really believe in it,\u2019 says 26-year-old Andi Manzano.\n\nSeveral months ago, this seemed hard to imagine for Andi and her four siblings, their father and especially Rose, who is not even 50 years old.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thought she was just going through menopause. She was moody and she was bleeding. This went on for two months until someone told my mom this wasn\u2019t normal. She was urged to have herself checked,\u201d says the 26-year-old Andi during the media event for \u201cX Means Love,\u201d which aims to increase awareness for cervical center.\n\n\n\nAndi describes as \u201cdevastating\u201d the next turn of events. Rose was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She tells her children, who cry for a while and decide to be their mother\u2019s support system.\n\n\n\nAndi, who lives on her own, assigned herself to be Rose\u2019s chauffeur every time the latter would need to go to UST hospital for her chemotherapy and radiation treatments. The radio DJ and TV/events host saw her mom in extreme pain and discomfort. Her heart broke every time Rose would lose strands of hair or run to the bathroom to throw up. Andi would drive from her home to Antipolo to fetch Rose, bring her mother to UST and ferry her home after the treatments. It wasn\u2019t easy. Andi refused to cry in front of her mom. She would put on a brave face and cry only when GP would take her into his arms.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mom is my best friend. I cannot imagine living without her. She knows everything about me,\u201d says the bubbly Andi, who many say is her mom\u2019s spitting image.\n\n\n\nLess than two months ago, Rose was declared cancer-free.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor six months, I couldn\u2019t even plan my own wedding. It was nerve-wracking and painful at the same time so when the doctor gave my mom a clean bill of health, we could only say \u2018Thank you, Lord,\u2019\u201d says Andi.\n\n\n\nCervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer after breast cancer among women worldwide with an estimated 529,409 new cases and 274,883 new deaths in 2008. In the Philippines, it ranks as the second most frequent cancer. It is estimated that every year, 4,544 Filipino women are diagnosed with cervical cancer with 1,856 dying from the disease.\n\n\n\nAndi has long wanted to be involved in a charity or advocacy. Thus, when she was approached by GlaxoSmithKline and Healthway Medical to be a part of \u201cX Means Love,\u201d the bride-to-be could only say, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\n\n\nSo who is susceptible to cervical cancer?\n\nAndi is teary-eyed as she talks about her mother\u2019s ordeal.\n\n\u201cIt is basically every woman,\u201d says GlaxoSmithKline product manager Kristel Guce. \u201cThe scary part about cervical cancer is that in the early stages, there are no symptoms. So having oneself checked via a pap smear is a must.\u201d\n\n\n\nAndi convinced her sisters and even her mom to get the HPV vaccine. Cervical cancer can be caused by the human papillomavirus. Genital HPV is a common highly-transmissible virus that is passed from one person to another through direct skin-to-skin contact during sexual activity. No penetration is required to transmit the virus so it can be passed on via girl-on-girl sex. Monogamy will not save a woman from contracting the virus.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as the woman is sexually active, she can be infected. The incidence of cervical cancer starts rising when a woman is 30 years old. It is highest in women ages 40-55. Most sexually active people will get HPV at some time in their lives, though most of them will never recognize it. About 80 percent of women will acquire an HPV infection in their lifetime,\u201d says Guce.\n\n\n\nAndi, as one of the campaign\u2019s brand ambassadors, urges women to get screening using a pap smear or HPV DNA test. More importantly, she says women should get the HPV vaccine. Females from nine years old are eligible for vaccination.\n\n\n\nGuce points out HPV vaccines have been proven safe and effective. It does not eliminate the need for screening later in life since HPV types other than 16 and 18 cause up to 30 percent of all cases of cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nAndi sees her wedding as a fresh start of sorts for her and her mom. She and her husband-to-be are very well-matched, despite the differences in their ages and lifestyles. Before she met GP, who would wake up at 1 p.m., Andi would go to bed early as she had to rise for work the next day. So what happened next? \u201cWe compromised,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI really wanted to pick someone more mature, someone who is driven to be my husband. I didn\u2019t want to be taking care of someone who was still dependent on his parents. I am very mature for my age, I think,\u201d she stresses.\n\n\n\nAndi and GP met on the social networking site Facebook. GP had a crush on Andi and he asked Luis Manzano, who is her cousin, to introduce them. What happened was that they became Facebook friends first before they actually met in person.\n\n\n\nAndi finds it endearing that GP asked her mom for her hand in marriage months before actually proposing to her at NAIA-3. Months before that, the couple had been to Paris and GP took Andi to the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a nervous wreck. I thought he was going to propose there. Every time he moved, I would look at him but the proposal didn\u2019t happen there. It happened at the airport while I was wearing shorts with my hair in a bun,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"default-url": "http://manilastandardtoday.com", "description": "When Andi Manzano walks down the aisle on Tuesday in a church in Baguio,  she will be marrying club and restaurant owner GP Reyes, the love of  her life.
