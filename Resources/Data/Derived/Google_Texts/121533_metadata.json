The clinic provides primary care services for adults and children.\n\nRiverfront Family Medicine will serve as a \u201cpatient-centered medical home\u201d for area residents, and those who work in the Renaissance Center and in downtown Detroit. Under the federal Affordable Care Act, health care costs are meant to be reduced by centering each patient\u2019s care with a primary care doctor who manages the patient\u2019s case and provides basic health services, like preventive care and annual physicals.\n\nHealth care services available by appointment at the new clinic include same-day sick visits; preventive health care; chronic disease management for conditions such as diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure; and flu shots and other immunizations.\n\nBeaumont Health System is part of Beaumont Health, formed earlier this year by Beaumont\u2019s merger with Oakwood Healthcare and Botsford Health Care. The new doctor\u2019s office offers Beaumont laboratory services for on-site blood draws; referrals to Beaumont specialists, as needed; and an electronic medical record linking all of a patient\u2019s care throughout the Beaumont health system.\n\n\u201cBy having a presence in the Renaissance Center, we can accommodate the needs of busy, working professionals, while providing convenient accessibility to Beaumont doctors and services,\u201d Dr. David Wood, chief medical officer for Beaumont Health, said in a press release.\n\nBeaumont representatives and downtown business leaders celebrated the center\u2019s opening Monday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Riverfront Family Medicine is located at 500 Renaissance Center, Suite R560, River East Center, Level 1. It is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nRiverfront Family Medicine is part of the Beaumont Medical Group, which employs about 600 primary care and specialty physicians in Southeast Michigan. The practice is headed by Andrew Kotsis, D.O., a board-certified family medicine physician whose areas of clinical interest include chronic and acute disease management and preventive medicine.\n\nTo make an appointment, call (313) 473-3800, or visit www.beaumont.edu/riverfront-family-medicine for more information. Free, validated parking is available for patients.\n\nKBouffard@detroitnews.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1tfpYvo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Beaumont Health System has opened a family practice clinic in downtown Detroit.", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Beaumont Health System has opened a family practice clinic in downtown Detroit.", "title": "Beaumont adds primary care office in downtown Detroit", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2014/11/24/beaumont-primary-care-office-downtown-detroit/70058078/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beaumont Health System has opened a family practice clinic in downtown Detroit.", "title": "Beaumont adds primary care office in downtown Detroit", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/karen.bouffard.56?fref=browse_search"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c57\"", "article_summary": "Beaumont Health System is part of Beaumont Health, formed earlier this year by Beaumont\u2019s merger with Oakwood Healthcare and Botsford Health Care.\nUnder the federal Affordable Care Act, health care costs are meant to be reduced by centering each patient\u2019s care with a primary care doctor who manages the patient\u2019s case and provides basic health services, like preventive care and annual physicals.\n\u2014 Beaumont Health System has opened a new family practice clinic in the Renaissance Center, increasing primary care options available in Detroit.\nThe clinic provides primary care services for adults and children.\nHealth care services available by appointment at the new clinic include same-day sick visits; preventive health care; chronic disease management for conditions such as diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure; and flu shots and other immunizations."}
