It\u2019s levied on equipment like artificial hearts and X-ray machines but not on items used by individuals, like eye glasses. Foes of its repeal say that this and other taxes the law imposed on the health care industry were outweighed by added customers the law has created, and that repealing it means paying that $24 billion, 10-year cost with bigger federal deficits.\n\nPresident Obama has threatened to veto the bill, which passed on a 280-140 vote. Reps. Eric Swalwell, D-Dublin; Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo; and Jerry McNerney, D-Stockton voted for it, while the rest of the Bay Area delegation was opposed.\n\n\u201cI support the Affordable Care Act and policies that improve our ability to conquer illnesses and diseases before they conquer us,\u201d Swalwell said in a statement emailed later Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s vote will help more start-up bio-innovation companies create devices that have the potential to make us healthier.\u201d\n\nMcNerney emailed a statement saying that \u201cmedical research and technology contribute significantly to California\u2019s economy with more than 75,000 jobs, and advancements in the field are resulting in new treatments and cures that improve the lives of people across the country.\n\n\u201cWe should be doing everything to encourage further innovation by removing unnecessary barriers that hinder new research and job growth \u2013 especially in California, the home to more medical device companies than any other state in the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, this law is not perfect and we should continue to look at ways to improve it. Doing so will not only benefit medical innovation, but lower costs and improve care for individuals and families as well.\u201d\n\nSpeier\u2019s office said she was on a plane Thursday afternoon and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Political Blotter", "description": "Three Bay Area House members were among the 46 Democrats who joined with Republicans on Thursday to approve repealing the medical-device tax enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.
