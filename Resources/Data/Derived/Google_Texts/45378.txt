Sioux Falls, SD

We introduced you to Casey Underberg last month in an EYE ON KELOLAND. The 34 year-old is suffering from Leber's Disease, a rare disease that causes blindness. Now he's loved ones are using a sport he loved to help raise money for his family.

The lanes were filled at Sport Bowl today for the fundraiser. Entry fee is $25 per person and includes 3 games. There was also a silent auction of donated items, with the proceeds going toward the Underberg family as they deal with rising medical costs, including a trip to Iowa City last month.

"Obviously it's very humbling to see the support from this event and events planned going forward that we've heard about and stuff. It makes you feel like part of your life was at least part effected people in a good way and it's a cool thing," Casey Underberg said.

The Sport Bowl alley was where Underberg loved to bowl.
