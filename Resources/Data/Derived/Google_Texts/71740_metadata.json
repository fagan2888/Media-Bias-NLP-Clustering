During that time, she allegedly smoked pot and had sex with a man in his truck which was parked alongside her vehicle on a rural road on the Grand Mesa, east of Grand Junction.\n\nWilliam died at the scene, and Tyler died a week later at Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver.\n\nThe boys\u2019 father had died in a car accident less than two months before the boys died.\n\nJensen was arrested in Florida and extradited to Mesa County where she has been jailed for more than a year. Jensen dabbed at tears after nearly 90 potential jurors were brought into the courtroom Tuesday.\n\nJury selection had been delayed after Jensen\u2019s attorneys complained that jurors would see her shackled to the defendant\u2019s table because she was wearing a skirt. The jury pool waited for nearly two hours until a pair of slacks was procured and Jensen changed clothes.\n\nHer trial is scheduled to last nine days.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf193\"", "article_summary": "William died at the scene, and Tyler died a week later at Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver.\nThe boys\u2019 father had died in a car accident less than two months before the boys died.\nJury selection had been delayed after Jensen\u2019s attorneys complained that jurors would see her shackled to the defendant\u2019s table because she was wearing a skirt.\nJury selection began Tuesday afternoon and will continue Wednesday in Mesa County District Court in the case of the Palisade mother whose children died of hyperthermia after she locked them in a heated car.\nJensen left 2-year-old William Jensen and 4-year-old Tyler Jensen in her car in November 2012 with the doors locked and the heater on for more than an hour."}
