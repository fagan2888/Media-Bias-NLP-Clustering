This task force helped assess current federal criminal laws and recommended improvements.\n\nThe House Judiciary moved faster than expected to get a criminal justice reform bill on the table, a piece that acts as a companion bill to legislation introduced Oct. 1 in the Senate.\n\nThe bill unveiled in the House is not a mirror image of the criminal justice reform proposal by the Senate Judiciary Committee (headed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa), but has similar items of action.\n\nAccording to Goodlatte, the House worked with the Senate to craft complementary criminal justice reform legislation.\n\n\u201cWe really are at a zenith of momentum for criminal justice reform,\u201d advocacy group U.S. Justice Action Network Executive Director Holly Harris stated. \u201cIn one remarkable week, leaders on both sides of the aisle in both chambers have presented significant sentencing reforms that can safely reduce the federal prison population and astronomical costs to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nHarris remarks in a press release that her organization is \u201cincreasingly hopeful\u201d that Congress will pass a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill this year.\n\nThe House Judiciary bill, among other points, will reduce a \u201cthree-strike\u201d drug offense mandatory life sentence down to 25 years and a \u201ctwo-strike\u201d mandatory sentence from 20 to 15 years. Drug sentences may be enhanced for offenders who have had prior serious violent felonies.\n\n\u201cChairman Goodlatte was one of the last defenders of our counterproductive mandatory sentencing laws, so we\u2019re glad to see him take this positive step toward reform,\u201d Molly Gill of nonprofit Families Against Mandatory Minimums said in a statement. \u201cWhile the bill introduced today improves upon the status quo, we\u2019re not convinced that it is the best the House can do.\u201d\n\nThe bill would retroactively apply to some current federal sentences. This may limit the scope of who seeks sentence adjustments, according to Gill. She claims, \u201cLimited retroactivity isn\u2019t fair or right.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte says he hopes the committee will quickly pass the bill \u201cand will roll out additional criminal justice reform bills over the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nOnce the bill gets passed through the Judiciary Committee, it can be voted on by the full House. If the House and Senate both agree on a bill, it will be sent to the president.\n\n\u201cIt is encouraging to see a bipartisan group of congressmen introduce a reform package so closely on the heels of the Senate doing the same thing,\u201d said John Malcolm, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s director of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. \u201cThe bill is designed to ensure that low-level drug offenders are given sentences that more accurately reflect the severity of the crimes they have committed while still ensuring that kingpins and violent drug dealers whose actions result in death or serious bodily injury are punished severely.\u201d\n\nAlong with Goodlatte and Conyers, representatives spearheading the bipartisan bill are Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas; Judy Chu, D-Calif.; Mike Bishop, R-Mich.; and Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho.\n\n\u201cWe have this rare coming together of bipartisanship,\u201d Conyers thanked his colleagues for their work.\n\nDuring the press conference on Thursday, Conyers stated his confidence that the criminal justice reform legislation will move through Congress.\n\n\u201cWe want to get it to the president\u2019s desk as soon as possible for his signature,\u201d Conyers said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reps.
