Without the right financial savvy, they're more likely to rack up debt, wreck their credit scores, and even go bankrupt in the most drastic cases.\n\nSerious money problems, whether created through carelessness or ignorance, could also prevent even qualified people from getting good jobs and buying decent homes.\n\nThis is why financial literacy, so critical to an informed, educated and economically thriving population, can and should start young. But who\u2019s going to teach our kids?\n\nRelated: How to Prep Kids for True Financial Independence\n\nMoney management is not taught in most public schools; neither are the basic rules of accounting and economics, in many cases, as students enter high school. Right now just 17 states require high students to take a personal finance course or to have personal finance instruction embedded in an economics or civics course as a graduation requirement, according to the Council of Economic Education (CEE). Only 6 states require students to be tested in personal finance before graduating, the Council found in its most recent Survey of the States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job of helping policymakers and educators ensure that students nearing adulthood gain [an] understanding\u201d of financial concepts, said CEE president Nan J. Morrison in a statement. More than 80 percent of teachers, however, don\u2019t feel qualified to instruct kids on personal finance though more than 90 percent agree the topic should be taught in school.\n\nIt\u2019s wise for parents or grandparents to introduce financial literacy concepts to children beginning at a young age \u2013 and to keep that going in very concrete ways through their school years.\n\nRelated: Why High Debt Could Mean Financial Stability\n\n\u201cResearch shows that waiting until high school to teach this topic may be a mistake,\u201d says Beth Kobliner, a member of the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans. \u201cMost children\u2019s money habits are already ingrained by age seven,\u201d she adds, citing a 2013 report from the University of Cambridge.\n\nBy age seven, most children \u201care capable of complex functions such as planning ahead, delaying a decision until later, and understanding that some choices are irreversible,\u201d the study found. But kids under the age of eight \u201chave not developed an understanding of the difference between \u2018luxuries\u2019 and \u2018necessities.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Kobliner shared a few key tips for parents and grandparents as they strive to teach even very young kids to be savvy about money:\n\n\u201cTeach toddlers to wait,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s for the swings or for the first day of school, waiting is the key for kids to learn how to delay gratification \u2013 the foundation of becoming a good saver\u201d down the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShow kids how to shop around. Elementary schoolers can learn how to compare prices online vs. at the store before they buy. Try it for school supplies or back-to-school clothes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cProtect yourself against identity theft. Warn teens to never share their Social Security number, bank password, or debit card PIN \u2013 not even with their friends. Otherwise, someone could steal the information and use it to open credit cards in their name.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKobliner says the mediocre performance of \u201cAmerican teenagers on the first international PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) test of financial literacy was a wake-up call. Of the 18 countries whose students participated, the U.S. ranked just below average on basic personal finance questions like comparing loan interest rates, evaluating a stock\u2019s performance, or even reading a pay stub.\u201d\n\nRelated: Buffett on the Biggest Money Mistake Parents Make\n\nThough it\u2019s \u201clong been taboo\u201d in American households to openly talk about money and financial issues, one-on-one conversations \u2013 and actions \u2013 that explain the nitty gritty are critical. \u201cWhen kids are very young, stress the virtues of waiting and delayed gratification, and as children get a bit older you can drive home the idea that spending less than you have is the linchpin of a healthy financial life,\u201d Kobliner, whose forthcoming book is Make Your Kid a Money Genius (Even If You're Not), wrote in The Wall Street Journal recently.\n\nResources abound for any parents or guardians who feel out of sorts about teaching financial concepts. One is the Money Savvy Generation website, begun by Susan Beacham, a former banker and mother of two who wanted to \u201cget out in front of money management behavior before bad habits set in.\u201d Her personal financial curriculum for kids is now being taught in districts across the country.\n\nAnother is the Money As You Grow website, which shares age-appropriate financial lessons. For even the most blas\u00e9 teenagers, for example, it breaks down compound interest, credit reporting, investing in a diverse mix of stocks, bonds and cash, and shopping for health insurance into understandable and actionable concepts.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kids who don\u2019t have a strong education in personal finance are at risk for making majo", "title": "Financial Lessons You Must Teach Your Kids", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/01/Financial-Lessons-You-Must-Teach-Your-Kids", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062010_money_counter_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/01/Financial-Lessons-You-Must-Teach-Your-Kids", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062010_money_counter_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kids who don\u2019t have a strong education in personal finance are at risk for making majo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23a9\"", "article_summary": "Related: Why High Debt Could Mean Financial Stability\u201cResearch shows that waiting until high school to teach this topic may be a mistake,\u201d says Beth Kobliner, a member of the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans.\nKids who don\u2019t have a strong education in personal finance are at risk for making major money mistakes later that could take them years to correct.\nAnother is the Money As You Grow website, which shares age-appropriate financial lessons.\nThis is why financial literacy, so critical to an informed, educated and economically thriving population, can and should start young.\nRelated: How to Prep Kids for True Financial IndependenceMoney management is not taught in most public schools; neither are the basic rules of accounting and economics, in many cases, as students enter high school."}
