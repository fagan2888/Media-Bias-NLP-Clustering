Drug addiction treatment has been shown to reduce associated health and social costs by far more than the cost of the treatment itself. Treatment is also much less expensive than its alternatives, such as incarcerating addicted persons. For example, the average cost for 1 full year of methadone maintenance treatment is approximately $4,700 per patient, whereas 1 full year of imprisonment costs approximately $24,000 per person.\n\nThe Obama administration requested $133 million in February to combat heroin and prescription medication overdoses in the U.S.\n\nAccording to The Hill, \"The new funds would expand access to treatment, build up the national system for monitoring prescriptions and better train emergency responders, administration officials added. The plan would also tighten prescription drug use under Medicare Part D, requiring 'high-risk beneficiaries' to get their medication only from specific providers and pharmacies.\"\n\nHowever, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Hysingla ER, which \"is up to 24 times more powerful than a single Vicodin\" in November 2014, noted the Los Angeles Times.\n\nSources: Centers for Disease Control, USA TODAY, The Huffington Post, National Institute on Drug Abuse, The Hill, Los Angeles Times\n\nImage Credit: CDC", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "More Americans die these days from drug overdoses than from automobile or firearm deaths.According to the Cent...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Drug Addiction Treatment Hard To Get, Overdose Deaths Soar", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/drug-addiction-treatment-hard-get-overdose-deaths-soar", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "More Americans die these days from drug overdoses than from automobile or firearm deaths.According to the Cent...", "title": "Drug Addiction Treatment Hard To Get, Overdose Deaths Soar"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-27T03:24:17+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2015-05-27T03:24:17+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 854961}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcab\"", "article_summary": "Drug addiction treatment has been shown to reduce associated health and social costs by far more than the cost of the treatment itself.\nThere is also an extreme disconnect between science and reality in America when it comes to drug addiction.\nUSA TODAY notes there are almost 44,000 deaths every year from drug overdoses in the U.S., and the \"death rate from drug overdoses more than doubled from 1999 to 2013, according to the CDC.\"\nWhile the beliefs of drug addiction are a fantasy for millions of Americans, the cost is real.\nMore Americans die these days from drug overdoses than from automobile or firearm deaths."}
