That\u2019s why, when it comes to the open enrollment period for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), women are the targets of outreach and advertising campaigns.\n\nConsumers have until Feb. 15 to sign up for health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. In order to have a plan that begins on Jan. 1, consumers should enroll by Dec. 15.\n\nDid You Know? ACA plans now cover: screenings for breast cancer risk; regular mammograms for women over 40\n\naccess to support and supplies for breastfeeding\n\ncounseling and screening for domestic violence\n\ntesting for STDs like HPV and gonorrhea\n\n\"Last year, we made incredible progress in enrolling Americans in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. But, tens of millions of Americans still stand to benefit from these new options,\u201d said Anne Filipic, President of Enroll America. \u201cOur goal is to reach as many consumers as possible with the information they need to get covered before the enrollment window closes on February 15.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study by Enroll America, a nonprofit focused on maximizing the number of Americans with health coverage, 71 percent of women said they do not know or are unsure whether in-person help is available for people who want to enroll. Seventy-seven percent of women said they do not know or are unsure about getting financial help to pay for health plans in the marketplace, and 79 percent of women said they don\u2019t know enough or are unsure about the new law in general.\n\nFind Out What Other Americans Think About the State of U.S. Healthcare \u00bb\n\nIf the intention of the ACA is access to cost-effective healthcare for the masses, women should be lining up. It turns out that women tend to pay more than their male counterparts for health coverage. A healthy 22-year-old woman could be charged 150 percent more for premiums than her male peer, according to a White House report. And because of the perceived or actual costs, many women report delaying necessary care.\n\nDebunking Myths About the ACA\n\nEnroll America is trying to break through those misconceptions and get women covered. The federal government is also behind getting more women enrolled. Healthcare packages through the ACA must cover preventative check-ups, maternity care, and well-child visits for children, the White House says. The law also keeps insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nOur goal is to reach as many consumers as possible with the information they need to get covered before the enrollment window closes on February 15. Anne Filipic, Enroll America\n\nBefore the ACA, women were charged higher premiums and could be denied coverage if they had a cesarean section, were diagnosed with breast cancer, or were victims of domestic violence or assault. Now, women no longer have to pay more for health coverage simply because of their gender.\n\nEnroll America conducted a study earlier this year of nearly 700 newly enrolled people. As it turns out, those who enrolled were 30 percent more likely to be informed about the ACA than those who didn\u2019t, and nearly three-quarters of the newly enrolled felt confident that they could afford coverage. The good news for those who still haven\u2019t enrolled \u2014 nearly 70 percent said that enrolling was \u201ceasy.\u201d\n\nDebunked: The 5 Biggest ACA Myths \u00bb\n\nBenefits for Women Under the ACA\n\nWhat are some of the benefits health insurance plans are required to offer under the ACA?\n\nScreenings and genetic test counseling for breast cancer risk, as well as mammograms every one to two years for women over older than 40.\n\nSupport and counseling for breastfeeding, as well as increased access to supplies.\n\nCounseling and screening for domestic violence.\n\nTesting for sexually transmitted infections, including HPV and gonorrhea.\n\nCost is often a reason Americans avoid the doctor, but the ACA also offers expanded options through Medicaid for low-income families. However, some U.S. states have opted not to expand their Medicaid enrollment, largely for political reasons.\n\nEnrollment numbers must go up in order for Americans to get the most out of the new law. Some 20 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 64 \u2014 about 19 million people \u2014 didn\u2019t have health coverage in 2011.\n\nTo get women covered, Enroll America is working with the nonprofit Ad Council to target women and help explain the benefits of the ACA. They offer online resources, including:\n\na calculator to help you figure out the cost of health coverage\n\ninformation about the different insurance plans available\n\ninformation about how to find in-person help with enrollment\n\nLearn More: How the ACA Works \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/women-make-80-percent-of-health-decisions-120314", "news_keywords": "health insurance, affordable care act, ACA, exchange, open enrollment, Enroll America, Ad Council, White House", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "For women, health insurance is a must, and plans on the ACA exchange websites offer many gender-specific benefits.", "title": "Women Make 80 Percent of Health Decisions, Are Targets of Open Enrollment", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/women-make-80-percent-of-health-decisions-120314", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/womanmedicalforms.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/womanmedicalforms.jpg", "description": "For women, health insurance is a must, and plans on the ACA exchange websites offer many gender-specific benefits.", "card": "summary", "title": "Women Make 80 Percent of Health Decisions, Are Targets of Open Enrollment"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-03", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For women, health insurance is a must, and plans on the ACA exchange websites offer many gender-specific benefits."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1581\"", "article_summary": "Consumers have until Feb. 15 to sign up for health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nThat\u2019s why, when it comes to the open enrollment period for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), women are the targets of outreach and advertising campaigns.\nSome 20 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 64 \u2014 about 19 million people \u2014 didn\u2019t have health coverage in 2011.\nIt turns out that women tend to pay more than their male counterparts for health coverage.\nNow, women no longer have to pay more for health coverage simply because of their gender."}
