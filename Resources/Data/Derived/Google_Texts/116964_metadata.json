Only in the District of Columbia could you get away with telling the people if you like what you have you can keep it, and then pass regulations six months later that do just the opposite and figure that people are going to ignore it. But common sense is eventually going to prevail in this town and common sense is going to have to prevail on this piece of legislation as well,\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said at the time. \u201cThe administration\u2019s own regulations prove this is not the case. Under the grandfathering regulation, according to the White House\u2019s own economic impact analysis, as many as 69 percent of businesses will lose their grandfathered status by 2013 and be forced to buy government-approved plans,\u201d the Iowa Republican said. On a party line vote, Democrats killed the resolution, which could come back to haunt vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this year.\n\nPryor, Landrieu, Begich, Hagan \u2014 all your favorite vulnerable Democratic incumbents from conservative states went face-first into the tank as usual to protect Obama\u2019s baby and now they\u2019re paying for it, which explains why Landrieu\u2019s suddenly pushing a bill along the same lines as tea-party Republican Ron Johnson to re-grandfather some plans. Big question mark, though: Did Senate Democrats anticipate just how restrictive Obama\u2019s HHS would be in writing the regulations that ended up disqualifying many plans from grandfather status? Per CNN, some Dems like Tom Harkin defended their vote against the GOP proposal in 2010 at the time by claiming that it might, in theory, end up re-grandfathering everything, which would defeat the purpose of rendering truly bad plans illegal. Instead, HHS wrote the regs so restrictively that even decent plans ended up being nuked when insurers made small changes to them. That\u2019s why Frank Pallone was babbling about \u201cscams\u201d on Megyn Kelly\u2019s show on Wednesday night: Congressional Democrats have now been reduced to claiming, surreally, that basically all of the plans that have now been canceled were \u201cbad\u201d and scam-like even though the media\u2019s spent the past week interviewing consumers who wish they could have them back.\n\nNone of this excuses Pryor et al. for not anticipating what would happen but it does create political space for them potentially to say that, knowing what they know now about how HHS implemented the grandfather rules, they might have voted differently. And once they say that, future ObamaCare votes in the Senate start to look \u2026 interesting. Via the Corner, here\u2019s Avik Roy explaining that the individual insurance market is really just a canary in the coal mine; disruption has already begun on the much bigger employer-based market, with full impact scheduled for 2015 once the \u201cdelay\u201d in the employer mandate ends. If red-state Dems think they\u2019re having a tough time explaining their votes now, just wait. Exit question: Roy says of O\u2019s now infamous \u201cif you like your plan\u201d nonsense, \u201c\u201cEveryone in the health-policy community left, right, or center knew this was a lie.\u201d How come Senate Democrats didn\u2019t know?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Reform.", "title": "Friendly reminder from CNN: Senate Democrats killed a 2010 GOP proposal to let more people keep their plans", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/01/friendly-reminder-from-cnn-senate-democrats-killed-a-2010-gop-proposal-to-let-more-people-keep-their-plans/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-01T15:21:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-01T15:22:27+00:00"}, "keywords": "baucus, CNN, Democrats, grassley, Medicaid, Obama, rule, Tom Harkin,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd344b\"", "article_summary": "Friendly reminder from CNN: Senate Democrats killed a 2010 GOP proposal to let more people keep their plansposted at 11:21 am on November 1, 2013 by AllahpunditYou know what to do, Republican ad-makers.\nBig question mark, though: Did Senate Democrats anticipate just how restrictive Obama\u2019s HHS would be in writing the regulations that ended up disqualifying many plans from grandfather status?\nExit question: Roy says of O\u2019s now infamous \u201cif you like your plan\u201d nonsense, \u201c\u201cEveryone in the health-policy community left, right, or center knew this was a lie.\u201d How come Senate Democrats didn\u2019t know?\nOn a party line vote, Democrats killed the resolution, which could come back to haunt vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this year.\nInstead, HHS wrote the regs so restrictively that even decent plans ended up being nuked when insurers made small changes to them."}
