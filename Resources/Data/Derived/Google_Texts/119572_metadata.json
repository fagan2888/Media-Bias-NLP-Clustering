Benson, who collapsed on her bathroom when she was just 22 weeks pregnant, has been in the hospital since Dec. 28, 2013, with massive brain damage and no chance of recovery. After the incident, her husband, Dylan, asked doctors to do everything they could to save their unborn son, whom they\u2019ve already named Iver Cohen Benson.\n\n\u201cAt the hospital they discovered that my wife had experienced a massive blood leak into the centre of her brain, and that there was so much blood and pressure and damage that it was irreparable,\" Dylan wrote on his fundraising site. \"Based on my decision, they are attempting to keep her body alive for up to 7 more weeks ... Incredibly, they have been successful in doing this for 5 weeks now.\"\n\nThough her brain may be beyond rescue, Robyn\u2019s body is still carrying out the maternal tasks it is pre-programmed to do, giving her son a chance of survival that rises by the minute. According to Dylan, doctors now estimate that the unborn boy has an 80 percent chance of making it, citing the 30 published records of similar deliveries. Unfortunately, a successful birth will still mean the end for Robyn.\n\n\u201cShe was my rock. She did so much for us, and I can\u2019t believe I won\u2019t get to talk to her again,\u201d Dylan continued. \u201cIt is very difficult to know that our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother, and that we will have to say our goodbyes to Robyn within hours of seeing Iver for the first time.\u201d\n\nBrain Dead & Pregnant\n\nThe tragic situation recalls the case of Marlise Munoz, the 33-year-old Texas woman who was kept on life support for several weeks against her family\u2019s wishes. Her Do-Not-Resuscitate order notwithstanding, doctors at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, told her husband Eric that their hands were tied, citing a state statute prohibiting the termination of life support for pregnant patients. Munoz\u2019s body remained in the hospital until late January, when a judge held that the cited provision did not apply in this case and ordered the hospital to disconnect all life preserving instruments.\n\n\u201cAssuming that the c-section is successful, of course my son will then spend the next several weeks in the hospital under intensive care until he is ready to be released to me,\u201d Dylan wrote. \u201cMy days right now consist of a lot of time with family and close friends, and of course time at the hospital visiting Iver and Robyn, and hoping every minute for their health to continue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brain dead, robyn benson, pregnant woman on life support, dylan benson fundraiser", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors are working to keep 32-year-old Robyn Benson alive long enough to give her unborn son a shot at survival.", "title": "After Brain Death, Robyn Benson's Body Continues To Fight For Her Son's Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/will-brain-dead-robyn-benson-pregnant-woman-life-support-survive-long-enough-doctors-save-her-child", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/04/icu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors are working to keep 32-year-old Robyn Benson alive long enough to give her unborn son a shot at survival.", "title": "After Brain Death, Robyn Benson's Body Continues To Fight For Her Son's Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/will-brain-dead-robyn-benson-pregnant-woman-life-support-survive-long-enough-doctors-save-her-child", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/04/icu.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/04/icu.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-04T16:48:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-04T16:48:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors are working to keep 32-year-old Robyn Benson alive long enough to give her unborn son a shot at survival."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38f7\"", "article_summary": "According to Dylan, doctors now estimate that the unborn boy has an 80 percent chance of making it, citing the 30 published records of similar deliveries.\nWith time running out, Canadian doctors are working to deliver the baby of a 32-year-old Canadian woman who has been kept on life support since internal bleeding left her brain dead late last year.\nAfter the incident, her husband, Dylan, asked doctors to do everything they could to save their unborn son, whom they\u2019ve already named Iver Cohen Benson.\nHer Do-Not-Resuscitate order notwithstanding, doctors at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, told her husband Eric that their hands were tied, citing a state statute prohibiting the termination of life support for pregnant patients.\nBenson, who collapsed on her bathroom when she was just 22 weeks pregnant, has been in the hospital since Dec. 28, 2013, with massive brain damage and no chance of recovery."}
