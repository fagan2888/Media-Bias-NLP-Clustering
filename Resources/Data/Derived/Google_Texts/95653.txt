Gridlock and dysfunction are common in Washington, and partisan warfare reflects a deepening red-blue divide in America.

Partisan rancor is nothing new, but a Pew Research poll finds that the political gulf has been widening over the past 20 years. Republicans have become more conservative and Democrats are more liberal, while the center shrinks.

Presidential candidates often pledge to be a unifying force, working across the aisle to bridge party divides. But then, the realities of the office intrude.

"The notion that you can unite the country as a promise is more of an illusion than it is a reality," said Josh Kraushaar of National Journal.

But maybe that's OK, some analysts say.

"Sure, there have been major bipartisan achievements in decades past, but it's not always the case that the country makes progress simply when the parties and people of good will come together," said Matthew Dallek of George Washington University.

Sometimes, big things can get done with one party in charge, even though the other side doesn't like it. The Bush tax cuts, Wall Street reform and the Affordable Care Act are some examples.

The Bipartisan Policy Center set up a 29-member commission to study polarization in America. Among its recommendations is that the president hold regular monthly meetings with congressional leaders.
