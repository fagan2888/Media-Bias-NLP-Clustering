Donald Trump will be in Washington D.C. Monday, and he is expected to release a list of people he'd nominate for Supreme Court judge.

The Republican presidential front-runner says the list will include 5 to 10 judges that he'd pick for the open seat if he's elected.

He made the announcement to Republicans in Florida Sunday while hosting the Palm Beach County Republican Party's Lincoln Day dinner at Mar-A-Lago.

Trump said he wants to ease concerns that he will pick judges that are too liberal. Instead he assured the crowd that he'll select judges "everybody respects, likes and totally admires."

The GOP contender also criticized President Obama's trip to Cuba, because the island's leader Raul Castro did not meet him at the airport.

"So President Obama landed in Cuba and the head of Cuba who was there for the Pope, and was there for other dignitaries, but he wasn't there for the POTUS. I mean we are amateur hour folks - amateur hour!" said Donald Trump.

He will be speaking at "The Old Post Office" in D.C. on Monday, which used to be a post office but is soon to be a new Trump hotel.

In addition to releasing his list of supreme court nominees, the billionaire businessman talked about his plans to repeal Obamacare if elected.

On Trump's website, it says he will ask congress to repeal Obamacare on day one.
