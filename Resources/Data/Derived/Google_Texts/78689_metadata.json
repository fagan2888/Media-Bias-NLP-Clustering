This particular story seems to be the source for the flying ace claim on numerous other websites. One of these \u2014 as of this writing \u2014 is a Wikipedia article on the Reno Air Races, which is now called the National Championship Air Races.\n\nBut the claim goes back a little earlier. An information box included with a 2011 Reno Gazette-Journal story said, \u201cThe Reno Air Races were first organized in 1964 by World War II flying ace Bill Stead.\u201d\n\nBefore going any further, you might be wondering what exactly is a flying ace? The accepted definition seems to be a pilot with five victories in encounters with enemy pilots. This is stated in numerous places, including a 1997 book about World War I flying aces called \u201cAbove the War Fronts\u201d by Norman L.R. Franks, Russell Guest and Gregory Alegi.\n\nTime spent at the Nevada Historical Society with its helpful staff and historian Philip Earl turned up numerous stories about Stead.\n\nOne was a full-page sports story on Stead\u2019s retirement from hydroplane racing in the Feb. 14, 1960 edition of the Nevada State Journal (a precursor to the Reno Gazette-Journal). There\u2019s zero mention of him being a flying ace.\n\nStead died when an 85-horsepower \u201cmidget\u201d plane he was piloting crashed in Florida. The April 28, 1966 issue of the Journal contained a front-page obituary. Again, no mention of him having been a flying ace.\n\nA lengthy tribute story about Stead appeared in the Sept. 2, 1979 issue of the Journal. No flying-ace mention.\n\nMany other stories also revealed no mention of flying-ace status.\n\nFact Checker reached out to Reno writer Harry Spencer. Spencer not only knew Stead, he flew with him once to Sacramento in a little four-seater. Also on the flight was hotel-casino owner Charles Mapes.\n\n\u201c(Stead) didn\u2019t submit a flight plan so we went to Sacramento through the Truckee River canyon, and the mountains were higher than we were,\u201d Spencer said.\n\nStead decided to give a show to the guys in the air traffic control tower at Sacramento. The landing featured several circles of the airfield with the plane perpendicular to the ground and the wing\u2019s tip just five feet above the ground. Mapes weighed nearly 300 pounds, Spencer said, and \u201cif his seatbelt broke, he would\u2019ve taken Stead out the door.\u201d\n\nSpencer took a Greyhound bus back to Reno.\n\n\u201cBill was not a fighter pilot,\u201d Spencer said, and never mentioned having been a flying ace \u2014 \u201cand he would\u2019ve.\u201d\n\nA 1966 obituary written by the Associated Press said of Stead\u2019s military flying history: \u201cStead tried to join the Chinese air force and the Canadian air force in 1940, but was drafted before he could get into either unit. After two years as an infantryman, he was transferred to the Air Corps and directed an air-sea rescue unit in Panama.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to become a flying ace.\n\nBill\u2019s brother Croston Stead was referred to as a flying ace in a 2005 RGJ-affiliated advertising product:\n\n\u201cStead Air Force Base was named for Croston, a World War II flying ace, who was killed when his plane crashed in the area while he was flying for the Nevada National Guard. Bill Stead is recognized as the founder of the Reno Air Races, which began in 1964.\u201d\n\nPerhaps their names and the flying-ace label got conflated over time.\n\nAlthough not the subject of this column, Fact Checker doubts Croston was a flying ace either.\n\nReno Army Air Base\u2019s name was changed on Jan. 1, 1951 to Stead Air Force Base in honor of Croston. A vintage base magazine and resource guide found at the Nevada Historical Society included an article called \u201cThe Story of Lieutenant Croston K. Stead.\u201d\n\nIt has no mention of him having been a flying ace. It does say, \u201cAt the time of his death he was flying with the 192nd Fighter Squadron of the Air National Guard.\u201d\n\nIn the Reno Evening Gazette\u2019s Dec. 13, 1949 news story and obituary about Croston\u2019s crash shortly after takeoff at the base, no mention of flying-ace status was mentioned.\n\nWikipedia states there were 1,297 aces from the United States during World War II and lists each one. Neither Stead is mentioned.\n\nThe website Air Aces (aces.safarikovi.org) lists flying aces around the world with extensive sources cited. It\u2019s the creation of Czech academic Jan Safarik, who has written aviation history articles for the Czech magazine Revi, \u201ca bimonthly magazine about planes and pilots.\u201d\n\nSome of the rarer wars chronicled by Safarik during which pilots took out enemy aircraft are the Nigerian-Biafran Civil War and the \u201cSoccer War\u201d of 1969 involving El Salvador and Honduras. This is mentioned to point out the depth of flying-ace information on the site.\n\nAir Aces lists every known aerial combat victory for the United States from World War I through the war in Afghanistan, where a U.S. Air Force pilot flying an F-15E shot down an Mi-24 Hind helicopter.\n\nThe site catalogs each pilot\u2019s name, his number of victories and what branch of service he was with. It even includes pilots who had zero in-air victories but who took out enemy planes on the ground. Neither Stead is mentioned.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nBill Stead was a pilot who flew during World War II, he was a rancher, he started the Reno Air Races, he was a world-champion hydroplane racer \u2014 and he most definitely was not a World War II flying ace.\n\nTruth Meter: 1", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
