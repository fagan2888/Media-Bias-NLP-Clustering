Lee \u2013 future commander of the Confederate States of America\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia \u2013 wrote a famous letter to Franklin Pierce, the profoundly inept outgoing president. After praising Pierce for his pro-Southern policies, Lee wrote: \u201cThere are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil.\u201d (That phrase was likely meant as a mild rebuke to Pierce, who may not have felt that way.)\n\nThis letter has long struck historians as significant because of its apparent paradox: A few years later, Lee would command hundreds of thousands of young men to kill and die for a cause he personally believed was immoral, a cause his great adversary, Ulysses S. Grant, would describe as \u201cone of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.\u201d Lee was of course not the first white American to be pinioned by this paradox, which was written into our Constitution, with its oblique references to \u201cother persons\u201d existing in certain states who were to be counted as three-fifths of a human being. Nor was he the last.\n\nHow are we to understand the Confederate battle flag waved by a demonstrator from Texas outside the White House last week? Some shutdown supporters, fearing media blowback, tried to suggest it was the work of a liberal agent provocateur, or simply a symbol of rebellious high spirits and \u201cSouthern heritage.\u201d But the meaning of that particular flag, outside the home of our first black president, in the middle of a conflict loaded with not-so-hidden racial messaging, is not difficult to grasp. It strikes me as evidence that the heavy historical weight of slavery, and what Jimmy Carter has called the \u201cburden of white supremacy,\u201d has not yet been lifted. We ignore it, or agree to overlook it, at our peril.\n\nIn that light, I think Steve McQueen\u2019s riveting film \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d is one of the most important works of mainstream cinema to reach wide release in recent years. Based on the true story of Solomon Northup (played by the Afro-British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free-born African American from upstate New York who was abducted and sold into slavery in 1841, \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d was made by a black director and a black writer (the novelist and screenwriter John Ridley), with a black star. But it also reaches us under the aegis of Hollywood\u2019s biggest male star, Brad Pitt (who produced the film and plays a crucial supporting role). Its subject is the complex weave of America\u2019s racial history, which has never been a straightforward or simple dichotomy, and its intended audience is all Americans and indeed the whole world. It is not a movie about \u201cwhite guilt,\u201d whatever that would even mean in the 21st century. I not only had slave-owning ancestors, but am descended on my mother\u2019s side from a family in the French port city of Nantes who owned slave-trading ships, which might be even worse. I do not remotely feel responsible for their crimes; the only historical obligation those long-ago rich assholes have conferred on me is not to avoid the truth.\n\nSpeaking of avoiding the truth, I can see you coming, Confederate apologists. Robert E. Lee\u2019s letter is sometimes employed as indirect evidence that the Civil War was not really fought over the issue of slavery, but of course it demonstrates no such thing and anyway in 2013 that dog just won\u2019t hunt anymore. Despite more than a century of whitewashing and euphemizing about \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d and the \u201cSouthern way of life,\u201d it\u2019s perfectly clear how white Southerners saw the conflict at the time. And a great many of them did not agree with Lee.\n\nAs Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens put it in his Cornerstone Speech of March 21, 1861, the brand new constitution of his brand new breakaway republic \u201chas put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions \u2013 African slavery as it exists among us \u2013 the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.\u201d The anxiety felt about slavery by Thomas Jefferson and other conscience-stricken slave-owning founders, Stephens went on, had been misguided. Such men had believed \u201cthat the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically \u2026 Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested on the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error \u2026 Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.\u201d\n\nIdeology aside, Stephens (who was played by Jackie Earle Haley in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cLincoln\u201d) had the reputation in rural Georgia of being a benevolent slave master. During his years as a lawyer, he once successfully defended an enslaved woman charged with attempted murder, and after the Civil War ended (and Stephens returned from imprisonment in Boston) many of his emancipated slaves reportedly remained on his plantation as hired hands. Of course we can\u2019t now ask any of those people why they stayed. The post-war situation in the South was extremely chaotic, and a job with one\u2019s former master was in some cases preferable to no job at all. It\u2019s also important to remember that all the historical accounts of that era, including the narratives of former slaves, have been filtered through a white perspective tinged with unconscious or semi-conscious apologetics.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume, for the purpose of argument, that Stephens was a kind and decent person in his private life, who also became the public spokesman for the virulently racist official ideology of the Confederate States of America and the author of the one text that neo-Confederates would most like to sweep under the historical carpet. If that\u2019s the case, he becomes a perfect example of the toxic effects of America\u2019s \u201cpeculiar institution,\u201d exactly the issue explored in \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d That same poisonous influence drove the anti-slavery Lee to lead the South\u2019s armies into a war that would kill more than a million people (about 3 percent of the U.S. population, or the equivalent of 9 million today).", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the toxic effects of white supremacy, seen so clearly in \"12 Years a Slave,\" endure in American politics", "title": "Slavery, the Rebel flag and the shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "How the toxic effects of white supremacy, seen so clearly in \"12 Years a Slave,\" endure in American politics", "title": "Slavery, the Rebel flag and the shutdown", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/19/slavery_the_rebel_flag_and_the_shutdown/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/twelve_years_a_slave3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How the toxic effects of white supremacy, seen so clearly in \"12 Years a Slave,\" endure in American politics", "title": "Slavery, the Rebel flag and the shutdown", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/twelve_years_a_slave3.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 12 years a slave, African American, African Americans, african-american history, American History, chiwetel ejiofor, Civil War, Editor's Picks, Government shutdown, History, michael fassbender, Movies, Our Picks, Our Picks: Movies, Racism, racism in america, Shutdown, slavery, steve mcqueen, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "How are we to understand the Confederate battle flag waved by a demonstrator from Texas outside the White House last week?\nIt strikes me as evidence that the heavy historical weight of slavery, and what Jimmy Carter has called the \u201cburden of white supremacy,\u201d has not yet been lifted.\nIt is not a movie about \u201cwhite guilt,\u201d whatever that would even mean in the 21st century.\nBut it also reaches us under the aegis of Hollywood\u2019s biggest male star, Brad Pitt (who produced the film and plays a crucial supporting role).\nThe post-war situation in the South was extremely chaotic, and a job with one\u2019s former master was in some cases preferable to no job at all."}
