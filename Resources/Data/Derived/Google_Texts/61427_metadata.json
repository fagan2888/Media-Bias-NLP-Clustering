Rowling.\n\nBut the most scathing rebuttal was courtesy of comedian Aziz Ansari.\n\nAnsari, whose heritage is Tamil Muslim, fired off several tweets mocking Murdoch on Sunday, ultimately introducing a hashtag -- #RupertsFault.\n\nWith the hashtag, Ansari and his followers jokingly blamed the News Corps chairman for a variety of unfortunate scenarios.\n\nAnsari tweeted: \"@rupertmurdoch is responsible for all pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic. @rupertmurdoch why are you pro pedophile :(\"\n\nIn another tweet aimed at Murdoch, Ansari asked for a \"step by step guide\" on how his parents can \"destroy\" terrorist groups.\n\n\"Plz advise,\" Ansari said.\n\nMurdoch can take solace in knowing that he wasn't the only one to take so much flack this weekend.\n\nSteve Emerson, a Fox News guest who claims to be an authority on Islamic extremist networks, also inspired a hashtag with a widely panned remark of his own.\n\nAppearing on \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" Emerson said the British city of Birmingham is a \"totally Muslim city where non-Muslims don't go in.\"\n\nIt was the type of observation that might have previously only drawn a rebuttal from liberal watchdog Media Matters or other blogs dedicated to fact-checking Fox News.\n\nBut with Twitter, anyone can be a media critic.\n\nEnter: #FoxNewsFacts.\n\nThe hashtag was trending on Sunday, the result of several Twitter users ridiculing Emerson's assertion. One widely shared tweet included a photo of the Queen donning a head scarf with a caption suggesting that she followed an Islamic dress code when she visits Birmingham.\n\nEmerson eventually apologized and acknowledged that his comments \"were totally inaccurate.\"\n\nBut the piling on continued Monday when British Prime Minister David Cameron addressed the matter during an interview with ITV News.\n\n\"When I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge,\" Cameron said of Emerson's remark. \"I thought it must be April Fool's Day.\"\n\nEmerson, Cameron added, is \"clearly a complete idiot.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "steven emerson, rupert murdoch, muslims, fox news facts, twitter, aziz ansari", "title": "Rupert Murdoch and Fox News draw massive online backlash for Muslim comments", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/12/media/rupert-murdoch-aziz-ansari-fox-news-facts/index.html", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "type": "article", "description": "A Fox News pundit and Rupert Murdoch each inspired online ridicule for comments on Muslims.", "title": "Rupert Murdoch and Fox News draw massive online backlash for Muslim comments"}, "section": "media", "author": "Tom Kludt", "vr": {"category": "media", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-12T10:38:51", "keywords": "steven emerson, rupert murdoch, muslims, fox news facts, twitter, aziz ansari", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "date": "2015-01-12 10:38:51", "twitter": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/12/media/rupert-murdoch-aziz-ansari-fox-news-facts/index.html", "description": "A Fox News pundit and Rupert Murdoch each inspired online ridicule for comments on Muslims.", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rupert Murdoch and Fox News draw massive online backlash for Muslim comments"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "A Fox News pundit and Rupert Murdoch each inspired online ridicule for comments on Muslims."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfaf\"", "article_summary": "Rupert Murdoch and his Fox News empire were on the receiving end of a massive Twitter counteroffensive this weekend.\nWith the hashtag, Ansari and his followers jokingly blamed the News Corps chairman for a variety of unfortunate scenarios.\n@rupertmurdoch why are you pro pedophile :(\"In another tweet aimed at Murdoch, Ansari asked for a \"step by step guide\" on how his parents can \"destroy\" terrorist groups.\nAnsari, whose heritage is Tamil Muslim, fired off several tweets mocking Murdoch on Sunday, ultimately introducing a hashtag -- #RupertsFault.\nThe billionaire media mogul ran into an online buzz saw after he offered his thoughts on radical Islam."}
