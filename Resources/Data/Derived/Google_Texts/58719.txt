Denver police are investigating a fatal shooting that occurred Sunday afternoon.

Officials received reports of a shooting in the the alley behind the 3200 block of West Nevada Place in Denver. When they arrived, they found man in his 40s with a gunshot wound.

The victim was riding a motorcycle east through the alley when he was confronted by a man on foot, who fired a shot at him, said Doug Schepman, a police spokesman .

The victim was transported to a hospital where he was declared dead.

Police are still looking for the suspect.

“We’re still trying to figure out what happened,” Schepman said. “I would encourage folks to be vigilant.”

Jesus Cadena, 18, was there before officers arrived. He was working in a nearby grocery store when someone entered and told him people were fighting in the alley.

“I was turning the corner to go in the alley, and I heard a pop,” Cadena said. “I walked up to the body. He was face down.”

He noted that another witness turned the body over to find blood gushing from the chest, nose and mouth. The other witness began performing CPR.

“There was no pulse,” he said. “We didn’t feel anything.”

Cadena, who said he was still shaken up several hours after the shooting, was shocked that a deadly shooting occurred near the store his family owned.

“I never would have thought something like this would happen here,” he said. “For something to happen in our alley is crazy.”
