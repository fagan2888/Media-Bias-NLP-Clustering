The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan and its Ziibiwing Cultural Society recently repatriated and held a reburial ceremony for the ancestral remains of 43 ancestors.

The remains were repatriated mostly from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, but one set of remains came from the Toledo Zoological Society in Ohio and the Dearborn Historical Society in Michigan.

The repatriated remains were excavated from the Fairlane Estate in Dearborn, Michigan in the 1950s, and the work has been funded by a grant from the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, and the National NAGPRA Program.

“The work funded by these grants is a step toward addressing past violations of the treatment of human remains and sacred objects of Native peoples, while restoring the ability of American Indian and Native Hawaiian peoples to be stewards of their own ancestral dead and cultural heritage.” said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis in a press release.

The Recommitment to the Earth Ceremony was held May 22 at the tribe’s Nibokaan Ancestral Cemetery, which was established in 1995 explicitly for the reburial of repatriated remains and associated funerary objects.
