At the same time, reports that Carson\u2019s campaign is on the rocks financially, and is laying off large numbers of staff, are beginning to circulate.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Losing Iowa Wasn\u2019t My Fault\n\nThe combination could have some toxic consequences for Ted Cruz, who is trying to follow up his win in Iowa Monday with strong performances in other early voting states. Both men have built campaigns that rest in large part on their repeated outward demonstrations of Christian faith, which has made them popular with evangelical Christians that make up much of the GOP base.\n\nWhile Carson has faded considerably since the brief moment he led the polls a few months ago, his 9.3 percent showing in Iowa demonstrates that he still has a considerable following, and many of those followers are the same evangelicals that Cruz has his eye on as he looks to consolidate any support he can to challenge frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nThe general assumption is that Carson voters\u2019 second choice would be another evangelical or at least a candidate who leans heavily on religious themes.\n\nThat seemed to be Cruz-backing Iowa Rep. Steve King\u2019s thinking Monday night when he sent out a tweet suggesting that Carson\u2019s departure was imminent.\n\nRelated: Rubio Vs. Cruz?

Most will go to Cruz, I hope. https://t.co/lW5Js50EMA \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) February 2, 2016\n\nAs the media discovers more facts surrounding Ted Cruz's campaign resorting to dirty tricks, even they are appalled.https://t.co/sOieTvJy8o \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) February 5, 2016\n\nAll things equal, the fallout from the Iowa results would have seemed to support that theory. With former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum out of the race, that left Cruz as the last candidate standing for voters to whom displays of Christian faith were important.\n\nBut in Carson\u2019s mind, things are far from equal.\n\nThe tweet from King was just the beginning. On Thursday, the website Breitbart.com, which is unabashed in its support for Trump, obtained and published what it said were two voicemails left for Cruz precinct captains.\n\nThe messages, left shortly before Iowa Republicans gathered to caucus for presidential candidates, urged the Cruz organizers to tell Carson supporters at Monday night\u2019s caucuses that their man was getting out of the race, and that they would be wasting a vote on the retired neurosurgeon.\n\nRelated: Huckabee Quits and Carson Heads Home: The GOP Shake-Up After Iowa\n\nOn Tuesday, Carson accused the Cruz campaign of employing \u201cdirty tricks\u201d in Iowa. On Wednesday, speaking to reporters, Carson himself got Biblical on Cruz.\n\n\u201cI make no bones about the fact that I am a person of faith, and I believe what it says in Matthew 7:20: 'By their fruit you will know them.\u2019\u201d The verse, as Carson undoubtedly knows, refers to \u201cfalse prophets\u201d and is the source of the saying, \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nWhen Breitbart released the audio recordings Thursday, the Cruz campaign posted them online and sent out a fundraising pitch in the form of an email from Carson himself to his supporters.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Rolls Snake Eyes in Iowa\n\n\u201cThis kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people don't trust politicians and don't trust Washington, D.C.,\u201d it read. \u201cIf Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values\u2026 I call on Senator Cruz to take decisive action at a senior level within his campaign or I fear this culture of destructive behavior will only continue.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Cruz campaign has denied any wrongdoing, and said that its messages to supporters were just accurately reporting what was already in the news.\n\nIn fact, what had been reported was that Carson was briefly returning home to Florida before heading on to the next primary state of New Hampshire. There was no suggestion that he was \u201csuspending\u201d his campaign \u2013 the technical term candidates use when they drop out of a race.\n\nHowever, one of the voicemails specifically used the word \u201csuspending\u201d to describe what Carson was doing.\n\nRelated: Sanders Closes the Gap on Clinton \u2013 and Cleans Up Against the GOP\n\nBy Friday, Carson was still plainly furious, not just about the events Monday night, but about the Cruz camp\u2019s response to it.\n\n\u201cNot to take corrective action is tacitly saying it\u2019s okay, or it\u2019s sort of like, as Hillary Clinton said after Benghazi, \u2018what difference does it make,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that it rises to the level up Benghazi, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the same kind of attitude\u2026The attitude being, it\u2019s water under the bridge, it\u2019s gone by, let\u2019s not deal with it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when, or even if, Carson will drop out of the campaign, but right now, he doesn\u2019t sound like a guy ready to throw his support, and his influence with evangelicals, behind Cruz.\n\nIn fact, if he keeps warning about \u201cfalse prophets,\u201d he may have exactly the opposite effect.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Mild-mannered Ben Carson doesn\u2019t seem inclined to turn the other cheek to Ted Cruz, now that voicemail messages have been uncovered that appear to show Cruz campaign staff in Iowa falsely telling precinct captains that Carson was planning to suspend his presidential campaign.", "title": "Why Carson Might Poison the Well for Cruz with Evangelicals", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/Why-Carson-Might-Poison-Well-Cruz-Evangelicals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/Why-Carson-Might-Poison-Well-Cruz-Evangelicals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_3.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mild-mannered Ben Carson doesn\u2019t seem inclined to turn the other cheek to Ted Cruz, now that voicemail messages have been uncovered that appear to show Cruz campaign staff in Iowa falsely telling precinct captains that Carson was planning to suspend his presidential campaign.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Huckabee Quits and Carson Heads Home: The GOP Shake-Up After IowaOn Tuesday, Carson accused the Cruz campaign of employing \u201cdirty tricks\u201d in Iowa.\nMild-mannered Ben Carson doesn\u2019t seem inclined to turn the other cheek to Ted Cruz, now that voicemail messages have been uncovered that appear to show Cruz campaign staff in Iowa falsely telling precinct captains that Carson was planning to suspend his presidential campaign.\n\u201cIf Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values\u2026 I call on Senator Cruz to take decisive action at a senior level within his campaign or I fear this culture of destructive behavior will only continue.\u201dFor its part, the Cruz campaign has denied any wrongdoing, and said that its messages to supporters were just accurately reporting what was already in the news.\nOn Wednesday, speaking to reporters, Carson himself got Biblical on Cruz.\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Losing Iowa Wasn\u2019t My FaultThe combination could have some toxic consequences for Ted Cruz, who is trying to follow up his win in Iowa Monday with strong performances in other early voting states."}
