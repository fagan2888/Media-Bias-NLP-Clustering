Jobs in health care were up nearly 5 percent over 2014, while the overall economy in Kentucky saw 3.1 percent job growth in that period.\n\nJason Bailey, executive director of KCEP, said employment in health care and social assistance sectors picked up after the implementation of the Medicaid expansion, which former Gov. Steve Beshear did under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cSo many more people have health care coverage and are going to the doctor, and that\u2019s very likely having a strong influence on the job growth that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 500,000 Kentuckians have gotten health coverage via expanded Medicaid and the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Kynect, since the program began. The rate of uninsured in Kentucky has dropped from 20.4 percent before Kynect to 7.5 percent today, according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.\n\nBailey said job growth didn\u2019t happen immediately after Medicaid expansion. Before the state began enrolling people in Medicaid expansion, health care jobs were tapering off. But by the fall of 2014, job growth in the state\u2019s health care and social assistance sector began improving, resulting in a dramatic increase in 2015.\n\nRelated Story Bevin Offers Hints \u2014 But Few Details \u2014 of Future Medicaid Reforms In Kentucky\n\nKCEP also found the ambulatory health care services and hospital employment sectors have added more than 2,300 jobs in the state over the last year.\n\n\u201cMore people going to the doctor means there has to be more health care jobs to provide those services \u2014 more nurses, more doctors, etc.,\u201d he said.\n\nBailey said Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s plans to modify the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion could threaten job growth. He said the changes could make it more challenging for people to access care.\n\n\u201cIf there are fewer people covered, then there are fewer people who are using health care services, and that could definitely translate into fewer jobs if that\u2019s what ends up happening,\u201d he said.\n\nBevin plans to move those getting insurance plans through Kynect onto the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov. Jon Kingsdale, a health care analyst who helped implement Massachusetts\u2019 insurance exchange, told NPR that wouldn\u2019t affect access to care.\n\n\u201cThe federal exchange is a perfectly viable alternative,\u201d Kingsdale said in December.\n\nThe governor has yet to unveil a plan for remaking Medicaid, although he has hinted that he plans something similar to the program in Indiana, where most beneficiaries pay into the system. Some 400,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in Medicaid under the expansion.\n\nLast month, the Bevin administration began transitioning Medicaid users off of Kynect and onto Benefind, a new application service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jobs in health care were up nearly 5 percent over 2014, while the overall economy in Kentucky saw 3.1 percent job growth in that period.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Jobs in health care were up nearly 5 percent over 2014, while the overall economy in Kentucky saw 3.1 percent job growth in that period.", "title": "New Data Show Health Care Jobs Grew In Kentucky Last Year", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3648, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5936305758_bf3e7fa920_o-e1450383539611.jpg", "height": 1258}, "updated_time": "2016-03-14T11:41:14-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kentucky-health-care-jobs-grew-2015/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jobs in health care were up nearly 5 percent over 2014, while the overall economy in Kentucky saw 3.1 percent job growth in that period.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5936305758_bf3e7fa920_o-e1450383539611.jpg", "title": "New Data Show Health Care Jobs Grew In Kentucky Last Year", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2016-03-14T09:00:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T11:41:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Before the state began enrolling people in Medicaid expansion, health care jobs were tapering off.\nJon Kingsdale, a health care analyst who helped implement Massachusetts\u2019 insurance exchange, told NPR that wouldn\u2019t affect access to care.\nThe health care industry in Kentucky continued to add jobs in 2015, according to newly revised data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cMore people going to the doctor means there has to be more health care jobs to provide those services \u2014 more nurses, more doctors, etc.,\u201d he said.\nJobs in health care were up nearly 5 percent over 2014, while the overall economy in Kentucky saw 3.1 percent job growth in that period."}
