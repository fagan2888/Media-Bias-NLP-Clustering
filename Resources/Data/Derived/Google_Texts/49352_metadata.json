And yet the tale has been adapted for film twice, first as a 1947 Danny Kaye musical, now as a dramedy starring and directed by Ben Stiller. The challenges of making it feature length are obvious and many, but first and foremost is that one must puff out a slender tale. For Hollywood, that means inevitably inverting the message, which means to speak to real-life drudgery of the everyperson. But that\u2019s not feel-good.\n\nBoth movie versions turn on Mitty growing a pair. Stiller\u2019s version simply caves in far quicker than the Kaye. This Mitty isn\u2019t drowning in an unhappy marriage, perhaps because shy Manhattaners no longer so easily find a life partner. He\u2019s an OK Cupid addict who\u2019s also excellent at his admittedly archaic job: as a photo archivist at Life Magazine. He also likes a woman at his office (Kristen Wiig).\n\nLife folded its print edition in 2007. Here\u2019s, it\u2019s lasted to about 2013. (Movie magic!) Hoping to keep his job as everyone else is laid off, he decides to throw his usual mousiness out the window and do something closer to one of the outsized fantasy sequences that pepper the narrative: he\u2019ll try to locate a mysterious star photographer (Sean Penn) to get a needed photo, a mission that will take him all over the world.\n\nGiven his sketch comedy background, Stiller should be the ideal person for this. But the fantasy numbers \u2014 which drop around the halfway mark as our hero starts \"living the dream\" \u2014 aren\u2019t particularly witty or even very escapist; they\u2019re just big. Meanwhile the scenes of Mitty doing the impossible should be ridiculous \u2014 he battles sharks, hops on skateboards, rides with ten-sheets-to-the-wind helicopter pilots \u2014 but are played so sincerely they come off like the types of scenes Stiller would mock in \u201cTropic Thunder.\u201d\n\nThat said, the film is funnier than it seems like it should have been. Stiller\u2019s specific interpretation of awkward \u2014 stammering with notes of confidence that come from intelligence \u2014 proves winning, and two or three times the film lives up to its promise of inspired lunacy. Even though \u201cArcade Fire\u201d-backed emo wins over, it\u2019s hard to hate anything so nakedly in love with print media and analogue in general. That the film revolves around a piece of celluloid \u2014 and was filmed on film \u2014 is a way to get any cinephile on its side, even if only up to a modest point.\n\nFollow Matt Prigge on Twitter @mattprigge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' needs a better imagination", "author": "Matt Prigge", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Review: 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' needs a better imagination", "title": "Review: \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" Needs a Better Imagination", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/review-the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty-needs-a-better-imagination/tmWmlv---3d8QQ2ahu89VY/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$5ntkv1oqpw0ywa6fkwb51u7y4p8mxjt/ENT_WalterMitty_1223-614x410.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Review: 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' needs a better imagination", "creator": "Matt Prigge", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$5ntkv1oqpw0ywa6fkwb51u7y4p8mxjt/ENT_WalterMitty_1223-614x410.jpeg"}, "title": "Review: \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" Needs a Better Imagination", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Ben Stiller, Danny Kaye, James Thurber, Kristen Wiig, moviesr, Review, Sean Penn, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-12", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/movies", "published_time": "2013-12-22T12:18:23Z", "modified_time": "2013-12-22T12:18:23Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Ben Stiller, Danny Kaye, James Thurber, Kristen Wiig, moviesr, Review, Sean Penn, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"}, "article_summary": "Ben Stiller talks to the girl that he likes (Kristen Wiig) in \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.\"\nCredit: Wilson Webb\u2018The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\u2019Director: Ben StillerStars: Ben Stiller, Kristen WiigRating: PG-132 (out of 5) GlobesThere are few things less empowering than James Thurber\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\u201d a succinct short story that contrasts one wallflower\u2019s fertile daydreams against his miserable, dead-end reality.\nThis Mitty isn\u2019t drowning in an unhappy marriage, perhaps because shy Manhattaners no longer so easily find a life partner.\nAnd yet the tale has been adapted for film twice, first as a 1947 Danny Kaye musical, now as a dramedy starring and directed by Ben Stiller.\nHe\u2019s an OK Cupid addict who\u2019s also excellent at his admittedly archaic job: as a photo archivist at Life Magazine."}
