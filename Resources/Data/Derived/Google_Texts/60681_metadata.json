He\u2019s overtaken Donald Trump in a CBS/New York Times national poll and he\u2019s ahead in Iowa now with the caucuses just three months away. The Times is writing nice profiles of him full of polite euphemisms like \u201clack of governing experience.\u201d First we all got used to the idea that it wasn\u2019t insane to think that Donald Trump could be the GOP nominee. And now we have to acclimate ourselves to the idea it could be Carson, too.\n\nThe only actual interesting thing about Carson is that he raises a question we rarely get the chance to contemplate: How can a man who is so obviously distinguished and brilliant in one field be such an across-the-board nincompoop in another? Because usually, if a man (or woman) is a good and knowledgeable and sure-footed doctor, or lawyer or department chair or any other position that could have been attained only through repeated displays of excellence and probity, then that person will also be a pretty solid human being across the board. He or she might be right wing or left wing, and he or he might have a weakness for French New Wave cinema or for Rock Hudson-Doris Day movies; but s/he won\u2019t be an idiot.\n\nBut Carson is a political idiot. And it\u2019s not all the Nazi and slavery talk, although those are certainly stupid and crude comparisons that can only be invoked by people who are dumb enough\u2014and, I should add, insensitive enough\u2014never to have given serious thought to the grisly particulars of what Nazism and slavery entailed. Whatever you think of Obamacare, you actually have to be a ghastly human being to compare it to practice in which horrors like this happened all the time, to many millions of people.\n\nAnd these rants of his against political correctness! We\u2019re getting to be like (again) Nazi Germany? Is he serious? Yes, he is. Imagine how ignorant of history a person has to be to think that today\u2019s pc police, annoying as they sometimes are, can be compared to the SA or the SS? It\u2019s insulting even to have to hear it.\n\nSo all that is plenty bad, but even more, I mean nearly everything else that comes out of this mouth. Just Google \u201cBen Carson ignorance\u201d and you\u2019ll see quickly enough that on subjects ranging from science to foreign policy to the Constitution to virtually any political or historical or policy topic on which he chooses to speak, he says something that has no basis in real-world fact.\n\nHow does a man who is (presumably, anyway) in his chosen realm a man of science and empirical knowledge and testing of hypotheses enter this other realm and become someone who just spends his time scouring the most lunatic right-wing websites there are and repeating back everything he reads there as if it\u2019s true? That\u2019s where that madness about how armed Jews could have prevented the Holocaust comes from\u2014it started about 20 years ago, and there is nothing about it that\u2019s true. But the notion lives a healthy life on right-wing and pro-gun websites and chat boards. Great weight is given in those circles to a supposed quote from Hitler extolling gun control. But as Alex Seitz-Wald showed in this Salon piece in which he quotes leading scholars, Hitler almost certainly never said it.\n\nNow, none of this is shocking to you, if you follow these things at all. There are all kinds of matters on which conservatives have their own version of reality. I remember being astonished back when we were all first getting to know a certain half-term Alaska governor to learn, via some dodgy and weird creationistic answer she gave to some question, that there\u2019s this excavation site in, predictably enough, Texas, called the Taylor Trail, where there exists \u201cevidence\u201d that man and dinosaur walked together. So this kind of thing goes on all the time out there in this big country of ours.\n\nBut what doesn\u2019t go on all the time is that a man who gets his ideas about the world from conspiracy-theory websites is a leading presidential candidate\u2014or that his idiot comments not only don\u2019t hurt him but help him. I\u2019d reckon some of you saw that poll last week asking Iowa Republicans whether X statement about Carson raised or lowered their esteem of him. His comparison of Obamacare to slavery was considered \u201cattractive\u201d by 81 percent of those polled, and gave just 16 percent the willies.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the great cons of the year that Carson gets to be called \u201cmild-mannered.\u201d How many people who think that getting health insurance is worse than being held in bondage get to be called mild-mannered? And how arrogant a man must Carson be\u2014what made him think he should be the president of the United States in the first place? There are lots of distinguished surgeons out there. So why him?\n\nAnd now we have this debate coming up Wednesday. Carson did pretty badly in the first couple debates\u2014he was unfocused and off-point and spoke in the kind of generalities that left you wondering what he really meant. But did it hurt? No, it helped him! Now, Trump and maybe some of the others are going to come after him. So we\u2019ll see how he holds up.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Politics-Election, 2016 Election, 2016, Republican Party, Ben Carson, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Iowa,United States, Donald Trump", "publicationDate": 201510270500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "How a brilliant man\u2019s profound ignorance became his greatest political asset.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "What Ben Carsons Rise Says About America", "tags": "article:politics-election,obsessional:2016-election,entity:event/2016_election,entity:organization/republican_party,entity:person/ben_carson,topic:politics,entity:person/donald_trump,entity:provinceorstate/iowa_united_states,obsessional:donald-trump", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"What Ben Carson\u2019s Rise Says About America\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/27/what-ben-carson-s-rise-says-about-america.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/27/what-ben-carson-s-rise-says-about-america/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48197401.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/27/what-ben-carson-s-rise-says-about-america\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-27T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Michael Tomasky\",\"tags\":[\"politics-election\",\"2016-election\",\"2016_election\",\"republican_party\",\"ben_carson\",\"politics\",\"donald_trump\",\"iowa_united_states\",\"donald-trump\"]}", "news_keywords": "PoliticsElection, 2016 Election, 2016 election, Republican Party, Ben Carson, US Politics, Donald Trump, Iowa United States, Donald Trump", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Michael Tomasky", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-10-27T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/michael-tomaskyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/27/what-ben-carson-s-rise-says-about-america", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "How a brilliant man\u2019s profound ignorance became his greatest political asset.", "title": "What Ben Carson\u2019s Rise Says About America", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/27/what-ben-carson-s-rise-says-about-america.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/27/what-ben-carson-s-rise-says-about-america/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1445922047209.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/michael-tomasky", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce524\"", "article_summary": "So it\u2019s Ben Carson\u2019s moment.\nAnd how arrogant a man must Carson be\u2014what made him think he should be the president of the United States in the first place?\nSo all that is plenty bad, but even more, I mean nearly everything else that comes out of this mouth.\nAnd now we have to acclimate ourselves to the idea it could be Carson, too.\nHe\u2019s overtaken Donald Trump in a CBS/New York Times national poll and he\u2019s ahead in Iowa now with the caucuses just three months away."}
