Gold is a pretty big lure, it\u2019s already been thrown out there about Sonny Bill Williams for New Zealand.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s on the radar, but I\u2019m leaving it with my manager, I\u2019m just enjoying starting with the Brumbies.\u201d\n\nColeman, who is contracted with the Brumbies until the end of next year, was coached by Australian sevens general manager Anthony Eddy in the under-20s team.\n\nSpeight was player of the tournament at the sevens club event in London last year. The Fijian flyer is poised to sign a two-year deal to stay in Canberra. He will become eligible for Australian Test selection in September after a drawn-out battle to play for the Wallabies.\n\nSevens players have to be citizens if they want to play for Australia at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t interested, it\u2019s definitely very appealing,\u201d Speight said. \u201cThe drive for an Olympic gold is up there with my drive to get into the Wallabies and play at a World Cup. I certainly am thinking of it and moving to sevens wouldn\u2019t be a problem, we [the Brumbies] proved that in London next year.\u201d\n\nSpeight\u2019s blistering speed coupled with his breakdown work would make him an attractive prospect for sevens.\n\nOutgoing sevens coach Michael O\u2019Connor has made a point to say he wouldn\u2019t parachute Wallabies stars in for the Olympics.\n\nQueanbeyan junior Lewis Holland and Royals star Tom Cusack are part of the sevens set up. The Olympic qualifying campaign starts when the next sevens world series begins in October.\n\nBrumbies coach Stephen Larkham backed Coleman and Speight to make a successful transition and bolster Australia\u2019s medal hopes. But Larkham wants to keep the pair in the Brumbies program to chase Super Rugby glory.\n\n\u201cRobbie Coleman and Henry would be unbelievable at sevens,\u201d Larkham said.\n\n\u201cIf it overlaps Super Rugby, we would be against it because our priority is to make this franchise the most successful franchise in Australia again.\n\n\u201cYou need all of your good players on the field for that and those guys are two of our best players. But if it was an opportunity to represent their country and maybe win a gold medal at an Olympics, you have to give them that chance.\n\n\u201cIf they missed some [Brumbies] training or one game, if it came down to that, we\u2019d probably be all for it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Canberra mechanic Sharni Williams is leading the women\u2019s sevens team in the Amsterdam tournament this weekend. The Australian team is battling with New Zealand to win the world series crown and the Amsterdam event is the last in the campaign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brumbies, Union News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "ACT Brumbies wing duo Henry Speight and Robbie Coleman are considering a temporary switch to sevens rugby in the hope of winning an Olympic Games gold medal.", "title": "Henry Speight and Robbie Coleman keen on Olympic sevens gold", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/henry-speight-and-robbie-coleman-keen-on-olympic-sevens-gold-20140517-zrfok.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/g/q/t/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zrfok.png/1400328599217.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/g/q/t/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zrfok.png/1400328599217.jpg"}, "title": "Henry Speight and Robbie Coleman keen on Olympic sevens gold", "description": "ACT Brumbies wing duo Henry Speight and Robbie Coleman are considering a temporary switch to sevens rugby in the hope of winning an Olympic Games gold medal.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "ACT Brumbies wing duo Henry Speight and Robbie Coleman are considering a temporary switch to sevens rugby in the hope of winning an Olympic Games gold medal."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd148b\"", "article_summary": "ACT Brumbies wingers Henry Speight and Robbie Coleman are considering a temporary switch to sevens rugby in the hope of winning an Olympic Games gold medal.\nAdvertisementSuperstar Israel Folau has been touted as a possible recruit, while James O\u2019Connor could also make the switch for Olympic gold.\n\u201cThe drive for an Olympic gold is up there with my drive to get into the Wallabies and play at a World Cup.\nSevens players have to be citizens if they want to play for Australia at the Olympics.\nThe Brumbies are willing to find a way for Coleman and Speight to get an Olympic experience, but not at the cost of the club\u2019s Super Rugby plans."}
