But there are enough tidbits to imply that he was a Social Gospel Christian, very much the product of his family\u2019s targeted philanthropy and devotion to liberal Protestantism.\n\nThe grandson of America\u2019s first billionaire, Rockefeller was born into a pious Baptist home where liquor, smoking and profanity were prohibited, family prayers were a daily ritual, and the Sabbath always sacred. His grandfather, John Sr., the builder of an oil empire, was a conventional but not very theologically minded Baptist. His father, John Jr., the heir and only son, was devout but committed to modernizing Christianity under the guidance of experts he would fund. His counsel for philanthropy was Raymond Fosdick, a backslidden Baptist who championed cautiously progressive causes. Fosdick was brother to the great liberal preacher Harry Emerson, a zealous foe of \u201cfundamentalism\u201d who had survived a Presbyterian heresy trial.\n\nJohn Jr. so admired Rev. Fosdick that he funded his tracts and built a cathedral for him on New York\u2019s upper West side, Riverside Church, where Protestantism and modernity were merged together by Fosdick\u2019s sermons and the church\u2019s progressive iconography. The church was and is next door to Union Seminary, once Baptist, and long an academy of liberal Protestantism, also supported by the Rockefellers. In the same neighborhood in the late 1950s the Rockefellers also built the soaring Interchurch Center as headquarters for liberal Protestant denominational and ecumenical agencies.\n\nEarnest, chaste, sober, punctilious, generous, and committed to social uplift, John Jr. and his more exuberant wife Abby raised their five sons to be conventionally moral but theologically liberal Baptists who would perpetuate the family tradition of high-minded philanthropy. Their exertions were partly successful. Young Nelson, himself still chaste, married an upright woman whom he admired, quickly fathering five children. For most of his life he avoided hard liquor, profanity, and smoking. His work ethic never wavered. His commitment to humanitarian causes, political reform, and the arts was perpetual.\n\nAfter helping with the management of Rockefeller Center during the Depression, he spent the rest of his life in public service, starting with appointive positions in FDR\u2019s administration, despite his Republicanism. Always a fervent patriot, Rockefeller worked to counter Nazi and later Communist influence in Latin America. He conferred and socialized with FDR, who remained his lifelong beau ideal as President, and who helped further instill in Rockefeller a lifelong confidence in the power of government to sweepingly reform society.\n\nRockefeller served but did not as zealously admire Truman and Eisenhower. Against expectations, he was elected governor of New York in 1958, a big year for Democrats, the first of four unprecedented terms that would change the face of then America\u2019s most populous and wealthiest state, instantly making him a major presidential contender.\n\nSupposedly former Governor Tom Dewey once told Rockefeller, \u201cI like you but I can\u2019t afford you.\u201d Across nearly sixteen years Rockefeller taxed, borrowed and spent, building highways, hospitals, schools, museums and an ever more expansive social welfare state. He had every confidence that few social problems could not be solved with enough funding and the right experts. Equally lavish with his own personal generosity towards charity, the arts, friends and subordinates, Rockefeller devoted himself to a life of giving. He was garrulous, empathetic, personable and approachable. He wrote long hand-written thank you notes. He charmed elevator operators. He may have had a rich man\u2019s sense of entitlement but he was not a snob and mixed easily with all sorts, including unionized construction workers who appreciated his endless love affair with concrete and construction.\n\nRockefeller was devoted to fighting poverty, environmental degradation, disease, urban blight, and racism. He funded Martin Luther King, Jr., claiming almost no public credit. He was an enthusiast for American democracy and hated Communism. One campaign aide who worked for him, Reagan, and Goldwater claimed Rockefeller was the most passionately anti-Soviet of all of them.\n\nAs governor of New York, through the force of his personality, his political acumen, and his private wealth, he was the unquestioned dominant force across three decades. New York Mayor John Lindsey sarcastically called Rockefeller\u2019s Fifth Avenue apartment \u201cBerchtesgaden,\u201d the name of Hitler\u2019s alpine retreat. Nixon called him one of only three men then in American politics who understood power (including himself and John Connally). Even William F. Buckley acknowledged that Rockefeller, although liberal, would have been a great president.\n\nSupposedly Rockefeller expended his life trying to become president. He ran three times, always haltingly, and throwing away his best chance in the lead up to 1964, when he divorced his wife of thirty-two years to marry a woman who was divorcing her own husband who retained custody of their children. Republican U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, patriarch of his own political dynasty, spoke for many by asking, \u201cHave we come to the point in our life as a nation where the governor of a great state can desert a good wife, mother of his grown children, divorce her, then persuade a young mother of youngsters to abandon her husband and children and marry the governor?\u201d\n\nRockefeller lost and never regained his lead over Barry Goldwater. He was and remained a chronic adulterer. A liberal Christian focused on saving the world, Rockefeller led his children in prayers, prayed on his own, supported the church his father built on Riverside Drive, plus the more modest ecumenical chapel his family built near their estate outside the city. There is no evidence in Smith\u2019s book that Rockeller, so often thoughtful in other human interactions, was morally troubled by his marital infidelities. Morality was societal but not always personal.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Rockefeller led New York to become among the first in the nation to liberalize its abortion laws. His family had long supported population control, and his father had dabbled in eugenics. In 1970 he signed legislation allowing abortion during the first two trimesters. A Catholic-supported campaign to repeal the new law nearly succeeded in 1972, with the legislature voting to overturn, and President Nixon writing Cardinal Cooke of New York backing the church\u2019s stance against the law. But Rockefeller vetoed repeal, just a year before Roe v. Wade. While studying the issue, he found an article citing Aquinas, cluelessly asked a staffer to arrange a meeting, and laughed when told he was theologian of centuries before.\n\nSeven years later, arch-liberal Rev. William Sloane Coffin presided over Rockefeller\u2019s funeral at Riverside Church, which featured favorite hymns like \u201cA Mighty Fortress Is Our God.\u201d From the pulpit, Henry Kissinger, a longtime prot\u00e9g\u00e9, eulogized his patron\u2019s conviction that for America \u201cit is not a burden but God\u2019s blessing conferring an opportunity to oppose tyranny, to defend the free, to lift up the poor, to give hope to the disadvantaged, and to walk truly in the paths of justice and compassion. \u201c\n\nKissinger also added, in a quote that Smith doesn\u2019t include: \u201cI have known no public figure who so often reflected about the spiritual. The Brotherhood of Man and the Fatherhood of God was not a clich\u00e9 for Nelson; it was a call to action, the motive force of his life. He practiced his faith, but he was too humble to preach it. He fought against injustice and fostered equality, but he thought it unseemly to adopt the clamoring tone of protest. He helped the downtrodden, but he thought it demeaning to publicize acts of Christian love.\u201d\n\nIt was a eulogy of which the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick, the iconic modernist Protestant chaplain to the Rockefellers, would have fully approved.\n\nMark D.
