That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be able to see a dentist.\n\nTwo state policy changes rolling out next year are intended to improve access to oral health care for low-income Coloradans. The state Legislature earlier this year voted to expand Medicaid\u2019s dental benefits to adults \u2013 it now only covers children for most kinds of care.\n\nThe change will go into effect around the same time as Colorado expands Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act to those who make slightly more than the federal poverty level.\n\nThe pair of changes is expected to grow the ranks of Medicaid enrollees with dental benefits to 844,491 in 2016, from 348,142 last year, according to a study released last week by the Colorado Health Institute.\n\nBut 17 counties in Colorado don\u2019t have a dentist who accepts Medicaid, the study reported.\n\nSome rural areas simply don\u2019t have dentists at all \u2013 you won\u2019t find one in sparsely populated Kiowa County in the eastern plains or in southern Colorado\u2019s Mineral County, the institute found. In more populous Delta and Elbert counties, there are dentists \u2013 but none who take Medicaid.\n\nIn La Plata County, the number of Medicaid enrollees with dental benefits is expected to rise from 2,556 in 2012 to 7,373 by 2016, which is 14 percent of the county\u2019s population. In La Plata, six of 31 dental practices accept Medicaid patients.\n\nChaffee County ranks among the areas with a low percentage of dentists accepting Medicaid. Cara Russell heads the county\u2019s program to improve oral health, which works to educate people about the importance of good oral hygiene.\n\nPreventive dental care can keep people from showing up in pain at emergency rooms and in need of expensive surgery. Poor oral health also is associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, according to recent studies cited by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut inspiring someone to go to the dentist doesn\u2019t get them there, Russell says. For those living in her area of the state, the nearest dentist accepting Medicaid often is a drive of 65 to 110 miles. At the same time, much of the working population will remain uninsured even as Medicaid expands.\n\n\u201cWe are on the verge of much better care for our underserved population,\u201d Russell said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet, and the transition is going to be painful.\u201d\n\nIn the southeastern Colorado town of Walsh, Carol Morrow is the only dentist in Baca County, population 4,500. She accepts Medicaid, making her office an oasis in a dental desert. Some patients drive hours to get to her.\n\n\u201cI think every person deserves the same kind of care, whether they can afford it or not,\u201d Morrow said. The expansion of Medicaid benefits to adults will allow her to get some compensation for care she now provides for free, she said.\n\nMorrow is participating in a new push by the Colorado Dental Association to encourage more dentists to accept Medicaid as the policy changes unfold.\n\nThe professional group is fighting a perception among some dentists that the paperwork is too cumbersome and reimbursement rates too low and an unfounded fear that Medicaid patients will fail to show up for appointments, says Jennifer Goodrum, who directs the organization\u2019s government relations.\n\nJeff Hurst, who runs a practice in Lakewood, is one of the Colorado dentists who doesn\u2019t take Medicaid. The 40-page application form to become a Medicaid doctor is one barrier. Payment is another reason Hurst stopped seeing Medicaid enrollees. The state is slow to process claims, and the reimbursement doesn\u2019t even cover his office\u2019s overhead costs, he said.\n\nHowever, Hurst is heartened by recent moves by state officials to make it easier to navigate the application and payment process and raise reimbursement rates.\n\n\u201cRemoving these barriers will allow us to treat these patients the same way we treat others,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cThese adults \u2013 some of whom have never had care \u2013 can get introduced to the world of dentistry.\u201d\n\nStill, improving access to dental care is likely to take creative thinking in places as far-flung as Delta County on the Western Slope, Conejos County to the south, and a huge swath of the eastern plains, where Medicaid enrollees far outnumber dentists willing or able to provide services.\n\nExpanding the role of dental hygienists may be one solution, while boosting the capacity of dentists who already see low-income patients may be another route.\n\n\u201cCommunities are gearing up and getting ready,\u201d said Sara Schmitt, one of the authors of the Colorado Health Institute study.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know if they\u2019ll succeed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20131221/NEWS01/131229889/", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "image": "http://www.durangoherald.com/img/dh_200-2.png", "type": "article", "title": "Dental benefits to expand for Medicaid"}, "fb": {"app_id": 263076300371367, "pages": 205518469520233}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1dcd\"", "article_summary": "Almost half-a-million Coloradans are expected to gain dental benefits under Medicaid by 2016.\nThe state Legislature earlier this year voted to expand Medicaid\u2019s dental benefits to adults \u2013 it now only covers children for most kinds of care.\nPreventive dental care can keep people from showing up in pain at emergency rooms and in need of expensive surgery.\nThe expansion of Medicaid benefits to adults will allow her to get some compensation for care she now provides for free, she said.\nThe pair of changes is expected to grow the ranks of Medicaid enrollees with dental benefits to 844,491 in 2016, from 348,142 last year, according to a study released last week by the Colorado Health Institute."}
