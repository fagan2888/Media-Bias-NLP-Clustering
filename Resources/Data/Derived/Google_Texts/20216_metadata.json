WARNING: Video may be disturbing to some viewers.\n\nWMC Action News 5 reached out to Kellogg officials who are investigating the incident.\n\nAccording to Kellogg's spokesperson Kris Charles, the video was recorded at the Memphis, Tennessee, facility in 2014.\n\nCharles also released the following statement on behalf of Kellogg:\n\n\u201cKellogg takes this situation very seriously and we were shocked and deeply disappointed by this video that we just learned of today. We immediately alerted law enforcement authorities and regulators. A criminal investigation is underway as well as a thorough internal investigation. Our investigation revealed that the video was recorded at our Memphis, TN facility, in 2014. We have confirmed that products that could have been potentially affected were Rice Krispies Treats, Rice Krispies Treats cereal and puffed rice cake products, all of which would be past expiration date. Food quality is of the utmost importance to Kellogg Company. We are outraged by this completely unacceptable situation, and we will work closely with authorities to prosecute to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nMemphis residents are disgusted after learning about the video.\n\n\"We could be dealing with people\u2019s health, people getting sick and dealing with children,\u201d Tony Pacasso said.\n\n\"For a person to do something like that, he is nasty, low down, dirty,\u201d Felicia Hayslett said. \u201cHe should go to jail. Go straight to jail.\"\n\nWMC Action News 5 is reaching out to the FDA for comments on this incident.\n\nCopyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.
