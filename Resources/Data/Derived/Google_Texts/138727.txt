Melissa Francis, who now anchors at Fox Business Network, said Friday that network executives at CNBC silenced her a few years ago when she questioned the long-term sustainability of the Affordable Care Act.

“It’s shocking, but it actually doesn’t surprise me because when I was at CNBC, I pointed out to my viewers that the math of Obamacare simply didn’t work. Not the politics by the way. But just the basic math. And when I did that, I was silenced,” Francis said.

“I said on the air that you couldn’t add millions of people to the system and force insurance companies to cover their pre-existing conditions without raising the price on everyone else. I pointed out that it couldn’t possibly be true that if you like your plan, you can keep it,” she added.

She continued, claiming during the segment that CNBC executives met with her after she criticized the massive healthcare law, reprimanding her for “disrespecting the office of the president.”

Francis then launched into what amounted to a very impassioned commercial for the Fox News network, warning her audience to not trust the major news networks, including ABC, CBS and NBC News, to provide the public with accurate reports on the state of the U.S. economy.

“I can tell you first hand, they are willing participants in the campaign to keep the economic truth from you,” Francis said. “Don’t let them do it.”

CNBC is home to market analyst and on-air editor Rick Santelli, the man commonly credited with giving the speech that launched the Tea Party movement.
