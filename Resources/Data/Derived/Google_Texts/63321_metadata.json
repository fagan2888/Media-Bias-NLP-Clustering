The shift is propelled by the Affordable Care Act, which mandates mental health benefits in insurance coverage, and the 2008 mental health parity law, which requires private and public insurers to cover mental health needs just as they do medical conditions by charging similar co-pays, for example.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big change for us,\u201d said Barbara Griswold, a marriage and family therapist in San Jose, Calif. \u201cI spent all of my life setting up this practice where I choose my clients, I choose my hours.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn just the last few months, Griswold has weighed a new contract with a giant health insurer, warned other therapists to watch what they\u2019re signing in payment negotiations and considered the extinction of her own solo practice. \u201cThe idea of me moving into an interdisciplinary practice where somebody else is taking care of my billing, and someone is choosing my clients for me \u2014there is a loss of autonomy that a lot of therapists are frightened about,\u201d Griswold said.\n\nOrganizations that advocate for mental and behavioral health, groups that long complained they were treated as second-class providers, have applauded the federal laws. \u201cSome people have paid for mental health out of pocket because they didn\u2019t have mental health insurance,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Nordal, executive director for professional practice at the American Psychological Association. \u201cI think now they\u2019ll expect their providers to accept insurance.\u201d\n\nBut inclusion into the mainstream has come with some unhappy caveats: Cash was simple. Patients used to paying $150 in cash for a therapy session will, with some limitations, be covered by their health plan.\n\nThat means many therapists will have to figure out innumerable insurance plans and byzantine billing codes for the first time. \u201cA lot of people come to me and they\u2019re almost falling apart,\u201d said Griswold who wrote a book called, \u201cNavigating the Insurance Maze: The Therapist\u2019s Complete Guide to Working with Insurance \u2013 and Whether You Should.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a therapy session with these therapists. Seriously! I had a woman cry on my couch. She was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to do this!\u2019\u201d\n\nTherapists who already accept insurance typically take a big pay cut since insurers negotiate fees that are about half of what they charge for cash visits. Blue Shield of California, for example, recently asked Griswold to accept a 10- to 30-percent discount off of her already discounted rate for patients who will buy health plans through the new online insurance marketplace. She refused and then wrote about the negotiations in her popular newsletter. \u201cI put out in my newsletter, \u2018Do you even know what you signed?\u2019 And people wrote back, \u2018Oh my God, I had no idea!\u2019\u201d\n\nIn many ways, therapists are encountering what medical doctors have complained about for years: the confusing and confounding \u2013 some say hostile \u2013 insurance bureaucracy that providers must tangle with in order to get paid. Therapists are expected to invest in expensive electronic billing software and electronic health records and comply with a tome of regulations.\n\n\u201cJust keeping up with all of that quite frankly is exhausting,\u201d said Erica Savino Moffatt, a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Boston. \u201cIf you\u2019re Jane Therapist hanging her shingle down the office from her home, it used to be the benefit was a better work-life balance and control over your immediate work environment.

Or they are joining large medical groups in which mental health services are part of a continuum of care.\n\nThe changes are part of a remaking of a system that has long treated the mind as separate from the body. \u201cIf you look how many airlines there are today versus 10 years ago; if you look at hardware stores versus Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s; it\u2019s really a monopoly economy,\u201d said Linda Rosenberg, president of the National Council for Behavioral Health. \u201cAnd I think solo practitioners are going to be employees of big systems.\u201d\n\nIn Tacoma, Wash., Dr. Barry Anton works as a clinical psychologist at Rainier Associates, an outpatient mental health clinic staffed by 17 therapists. Solo practitioners \u201cmight find it difficult to succeed in the new environment because the health care delivery system is evolving,\u201d Anton said.\n\nAs insurance companies look to provide mental health care on a large scale, clinics like Rainier Associates are attractive partners. \u201cIt\u2019s been very convenient and efficient for the insurance company to work with a bigger group,\u201d said Anton. \u201cWe only have one tax ID number; we take care of all the credentialing; we take care of all the billing. They cut one check. It\u2019s just more efficient for them.\u201d\n\nPsychologists, psychiatrists and other therapists in larger groups gain bargaining power as well and can demand higher reimbursement rates from insurance companies. \u201cFor those mental health practitioners who can develop group practices where they can provide a full range of services \u2013 from psychotherapy to family therapy to marriage therapy to medication management \u2013 they are going to be in a much better position to negotiate not only with commercial carriers but also with the federal government,\u201d said Nordal of the American Psychological Association.\n\nIn addition to super-sizing mental health practices, mental health providers are beginning to play a bigger role at primary care clinics.\n\nSavino Moffatt is a newly minted graduate who, instead of starting her own practice, saw where the future was headed: She works as a psychiatric nurse practitioner at a large clinic in Boston that is well positioned for the era of integrated medicine. She sits alongside internists and pediatricians who previously didn\u2019t know where to turn to for psychological help with their patients.
