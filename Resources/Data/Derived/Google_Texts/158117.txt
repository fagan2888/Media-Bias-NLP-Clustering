Interstate 70 eastbound was shut down between Federal Boulevard and Sheridan Road for nearly four hours Sunday because of a woman “down on the highway,” according to Denver police.

The woman, who police did not identify, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police did not elaborate on how the woman got on the interstate.

According to CDOT’s website, the road closed at 2:15 p.m. It re-opened just before 6 p.m., Denver police reported.

Eastbound ramps onto the interstate were closed at Federal Boulevard and Sheridan Road but they also have re-opened, Denver police said.
