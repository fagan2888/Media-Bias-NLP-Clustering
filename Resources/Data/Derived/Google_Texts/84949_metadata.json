That is a good start for a movie based on a little-known character that cost $130 million to make, but not impressive given the standards Marvel itself has set.\n\nStarring Paul Rudd as the titular shrinking hero alongside Michael Douglas and Michael Pena, \u201cAnt-Man\u201d posted the second-lowest domestic opening of any of Marvel\u2019s 12 self-produced super-hero pictures, ahead of only \u201cThe Incredible Hulk,\u201d which started its run with $55.4 million in 2008.\n\nThe weekend\u2019s other new film was \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d an inexpensive romantic comedy starring Amy Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, which debuted to a healthy $30.2 million.\n\nThat is an impressive start for a comedian who has never starred in her own movie and on par with Apatow\u2019s most successful release as a director, \u201cKnocked Up.\u201d But it is far below the biggest openings for R-rated comedies, such as last year\u2019s \u201cNeighbors,\u201d which debuted to $49 million. That means it will need a strong run fueled by word-of-mouth to become a major success for Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, -0.50% Universal Pictures.\n\nEmmy-nominee Ms. Schumer, who has ridden a wave of popularity recently fueled by her Comedy Central show \u201cInside Amy Schumer,\u201d drew an audience that was two-thirds female. Opening night crowds gave it an average grade of A-, according to market research firm CinemaScore, giving Universal executives hope that positive buzz could keep drawing crowds for weeks to come. The ideal model is \u201cKnocked Up,\u201d which opened to $30.7 million but ended up with $148.8 million.\n\n\u201cAnt-Man\u201d opened to a solid $56.4 million overseas in countries that represent about half the total global market. Its strongest starts were in the United Kingdom, Mexico and Russia, with Germany, South Korea and China among the major markets left to go.\n\n\u201cTrainwreck\u201d has yet to open internationally, although American comedies rarely are hits abroad.\n\nIn second place at the box office this weekend was Universal\u2019s animated \u201cMinions.\u201d Coming off a huge $115.7 million opening, it dropped 57% to $50.2 million, on the high end of second-weekend declines for family animated films.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Box-office debut brings in $58 million.
