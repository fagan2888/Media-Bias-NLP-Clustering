Since 1988, sex has dropped by 14 percent among teenage females (ages 15 to 19) and 22 percent among teenage males (ages 15 to 19). The latest study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics shows that 44 percent of female teenagers and 47 percent of male teenagers had experienced sexual intercourse at least once.\n\nRelated: The App-Selling Power of Kate Upton\u2019s Cleavage\n\nThe good news? The majority of them used contraception. From 2011 to 2013, 79 percent of female teenagers and 84 percent of male teenagers used contraception the first time they had sexual intercourse. Condoms were the most widely used method of contraception among teenage girls, followed by withdrawal (60 percent) and the pill (54 percent). Use of the emergency \u201cPlan B\u201d or \u201cmorning after pill\u201d came in fourth, reaching 22 percent in 2013, and up from 8 percent in 2002.\n\nAbout 70 percent of 15- to 19-year-old females said their first sexual intercourse happened with a steady dating partner, compared to about 50 percent of 15- to 19-year-old males.\n\nCould all that sex education be working? Are teenagers watching more porn? Do teens have more access to contraception because of Obamacare? Then again, it could be all those episodes of reality TV they\u2019re watching. Last year CNN reported a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research that linked watching MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom to a 5.7 percent reduction in teen births in the U.S. The study found a correlation between higher rates of viewership in certain areas with a bigger decrease in teen births.\n\nRelated: Schools Gamble on Gut-Punch Anti-Drug Programs for Teens\n\nDespite teen births being at an all-time low, the U.S. still leads other developed countries in teen pregnancy. (New Zealand comes in second, followed by England and Wales.) And if parents are worried their teens won\u2019t ever get off their iPhones long enough to have sex, they can relax. Most teens, or two-thirds of adolescents, will have sex by the time they\u2019re 19.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Adolescents may be thinking about sex all the time, but fewer teens are actually doing the deed.
