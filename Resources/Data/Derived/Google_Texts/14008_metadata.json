I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he'd support],\u201d Fairey said.\n\nThe artist did say, however, that he thought Obama was a \u201cquality human being,\u201d but that the president was in a position where his actions were largely dictated by things outside his control.\n\nIn the interview, Fairey also railed against the influence of money in politics, saying \u201cthe entire system needs an overhaul and taking money out of politics would be a really good first step.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFairey's iconic image of a red, white and blue Obama was never officially endorsed by the then-candidate's campaign, as it was based on an Associated Press photograph for which the artist did not have the rights. However, the poster was viewed as an extremely effective tool for communicating Obama's message, with New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl dubbing it \"the most efficacious American political illustration since 'Uncle Sam Wants You'.\"\n\nIn a 2008 thank you note to Fairey, Obama said that the artist's images \u201chave a profound effect on people,\u201d adding that he was \u201cprivileged to be part of your artwork.\u201d\n\nFairey subsequently sued the Associated Press over the poster, seeking a declamatory judgment from the court that his use of the image constituted fair use. He pleaded guilty to contempt of court for manufacturing evidence, and settled the case.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "shepard fairey, artist who created obama 'hope' poster, says disappointed in president, barack obama 2008 campaign, obama hope change, visual arts, political illustrations, street art,", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Shepard Fairey, the artist who created the iconic \u201cHope\u201d poster, said President Obama is \"not even close\" to living up to the ideals expressed in the poster.", "title": "Shepard Fairey, Artist Who Created Obama 'Hope' Poster, Says Disappointed In President", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/shepard-fairey-artist-who-created-obama-hope-poster-says-disappointed-president-1943385", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/05/29/shepard-fairey-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shepard Fairey, the artist who created the iconic \u201cHope\u201d poster, said President Obama is \"not even close\" to living up to the ideals expressed in the poster.", "title": "Shepard Fairey, Artist Who Created Obama 'Hope' Poster, Says Disappointed In President", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/shepard-fairey-artist-who-created-obama-hope-poster-says-disappointed-president-1943385", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/05/29/shepard-fairey-obama.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/05/29/shepard-fairey-obama.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Media & Culture", "published_time": "2015-05-29T02:18:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-29T08:28:10-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/markdhanrahan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Shepard Fairey, the artist who created the iconic \u201cHope\u201d poster, said President Obama is \"not even close\" to living up to the ideals expressed in the poster."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8865\"", "article_summary": "Shepard Fairey, the artist who created the iconic \u201cHope\u201d poster that became the unofficial symbol of Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign, has said that he is disappointed with the Obama presidency.\nIn an interview with Esquire magazine posted Thursday, Fairey said that Obama was \u201cnot even close\u201d to living up to the ideals expressed in the \u201cHope\u201d poster.\n\u201cThere have been a lot of things that [Obama has] compromised on that I never would have expected.\nI mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he'd support],\u201d Fairey said.\nThe artist did say, however, that he thought Obama was a \u201cquality human being,\u201d but that the president was in a position where his actions were largely dictated by things outside his control."}
