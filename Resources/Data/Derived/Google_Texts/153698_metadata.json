Apparently the parent company of Assurant Health, which specializes in health insurance form individuals and small businesses, is selling off or shutting down its insurance arm because, the Associated Press reported last week, it has been losing money since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPOZ reported that several Assurant customers had received a notice (like the one below) saying the insurer would stop coverage in July.\n\n\u201cProphylactic treatment is not a covered benefit as listed in the Exclusion Section of your member contract,\u201d read one customer\u2019s notice. \u201cAs a courtesy we will allow two additional months of prescription coverage for your Truvada prescription. This means you will continue to receive prescription drug card benefits for Truvada at CVSC Specialty Pharmacy until July 1, 2015.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssurant Health\u2019s recent decision to now refuse coverage of Truvada if prescribed as PrEP\u2014an FDA-approved, CDC-endorsed, highly effective and needed HIV prevention intervention\u2014is unprecedented, unacceptable and dangerous,\u201d said Jim Pickett, the director of prevention advocacy and gay men\u2019s health at AIDS Foundation of Chicago. \u201cIt reeks of contempt for, and discrimination of, people vulnerable to HIV. It\u2019s bad for the health of individuals, and it\u2019s bad for the health of our communities. AIDS Foundation of Chicago, with fellow advocates and allies from across the country, is mobilizing now to take a strong stand against this action.\u201d\n\nThat threat prompted a swift reversal by the company. In an email statement to Tracy Baim, publisher of The Windy City Times, Mary Hinderliter, Assurant Health\u2019s Vice President of Communications, wrote: \u201cWe are reversing our decision and will be reaching out to policyholders who received the letter.\u201d\n\nWhile this policy change was swiftly addressed and corrected, the incident raises questions about how many medications are quietly being cut from coverage that may not come to the attention of the media.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "assurant health insurance, hiv/aids, jim pickett, gay news, gay los angeles, gay news california", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Frontiers Media", "description": "This incident raises the question of how many other medications are quietly being denied by insurance companies?", "title": "Assurant Health Insurance Reverses Controversial Policy on Truvada", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 625, "identifier": "https://www.frontiersmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/truvada_0-e1431101825656.jpg", "height": 352}, "updated_time": "2015-05-08T11:23:18-07:00", "url": "https://www.frontiersmedia.com/frontiers-blog/2015/05/08/assurant-health-insurance-reverses-controversial-policy-on-truvada/", "type": "article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-08T08:39:13-07:00", "fb": {"admins": 1023602871, "app_id": 1473823566216826}, "article": {"section": "Frontiers Blog", "tag": "Jim Pickett", "published_time": "2015-05-08T08:39:13-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T11:23:18-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Assurant Health Insurance Reverses Controversial Policy on TruvadaThis incident raises the question of how many other medications are quietly being denied by insurance companies?\n\u201cAs a courtesy we will allow two additional months of prescription coverage for your Truvada prescription.\nA jolt of panic hit HIV/AIDS prevention advocates late Thursday as POZ reported that Assurant Health Insurance would no longer be covering the medication Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent the spread of HIV.\nApparently the parent company of Assurant Health, which specializes in health insurance form individuals and small businesses, is selling off or shutting down its insurance arm because, the Associated Press reported last week, it has been losing money since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\nPOZ reported that several Assurant customers had received a notice (like the one below) saying the insurer would stop coverage in July."}
