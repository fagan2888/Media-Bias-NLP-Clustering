So he was right where he wanted to be in a tie game late in the opener of the College World Series.\n\nTowns delivered a tiebreaking eighth-inning double after Daniel Pinero stole second and third base, and the Cavaliers defeated Arkansas 5-3 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI feel comfortable in the postseason with games on the line. The past couple years I\u2019ve been here and I\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d said Towns, whose 22 RBIs in 26 career NCAA tournament games are a school record. \u201cYou want to rise up for your team and give them a better chance to win. I\u2019ve been able to get the opportunity and succeed sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe Cavaliers (40-22), the 2014 national runners-up, advanced to a Monday game against the winner of a late Bracket 1 game between Miami and Florida. The Razorbacks (40-24) will meet the Miami-Florida loser on Monday.\n\nVirginia took a gutsy offensive approach, matching its season high with five stolen bases on eight attempts, and Connor Jones turned in a solid six-inning start despite struggling with his command.\n\nThe Cavaliers, a No. 3 regional seed and the lowest to make it to Omaha, have won all six of their games in the national tournament. They\u2019ve scored 27 of their 37 tournament runs in the sixth inning or later.\n\n\u201cThat ballgame is kind of how we played the last couple weeks,\u201d coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cConnor Jones certainly didn\u2019t have his best stuff, but he grinded. Our plan coming into this World Series was to be very aggressive and take the fight to the other team, and we did that from an offensive standpoint.\u201d\n\nJosh Sborz (5-2), who started two CWS games last year and is now the Cavaliers\u2019 closer, struck out five of 10 batters in three innings.\n\nArkansas tied it at 3 in the fifth on Andrew Benintendi\u2019s nation-leading 20th home run. That was the second homer of the game at TD Ameritrade Park, which surrendered only three each of the past two years in the CWS. Virginia\u2019s Joe McCarthy had opened the scoring with a drive into the right-field seats in the second.\n\nThe Hogs got a strong outing from Trey Killian (3-5), a ninth-round draft pick of the Colorado Rockies who left with one out in the eighth after Pinero singled for his third hit. Zack Jackson came on, and Pinero stole second and third on back-to-back pitches.\n\nTowns, a 20th-round pick by the Los Angeles Angels, fell behind 1-2 against Jackson, but worked the count full before driving the ball into right field to score Pinero.\n\n\u201cHaving Kenny out there in a tight ballgame, end of a game, I have total confidence in him getting the big hit,\u201d Pinero said. \u201cI knew he would get the big hit and he did.\u201d\n\nPinero, who arrived in Omaha with six steals for the season, had three against the Hogs. That was the most by a player in the CWS since 2004.\n\nErnie Clement added an RBI single in the ninth, and Virginia scored all five of its runs with two outs.\n\nArkansas\u2019 leadoff batter reached base in six innings, including the first four. But Virginia turned three double plays.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get a bunt down, and a lot of times when you don\u2019t get a bunt down, you hit into a double play,\u201d Hogs coach Dave Van Horn said. \u201cGive Virginia credit. Their pitchers got out of some good jams. We had too many runners left on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia's Kenny Towns thrives on the pressure this time of year.
