If you’re looking for a more scientific explanation of football, never fear. Two of our favorite scientists, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, sent out a series of tweets detailing everything from deflategate to the minutia of football physics.

So whether you’re a Patriots fan putting the travails of deflategate on hold while you celebrate a win, or a Seahawks fan nursing your loss, take a second and learn a little bit more about the game.

Nye’s fan loyalty certainly showed:

Wearing my Blue & Green, you can bet I'll be watching- and watching the ball. ;-) pic.twitter.com/wh2Urf0CJW — Bill Nye (@BillNye) February 1, 2015

The Seahawks fan threw some deflategate shade:

Wonder if Brady has trouble controlling the fully inflated ball. Hmmm... — Bill Nye (@BillNye) February 2, 2015

Brady is throwing just fine with the ball at reg psi. 2 more minutes for the Seahawks. My O My... — Bill Nye (@BillNye) February 2, 2015

And he tosses it over to Tyson…

…who was far more technical:

XLIX: The count of this year’s @SuperBowl — the last bastion of Roman Numerals in the universe. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 1, 2015

Efficiency is a good thing: e.g. Arabic Numerals: 888. Roman Numerals: MCCCLXXXVIII. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 1, 2015

And no denying it. The zero is badass: Arabic Numerals: 0. Roman Numerals: <does not exist>. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 1, 2015

Odd: “Patriots" derives from the American Revolutionary war against enemy England. Yet they proudly hail from “New” England. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 1, 2015

Arizona is famous for its holes in the ground. Grand Canyon took millions of years to form. Meteor Crater took a few seconds. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 2, 2015

Near Winslow, Arizona, Meteor Crater (made 50,000 yrs ago) is nearly a mile across, & deep enough to bury a 60-story building — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) February 2, 2015
