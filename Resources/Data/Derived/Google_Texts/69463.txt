If you’re looking to save a few bucks by making your own sparkling red wine at home, let me stop you right there. YouTube user Larry G and his son Noah decided to try their hand at making homemade sparkling red wine using a Sodastream, and the result is nothing short of disastrous. On the bright side, if they had been looking to repaint their kitchen walls, they have the perfect reason to now.

While carbon dioxide tends to escape the initial fermentation process, where yeast consumes the sugars in grape juice to create alcohol, completing the process in a sealed champagne bottle keeps the finished product carbonated. These specially designed bottles have to withstand 90 pounds per square inch, considering the fermentation process creates tremendous pressure, something Larry G and Noah did not take into account.

Sodastream claims it can “turn tap water into sparkling water in under 30 seconds, with no clean-up,” but it clearly doesn’t say anything about red wine to sparkling red wine. Even if you think sparkling red wine is the perfect dinner drink for company during the upcoming holiday season, avoid the mess and head to the liquor store.
