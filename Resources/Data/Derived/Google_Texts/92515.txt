Was it really just three years ago?

On June 29, 2012, The News-Gazette led with coverage of a Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act.

The Associated Press recounted the decision, which upheld the law.

DEBRA PRESSEY wrote a story looking at the potential aftermath.

A table listed how each of the court's nine justices voted in the 5-4 decision.

In the summer of 2012, there was a fall election just months ahead, and candidates for the 13th District seat in the U.S. House — Dr. DAVID GILL, the Democrat challenger, and Republican RODNEY DAVIS — gave JULIE WURTH their reactions to the court ruling, Gill saying he would work to fix "flaws" in the legislation and Davis saying he would work to repeal it.

Just last week, the Supreme Court again upheld a challenge to a different part of the law, this time by a 6-3 vote.

While that was the biggest thing going on in the June 29, 2012, paper, two other items of note made the front page.

Illini MEYERS LEONARD joined the ranks of the NBA, being drafted 11th overall by the Portland Trailblazers.

And then-Rantoul Press reporter MATT DANIELS covered the Rantoul Village Board giving its unanimous approval to a new Easton-Bell facility, the second-to-last step before the enormous structure now standing along Interstate 57 could be built.
