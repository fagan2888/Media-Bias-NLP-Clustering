Mississippi Industries for the Developmentally Disabled or MIDD has a short history in Meridian, but it's a history that stems from the concerned parents of Lauderdale County.

"They were part of an organization, LARC," MIDD Director Bryan Burt said. "I think it was Lauderdale Association for Retarded Citizens. They started this and I think in the same location exactly where MIDD is at 1405 College Drive."

Burt says it was a grassroots group that worked with Lauderdale County to get the program started over 30 years ago.

"It was established in 1982 by some concerned parents," Burt said. "Parents that wanted their children or family members to be in a place where they could be more productive. It started with 7 people in the program and now we have 84 people."

While the industry has grown to encompass nearly 100 workers, the fact still remains that the company was founded as a way for parents to help those in need.

"They were trying to find something that their children who they say the abilities in their children, not the disabilities," said Burt. "They wanted them to have something to do."

Today the company is thriving and relies on outside support from other companies and businesses when it comes to making products and Burt says when they are contacted to make products it goes to show the support from the community.

"I think it's been a win-win situation for the community," Burt stated. "It's allowing people who have disabilities a place to go. It's a socialization situation as well as a place to work. So it's been positive in a lot of ways for them and their families. Again I think what we put back into the community has been a plus for the community as well."
