Pirates have taken over Panama City Beach this weekend.

The occasion is the 5th annual Pirates of the High Seas Fest at Pier Park. The day was filled several events and activities for all ages from live music to fun zones and even a costume contest.

Volunteers with the event say this is the largest turnout ever for the festival.

Del McRey, the Captain of the Pirates of the White Sands explained, "When we're out doing our thing and we're sword fighting and the crowd gets excited and get into it and they are cheering and they're happy. That makes us do our job a little bit better. When they're happy, we're happy, we do a great job and everybody has a fantastic time."

If you missed the pirate party Friday or Saturday, you still have one more day to catch the action .

Sunday, October 11th, the pirates will move to Grand Lagoon at the Captain Anderson's Marina. The fun starts at 1:00 and ends with a fireworks show at 7:30.
