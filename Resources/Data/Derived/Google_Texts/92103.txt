TROY — Troy Police have charged two Troy men with first degree aggravated robbery for holding up the Abbey Credit Union on Wayne Street Friday morning.

Justin Higbee and Jeremy Miller, both 34, have been booked into the Miami County Jail. The two suspects are half brothers.

Higbee allegedly robbed the bank while Miller assisted by driving the getaway car from the scene. Higbee allegedly entered the credit union on Friday and handed a note to a teller indicating he was armed and demanded money.

No one was injured in the incident. Heywood Elementary School was placed on lock down during the initial call, which was lifted once the scene was cleared.

According to Troy Police Department Captain Jeff Kunkleman, the department made the arrests late Friday evening.

Higbee was arrested during a drug trafficking stop in Butler Township at the Red Roof Inn on Miller Lane. Miller was arrested in the 7300 block of Colegrove Drive in Huber Heights on an unrelated charge.

The car and clothing related to the robbery were recovered at the Huber Heights residence on Friday night.

On Saturday afternoon, the note used in the robbery was discovered by a Pleasant Hill landowner — which corresponds with the account and route driven after the robbery provided by Miller — and turned into the Miami County Sheriff’s Office, Kunkleman said.

Kunkleman said Troy Police also issued a search warrant on Saturday at the Red Roof Inn on Miller Lane and recovered several thousand dollars of the stolen money.

This is the third time the bank has been robbed. The last incident was May 19.
