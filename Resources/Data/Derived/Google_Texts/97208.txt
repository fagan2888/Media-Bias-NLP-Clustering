The leader of Colorado’s health insurance exchange is hoping for a busy week.

Kevin Patterson, chief executive of Connect for Health Colorado, told the state Legislative Audit Committee on Monday that about 42,000 people have signed up for 2016 health insurance coverage through the exchange so far.

“We’re feeling really good about where we are,” he said, because that’s about twice the number at the same time last year.

But it’s a long way from the exchange’s goal. The deadline for gaining coverage Jan. 1 is Dec. 15, a week away, and Patterson told the committee he hopes to see 179,000 to 190,000 people insured through the exchange.

“The super majority of people have not signed yet,” he said. “They make decisions as close to the payment date as possible.”

The exchange, which serves as a middleman between people wanting health insurance and insurance providers, knows a large pool of people lost their policies.

That’s because the state Division of Insurance is shutting down Colorado HealthOP, the cheapest and most popular insurance provider on the exchange, as of Jan. 1. Its decision left about 83,000 people hunting for alternatives.

Patterson told legislators he does not know yet how many of the 42,000 new enrollees came from the cooperative.

Rep. Dan Nordberg, a Colorado Springs Republican and vice chairman of the committee, praised Patterson after the hearing but questioned the future of the exchange.

“If more people are coming off the marketplace than coming on, you’re not sustainable,” he said. “It’s a question for all the state exchanges.”

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, handed in 1,300 form letters wrapped in a red bow afterward, calling for an expedited state audit of the exchange.

“We think it’s a top priority,” said Michael Fields, the group’s state director.
