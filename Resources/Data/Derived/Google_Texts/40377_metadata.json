They all agreed the environmental damage caused by the foam outweighed polystyrene\u2019s low-cost ability to keep \u201chot foods hot\u201d and \u201ccold foods cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you have done is remind us that we have to look at the \u2018full cost\u2019 of these products,\u201d said Mayor Terry Tornek to a crowd of several dozen supporters.\n\nThe city will delay the implementation for financially strapped small businesses and for companies with existing contracts to use polystyrene. The ordinance won\u2019t apply to packaging for uncooked meat, poultry, fish, eggs or fresh produce, according to a staff report.\n\nOnce the ordinance is finalized, food providers will have a year to comply.\n\nCity staff estimates the switch to plastic and paper alternatives will run about 4 cents per unit. That might add up to nearly $20,000 annually for some of the city\u2019s most popular takeout joints, but for the average dine-in restaurant it will come in at a less than $3,000 hit per year, according to Gabriel Silva, Pasadena\u2019s environmental programs manager.\n\n\u201cThe problem with polystyrene is that it is a very durable material, it doesn\u2019t biodegrade,\u201d Silva said.\n\nBut it does break up into hard to clean up chunks that float downriver and get consumed by fish and other animals, he said.\n\nSupporters say the ban helps Pasadena reach a \u201czero waste\u201d pledge made in 2014. Polystyrene litter has turned up in the Arroyo Seco River and other nature areas, where environmentalists say it threatens wildlife.\n\nThe city\u2019s trash haulers do not recycle the material because of the cost, so the packaging often ends up in landfills, according to Silva.\n\nMore than 90 cities in California have adopted some form of polystyrene ban, with Berkeley leading the way in the 1980s.\n\nOpponents at the City Council meeting said the ban would hurt small businesses and fail to have a lasting impact because the waste generated by polystyrene would get replaced by its alternatives, many of which contain plastic.\n\nVeronica Perez, representing the California Restaurant Association, said the ban will hurt businesses\u2019 bottom line. The city\u2019s and state\u2019s increased minimum wage, the addition of paid sick leave and the Affordable Care Act have already created strains, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also having to raise their prices to deal with all of these government mandates,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the cost of replacing polystyrene, but the loss of functionality that also concerns businesses, Perez noted. None of the paper or plastic alternatives are as effective at keeping consistent temperatures and protecting against leakage, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pasadena will ban polystyrene food containers after a yearslong grassroots effort to get rid of the foam packaging.The restrictions affect restaurants, grocers and caterers who use the nonbiodegradable material to package prepared food.T", "title": "Pasadena backs citywide ban of polystyrene for food", "og": {"url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/government-and-politics/20160510/pasadena-backs-citywide-ban-of-polystyrene-for-food", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.pasadenastarnews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/pasadenastarnews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Pasadena backs citywide ban of polystyrene for food"}, "twitter": {"domain": "pasadenastarnews.com", "description": "Pasadena will ban polystyrene food containers after a yearslong grassroots effort to get rid of the foam packaging.The restrictions affect restaurants, grocers and caterers who use the nonbiodegradable material to package prepared food.T", "title": "Pasadena backs citywide ban of polystyrene for food", "url": "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/government-and-politics/20160510/pasadena-backs-citywide-ban-of-polystyrene-for-food", "image": {"src": "http://local.pasadenastarnews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/pasadenastarnews.png?052016"}, "site": "@PasStarNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563965297", "iphone": "id503656700", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.pasadenastarnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "breaking news,environment,Pasadena,Pasadena City Council, Local governments", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "breaking news,environment,Pasadena,Pasadena City Council, Local governments"}, "article_summary": "Pasadena will ban polystyrene food containers after a yearslong grassroots effort to get rid of the foam packaging.\nMore than 90 cities in California have adopted some form of polystyrene ban, with Berkeley leading the way in the 1980s.\nIt\u2019s not just the cost of replacing polystyrene, but the loss of functionality that also concerns businesses, Perez noted.\nThe city will delay the implementation for financially strapped small businesses and for companies with existing contracts to use polystyrene.\nPolystyrene litter has turned up in the Arroyo Seco River and other nature areas, where environmentalists say it threatens wildlife."}
