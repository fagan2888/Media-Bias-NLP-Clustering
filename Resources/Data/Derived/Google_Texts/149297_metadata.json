We couldn\u2019t confirm if anyone had fallen victim. But this email, sent en masse, isn\u2019t the most convincing con.\n\nUsually with the subject line \u201cIn arrears from driving on toll road,\u201d it claims to the unnamed \u201cDear customer\u201d that \u201cYou have not paid for driving on a toll road\u201d and you need to click on an embedded link to pay the phony invoice.\n\nIn addition to not addressing recipients by name or E-ZPass account number, other telltale signs that the message isn\u2019t authentic include:\n\nThe purple E-ZPass logo is a close match but lacks the distinct white lines that go through the word \u201cPass.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no reference to any of the 25 toll agencies or state transportation offices that participate in the E-ZPass program.\n\nThe \u201cfrom\u201d line only says \u201cE-ZPass Info\u201d and includes an address associated with WordPress, a publicly available website-creation service.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nIf you get this email, you know what to do: Delete it without clicking on the link \u2013 or even replying, since that alerts scammers to your working email address for possible future spam.\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network.
