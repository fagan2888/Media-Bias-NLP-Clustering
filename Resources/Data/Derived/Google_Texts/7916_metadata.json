Cossette's organization represents Community Health Centers, which are private not-for-profit or public organizations that provide care to underserved populations.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page.

The federal government would inject $2.2 billion of Medicaid expansion money into the Missouri economy, covering an additional 300,000 people, Cossette said, and allow for 4,100 more mammograms and 14,000 more pap smears a year.\n\nCossette said that means more healthy workers for businesses.\n\n\"But also it's just the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nCossette said that Medicaid expansion could help keep hospitals \u2014 some of which are laying off workers \u2014 afloat and especially help rural hospitals, which are often the largest employers in their area.\n\nSupporters of Medicaid expansion say the move would actually save Missouri money. For the first three years, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid. Cossette said if Missouri switches to the new Medicaid plan, the state would save $150 million.\n\nBut opponents say they fear Missouri could be on the hook for a large tax burden when federal payments get lower. Detractors, primarily in the majority Republican Party, have disputed the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion and say extra Medicaid expenditures down the road could jeopardize funding for education. The legislative session ended in May and with no hope for expansion in sight.\n\nCossette said some Republicans are softening their stance and others, such as Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, support Medicaid expansion.\n\nJefferson City resident Steve Shamburger said it just makes sense to expand Medicaid.\n\n\"He's preaching to the choir here,\" Shamburger said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"description": "A lobbyist for not-for-profit and public health centers reiterated the case for Medicaid expansion in Missouri to a crowd of about 30 at the Muleskinners meeting Friday at the Columbia Country Club.", "title": "Health care lobbyist reiterates case for Medicaid expansion", "image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.comhttp://www.columbiatribune.com/sa-a-cossettemug-jpg/image_9cdab3bc-edf9-11e3-b97f-0017a43b2370.html", "width": 250, "height": 379}, "creator": "@JackWitthaus", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "A lobbyist for not-for-profit and public health centers reiterated the case for Medicaid expansion in Missouri to a crowd of about 30 at the Muleskinners meeting Friday at the Columbia Country Club.", "title": "Health care lobbyist reiterates case for Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/politics/health-care-lobbyist-reiterates-case-for-medicaid-expansion/article_388bf6d6-ee04-11e3-b05b-10604b9f6eda.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/cd/9cdab3bc-edf9-11e3-b97f-0017a43b2370/539290a08651f.image.jpg?resize=250%2C379", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "missouri,medicaid,healthcare reform in the united states,social issues,brendan cossette", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A lobbyist for not-for-profit and public health centers reiterated the case for Medicaid expansion in Missouri to a crowd of about 30 at the Muleskinners meeting Friday at the Columbia Country Club."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd826a\"", "article_summary": "A lobbyist for not-for-profit and public health centers reiterated the case for Medicaid expansion in Missouri to a crowd of about 30 at the Muleskinners meeting Friday at the Columbia Country Club.\nSupporters of Medicaid expansion say the move would actually save Missouri money.\nCossette said some Republicans are softening their stance and others, such as Rep.
