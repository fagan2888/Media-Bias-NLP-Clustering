But new rules released by the EPA this week to effectively ban the construction of new coal plants highlight the agency\u2019s deep-seeded transparency problems and questionable scientific methodology.\n\nThe proposed rules prohibit the construction of coal power plants that don\u2019t meet new carbon dioxide standards. While the EPA claims it will still be possible to use coal by outfitting new plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology\u2014a way of storing carbon dioxide underground so it doesn\u2019t end up in the atmosphere\u2014CCS hasn\u2019t been demonstrated to work on a commercial scale.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe EPA is charging ahead with these rules anyway, claiming that the agency has \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d evidence that CSS is possible. Unfortunately, the EPA has a funny way of defining peer-review.\n\nNew documents released from the U.S. Energy Department (DOE) show that the studies relied on by the EPA to prove that CSS is a viable option were performed by DOE, but only peer-reviewed by the EPA itself. Even more alarmingly, DOE couldn\u2019t produce \"a documented or publicly available description for this peer review process.\"\n\nThe EPA\u2019s own Science Advisory Board (SAB) pointed out the peer review of CSS was \u201cinadequate.\u201d But instead of providing actual peer-reviewed evidence to support its regulations, EPA leaders merely argued that the SAB shouldn\u2019t even review those CSS studies.\n\nThis troubling example of the EPA\u2019s political bulldozing trumping actual scientific evidence has a huge impact on future energy costs. DOE projected that utilizing \u201ccommercially available CCS technologies would add around 80 percent to the cost of electricity for a new pulverized coal plant.\u201d That\u2019s an addition of $664 billion to our national electric bill.\n\nDespite the tremendous impact EPA regulations have on our economy, \u201ctransparent\u201d describes its operations like \u201cefficient\u201d does the healthcare.gov roll-out.\n\nThe more we learn about the agency\u2019s operations, the scarier it gets. Former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson not only used a secret email account to conduct business, but created a whole fake person \u2013 \u201cRichard Windsor\u201d \u2013 through whom she funneled official correspondence. And in at least one instance, Jackson used her private email account to contact a lobbyist in violation of federal record keeping laws.\n\nThe EPA also missed a host of red flags, failing to figure out that one of its top climate scientists wasn\u2019t really a CIA agent. For over 20 years, the EPA allowed that employee to take obscenely expensive trips and pull in a hefty paycheck without actually working\u2014all on the taxpayers\u2019 dime.\n\nAs if these management issues weren\u2019t troubling enough, the EPA has allegedly colluded with environmental activists in a \u201csue and settle\u201d legal strategy.\n\nSue and settle is a scheme where activists like the Sierra Club \u201csue\u201d the EPA to force regulatory change. The \u201cindependent\u201d agency then quickly proposes a settlement, the terms of which are negotiated behind closed doors and silenced through myriad non-disclosure agreements.\n\nThe EPA has used this strategy for years to pay millions of dollars in attorney fees to environmental activists and make sweeping regulatory changes. As Oklahoma\u2019s Attorney General notes: \u201cThis appears to be a blatant strategy by the EPA to go around the process and bend the rules to create environmental regulations that have failed in Congress.\u201d\n\nOne of the regulatory results of this scheme is the current Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS). In 2009, environmental activists sued the EPA to force the agency to limit mercury emissions. The resulting rule is projected to be the single costliest regulation in U.S. history. The EPA predicts compliance with this single rule will cost $10 billion per year, but the unintended consequences will cost far more.\n\nIn a current lawsuit challenging the MATS rule, opponents argue the rulemaking procedure was \"substantively and procedurally flawed\" and that the EPA \"artificially skewed the data\" by basing the proposed emissions limits on data from the best performing power plants instead of a representative sample. That\u2019s like using a Ferrari as the baseline for minimum car engine performance standards.\n\nThis lack of transparency would be less troubling if the EPA had less power. But for an agency that costs the economy roughly $353 billion annually in compliance costs, we should demand greater accountability.\n\nSwearingen is a senior research analyst for the Center for Consumer Freedom.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "New rules released by the EPA this week to effectively ban the construction of new coal plants highlight the agency\u2019s deep-seeded transparency problems and questionable scientific methodology.", "description": "New rules released by the EPA this week to effectively ban the construction of new coal plants highlight the agency\u2019s deep-seeded transparency problems and questionable scientific methodology.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "New rules released by the EPA this week to effectively ban the construction of new coal plants highlight the agency\u2019s deep-seeded transparency problems and questionable scientific methodology.", "title": "EPA\u2019s transparency problem", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/195419-epas-transparency-problem", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:40-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/195419-epas-transparency-problem", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-15T09:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Anastasia Swearingen", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T09:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/195419-epas-transparency-problem", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "New rules released by the EPA this week to effectively ban the construction of new coal plants highlight the agency\u2019s deep-seeded transparency problems and questionable scientific methodology.", "card": "summary", "title": "EPA\u2019s transparency problem"}, "dcterms.title": "EPA\u2019s transparency problem"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf4c\"", "article_summary": "But new rules released by the EPA this week to effectively ban the construction of new coal plants highlight the agency\u2019s deep-seeded transparency problems and questionable scientific methodology.\nThis troubling example of the EPA\u2019s political bulldozing trumping actual scientific evidence has a huge impact on future energy costs.\nAs if these management issues weren\u2019t troubling enough, the EPA has allegedly colluded with environmental activists in a \u201csue and settle\u201d legal strategy.\nADVERTISEMENTThe EPA is charging ahead with these rules anyway, claiming that the agency has \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d evidence that CSS is possible.\nIn 2009, environmental activists sued the EPA to force the agency to limit mercury emissions."}
