The city will spend $420 million to raze vacant houses and clear lots; $167 million for new police, fire and EMS vehicles; and $715 million to hire and train workers and for other general upgrades.\n\nSome people, like Eugene Weller and Bishop White, wonder how long it will be before they see and feel a full recovery in the city that once was home to nearly 2 million residents and pulsed to the around-the-clock rhythm of auto assembly lines that kept people working and off the streets.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to better everything, I\u2019m for it,\u201d said White, a 67-year-old retired auto worker. \u201cIf they are going to (just) fix up downtown neighborhoods, no. I ain\u2019t for it. People still live out here. They\u2019re like \u2014 forgotten.\u201d\n\nWhite\u2019s home is one of only four occupied houses on his west-side block and is sandwiched between two empty lots. He wants to buy a lot from the city; crews razed the house that had been there, but the former basement sags and needs more backfill. It\u2019s another example of something the city failed to do right the first time, White said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to put no money in the lot and then have to live next door to this,\u201d he said, pointing in frustration at the hard, pock-marked dirt.\n\nRestructuring won\u2019t be easy. There will be lean years as elected city leaders search for ways to increase revenue.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan has said making Detroit more functional could persuade residents to stay and attract new ones. The city\u2019s population is about 688,000, down nearly 30 percent from 2000 and a far cry from the 1.2 million in 1980.\n\nDetroit\u2019s Land Bank has been awarded $52 million in federal money to demolish at least 3,300 of more than 40,000 vacant structures; about 2,300 are already gone. A public lighting authority also is installing thousands of street lights in once-dark neighborhoods. And Duggan has solicited plenty of community, private foundation and corporate support on a blight eradication plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect", "title": "Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect", "title": "Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/detroit_starts_down_the_road_to_recovery_respect/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/detroit-bankruptcy-recovery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect", "title": "Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/detroit-bankruptcy-recovery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Corey Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfd1\"", "article_summary": "A federal judge on Friday approved outgoing emergency manager Kevyn Orr\u2019s long-term fiscal recovery plan, which calls for $1.7 billion to remove blight, train city workers, hire more first responders and shore up services to improve the lives of Detroit residents.\nMayor Mike Duggan has said making Detroit more functional could persuade residents to stay and attract new ones.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to better everything, I\u2019m for it,\u201d said White, a 67-year-old retired auto worker.\nAnd Duggan has solicited plenty of community, private foundation and corporate support on a blight eradication plan.\nThe city will spend $420 million to raze vacant houses and clear lots; $167 million for new police, fire and EMS vehicles; and $715 million to hire and train workers and for other general upgrades."}
