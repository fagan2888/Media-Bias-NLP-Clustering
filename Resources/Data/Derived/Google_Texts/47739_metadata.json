Cory Gardner in Colorado, who won a seat in the Senate last week; North Carolina state House Speaker Thom Tillis, who also won a Senate seat and Virginia Del. Barbara Comstock, who won a high-profile House race in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. to succeed retiring Republican Rep. Frank Wolf.\n\nNone of them returned messages seeking comment on their contraceptive plans now that the election is over.\n\nSEE ALSO: Biggest losers \u2026 Big O, big government and big labor\n\nBirth control also didn\u2019t appear on the Obamacare agenda laid out by House Speaker John A. Boehner and presumptive Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who instead talked about votes to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act ranging from the individual mandate to the medical device tax.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. McConnell and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican, championed legislation that would ask the Food and Drug Administration to speed up its review of whether contraceptives could be made available safely to adults without a prescription.\n\nDon Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said the Kentucky Republican has not laid out concrete plans to move the proposal forward \u2014 when the GOP will call the shots on the Senate floor \u2014 so he could not give a timeline for legislative moves on over-the-counter birth control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something our members are interested in,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvocacy groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund will be monitoring their approach. The fund\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, said shortly after the election that victorious GOP candidates \u201cwon as moderates, and the American people expect them to govern as moderates.\u201d\n\nPartisan bickering over a woman\u2019s ability to afford contraceptives started with Obamacare, which mandated employers must insure 20 forms of birth control at no cost to employees as part of their company health plans.\n\nDozens of faith-based nonprofits and religiously devout business owners objected, and the Supreme Court last summer ruled closely-held corporations can refuse to cover forms of birth control they object to on moral grounds.\n\nDemocrats raised funds and campaigned enthusiastically against the so-called Hobby Lobby decision, arguing Republicans who championed it were standing in the way of woman\u2019s right to make her own health decisions.\n\nIt was tactic that worked well in 2012, when Mr. Obama retook the White House and Democrats won seats in part because their GOP opponents made heavily criticized comments about women\u2019s health issues.\n\nWhile Democrats tried to roll back the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Republicans started to offer alternatives with months to go before the midterms.\n\nMs. Comstock, who defeated Democrat John Foust in Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, championed over-the-counter contraception during the campaign. It\u2019s a position she\u2019s held since at least January 2013, when as a state delegate she asked then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to speed up review of OTC availability and \u201cput this decision totally in the hands of adult women in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMr. Gardner, a congressman, proposed over-the-counter birth control in an op-ed in The Denver Post in June, shortly before the Hobby Lobby ruling. He then told voters in TV ads that Sen. Mark Udall, his Democratic opponent who voted for Obamacare, wanted the government to stand between women and their health care choices.\n\nThe approach paid dividends, but some doubt the GOP Senate majority will turn campaign pledges into policy.\n\n\u201cThe Hobby Lobby decision was what the GOP wanted \u2014 they were thrilled. So they are happy with the status quo,\u201d said Holly Lynch, an expert on health policy and ethics at Harvard Law School. \u201cMaking things easier for women to access contraceptives seems highly unlikely \u2014 not to mention that OTC contraceptives isn\u2019t really the best goal.\u201d\n\nShe said the health law\u2019s mandate offered a better solution because it made contraceptives \u201ctotally and completely free\u201d for women through their insurance.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee, which sided with Republicans during the Hobby Lobby fight over the mandate because they feared employers could one day be compelled to cover abortions, said it does not plan to wade into any birth control debates on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a position or taken a position on contraceptives,\u201d NRLC President Carol Tobias said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A number of Republican candidates surmounted Democrats' \"war on women\" attacks in this year's campaigns by calling for birth control to be made available over the counter &mdash; but it's unclear whether they'll be able to follow through on those promises when the new Congress convenes next year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A number of Republican candidates surmounted Democrats\u2019 \u201cwar on women\u201d attacks in this year\u2019s campaigns by calling for birth control to be made available over the counter \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll be able to follow through on those promises when the new Congress convenes next year.", "title": "Over-the-counter contraception not on Republican agenda", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/9/over-the-counter-contraception-not-on-repulican-ag/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/119_2014_senate-north-carolina-148201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/09/119_2014_senate-north-carolina-148201.jpg", "description": "A number of Republican candidates surmounted Democrats' \"war on women\" attacks in this year's campaigns by calling for birth control to be made available over the counter &mdash; but it's unclear whet", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Over-the-counter contraception not on Republican agenda"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Virginia Del Barbara Comstock, Supreme Court, Republican Party, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3ed\"", "article_summary": "While Democrats tried to roll back the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Republicans started to offer alternatives with months to go before the midterms.\nThe approach paid dividends, but some doubt the GOP Senate majority will turn campaign pledges into policy.\nMs. Comstock, who defeated Democrat John Foust in Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, championed over-the-counter contraception during the campaign.\nBarbara Comstock, who won a high-profile House race in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. to succeed retiring Republican Rep.
