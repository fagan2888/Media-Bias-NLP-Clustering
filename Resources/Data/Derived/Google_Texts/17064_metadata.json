Callahan said after the game he didn\u2019t know if Orpik pushed him into Holtby.\n\n\u201cI feel that we are writing the book on it and I don\u2019t know what the right answer is because it\u2019s just a different explanation every time,\u2019\u2019 Lightning head coach Jon Cooper said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really, really frustrating. I don\u2019t know, in my eyes only, how that is not a goal. I think something has to be taken into account, too, and take everybody out of the picture and see if the goaltender would have got back. I don\u2019t think he would have, it doesn\u2019t matter who was there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, and I don\u2019t have the answer. . . . We make up a lot of rules to open up scoring and this seems counterproductive. But there were four (officials) out there and they saw it one way, and how can you argue. I guess (they) thought their guy had the chance to make the save, that\u2019s the way the rules are set. We know what the rules are going in, and I guess I shouldn\u2019t get so ticked off because I know what the rules are.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat could have been one momentum swing, but perhaps the biggest came early in the second when Washington took two simultaneous penalties to give the Lightning a full two-minute, two-man advantage at 6:49. But the only quality chance created came when Callahan got a piece of a rebound to put the puck behind Holtby, but the netminder was able to reach back with his stick and pull the puck back before it crossed the goal line at 7:39. That was one of four shots on goal during the 5-on-3 chance, which created just six shot attempts total.\n\n\u201cOur power play needs to capitalize on those opportunities,\u2019\u2019 Callahan said. \u201cThe last couple of games it has definitely been hurting us. Everybody on that power play knows we have to produce when we\u2019re out there, that\u2019s why we\u2019re put out there, to put the puck in the back of the net. As of late we haven\u2019t been doing that, those are big power plays and we have to find a way to get the puck in the net.\u2019\u2019\n\nPerhaps Tampa Bay needs to have more of a shooting mentality.\n\n\u201cMaybe I just got to start blasting the puck and get back to some old habits and good things are going to happen,\u2019\u2019 captain Steven Stamkos said. \u201cEarly on (in the power play), take a few shots on net and if it doesn\u2019t go in, create some scrambles then we can make some plays. We\u2019re trying to be too cute. We have to find a way to be better.\u2019\u2019\n\nWashington instead grabbed the momentum as Backstrom scored on a backhander at 10:33 of the second period and added his second of the night with 1:20 left in the period. Just after the Lightning failed to convert on an early third period power play, Backstrom completed the hat trick at 2:17 of the final period.\n\nJohnson and Carle scored 1:55 apart in the final five minutes to make it close before Eric Fehr scored an empty net goal with 38.1 seconds left to send the Lightning into another loss in which they helped determine on their own, even as circumstances may not have went their way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of our work ethic or anything like that, we just have to bring the mentality to play a full 60 minutes,\u2019\u2019 defenseman Victor Hedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just small things, I think we are on the right track. Obviously one win out of four is not good enough, but we feel we are in a good spot.\u2019\u2019\n\neerlendsson@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7835\n\nTwitter: @erlendssonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 13 Dec 2014 22:38:19 -0400", "Description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tampa Bay was hurt by an early controversial call Saturday night, but the Lightning did little the rest of the way to help themselves.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tampa Bay was hurt by an early controversial call Saturday night, but the Lightning did little the rest of the way to help themselves.", "title": "Controversial call, early penalties hurt Bolts against Capitals", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/controversial-call-early-penalties-hurt-bolts-against-capitals-20141213/", "image": {"width": 2656, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141213/ARTICLE/141219612/EP/1/2/EP-141219612.jpg", "height": 1948}, "updated_time": "2014-12-13T23:02:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tampa Bay was hurt by an early controversial call Saturday night, but the Lightning did little the rest of the way to help themselves.", "title": "Controversial call, early penalties hurt Bolts against Capitals", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141213/ARTICLE/141219612/AR/0/AR-141219612.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-13T22:38:19Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-13T23:02:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca44f\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Tampa Bay was hurt by an early controversial call Saturday night, but the Lightning did little the rest of the way to help themselves.\nJust after the Lightning failed to convert on an early third period power play, Backstrom completed the hat trick at 2:17 of the final period.\n\u201cOur power play needs to capitalize on those opportunities,\u2019\u2019 Callahan said.\n\u201cEarly on (in the power play), take a few shots on net and if it doesn\u2019t go in, create some scrambles then we can make some plays.\nThe result was a 4-2 loss to the Capitals in front of an announced crowd of 18,506 at Verizon Center."}
