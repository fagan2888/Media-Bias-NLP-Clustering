Depending on who you ask, Florida either ranks 49th or 50th in per-person mental health funding.\n\nEither way, at $37 dollars per person, Florida spends one-third of what Mississippi spends and one-tenth of what Maine puts in. And last year, an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune found that budget cuts and neglect at state mental hospitals led to 15 deaths.\n\nCandice Crawford with the Mental Health Association said $1.1 million has been cut from two Central Florida behavioral health hospitals.\n\n\u201cThese cuts result in the closing down of psychiatric beds in these hospitals,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cAnd Florida has experienced so many cuts and a huge influx in population. It\u2019s incalculable how much we\u2019re behind.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is focusing on Florida House Speaker Steve Crisafulli of Brevard County. Crisafulli\u2019s spokesman Michael Williams said his office hasn\u2019t been approached about the proposal.\n\n\u201cIt is curious that this group would only target one legislator from one chamber,\u201d Williams wrote in an email. \u201cSuch actions tend toward a political motivation, rather than a genuine desire to find real solutions.\u201d\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, lawmakers cut $140 million for mental health and substance abuse treatment, according to the Florida Community Health Action Information Network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing that among the half million adults with serious mental illness in Florida, only about 36 percent receive treatment,\u201d said Sita Diehl, director of state policy with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cThat\u2019s just two thirds of the national average. And for a major state like Florida, that\u2019s a national disgrace.\u201d\n\n-- Reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
