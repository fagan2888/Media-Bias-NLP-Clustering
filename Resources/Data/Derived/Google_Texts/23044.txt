Cleveland police say two officers told a 12-year-old boy with a pellet gun three times to show his hands before he was shot to death.

Authorities on Wednesday also released video and audio evidence from the shooting.

Police identified the officers involved in the shooting of Tamir Rice as 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann, who was appointed to the force this year, and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, who's been with the department since 2008.

Police say Tamir was told to raise his hands three times, then reached into his waistband for what appeared to be a firearm. Police later determined it was an airsoft gun, which shoots small plastic pellets.

Police emphasized the video is being released as the boy's family wished, and it was not an effort to "exonerate" or condemn anyone.

The video was made available to media later.
