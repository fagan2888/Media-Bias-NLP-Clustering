It refers to the inability of a woman or man to process their anguish, fear, anger, sadness and guilt stemming from their experience of one or several abortions.\n\nTwo women who have had abortions and were helped by Project Hope spoke to CNA anonymously.\n\nOne of them, 59-year-old \u201cA.A.,\u201d recalled that after her abortion she went through \u201cnights of crying, days of not wanting to get out of bed.\u201d\n\nFor her part, \u201cC.G.,\u201d a 52-year-old psychologist, told of the difficult situation she went through when she was young and her mother forced her to have an abortion.\n\n\u201cI cried a lot and experienced a lot of sadness for years,\u201d she said. She also showed \u201cvery aggressive behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand where it was coming from,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most profound consequence was an anxious, depressed frame of mind I carried around with me for years.\u201d\n\nThe Chilean Psychological Association\u2019s committee said that post-abortion syndrome has nothing to do with the practice itself, but rather the social \u201ccriminalization\u201d of the act.\n\nBut A.A. challenged this.\n\n\u201cI suffered from the need to see and caress my child. No one ever judged me. I\u2019m the one who judged myself, feeling I was the worst of mothers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe reason she was suffering, she said, was that she knew \u201cI had been capable of killing my child who couldn\u2019t even defend himself. My other children were able to play, cry and laugh, but their brother could not. That was the source of my pain.\u201d\n\nC.G. also rejected claims abortion grief is a result of social conditioning.\n\n\u201cWhat I went through had to do with the relationship I formed with the presence of that child that was developing within me, whether wanted or not. He was a child, not a \u2018something\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot protecting that child and not having had the courage to resist having the abortion, developed into a profound sense of sadness that accompanied me for many years.\u201d\n\nDespite the many problems and sufferings the abortions caused, both women said they were able to go forward and rebuild their lives with much spiritual and psychological support.\n\n\u201cI spoke with a priest when I hit rock bottom because of the pain and regret. He counseled me to make reparation and said that the death of my child had a meaning for the other children in danger of being aborted,\u201d A.A related.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult and exhausting. I had to travel a long and painful journey, full of regret and grief. I was only able to do it with the help of Project Hope, in the person of someone who accompanied me for three years,\u201d C.G. said. \u201cThanks to their dedication and the care provided by the project\u2019s professionals I was able to overcome.\u201d\n\nNBPLifeABC\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/04/if-post-abortion-syndrome-doesnt-exist-why-are-these-women-suffering/", "article_author_name": "Catholic News Agency", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman_Hipster_Hoodie_Beach_Fog_CC0_10_CNA_1_28_15.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "abortion, baby, mothers, post-abortion depression, Pro-life, syndrome, women"}, "description": "A psychologist who cares for post-abortive women has emphasized the need to help women who have had abortions heal \u2013 and that these women have their own stories", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman_Hipster_Hoodie_Beach_Fog_CC0_10_CNA_1_28_15.jpg"}, "keywords": "pro-life,abortion,post-abortion depression,baby,women,mothers,syndrome", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If post-abortion syndrome doesn\u2019t exist, why are these women suffering?\nHer comments follow a statement from the committee on gender and sexual diversity at the Chilean Psychological Association which said that post-abortion syndrome does not exist.\n\u201cPost-abortion syndrome\u201d is a phrase often used to refer to the emotional state of people involved in abortions.\nTwo women who have had abortions and were helped by Project Hope spoke to CNA anonymously.\nPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/04/if-post-abortion-syndrome-doesnt-exist-why-are-these-women-suffering/(Courtesy of Catholic News Agency)Santiago, Chile (CNA/EWTN News) \u2014 A psychologist who cares for post-abortive women has emphasized the need to help women who have had abortions heal \u2013 and that these women have their own stories to tell."}
