The video went viral on Facebook, and after Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, showed it to him, he told the girl\u2019s grandmother in a Facebook post to \u201cdry her tears, because I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll still be a citizen just like her,\u201d he added in a response that might not have pacified the girl.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Jarrett said Mr. Obama \u201cis aware of the fact that it is natural for people to have this feeling of sadness.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat he has been trying to do is to reassure people that although he won\u2019t be the president, he is still absolutely committed to moving that arc of the moral universe as a citizen.\u201d\n\nBut the feeling of loss was not just attached to Mr. Obama himself. What had given them hope, many said in interviews, was an achievement that could never be erased even as it slips into history: that a black person can become president.\n\nMr. Vivian said that after Mr. Obama\u2019s election, a woman who had been teaching for more than two decades in Atlanta told him that her black students had started saying, for the first time, that they wanted to be president.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time that any class had been able to think about that, that they could be president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Vivian said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, said Lawrence Ware, a lecturer and the diversity coordinator of the philosophy department at Oklahoma State University, is that \u201cblack families are losing a first family that is a model of a working relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are things that combat the vicious legacy of white supremacy that communicates to African-Americans that you are not beautiful, that you are not intelligent, that you cannot achieve, that your relationships are pathologically doomed for failure,\u201d Mr. Ware, 34, said. \u201cThat symbolism is absolutely powerful and needed.\u201d\n\nBut if seven years under President Obama has opened possibilities for black Americans, many of those interviewed were torn about his lasting impact on race relations.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey were, on one hand, hard-pressed to imagine a white president saying \u201cTrayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,\u201d inviting the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the white police officer who had confronted him to a White House \u201cbeer summit,\u201d or singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at the funeral of the pastor who was one of the nine black churchgoers gunned down in Charleston, S.C., last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are losing a soldier who has actually been through the things that individuals are going through,\u201d said Jakya\u2019s father, Jevon Hobbs, 42. \u201cNone of the current candidates,\u201d he said, \u201cknow what it\u2019s like to be accosted by the police for no reason.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, they said they did not believe a white president would have heard \u201cYou lie!\u201d shouted at him from the floor of Congress; or would have had his birth certificate challenged and then seen a man who challenged it become the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nThrough this filter, many ascribed Washington partisanship to darker motives. Republicans\u2019 repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and refusal to entertain a Supreme Court nominee were, many of those interviewed had no doubt, a result of the president\u2019s ethnicity.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want a black president,\u201d said Willie Mae Burrell, 90, who attended segregated schools as a child and once worked as a cook on the same Havana, Ala., farm where her mother picked cotton. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason he couldn\u2019t get things done.\u201d\n\nThere was some disappointment with President Obama, too, that he had not done enough to relieve the burdens of life in black America, like poverty and high incarceration rates. Ms. Jarrett, his adviser, said the uninsured rate of African-Americans had dropped 50 percent under the new health care law, that incarceration rates had fallen and graduation rates had risen.\n\n\u201cBy objective metrics, the African-American community has made progress during the president\u2019s time in office,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cNow, is there still work left to do? Absolutely. And, the president would be the first to say that he didn\u2019t expect to be able to accomplish everything he wanted to accomplish in just eight years.\u201d\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\nMostly, though, there were questions about whether another black person could be elected president anytime soon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked who could be the next, a few mentioned Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala D. Harris, California\u2019s attorney general, who is running for a seat in the Senate, but most had no ready answer.\n\nThere are signs, though, that the odds of another black president are not insurmountable. A Gallup poll last year found that more than nine in 10 Americans said they would have no problem voting for a black president, about the same as could see themselves voting for a Catholic, woman, Hispanic or Jewish candidate.\n\nBen Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, was briefly a leading contender for the Republican nomination, though many blacks shrugged at his candidacy because of his conservative stances and criticism of Mr. Obama.\n\nAnd the president himself has shown that a black candidate has access to the key to modern campaigning, big money. Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee together raised about a billion dollars in 2012.\n\n\u201cNobody can predict the future,\u201d said Antonio Coye, 44, the manager of the Hyde Park Hair Salon, the president\u2019s old barbershop. \u201cWe can definitely get in there again.\u201d\n\nWhat is certain, in any event, is that next Jan. 20, the book will close on a significant chapter in American history.\n\n\u201cI had a vision the other night,\u201d said Mary Hooks, the co-director of Southerners On New Ground, a gay and transgender rights group in Atlanta. \u201cWhat if a bunch of black people mobilized to D.C. on his last day and just stood out there and gave him a standing ovation and clapped?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give the impression that he\u2019s been so excellent and amazing,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we also want to honor what this has meant for all our people and what it has meant for our ancestors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news",
