Consider it some wanting Westmoreland to show his had for his \u201918 plans, or others who are seeking \u201ctheir turn\u201d, there are some that have an interest in an open seat for Georgia\u2019s 3rd district. For any that are considering that as their next career move, they\u2019re going to have to go through Lynn.\n\nHis statement is as follows:\n\n\u201cIt has been an honor serving the Third District and I am forever grateful for the opportunity,\u201d stated Westmoreland. \u201cJoan and I are blessed to have had your support over the years, and we have made friends throughout the community that will last a lifetime. With that said, I would like to announce that I will be running for reelection in 2016 to continue being your conservative voice in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cOur nation is combating growing threats across the globe. Our national security is at the forefront of many American\u2019s minds. We must do whatever it takes to protect our homeland and those who bravely defend it abroad.\n\n\u201cServing as Chairman of the Subcommittee on NSA and Cybersecurity in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has given me a unique insight into what we are truly facing. I am proud of all we have accomplished in the intelligence community so far, but there is still work to be done. I would like to continue the momentum we have begun and make our nation a safer place for my grandchildren.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s liberal policies are not working. Healthcare premiums are rising because of ObamaCare, our foreign policy is a total failure, and we are giving in to the demands of countries like Iran.\n\n\u201cBut a new chapter has begun in the House of Representatives. We are making meaningful reforms, and Speaker Ryan has allowed more amendments in the last few months than we have had in years. Your conservative voice is being heard. I will keep fighting to protect family values, keep our homeland safe and our military prepared. Together, we can put America back on a path to prosperity and create an opportunity economy for all.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his Subcommittee Chairmanship on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Representative Westmoreland serves on the House Select Committee on Benghazi and the House Financial Services Committee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peach Pundit", "description": "While this may not sound like breaking news, many \u201cwell informed\u201d sources of rumors have said otherwise. \u00a0Consider it some wanting Westmoreland to show his had for his \u201918 plans, \u2026", "title": "Lynn Westmoreland Running For Re-election", "url": "http://www.peachpundit.com/2015/12/07/lynn-westmoreland-running-for-reelection/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T17:08:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T17:12:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "His statement is as follows:\u201cIt has been an honor serving the Third District and I am forever grateful for the opportunity,\u201d stated Westmoreland.\nFor any that are considering that as their next career move, they\u2019re going to have to go through Lynn.\n\u201cServing as Chairman of the Subcommittee on NSA and Cybersecurity in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has given me a unique insight into what we are truly facing.\nI would like to continue the momentum we have begun and make our nation a safer place for my grandchildren.\nWhile this may not sound like breaking news, many \u201cwell informed\u201d sources of rumors have said otherwise."}
