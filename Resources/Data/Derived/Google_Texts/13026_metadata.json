But they\u2019re the oldest, they\u2019re still the biggest, and on occasion, they will throw their weight around on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe new executive director of the caucus, Scott Parkinson, wants the RSC to use that political clout to build policy consensus among House Republicans. A veteran Senate staffer, he says that\u2019s the only way the GOP ever can outmaneuver President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats.\n\n\u201cRepublicans need to stand firm in the principles that got them elected as conservatives,\u201d Parkinson told The Daily Signal. If that happens, he said, it\u2019s possible to make Democrats blink because when \u201cyou have the will of the people in your corner, that stands stronger than any special interest.\u201d\n\nThat requires Republicans to offer a conservative policy agenda, Parkinson said. But the former legislative director to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., lamented the GOP\u2019s lost reputation as the party of ideas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sort of this tone that [Republicans] just vote no and don\u2019t offer an alternative,\u201d Parkinson, who started work in February, said. \u201cBut the RSC will offer an alternative.\u201d\n\nSomething of a small think tank inside Congress, the RSC\u2019s dozen staffers manufacture a full menu of conservative policies each year. That\u2019s where the committee traditionally has made its mark. And indicative of that effort, Parkinson points out that the caucus consistently drafts the most conservative budget blueprint with the lowest amount of government spending.\n\nWhile House Speaker Paul Ryan continues to push a budget deal that spends $1.07 trillion, the RSC\u2019s fiscal package proposes a much lower number: $974 billion. That budget, Parkinson brags, is the most conservative in Congress, balancing and saving taxpayers $8.6 trillion in the next 10 years.\n\nIn addition to big-ticket reform packages such as the budget, health care, and tax reform, RSC staff evaluate every bill and each amendment that crosses the House floor for a vote. With its own policy shop, the group scores all legislation according to its conservative priorities.\n\nThough that evaluation is informative, it\u2019s not necessarily related to the final vote count. Production of policy papers \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean members will vote as a bloc,\u201d Parkinson said, but \u201cmembers look to our analysis and make their own decisions.\u201d\n\nStill, that analytic mentality has been met with some criticism.\n\nOn and off Capitol Hill, some complain the academic mindset combined with ballooning membership has made the RSC lethargic and that its sheer size\u2014about 170 out of 247 Republicans in the House\u2014makes it too big to do anything more than generate dusty policy papers.\n\nThe conservative National Review recently reported that the RSC is making efforts to reclaim its \u201coriginal vision.\u201d That\u2019s a characterization Parkinson flatly rejects, arguing that the group has served as a conservative standard-bearer for Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve strayed from our original vision,\u201d the executive director said. \u201cWhen RSC was formed, it was intended to be a place where conservatives could organize. As it\u2019s grown over time, RSC has been a rallying point for those ideas.\u201d\n\nThe beginning was 1973, when Richard Nixon was president, Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, and the conservative movement first was emerging inside an entrenched GOP minority.\n\nA young staffer for Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., Edwin J. Feulner, took point as the group\u2019s first executive director. Inside Congress, the caucus provided a base of operations to advance conservative policy initiatives\u2013goals that didn\u2019t always align with the priorities of Republican leadership.\n\n\u201cThere was no inside operation that could do the kind of research that members really needed,\u201d Feulner, who soon cofounded The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt was very clear that there should be pressure on the Republican leadership from the right.\u201d\n\nSince then, the group became increasingly influential and a regular clearinghouse for Republican leadership. RSC has a large roster of influential alumni, including seven members who advanced to the Senate, three to governorships, and two to the vice presidency.\n\nBut while RSC\u2019s beachhead in Washington has expanded, its leaders say, the goal remains consistent:\n\n[RSC] exists to bring like-minded House members together to promote a strong, principled legislative agenda that will limit government, strengthen our national defense, boost America\u2019s economy, preserve traditional values and balance our budget.\n\nThe group prides itself on providing the intellectual firepower for many of the biggest battles in Congress. Nonpartisan in its criticism, the RSC has opposed policies proposed by both Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\nIn the 1980s, the RSC drafted tighter budgets that were further to the right than President Ronald Reagan\u2019s. More recently, it has led charges on several policy fights such as the Export-Import Bank, the First Amendment Defense Act, and Obamacare.\n\nThough it evaluates all legislation, the RSC seldom takes official positions. Instead, the group provides analysis, encouraging members to vote independently. But when the caucus does publicly weigh in, that influence can doom a bill before it makes it out of the GOP conference.\n\nPages", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Ever heard of the\u00a0Republican Study Committee?", "dcterms.title": "Behind the Scenes, This GOP Group Pushes Congress to the Right", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/behind-the-scenes-gop-group-pushes-congress-the-right-15743", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/1280px-US_Capitol_Building_at_night_Jan_2006.jpg", "site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "Ever heard of the\u00a0Republican Study Committee?", "title": "Behind the Scenes, This GOP Group Pushes Congress to the Right"}, "dcterms.subject": "U.S. Politics, , Congress, Politics, GOP, Republican, Republican Study Committee", "abstract": "Ever heard of the\u00a0Republican Study Committee?", "description": "Ever heard of the\u00a0Republican Study Committee?", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "Philip Wegmann", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "U.S. Politics, , Congress, Politics, GOP, Republican, Republican Study Committee", "dcterms.publisher": "The Center for the National Interest", "twitter": {"description": "Ever heard of the\u00a0Republican Study Committee?", "title": "Behind the Scenes, This GOP Group Pushes Congress to the Right", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/behind-the-scenes-gop-group-pushes-congress-the-right-15743", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/1280px-US_Capitol_Building_at_night_Jan_2006.jpg", "site": "@thenatlinterest", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, width=device-width", "news_keywords": "U.S. Politics, , Congress, Politics, GOP, Republican, Republican Study Committee"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Study Committee isn\u2019t the newest conservative caucus on the congressional block.\nInside Congress, the caucus provided a base of operations to advance conservative policy initiatives\u2013goals that didn\u2019t always align with the priorities of Republican leadership.\nThat budget, Parkinson brags, is the most conservative in Congress, balancing and saving taxpayers $8.6 trillion in the next 10 years.\nThe group prides itself on providing the intellectual firepower for many of the biggest battles in Congress.\nA veteran Senate staffer, he says that\u2019s the only way the GOP ever can outmaneuver President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats."}
