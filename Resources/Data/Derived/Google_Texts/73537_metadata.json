The day before he charmed his paying audience of liberal 1 percenters, Obama had sent out an e-mail alleging that Republicans were \u201cin the pocket of billionaires.\u201d Does that mean that Republicans who accept cash from billionaire supporters are always in their pockets, but that when the president does likewise, he never is? And if so, on what grounds is he exempt from his own accusations?\n\nIn mid-October, Hillary Clinton gave a short lecture at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas bewailing the crushing costs of a university education. \u201cHigher education,\u201d Clinton thundered, \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a privilege for those able to afford it.\u201d\n\nOne reason tuition and student indebtedness have soared \u2014 UNLV\u2019s tuition is set to go up by 17 percent next year \u2014 is that universities pay exorbitant fees to multimillionaire speakers like Hillary Clinton.

Clinton trolls liberal universities because they are fat sources of campaign money for her 2016 presidential bid. Biden knows that the more he trashes the rich, the more he can get some of the rich\u2019s money without public scrutiny.\n\nModern liberalism is an ideology of the super-wealthy in alliance with those who need government assistance \u2014 often in opposition to the less liberal middle class, which bears the brunt of higher taxes, more regulations, and zero interest on savings. The vast growth of local, state, and federal government and their workforces, the huge increase in pensions and benefits, the spectacular rise in the number of people on government support, coupled with zero interest for those with modest savings, represents a huge transference of wealth from the middle class to those classes beneath them \u2014 even as the resulting booming stock market has enriched the already rich. In some sense, strident populist rhetoric is a psychological tic, an acknowledgment that Obama progressivism has all but destroyed the middle class. When Hillary Clinton and Mark Zuckerberg talk like populists, then we know populism is dead.\n\nThe more liberal the 21st-century multimillionaire sounds, the more likely it is that he believes that not much of his progressive rhetoric applies to himself. In sum, for the plutocratic class and the politicians they buy, faking populism is now an anti-depressant as well as a wise business investment.\n\n\u2014 NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of The Savior Generals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Plutocratic Populism Pays    , by Victor Davis Hanson, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Plutocratic Populism Pays", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Plutocratic Populism Pays", "keywords": "Victor Davis Hanson", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Plutocratic Populism Pays    , Victor Davis Hanson, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Victor Davis Hanson, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3e0\"", "article_summary": "In mid-October, Hillary Clinton gave a short lecture at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas bewailing the crushing costs of a university education.\nIf Hillary Clinton is going to deplore high college costs, could she not settle for $25,000 an hour rather than ten times that?\nWhen Hillary Clinton and Mark Zuckerberg talk like populists, then we know populism is dead.\nIs there a Clinton Tuition Fund, to which Hillary contributes a portion of her honoraria to exempt herself from the ramifications of her own accusations?\nIf Hillary Clinton had had to borrow thousands of dollars for her daughter\u2019s tuition, she might resent huge college speaking fees like her own."}
