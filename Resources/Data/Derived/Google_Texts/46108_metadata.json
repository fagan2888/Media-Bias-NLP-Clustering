Young people were distraught because the fishing industry was nearly dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dream of going to Europe animated everyone until the deaths started to multiply.\u201d\n\nThe sheer number of people presumed to have died en route played a big role in dampening the fishermen\u2019s enthusiasm. They now focus on trying to support themselves at home, difficult though it might be.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Senegal, some fishermen resist lure of Europe migration", "title": "In Senegal, some fishermen resist lure of Europe migration", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Senegal, some fishermen resist lure of Europe migration", "title": "In Senegal, some fishermen resist lure of Europe migration", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/11/in_senegal_some_fishermen_resist_lure_of_europe_migration/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/senegal-migrants.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Senegal, some fishermen resist lure of Europe migration", "title": "In Senegal, some fishermen resist lure of Europe migration", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/senegal-migrants.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Babacar Dione", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of young men who managed to get to Europe didn\u2019t succeed in building something for themselves back in Senegal,\u201d he said.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsTHIAROYE, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Nearly a decade ago, Senegalese fisherman Mor Mar embarked on an illegal sea voyage to Spain, hoping a better life awaited him in Europe.\nPape Omar Diouf, a town elder, remembers how the initial trickle of migrants soon turned into a rush.\nHigh, violent waves turned the boat back, and Mar, 39, never tried to make the crossing again.\nThey now focus on trying to support themselves at home, difficult though it might be."}
