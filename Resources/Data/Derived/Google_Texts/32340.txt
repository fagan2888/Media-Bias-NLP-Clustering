Volunteers with the Guadalupe Center prepared about 2,000 Thanksgiving meals Thursday to feed Immokalee residents, some of who arrived hours early to ensure a good spot in line.

The center’s vice president of development, Katherine Caskey, said more than 200 volunteers came together to make the event happen, along with a lot of food.

“About 500 pounds of potatoes. We have roughly 200 turkeys,” she said.

Alan Cuevas was one of the volunteers. He is from Immokalee back in town visiting from Pennsylvania where he is in his first year of college. He volunteered at the event in high school and said coming back again this year was a no-brainer.

“He's like, ‘Only if you can.’ I'm like, 'Of course I can!”

Agriculture is a huge part of the economy in Immokalee with a lot of residents working in the fields. Cuevas said his father was one of the people picking produce.

“My dad worked in the fields for about 25 years,” he said. “He would take my older brother and I maybe like every month just so we could see how hard it is.”

Waiting patiently in line, Julio Nicolis said he knows first-hand. He used to pick vegetables.

“From bell peppers to tomatoes, onions,” he said.

He said the wages were low and the work was tiresome.

“Work hard in the hot sun and you know they come out all dirty. And for every dollar they pick, it's hard work.”

Caskey said that’s why this event is just a small way to say ‘thank you.’

“It's our chance to give back to the community that serves us. They're doing back-breaking work in the fields all year long.”
