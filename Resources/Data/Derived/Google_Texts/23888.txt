LAS VEGAS, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- The owner of the Nevada brothel at which former NBA player Lamar Odom was found unconscious says the celebrity paid more than $75,000 for his visit.

Speaking with Nancy Grace this week, Love Ranch owner Dennis Hof said Odom charged his credit card for the visit which ended when he was found unconscious.

"That was his number," Hof said. "What he wanted was two girls, 24 hours a day to take care of any of his needs."

The visit, Hof said, was supposed to be four or five days with the cost being $15,000 a day.

In a statement released Thursday, Odom's father and two children -- who are now reportedly beside the Kardashians at the hospital where the athlete is being treated -- asked for prayers.

"Thank you for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad," the statement read. "We are here with our family and friends. We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers."

On Tuesday, Odom was found unconscious by brothel workers from an apparent drug overdose in Crystal, Nev. He was transferred to a Las Vegas hospital where members of the Kardashian-Jenner family and others like former teammate Kobe Bryant have met to be at his side.

According to reports, estranged wife Khloe Kardashian is making medical decisions for Odom as they are still legally married. Despite both signing divorce papers in July, a judgement has not yet entered into court.
