Leadership varies, coming in different sizes and voices.

The Broncos provided an example on Monday, naming their five captains. As voted on by the players, the holdovers were quarterback Peyton Manning and free safety/special teams ace David Bruton. Of more interest were the new faces: defensive tackle Terrance Knighton, defensive end DeMarcus Ware and receiver Demaryius Thomas.

Knighton impacts those around him through humor and candor. Watching him during warmups and at practice, it’s no surprise that he was named captain. Teammates gravitate toward him, listen to him. He has the ability to “be an icebreaker,” unafraid to tackle difficult topics or address tough issues with teammates.

“If it’s an awkward situation or awkward conversation, they know I am going to speak my mind,” said Knighton, who was last a captain his senior year at Temple. “That’s my personality. … Once you have that ‘C’ on your jersey, you are almost obligated to do the right thing.”

Thomas admitted that the honor caught him off guard. If for no other reason, he’s the strong silent type. Teammates recognized his work ethic.

“I don’t know if you all really know, but I don’t really talk much in front of the team,” Thomas said. “I like to lead by example. But I feel like I’ve got a bigger role, so I have got to figure out what I am going to do. I believe I will be fine.”

Ware’s selection came as no surprise. He functions as a coach on the field, and brings a professionalism and focus that’s impossible to miss.

“These guys have shown the work ethic, shown the way they deal with their teammates and shown their leadership ability over the last three-and-half, four months,” coach John Fox said. “A lot of them have made immediate impacts. A guy like DeMarcus. And Demaryius, you’ve seen his growth. It’s kind of fun to see. I feel good about who the players voted for.”
