Now in his post-\u201dLate Night\u201d career, comedian Jay Leno performed a salty routine Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cOur goal here, really, is to set the stage to do some good things for the American people that will create jobs, that will grow the economy and will strengthen the middle class in this country,\u201d says @SenJohnThune.\n\n\u201cOur goal here, really, is to set the stage to do some good things for the American people that will create jobs, that will grow the economy and will strengthen the middle class in this country,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told reporters yesterday.\n\nIn between sessions, members of House and Senate leadership held briefings with reporters and spoke about immigration reform, the Affordable Care Act and the potential for tax reform. Lawmakers returned to Washington, D.C. this afternoon.\n\nBut with the smell of chocolate hanging the air and in between trips to the lodge\u2019s Sweet Memories gift shop to peruse rows and rows of chocolate, Republicans formed their game plan for tackling immigration and Obamacare.\n\n#NoJoke.

Jeff Denham of California told reporters. \u201cThis is a real issue that we\u2019ve got to come to terms with, and it\u2019s time for us to put together a plan, not just principles.\u201d\n\nDenham was one of 26 Republicans who voted against an amendment to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\n\n\u201cI think by adding the deferred action amendment in here, it goes back to a situation that we\u2019ve got kids that came here through no fault of their own\u2014that we need to have a full discussion and debate on that\u2014now are going to be put on top of the list for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to deport, if this were to become law,\u201d Denham said. \u201cI think that sends the wrong message to the American public on what our overall reform ideas are.\u201d\n\nRepublicans discussed immigration during the retreat\u2019s afternoon session, where Denham promised to be vocal on the issue.\n\nA Republican aide attending the session said GOP lawmakers discussion the need to secure the country\u2019s borders and reward immigrants who have gone through the system legally.\n\nWhen speaking to reporters yesterday, Thune reiterated the 60 votes needed to break a Democratic filibuster in the Senate and advance the House-passed bill, and expressed skepticism that the bill would pass in its current form.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we recognize the important role the Department of Homeland Security plans in this country and the fact that it needs to be resourced in order to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to immigration, Obamacare proved the be a hot topic for Republicans at the retreat.\n\nWith a GOP-controlled Congress, Republicans have said they plan to offer their own reforms to the health care law. However, much of the strategy for tackling Obamacare focused on the upcoming Supreme Court case, King v. Burwell, a Republican aide attending the session said.\n\nThe case challenges whether the subsidies offered through Obamacare are available for consumers purchasing health insurance through both the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, and state exchanges. Obamacare opponents contend the law explicitly states that only Americans purchasing insurance through state exchanges are eligible for subsidies.\n\nThe Obama administration, however, believes the case will be dismissed.\n\nThe aide said conversation centered \u201cmoving quickly to show the country Republicans have a patient-centered response\u201d to the case.\n\nGOP lawmakers are also anxious to move forward with tax reform, and they contend that though the president\u2019s priorities may limit their ability to reform the tax code for both individuals and corporations, it is an area where Congress and the president can work together.\n\n.@SpeakerBoehner & Sens.
