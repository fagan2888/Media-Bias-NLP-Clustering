They jailed her, shut down her clinics and censored her writing. She went on to found the group that became Planned Parenthood.\n\nTo Arlington\u2019s Pallesen, Sanger was \u201cMimi,\u201d the diminutive grandma she grew up next door to in Tucson, Ariz., who loved dinner parties and dressing up to put on plays. \u201cShe was a great storyteller,\u201d the granddaughter recalls. \u201cShe listened well, and had presence as if you were the only person in the room.\u201d\n\nPallesen (and her sister, former Arlington School Board member Margaret Lampe) traveled to the Orient under grandma\u2019s auspices to meet world figures from India and Japan. Pallesen recalls watching Sanger solicit a million-dollar donation from philanthropist-biologist Katharine McCormick that eventually led to the birth control pill.\n\n\u201cWhen I was nine years old, I was at a loss about what birth control meant,\u201d Pallesen said.\n\nShe recounted Sanger\u2019s life as the sixth child of 11 born \u201con the other side of the tracks\u201d to a Corning, N.Y. stone mason and a homemaker. \u201cThe only careers for women at the time were domestic service, teaching or prostitution,\u201d Pallesen said. The fact that Sanger\u2019s mother went through 18 pregnancies before dying of tuberculosis led the visionary to believe that women could not prosper without more control over their health.\n\nUnhappy as a housewife, Sanger studied nursing and moved to Greenwich Village where, drawn to socialists and radicals, she began treating tenement women for venereal disease. \u201cShe thought everyone should know about sex,\u201d Pallesen said, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t talk about it\u201d without violating the law. Sanger\u2019s writings on syphilis led to her prosecution, and her first clinic was shut down\u2014after 500 patients\u2014in 10 days.\n\nTravels to France and Holland taught Sanger about birth control not available stateside. \u201cShe had lots of confidence in herself and she met people easily,\u201d Pallesen said, recalling how Sanger persuaded a French winemaker to ship diaphragms to the United States inside bottles and, later, in crates belonging to her oil-magnate second husband. Sanger insisted on a prenuptial that gave her sexual freedom and financial security.\n\n\u201cShe was more about birth control than abortion,\u201d Pallesen said. \u201cI wish I\u2019d listened\u2014I didn\u2019t get good information growing up.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, when Pallesen\u2019s job at Aetna insurance left Arlington, she helped raise the initial $4,000 that launched the free clinic \u201con a shoestring\u201d out of her home.\n\nToday it has a modern green building at Columbia Pike and South 11th Street and provides the full range of services to Arlington\u2019s income-qualifying uninsured.\n\nA few patients will qualify for the Affordable Care Act insurance exchange that opens for enrollment Oct. 1. But for most, Pallesen said, \u201cthe clinic will still be here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Obamacare about to land, the executive director of the Arlington Free Clinic held forth last week on...the historic birth-control activist Margaret Sanger.\r\n\r\nNancy", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.3.5", "og": {"site_name": "Falls Church News-Press Online", "description": "With Obamacare about to land, the executive director of the Arlington Free Clinic held forth last week on\u2026the historic birth-control activist Margaret Sanger.
