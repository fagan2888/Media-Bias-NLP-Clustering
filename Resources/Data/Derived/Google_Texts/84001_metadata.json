Fellow veterans Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg deliver perhaps their hardest verses in recent memory on \u201cIssues\u201d and \u201cOne Shot, One Kill,\u201d respectively. But Dre\u2019s outstanding production - with help from Dem Jointz, DJ Dahi, Focus. and more - is what makes \u201cCompton\u201d enthralling. Verses from Kendrick Lamar and newcomer King Mez also shake things up.\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time, I shot a (person) on accident. I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing. That\u2019s when I realized banging wasn\u2019t for everybody,\u201d Lamar rhymes on \u201cDeep Water,\u201d which begins with the gut-wrenching sounds of a man splashing, and gasping for air.\n\n\u201cLoose Cannons\u201d is sonically bananas, with its shifting sound beds, which transition seamlessly between rolling drums, heavy metal-inspired strings and more, while Xzibit, Cold 187um and Sly Pyper take turns on vocals. The song concludes with a chilling skit that ends with a woman being shot then buried.\n\nPerhaps the album\u2019s most shocking line comes by way of Eminem on the otherwise clever \u201cMedicine Man.\u201d In a rapid fire verse about dismissing consequences and murdering rappers on every Dre-provided beat, Em spouts off about raping b-words who enjoy it - a poor way, perhaps, of describing how even his critics and competition relish his bars.\n\nAnger is ever-present on \u201cCompton,\u201d but there\u2019s reflection, too. \u201cAnimals,\u201d which counts DJ Premier among its producers, captures that emotion and puts things into perspective. \u201cStill tryna figure out, why the (expletive) I\u2019m full of rage,\u201d Dre raps, later adding, \u201cJust a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us.\u201d\n\nIt is a question that needed answering at the start of Dre\u2019s career, and it is a question that could use an answer now.\n\n____\n\nFollow Melanie J.
