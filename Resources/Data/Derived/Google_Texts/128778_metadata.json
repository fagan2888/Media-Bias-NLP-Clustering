(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIt is important for us all to vote, even if it is for the lesser of two evils. Anybody who doesn\u2019t vote sabotages our democracy. If many people don\u2019t vote, the results are not really the desire of American citizens. Worst of all, people not voting could cause the worst candidate to become president (read, Donald Trump).\n\nWe cannot have a president who focuses on bigotry. I worry about what the world leaders think of Trump, especially leaders of Islamic nations. I have serious misgivings about Trump being commander-in-chief. Violence has happened only at Trump rallies. Unfortunately, Trump\u2019s success has been unpredictable time and again. Don\u2019t think that he would never get elected.\n\nIt is not so cut and dried about Hillary Clinton. The email situation depends on whether the message was classified at that time. Many people have an opinion of Clinton that has been molded by Republican propaganda, especially \u201cpathological liar.\u201d I ask anybody who has that opinion, \u201cDo you really trust any of the candidates?\u201d All politicians will distort the truth in order to get votes. Lincoln was called \u201cHonest Abe,\u201d but that isn\u2019t today\u2019s politicians. Clinton is the best qualified. Her idea to improve Obamacare is the way to go.\n\nIf Bernie Sanders becomes the nominee, I would vote for him mainly as the lesser of two evils. Some of his ideas can\u2019t be implemented. He has not said how he would pay for his ideas, especially free college tuition. Taxes is a dirty word.\n\nLester Hemphill\n\nWhiting\n\nMORE LETTERS\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/27bqXmN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lesser of two evils is better than the worst of two evils", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Lesser of two evils is better than the worst of two evils", "title": "LETTER: Vote, even if you have reservations", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/05/10/letter-vote-even-reservations/84191786/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lesser of two evils is better than the worst of two evils", "title": "LETTER: Vote, even if you have reservations", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bc40fc44c9281d99afb4bef778518bd6260498b5/c=121-0-606-485&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/10/AsburyPark/B9322092157Z.1_20160510145652_000_GPNEAO6H5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)It is important for us all to vote, even if it is for the lesser of two evils.\nIf many people don\u2019t vote, the results are not really the desire of American citizens.\nIf Bernie Sanders becomes the nominee, I would vote for him mainly as the lesser of two evils.\nI worry about what the world leaders think of Trump, especially leaders of Islamic nations.\nAnybody who doesn\u2019t vote sabotages our democracy."}
