Aetna plans to offer individual plans in part of Maine on the Affordable Care Actâ€™s health exchanges, bringing more competition to the market.

A filing with the state indicates Aetna will join Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in offering individual plans in the new year. Aetna already offered individual plans but they were outside the health insurance exchanges.

Emily Brostek from Consumers for Affordable Health Care in Augusta, Maine, says Aetna has proposed providing individual plans in nine counties.

All told, more than 84,000 Mainers are signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The next open enrolment begins on Nov. 1.
