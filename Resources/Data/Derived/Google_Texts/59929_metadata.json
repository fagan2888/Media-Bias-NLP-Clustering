I have heard many teachers using it as a tool for class because they see how students could revisit many of the concepts learned American history and American literature. Being an English teacher, I love its use of motifs that permeate great literature, especially the use of the crossroads.\n\nA crossroads represents that a choice is about to be made which can carry everlasting consequences. Often times that choice involves a deal with the devil. For you literary types, think Faust or Irving\u2019s \u201cThe Devil and Tom Walker\u201d. Even Oedipus makes a fateful decision at a crossroads, killing his father and then, well you know.\n\nBack to the movie. The protagonists, led by George Clooney\u2019s character, stop their car at a crossroads and pick up Tommy Johnson, an African-American man standing there with his guitar. Tommy claims that he met the devil at that crossroads the night before and sold his soul in exchange to play \u201cthis here guitar real good.\u201d When asked about what the devil looks like, Tommy describes him as a white man with \u201cempty eyes and a big hollow voice.\u201d\n\nThis past week while following my Twitter feeds, I was introduced to a virtual crossroads, complete with a loaded choice, a deal with the devil, and the potential to violently alter the future. And it was all because of Karl Rove, the architect of Crossroads GPS (Grassroots Policy Strategies), a non-profit corporation that is an extension of the Crossroads Super PAC.\n\nI find it ironic that the logo for Crossroads GPS is a crossroads that looks just like the one that Tommy Johnson visits in the Coen brothers\u2019 movie. The irony goes further when you see how Steven Law states on the official website that \u201cCrossroads GPS is dedicated to holding Washington\u2019s feet to the fire on the practical issues that will actually improve our country and our lives.\u201d Get it? Devil, fire\u2026?\n\nRove is currently spending copious amounts of money in states where an incumbent Democratic senator is in a close race with a Republican challenger. In my home state of North Carolina, Crossroads GPS is airing commercials on social media berating Kay Hagan on her education record and praising Thom Tillis on his work to help public schools. You can watch HERE.\n\nWhen the devil makes a deal at the crossroads, he usually speaks in half-truths and offers a tempting package to those who are willing to play, and in this case he is asking for North Carolinians to vote for Thom Tillis. But that would be like selling our souls to the devil, because when it comes to public education, Tillis has been no saint.\n\nThe ad claims, \u201cWhile Kay Hagan\u2019s budget shortfalls caused teacher furloughs and painful cuts to salaries, Thom Tillis fought to increase funding every year. He also gave teachers historic pay raises.\u201d The ad then goes into an almost humorous explanation as to why Tillis is the man for us.\n\nThe first \u201cfact\u201d brought up is that \u201cHagan\u2019s budget left behind a $3 billion shortfall\u201d in 2009. It seems ironic that Rove and Tillis are placing that blame on Hagan. Actually, it was because of a great recession caused by unregulated actions on the behalf of Wall Street and other shady finance practices left unchecked. All states, not just North Carolina, were faced with the same shortfall. That\u2019s why Hagan was elected to go to the US Senate \u2013 to help reverse the economic trends that were championed by President Bush, who was then advised by Karl Rove.\n\nNext the ad talks about teacher furloughs and teacher pay cuts because of the aforementioned shortfall. Wrong again. Our pay was not really cut; it was frozen. Under \u201cHagan\u2019s\u201d budget, teachers would have received salaries based on a step-scale schedule that would actually be paying teachers more right now than that historic pay raise Tillis is touting. And the furloughs were because of lack of revenue, mostly due to the fact that under Tillis\u2019s leadership, North Carolina gave massive tax cuts to the wealthy and to corporations. And he also led the fight to stop Medicaid expansion in the state which cost us more money.\n\nThe half- truths told in the last part of the ad highlight Tillis\u2019s claim that he increased school funding over 1 billion dollars under his leadership. And he is right, but that is not the whole story. While he has \u201cincreased\u201d funding, North Carolina has sunk to 48th in the nation on per pupil spending. Seems contradictory, does it not? Well, the fact is that North Carolina\u2019s population is growing and more and more students are in public schools. But that extra billion dollars in funding does not even come close to the amount needed to maintain the level of per pupil spending North Carolina had when Hagan was in the General Assembly.\n\nAnd then as the final exclamation point, the ad makes reference to that \u201chistoric\u201d pay raise.\n\nArt tends to portray real life, whether it is presented in films or in literature. Yet, what makes art most powerful is that it illustrates, predicts, and even warns us of what can happen if we make the wrong choices or poisonous deals. In short, it teaches us. What I have learned is when a man with \u201cempty eyes and a big hollow voice\u201d tells you that there is a \u201cclear choice on education\u201d in the race for Senator in North Carolina and that it is Thom Tillis, then he is selling you a lie.\n\nRemember that 30 seconds of an ad orchestrated by a man with who does not even live in our state cannot begin to disguise what the North Carolina General Assembly under the leadership of Thom Tillis has done to hurt our public schools and our state.\n\nStuart Egan, NBCT\n\nWest Forsyth High School\n\nClemmons, NC", "article_metadata": {"description": "thom \"teachers don't care\" Tillis\r\n\r\nFilm and literature have that wonderful quality of not only imitating life and giving us a clearer picture of human nature,", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Camel City Dispatch", "description": "Film and literature have that wonderful quality of not only imitating life and giving us a clearer picture of human nature, but they can instruct us on how to better our lives and make wise choices...", "title": "Guest Editorial \u2013 Oh Thom Tillis Where Art Thou?", "url": "http://www.camelcitydispatch.com/guest-editorial-oh-thom-tillis-where-art-thou-6874/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.camelcitydispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/o-THOM-TILLIS-facebook.jpg?fit=400%2C400", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index, follow", "keywords": "ads,American Crossroads,Camel City,Camel City Dispatch,CCD,Dark Money,editorial,education,educator,forsyth county,guest,Kay Hagan,news,North Carolina,policy,politics,Stuart Egan,Super PAC,teacher,teachers,Thom Tillis,Twin City,Winston-Salem,", "google-site-verification": "M5UynTDbxVlY5MEymUyZ0jsy7GIkpboOvqv3FfKuBjg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd5a\"", "article_summary": "The ad claims, \u201cWhile Kay Hagan\u2019s budget shortfalls caused teacher furloughs and painful cuts to salaries, Thom Tillis fought to increase funding every year.\nWhile he has \u201cincreased\u201d funding, North Carolina has sunk to 48th in the nation on per pupil spending.\nIn my home state of North Carolina, Crossroads GPS is airing commercials on social media berating Kay Hagan on her education record and praising Thom Tillis on his work to help public schools.\nAll states, not just North Carolina, were faced with the same shortfall.\nAnd the furloughs were because of lack of revenue, mostly due to the fact that under Tillis\u2019s leadership, North Carolina gave massive tax cuts to the wealthy and to corporations."}
