Go to your local state health department that administers WIC and talk to them about \u2018What can we do to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among WIC participants? Can we have the policy to support them using their WIC cash value vouchers for fruit and vegetables at farmers markets?\u2019\u201d Tagtow explained during the lecture at Utah University.\n\n\u201cPolicy dictates everything\u201d she said during the lecture. She also called for \u201cfood system reform\u201d to accompany the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen we make decisions about how food is grown and what food is grow, the quality and quantity and biodiversity of food that\u2019s grown here in this country, it directly affects the status of our food system,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the status of our food system directly affects our healthcare system.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think healthcare reform is really going to be as effective as it could be if we had food system reform as well?\u201d\n\nTagtow\u2019s views are in line with many members of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), which is placing a strong emphasis on environmentalism and climate change as it crafts the new nutrition standards for 2015.\n\nIn previous meetings the committee has suggested Americans move to more \u201cplant-based diets,\u201d and lifestyle interventions to fight obesity.\n\nThe committee, which will hold its next meeting on July 17, has been criticized as politically motivated and for putting environmentalism over nutrition science. Released next year, the guidelines will be used to craft policy for federal nutrition programs.\n\nJeff Stier, a Senior Fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, said Tagtow\u2019s appointment is troubling, and a sign that the government is doubling down on infusing environmentalism into the guidelines.\n\n\u201cHere you\u2019ve got the USDA\u2019s top person on nutrition education who has made a career out of making sustainability central to how we eat, rather than healthy diets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that Angela Tagtow is sympathetic with this point of view\u2014which would be problematic\u2014she\u2019s a cheerleader for these points of view,\u201d Stier added.\n\n\u201cHer appointment sends the clearest message we have yet of which direction the USDA is going, political science or nutritional science,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd certainly Tagtow comes from an ideologically divisive perspective. She\u2019s not someone who\u2019s views are mainstream in the nutritional community.\u201d\n\nTagtow said she is very happy to be brought on as executive director for the crafting of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to be appointed as executive director and I\u2019m thrilled to work with the outstanding staff at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion for the USDA,\u201d she said. \u201cTo assist with spearheading dietary guidance and be connected with many important programs that provide healthy food access to the entire country is a thrill as a dietitian.\u201d\n\n\u201cI especially look forward to shaping key nutrition education messages and the launch of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 2015,\u201d Tagtow said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Angela Tagtow calls for \u2018social justice\u2019 in food policy", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has hired an environmental nutrition consultant to oversee its Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which has already faced criticism for introducing climat", "title": "USDA Hires Environmentalist Food Activist to Oversee Dietary Guidelines", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/usda-hires-environmentalist-food-activist-to-oversee-dietary-guidelines/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP995982025083-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has hired an environmental nutrition consultant to oversee", "title": "USDA Hires Environmentalist Food Activist to Oversee Dietary Guidelines", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP995982025083-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@LizWFB", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce57b\"", "article_summary": "Tagtow explained her definition of a sustainable food system during a guest lecture at Utah State University in 2011.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has hired an environmental nutrition consultant to oversee its Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which has already faced criticism for introducing climate change into nutrition policy.\n\u201cWhen we make decisions about how food is grown and what food is grow, the quality and quantity and biodiversity of food that\u2019s grown here in this country, it directly affects the status of our food system,\u201d she said.\nShe also called for \u201cfood system reform\u201d to accompany the Affordable Care Act.\nShe\u2019s not someone who\u2019s views are mainstream in the nutritional community.\u201dTagtow said she is very happy to be brought on as executive director for the crafting of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans."}
