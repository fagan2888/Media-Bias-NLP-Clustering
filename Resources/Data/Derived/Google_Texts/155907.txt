For my sins, I’m debating Stephen Moore next week, so I’ve been doing some reading. And one assertion on Moore’s part actually sent me off to do some research. In an attack on Obamacare, he ridiculed the administration for taking credit for an expansion of Medicaid:

How is putting more people on Medicaid a triumph? Medicaid is a welfare program. If this were a well-functioning economy with good jobs, Medicaid rolls would be shrinking and Americans would be coming self sufficient.

Leave aside the question of whether supply-siders know anything at all about how to achieve prosperity; even when prosperity does come, or at least when they can claim it has come, how does this affect health insurance? Specifically, how did insurance rolls evolve during the reign of Saint Reagan?

The standard Census data don’t go back that far, but the CDC has made estimates for the population under 65. As you can see from the chart, Morning in America did nothing to boost insurance — in fact, the share of Americans with private coverage declined, and because Medicaid din’t grow the overall rate of uninsurance rose from 12 percent in 1980 to 15.6 percent in 1989.

In other words, nothing in the economic record — not even the record of the great conservative hero — suggests that you can grow your way into universal health coverage.
