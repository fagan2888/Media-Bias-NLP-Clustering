Check.\n\nForeign leaders as caricatures? Check.\n\nSightings of Russian invaders? Check that too.\n\nYup, welcome to the new Cold War.\n\nThe relationship between Russia and the West, fraught by any measure, this week devolved into something looking more like a ridiculous Cold War parody film from the 1960s than any sort of modern diplomatic arrangement.\n\nRelated: Why Putin May Be the Lesser of All Russian Evils\n\nOn one hand, there was Russian President Vladimir Putin, practically smirking at the news that his proxy fighters in Ukraine had driven government troops out of the contested city of Debaltseve.\n\nTo the soldiers who were injured and killed under rocket and artillery fire even while in full retreat \u2013 by weapons plainly provided by Russia \u2013 Putin offered the sort of consolation one might toss off to the loser of a football game: \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to lose. But life is life; it just goes on. No need to dwell on it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, there was the release, in Germany, of a documentary supposedly detailing Putin\u2019s early years as a KGB agent in East Germany. Among the supposed revelations: Putin used to be a drunk, lazy, fat, wife-beating incompetent, who resorted to plastic surgery in order to create his current persona that highlights fitness and vigor.\n\nRelated: Vladimir Putin: 17 Things You Never Knew About Him\n\nGod only knows what\u2019s true, what\u2019s exaggerated, and what\u2019s completely false in the movie\u2019s hash of accusations. That it should arrive now, at a time when heightened tensions guarantee extra public interest, should inspire at least more than usual skepticism.\n\nAs if things weren\u2019t weird enough already, the British government reported Thursday that, for the second time in less than a month, it had to scramble fighter jets to intercept nuclear-capable Russian bombers that were spotted flying off the coast of the United Kingdom.\n\nOne British paper even reported a citizen\u2019s (otherwise unsubstantiated) claim that she had seen the Russian planes flying over British land. The former head of the Royal Air Force, Sir Michael Graydon, told the media that the UK is now \u201cat the mercy\u201d of Russian air power.\n\nRussia, despite its obvious aggression in Ukraine, and its refusal to admit its involvement there, is not currently at war with the West. Actual proxy war, though, is about a trigger-pull away.\n\nThere\u2019s more than a strong argument that Russia\u2019s aggression in eastern Ukraine needs to be driven back, as well as punished economically. But inflaming public opinion unnecessarily in an already volatile situation has a distinctively Strangelovian feel.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The coverage of Russia\u2019s aggression in Eastern Ukraine has been justifiably withering, but thinly source media reports on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019 past, and equally dubious reports of Russian bombers over England sound more alarmist than informative.", "title": "Even More Evidence We\u2019re in a New Cold War", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Even-More-Evidence-We-re-New-Cold-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07222014_Putin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Even-More-Evidence-We-re-New-Cold-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07222014_Putin.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The coverage of Russia\u2019s aggression in Eastern Ukraine has been justifiably withering, but thinly source media reports on Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019 past, and equally dubious reports of Russian bombers over England sound more alarmist than informative.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Yup, welcome to the new Cold War.\nRussia, despite its obvious aggression in Ukraine, and its refusal to admit its involvement there, is not currently at war with the West.\nRelated: Vladimir Putin: 17 Things You Never Knew About HimGod only knows what\u2019s true, what\u2019s exaggerated, and what\u2019s completely false in the movie\u2019s hash of accusations.\nThe relationship between Russia and the West, fraught by any measure, this week devolved into something looking more like a ridiculous Cold War parody film from the 1960s than any sort of modern diplomatic arrangement.\nOne British paper even reported a citizen\u2019s (otherwise unsubstantiated) claim that she had seen the Russian planes flying over British land."}
