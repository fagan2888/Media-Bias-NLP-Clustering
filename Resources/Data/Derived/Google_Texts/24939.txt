Best Applause Line: Take your pick. “We need to abolish the I.R.S.” “We need to repeal every word of Obamacare.” Or, “Twenty months from now, imagine a commander-in-chief who stands up and says with utter clarity, we will destroy radical Islamic terrorism.” And finally, “If only the terrorists attacked a golf course, that might actually get the White House’s attention: ‘Holy cow, this is serious.’” Most of the Republicans ate up all of it and more.

Crickets: Only during Mr. Cruz’s brief history lesson about the Kurdish forces known as the pesh merga, who he views as key to defeating the Islamic State.

Local Pander: He recalled that snow was on the ground a few weeks ago when he visited New Hampshire, which was enjoying 60-degree weather in Nashua on Saturday. “Springtime is here!” he said to grateful chuckles.

Sideswipe: Only implicitly, when he said his Senate vote on the confirmation of Loretta E. Lynch as attorney general would be “unambiguously no.” Senator Lindsay Graham, who spoke to the Republicans an hour before Mr. Cruz, supports Ms. Lynch.

Clinton Critique: Nothing substantive. He joked that he thought he saw Mrs. Clinton’s van outside the Republican gathering. “But I’m pretty sure y’all don’t have any foreign nations paying speakers, right?” – a reference to some of the overseas donations received by the Clintons’ family foundation.

Mood in Room: The crowd couldn’t get enough of Mr. Cruz, interrupting him frequently with applause and cheers.
