He was among 35 people to be \"co-chairs\" of President Obama's re-election campaign and continues to help with fund raisers. He just hosted the President at his San Francisco home last week.\n\nBenioff told Post reporters Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein:\n\n\u201cA friend in need is a friend indeed. Silicon Valley is a friend of President Obama\u2019s, and we\u2019re going to help the government get through this,\u201d Benioff said. ... Benioff said he had \u201coffered to rebuild the entire HealthCare.gov site for free and run it for five years at no charge\u201d in direct talks with the White House, but the administration declined the offer.\n\nA White House official said the administration could not have accepted the offer, because it ran afoul of federal contracting rules.\n\nSo instead, he assigned two employees to help fix the website, doing what he described as \u201ccoaching and mentoring.\u201d He didn't charge the White House for their work, he said.\n\nEmployees from other big U.S. tech companies also helped out including IBM, Google, and Rackspace.\n\nBenioff is considered one of the fathers of cloud computing. The site he founded, Salesforce.com, is a website that helps large companies interact with their customers and is one of the biggest \"software-as-a-service\" cloud computing companies around.\n\nWe reached out to Salesforce.com and asked if the company had further comment.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Julie Bort", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff offered to fix the HealthCare.gov website at no charge, and run it for free for five years.", "creator": "Julie188", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/benioff-offered-to-run-obamacare-site-2013-12", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/529fad12ecad048327db2386-506-253/cloud-computing-guru-marc-benioff-offered-to-fix-healthcaregov-for-free-and-the-white-house-said-no.jpg", "title": "Cloud Computing Guru Marc Benioff Offered To Fix Healthcare.gov For Free And The White House Said No", "site": "bi_enterprise", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "enterprise,sai,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Cloud Computing, Salesforce.com, Marc Benioff, Healthcare.gov, Julie Bort", "description": "Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff offered to fix the HealthCare.gov website at no charge, and run it for free for five years.", "author": "Julie Bort", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-04", "sailthru.title": "Cloud Computing Guru Marc Benioff Offered To Fix Healthcare.gov For Free And The White House Said No", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/529fac896da811df73db2388-50-50/cloud-computing-guru-marc-benioff-offered-to-fix-healthcaregov-for-free-and-the-white-house-said-no.jpg", "news_keywords": "Cloud Computing, Salesforce.com, Marc Benioff, Healthcare.gov, Julie Bort", "tbi-image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/529fac896da811df73db2388/cloud-computing-guru-marc-benioff-offered-to-fix-healthcaregov-for-free-and-the-white-house-said-no.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-12-04", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/julie-bort"}, "sailthru.description": "Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff offered to fix the HealthCare.gov website at no charge, and run it for free for five years.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff offered to fix the HealthCare.gov website at no charge, and run it for free for five years.", "title": "Cloud Computing Guru Marc Benioff Offered To Fix Healthcare.gov For Free And The White House Said No", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/benioff-offered-to-run-obamacare-site-2013-12", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/529fad12ecad048327db2386-1190-625/cloud-computing-guru-marc-benioff-offered-to-fix-healthcaregov-for-free-and-the-white-house-said-no.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Cloud Computing Guru Marc Benioff Offered To Fix Healthcare.gov For Free And The White House Said No", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/529fac896da811df73db2388/cloud-computing-guru-marc-benioff-offered-to-fix-healthcaregov-for-free-and-the-white-house-said-no.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "enterprise"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd274a\"", "article_summary": "...
