MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blasted the network for what he called “BS” coverage of the turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting death of Michael Brown and a grand jury’s decision not to indict the officer who killed him.

Mr. Scarborough said the “final straw” was when several St. Louis Rams players entered the field for pregame introductions Sunday night with their arms raised in the air as an act of support for Ferguson demonstrators.

“I’m sorry, this Ram thing, this was the final straw for me,” the former Republican congressman said Monday on “Morning Joe,” Business Insider reported.

“I have sat here quietly and listened to BS being spewed all over this network and all over other networks. I can’t take it anymore,” he said.

Mr. Scarborough railed against the black community for exalting Michael Brown as “the face of black oppression.”

“There are so many great people to embrace as heroes in the black community that deciding you’re going to embrace a guy who knocked over a convenience store, and then, according to grand jury testimony, acted in ways that would get my children shot … that’s your hero? That’s the reason you want to burn down black businesses?” he asked.

Mr. Scarborough also lashed out at some of his show’s guests for agreeing with him privately but refusing to express their views on air, Business Insider reported.

“You know what pisses me off too is I have people around this set all the time. They let me say what I say on set and they sit and stare at me, slack-jawed,” he said. “They’re afraid to say anything on the air, even though they know it’s BS. People [are] saying one thing when the camera’s on and then saying something completely different when the camera gets turned off, because they’re somehow afraid they’ll be called racist if they tell the truth.”
