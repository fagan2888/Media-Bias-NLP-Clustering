A 20,000 square foot Boys & Girls Club will be the first new development on Commerce City’s remediated, 65-acre Greyhound Park site in fall 2015.

The new Suncor Boys & Girls Club will move its operations two blocks from its current spot inside Kearney Middle School at 6160 Kearney St.

The club will take up about 2.5 acres at Greyhound Park, which is one of the largest urban infill projects in metro Denver.

“One way of achieving our vision of a ‘Quality Community for a Lifetime’ is measuring the opportunities available to our youth,” Commerce City Mayor Sean Ford said in a statement. “Investing in the Suncor Boys & Girls Club meets that objective, providing a return on investment for generations to come.”

The new Suncor Boys & Girls Club will include a STEM lab, art room, learning center, teen center, commercial kitchen and full-sized gymnasium.

City officials said that since the original Boys & Girls Club opened at Kearney Middle School in 2007,enrollment has skyrocketed. The new building will serve more than 1,000 children, which is double the capacity of the existing space.

The $4.3 million project is funded through startup grants and a capital match campaign by the city, which is 92 percent complete.

Funding for the Boys & Girls Club was jumpstarted in 2011 by a $1 million grant from Suncor, a $250,000 capital commitment from Commerce City and a $166,000 U.S. Housing & Urban Development appropriation from Rep. Ed Perlmutter.

The city has also appropriated an annual operating budget of $80,000for regular maintenance and upkeep of the new club. The project is moving through zoning and permitting in the city quickly to meet the scheduled fall 2015 opening.

The remaining 8 percent of the city’s fundraising goal still needs to be met. All donations will be matched on the dollar, thanks to private financiers, officials said.
