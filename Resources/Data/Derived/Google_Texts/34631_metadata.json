Main St. in Cambridge City, opened April 6.\n\nTwo family nurse practitioners will oversee the care offered.\n\nThe clinic offers hours Monday through Saturday.\n\nHenry County Hospital has opened a satellite office in Cambridge City to serve patients in Wayne, southern Randolph and Fayette counties.\n\nCambridge City Family Health Partners opened April 6 at 415 E. Main St. in Cambridge City.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of patients driving to New Castle from Wayne County. This is a convenience for them,\u201d said Ricci Atchison, public relations and marketing director for Henry County Hospital in New Castle. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great first week. The community has embraced us.\u201d\n\nExperienced and board certified family nurse practitioners Juli Taylor and Toni Wilcher are working at the office to provide care for infants, children, teens and adults. Licensed practical nurse Julie Blaase and medical assistant Brandi Jessee are assisting with care.\n\nPatient care offered will include acute problems such as the flu or minor illnesses as well as chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. If further specialized care is needed, staff will provide referrals to specialists at Henry County Hospital in New Castle or other facilities.\n\nOccupational medicine services also will be available for local businesses, along with sports, school and camp physicals.\n\nThe clinic will be open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday and 8 a.m. to noon Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve set these convenient hours because we know it often is hard to arrange schedules to coincide with the usual office hours offered by most family medicine offices,\u201d Taylor said in a press release.\n\nTaylor said in most cases, an appointment can be made on the same day a patient calls. Walk-ins also are welcome, she said, however patients with appointments will be given preference.\n\nAtchison said work began on the property several months ago. She said the inside of the building on the National Road/U.S. 40 was gutted and completely remodeled. Now that the weather is improving, Atchison said work will begin to improve the building\u2019s exterior and the parking lot.\n\nOne or two open house events will be scheduled for the coming months, Atchison said.\n\nIf you go\n\n\u2022What: Cambridge City Family Health Partners, a division of Henry County Hospital in New Castle\n\n\u2022Where: 415 E.
