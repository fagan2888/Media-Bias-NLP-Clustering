They had a meeting with a Vietnamese man named Quang who they hoped would become their manufacturing partner.\n\n\u201cWe thought we had to look older for our meetings,\u201d Carter recalls, adding that they did not exactly anticipate the sweltering heat of Vietnamese summers.\n\n\u201cOur partner wound up walking past us a couple times,\u201d Carter says of the man they had been introduced to through a loose connection and only communicated with via email up until that point. \u201cTurns out, he thought we were a middle-aged married couple, and that Austin was my wife.\u201d\n\nToday, not only is Quang their business partner, but he also oversees a fleet of up to 5,000 Vietnamese needlepointing experts who craft elephants, martinis, college logos and the like onto Smathers & Branson products from their small rice village.\n\nAs for Branson and Carter, their namesake line of belts, wallets, key fobs and other accessories (the \u201cSmathers\u201d is drawn from Carter\u2019s middle name) is now found in roughly 1,800 locations nationwide. They boast an average growth rate of 67 percent year over year, while Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have all been spotted in their American flag belt. And this year, they debuted a collaboration with that small purveyor of all things prep, J.Crew.\n\n\u201cEveryone told us we were crazy. Everyone told us it was a terrible idea,\u201d Branson says. \u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t have started it if we didn\u2019t really think it had legs. Ten years later, we still think it can grow well beyond where it is now. And right or wrong, that\u2019s the optimistic outlook that entrepreneurs should have: that it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\nWith Might and Maine\n\nBranson and Carter first met as undergraduates at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Hailing from South Carolina and Maryland, respectively, they found the campus a supportive environment for entrepreneurial young men and women.\n\n\u201cWe were certainly very enamored by [the idea of running a business],\u201d Branson says. \u201cWe spent a lot of late nights talking about business ideas. Of our 10 or so best friends from college, eight probably have been entrepreneurs, and I think another six probably currently still are running businesses.\u201d\n\nAsked why the pursuit was so popular, Branson muses it was a result of either encouragement or stupidity. He does cite witnessing the growth of Vineyard Vines, a preppy retail company launched by brothers Shep and Ian Murray, as highly influential. As Carter explains, the brothers were the first to succeed in the space and \u201cplanted a seed that let us know that something like that was possible.\u201d\n\nThe idea for a needlepoint belt company, which Branson and Carter admit comes across as incredibly niche, struck during their junior year.\n\nBranson and Carter both happened to be dating young women who serendipitously both gifted them with hand-stitched belts they had made. Maisie Lynch, the young woman who crafted Branson\u2019s belt, married him in 2008.\n\nThe duo was overwhelmed by compliments from friends and students wondering where they could purchase their own belts. At the time, one belt, by Branson\u2019s estimation, required hundreds of dollars of materials and days to stitch.\n\n\u201cIt was never really available. You had to have someone make one for you, so to some extent it was creating an untapped market,\u201d Branson says. \u201cThe idea was to start our own company that sold the finished product.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, as seniors, Branson, Carter and their still half-baked idea found an unlikely mentor in Bowdoin\u2019s then-President Barry Mills, who took a meeting with the eager young men and remains a Smathers & Branson fan to this day, playing in a game of golf with Carter just this week.\n\nMills introduced the boys to invaluable contacts like Matt Rubel, who was formerly CEO of both Cole Haan and Payless Shoes. He also helped them establish an independent study during their senior spring semester where one business and one design professor advised them on strategy and product development.\n\nThey meticulously studied the space to understand the hurdles they were up against and resolved to begin their business just after graduation, and a summer spent saving up money teaching tennis lessons. Luckily, as Carter points out\u2014citing statistics of how many business partnerships break apart due to distrust or clashing personalities\u2014their business relationship was as balanced and productive as their friendship had been.\n\n\u201cPresident Mills took a bunch of meetings with us,\u201d Carter says. \u201cThat is not the responsibility of a college president, but he was an important part of [our development]. That piece of time at Bowdoin, when we were able to do this kind of on school time, gave us a huge head start.\u201d\n\nLiving Modestly, Working Tirelessly\n\nIn the fall of 2004, after graduating and pooling savings, Branson and Carter moved into Branson\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Maryland and settled on a company name, forming an LLC and contacting Quang.\n\nThey worked to get their designs just right, and they placed their first order\u2014very careful to not overspend or over-order, an ethos the company retains to this day. They lived modestly and worked tirelessly.\n\n\u201cWe say we never borrowed money [for the business] or anything like that, but we were also lucky enough to have Mrs. Branson cook us dinner for a year and a half,\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to pay for food, they probably paid the Internet bill, and we had a free place to live. Support is almost as good as money in some ways, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nThe boys also had the help of Bob Branson, who, despite not being an entrepreneur per se, had managed his own accounting firm and knew the ins and outs of launching a business from the ground up. Carter\u2019s parents also hosted the two in South Carolina while they traveled to expos.\n\nThe first batch of belts arrived in 2005, and the traveling salesmen were off, operating out of the back of Carter\u2019s Jeep and traveling up and down the East Coast. Their first few vendors were specialty stores in Washington, D.C.\u2019s Georgetown neighborhood and in Charleston, S.C. Their business grew almost entirely by in-person meetings and word of mouth, but not without hiccups.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, with all the production issues, getting the quality to where it needed to be, I mean we\u2019ve had all sorts of setbacks,\u201d Branson says. \u201cMy dad always jokes that he saw so many times he thought it was over, and we\u2019d figure out a way to work around it and get through. The simple answer [to our success] is finding the resolve to keep going as things go wrong.\u201d\n\nThey grew slowly and eventually found companies calling, asking for appointments to see the product. Over the years, fortuitous and unsolicited mentions and product placements (one in The New York Times, another on Bravo) helped.\n\n\u201cWe can only grow as fast as we stitch,\u201d Branson says. \u201cWe pick a new product, we pick a couple new things we want to do \u2026 but they\u2019re incremental rather than revolutionary, year by year.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, a then-19-year-old intern named Chris Piper answered Smathers & Branson\u2019s office line and fielded a request from a store in New York he had never heard of named \u201cBrockton and Goodman.\u201d He politely told them he was sorry, but they were extremely busy, and yes, Austin and Peter would try to squeeze them in while in New York if they could find the time.\n\nIt turned out to be luxury titan Bergdorf Goodman.\n\n\u201cI hung up the phone and Peter and Austin asked me, \u2018Who was that?\u2019\u201d Piper, who is now the company\u2019s director of Wholesale, says with a laugh. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, it was someone who has a stores in New York I think called Brockton Goodman. Their eyes lit up and they said, \u2018Do you mean Bergdorf Goodman?\u2019 I still had no idea what Bergdorf Goodman was, but I quickly Googled it and realized they were a big player. It\u2019s been a running joke since.\u201d\n\nDespite\u2014or potentially because of\u2014the mix-up, Bergdorf\u2019s did business with Smathers for five years, opening up new customers and markets to the brand.\n\n\u2018Stick to What You\u2019re Good At\u2019\n\nToday, Branson and Carter employ roughly 30 people in their office in suburban Maryland, where Branson\u2019s very large, very furry Goldendoodle named Moose stands guard. A long way from their days cold-calling retailers, they now find themselves playing the role of seasoned vet at expos and trade shows, which they say are filled with a new generation of 20-somethings eager to prove themselves.\n\n\u201cWe went through our twenties in this business, and are becoming adults in this business,\u201d Carter says.\n\nAsked what advice he\u2019d offer up to newcomers, Branson remains pragmatic, citing hard work, luck and an honest assessment of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u201cEvery business needs a little bit of luck to survive. We believe the hard work we\u2019ve put in since day one has helped earn us a lot of the luck that we\u2019ve needed to make it for ten years,\u201d he says, adding that he encourages other entrepreneurs to \u201cstick to what you\u2019re good at.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a good track record, but if we stretch too much outside of our niche, we may end up damaging the core of the business that we worked so hard to build,\u201d he says.\n\nLast year, after 10 years of sharing a desk with Branson, Carter moved to California\u2014not out of any grand business strategy, but to be closer to his new wife\u2019s family. Happily, he says, it\u2019s forced the duo to become even more focused as they rely heavily on very regimented schedules to coordinate calls.\n\nThey have developed partnerships with Pottery Barn, Brooks Brothers and, most recently, the aforementioned collaboration with J.Crew, which features a belt, a key fob and a card holder. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be called on by small brands and obviously big companies,\u201d Branson says.\n\nDespite big-name success, they maintain that their bread and butter is specialty stores, colleges, yacht clubs, golf courses and the like. They take pride in the fact that their product, heritage-driven, is, in their eyes, timeless.\n\nIt\u2019s clear their optimism has not wilted despite years gone by and shifting realities. \u201cWe recognized that we had very little to lose when we were in college,\u201d Branson says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have wives or mortgages or anything.\u201d\n\nAsk the duo where they think they are in terms of long-term expansion, and they\u2019ll insist they\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot in the pipeline that we want to do,\u201d Branson says. \u201cWe have the sort of confidence that either we will have screwed up or something will have changed with the global economy if we\u2019re not able to double, triple, really grow from where we are now. We look at ourselves and still think we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "College friends Austin Branson and Peter Carter turned an idea into a booming business in 10 years time.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "College friends Austin Branson and Peter Carter turned an idea into a booming business in 10 years time.", "title": "How Two Friends Turned Needlepoint Into Big Business", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Smathers-and-Branson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-10T13:07:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PaTT49"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "College friends Austin Branson and Peter Carter turned an idea into a booming business in 10 years time.", "title": "How Two Friends Turned Needlepoint Into Big Business", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Smathers-and-Branson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-08-07T11:52:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T13:07:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Smathers & Branson, needlepoint, small business, fashion, retail, Austin Branson, Peter Carter, Bethesda, Maryland"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2085\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe went through our twenties in this business, and are becoming adults in this business,\u201d Carter says.\n\u201cWe recognized that we had very little to lose when we were in college,\u201d Branson says.\n\u201cWe were certainly very enamored by [the idea of running a business],\u201d Branson says.\nEveryone told us it was a terrible idea,\u201d Branson says.\nLast year, after 10 years of sharing a desk with Branson, Carter moved to California\u2014not out of any grand business strategy, but to be closer to his new wife\u2019s family."}
