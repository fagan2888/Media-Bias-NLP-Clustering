A fast-moving snow storm is expected to dump up to 6 inches on the metro area starting Monday evening, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

The snow should end Tuesday morning.

“It is going to be moving out pretty quickly,” said Bob Kleyla, a NWS meteorologist.

Snow totals are expected to range from 2 to 6 inches in the metro area, 4 to 8 inches over the Eastern Plains, and 6 to 12 over the central mountains, Kleyla said.

Mild weather will return by Wednesday, with sunny skies and a high temperature in Denver of 54 degrees.
