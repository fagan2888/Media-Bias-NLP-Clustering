The teams vied furiously for the ball. The all-star feminist team tried repeatedly to kick it through the goalposts marked Widespread Social Problems, while the opposing team, staffed by the mainstream media and mainstream dudes, was intent on getting it into the usual net called Isolated Event. To keep the ball out of his net, the mainstream\u2019s goalie shouted \u201cmental illness\u201d again and again. That \u201cball,\u201d of course, was the meaning of the massacre of students in Isla Vista, California, by one of their peers.\n\nAll weekend the struggle to define his acts raged. Voices in the mainstream insisted he was mentally ill, as though that settled it, as though the world were divided into two countries called Sane and Crazy that share neither border crossings nor a culture. Mental illness is, however, more often a matter of degree, not kind, and a great many people who suffer it are gentle and compassionate. And by many measures, including injustice, insatiable greed, and ecological destruction, madness, like meanness, is central to our society, not simply at its edges.\n\nIn a fascinating op-ed piece last year, T.M. Luhrmann noted that when schizophrenics hear voices in India, they\u2019re more likely to be told to clean the house, while Americans are more likely to be told to become violent. Culture matters. Or as my friend, the criminal-defense investigator who knows insanity and violence intimately, put it, \u201cWhen one begins to lose touch with reality, the ill brain latches obsessively and delusionally onto whatever it\u2019s immersed in \u2014 the surrounding culture\u2019s illness.\u201d\n\nThe murderer at Isla Vista was also repeatedly called \u201caberrant,\u201d as if to emphasize that he was nothing like the rest of us. But other versions of such violence are all around us, most notably in the pandemic of hate toward and violence against women.\n\nIn the end, this struggle over the meaning of one man\u2019s killing spree may prove to be a watershed moment in the history of feminism, which always has been and still is in a struggle to name and define, to speak and be heard. \u201cThe battle of the story\u201d the Center for Story-Based Strategy calls it, because you win or lose your struggle in large part through the language and narrative you use.\n\nAs media critic Jennifer Pozner put it in 2010 about another massacre by a woman-hating man,\n\nI am sick to death that I have to keep writing some version of this same article or blog post on loop. But I have to, because in all of these cases, gender-based violence lies at the heart of these crimes \u2014 and leaving this motivating factor uninvestigated not only deprives the public of the full, accurate picture of the events at hand, but leaves us without the analysis and context needed to understand the violence, recognize warning signs, and take steps to prevent similar massacres in the future.\n\nThe Isla Vista murderer took out men as well as women, but blowing away members of a sorority seems to have been the goal of his rampage. He evidently interpreted his lack of sexual access to women as offensive behaviorby women who, he imagined in a sad mix of entitlement and self-pity, owed him fulfillment.\n\n#YesAllWomen\n\nRichard Martinez, the father of one of the young victims, spoke powerfully on national TV about gun control and the spinelessness of the politicians who have caved to the gun lobby, as well as about the broader causes of such devastation. A public defender in Santa Barbara County, he has for decades dealt with violence against women, gun users, and mental illness, as does everyone in his field. He and Christopher Michaels-Martinez\u2019s mother, a deputy district attorney, knew the territory intimately before they lost their only child. The bloodbath was indeed about guns and toxic versions of masculinity and entitlement, and also about misery, clich\u00e9, and action-movie solutions to emotional problems. It was, above all, about the hatred of women.\n\nAccording to one account of the feminist conversation that followed, a young woman with the online name Kaye (who has since been harassed or intimidated into withdrawing from the public conversation) decided to start tweeting with the hashtag #YesAllWomen at some point that Saturday after the massacre. By Sunday night, half a million #yesallwomen tweets had appeared around the world, as though a dam had burst. And perhaps it had. The phrase described the hells and terrors women face and specifically critiqued a stock male response when women talked about their oppression: \u201cNot all men.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the way some men say, \u201cI\u2019m not the problem\u201d or that they shifted the conversation from actual corpses and victims as well as perpetrators to protecting the comfort level of bystander males. An exasperated woman remarked to me, \u201cWhat do they want \u2014 a cookie for not hitting, raping, or threatening women?\u201d Women are afraid of being raped and murdered all the time and sometimes that\u2019s more important to talk about than protecting male comfort levels. Or as someone named Jenny Chiu tweeted, \u201cSure #NotAllMenare misogynists and rapists. That\u2019s not the point. The point is that #YesAllWomen live in fear of the ones that are.\u201d\n\nWomen \u2014 and men (but mostly women) \u2014 said scathing things brilliantly.\n\n\u2014 #YesAllWomen because I can\u2019t tweet about feminism without getting threats and perverted replies. Speaking out shouldn\u2019t scare me.\n\n\u2014 #YesAllWomen because I\u2019ve seen more men angry at the hashtag rather than angry at the things happening to women.\n\n\u2014 #YesAllWomen because if you\u2019re too nice to them you\u2019re \u201cleading them on\u201d & if you\u2019re too rude you risk violence. Either way you\u2019re a bitch.\n\nIt was a shining media moment, a vast conversation across all media, including millions of participants on Facebook and Twitter \u2014 which is significant since Twitter has been a favorite means of delivering rape and death threats to outspoken women. As Astra Taylor has pointed out in her new book, The People\u2019s Platform, the language of free speech is used to protect hate speech, itself an attempt to deprive others of their freedom of speech, to scare them into shutting up.\n\nLaurie Penny, one of the important feminist voices of our times, wrote,\n\nWhen news of the murders broke, when the digital world began to absorb and discuss its meaning, I had been about to email my editor to request a few days off, because the impact of some particularly horrendous rape threats had left me shaken, and I needed time to collect my thoughts. Instead of taking that time, I am writing this blog, and I am doing so in rage and in grief \u2014 not just for the victims of the Isla Vista massacre, but for what is being lost everywhere as the language and ideology of the new misogyny continues to be excused\u2026 I am sick of being told to empathize with the perpetrators of violence any time I try to talk about the victims and survivors.\n\nOur Words Are Our Weapons\n\nIn 1963, Betty Friedan published a landmark book, The Feminine Mystique, in which she wrote, \u201cThe problem that has no name \u2014 which is simply the fact that American women are kept from growing to their full human capacities \u2014 is taking a far greater toll on the physical and mental health of our country than any known disease.\u201d In the years that followed, that problem gained several names: male chauvinism, then sexism, misogyny, inequality, and oppression. The cure was to be \u201cwomen\u2019s liberation,\u201d or \u201cwomen\u2019s lib,\u201d or \u201cfeminism.\u201d These words, which might seem worn out from use now, were fresh then.\n\nSince Friedan\u2019s manifesto, feminism has proceeded in part by naming things. The term \u201csexual harassment,\u201d for example, was coined in the 1970s, first used in the legal system in the 1980s, given legal status by the Supreme Court in 1986, and given widespread coverage in the upheaval after Anita Hill\u2019stestimony against her former boss, Clarence Thomas, in the 1991 Senate hearings on his Supreme Court nomination. The all-male interrogation team patronized and bullied Hill, while many men in the Senate and elsewhere failed to grasp why it mattered if your boss said lecherous things and demanded sexual services. Or they just denied that such things happen.\n\nMany women were outraged. It was, like the post-Isla Vista weekend, a watershed moment in which the conversation changed, in which those who got it pushed hard on those who didn\u2019t, opening some minds and updating some ideas. The bumper sticker \u201cI Believe You Anita\u201d was widespread for a while. Sexual harassment is now considerably less common in workplaces and schools, and its victims have far more recourse, thanks in part to Hill\u2019s brave testimony and the earthquake that followed.\n\nSo many of the words with which a woman\u2019s right to exist is adjudicated are of recent coinage: \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d for example, replaced \u201cwife-beating\u201d as the law began to take a (mild) interest in the subject. A woman is still beaten every nine seconds in this country, but thanks to the heroic feminist campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s, she now has access to legal remedies that occasionally work, occasionally protect her, and \u2014 even more occasionally \u2014 send her abuser to jail. In 1990, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported, \u201cStudies of the Surgeon General\u2019s office reveal that domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women between the ages of 15 and 44, more common than automobile accidents, muggings, and cancer deaths combined.\u201d\n\nI go to check this fact and arrive at an Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence website that warns viewers their browsing history might be monitored at home and offers a domestic-violence hotline number. The site is informing women that their abusers may punish them for seeking information or naming their situation. It\u2019s like that out there.\n\nOne of the more shocking things I read recently was an essay in the Nation about the infamous slaying of Catherine \u201cKitty\u201d Genovese in a neighborhood in Queens, New York, in 1964. The author, Peter Baker, reminds us that some of the neighbors who witnessed parts of her rape and murder from their windows likely mistook the savage assault by a stranger for a man exercising his rights over \u201chis\u201d woman. \u201cSurely it matters that, at the time, violence inflicted by a man on his wife or romantic partner was widely considered a private affair. Surely it matters that, in the eyes of the law as it stood in 1964, it was impossible for a man to rape his wife.\u201d\n\nTerms like acquaintance rape, date rape, and marital rape had yet to be invented.\n\nTwenty-First Century Words\n\nI apparently had something to do with the birth of the word \u201cmansplaining,\u201d though I didn\u2019t coin it myself. My 2008 essay \u201cMen Explain Things to Me\u201d (now the title piece in my new book about gender and power) is often credited with inspiring the pseudonymous person who did coin it on a blog shortly thereafter.
