Flowers was due to make $5.25 million this season, and he carried a salary cap number of $10.5 million that made him difficult to keep.\n\nAlready bumping up against the salary cap, the Chiefs will save about $7.25 million this season and $7.5 million next season. That money could be used to help the team sign quarterback Alex Smith and linebacker Justin Houston to contract extensions.\n\nBoth of them are in the final year of their current contracts.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Brandon\u2019s contributions to the team over the last six seasons,\u201d general manager John Dorsey said in a statement released by the team. \u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of the club and the player to part ways at this time. We wish him nothing but the best as he continues his career.\u201d\n\nFlowers was the Chiefs\u2019 second-round pick in 2008, and he proved to be a dependable starter for them. He started 87 of the 88 games he played over six seasons, making 421 tackles, two sacks and 17 interceptions, two of which he returned for touchdowns.\n\nHis production is a big reason why he was signed to a six-year, $50 million deal in 2011.\n\nBut under a new regime last season, one that favors bigger, more physical cornerbacks, the 5-foot-9 Flowers gradually lost time to Marcus Cooper and other defensive backs. He wound up playing against slot receivers at the end of the season, and his future in Kansas City has been a subject of debate the entire offseason \u2014 especially as he skipped out on the voluntary workouts.\n\nShortly after he was released, Flowers tweeted his thanks to the Hunt family, which owns the franchise, along with its fans and his teammates \u201cfor some great years.\u201d\n\nEarly in the day, Chiefs coach Andy Reid was asked whether Flowers and Houston \u2014 who has also been absent from the voluntary workouts \u2014 would attend next week\u2019s mandatory minicamp.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThe thing that you\u2019re guaranteed of is we\u2019re going to coach whoever is here and do our thing here.\u201d\n\nWhile the rest of the Chiefs have avoided talking about Flowers and Houston missing the voluntary workouts, several indicated that they were making \u201cbusiness decisions.\u201d But linebacker Derrick Johnson did say that the workouts are valuable in preparing for training camp.\n\n\u201cMentally, this is the time to get everything down,\u201d he said, \u201cso that when we get to training camp, we can move faster mentally on the field so we can show up pretty quick.\u201d\n\nIn other news Friday, Reid said that tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver Kyle Williams could do more work next week. Kelce has been out after dealing with a knee injury last season, and Williams has been held out of practice while he recovers from a torn ACL.\n\nLeft tackle Eric Fisher remains limited following shoulder surgery, though he appeared to be doing more in Friday\u2019s workout. Wide receiver Junior Hemingway was absent with strep throat \u2014 he was asked to stay out of the building \u2014 and cornerbacks Chris Owens and David Van Dyke and wide receiver Weston Dressler were all out with hamstring injuries.\n\nRunning back Jamaal Charles, left guard Jeff Allen and cornerback Phillip Gaines were absent from Friday\u2019s workout, though Reid indicated that all of them had been excused.\n\nThe offensive line continues to play a game of musical chairs, though Reid said guys are starting to nail down positions. Part of that has been out of necessity with Fisher injured, but part of it has been to increase versatility and build across-the-board depth.\n\n\u201cYou know you need more than five. You need to make sure you have a good 10 of them ready to go,\u201d Reid said. \u201cYou want to find that number and see what you\u2019ve got there, so we\u2019ve been challenging them as much as you can challenge them here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chiefs release Pro Bowl cornerback Brandon Flowers", "title": "Chiefs release Pro Bowl cornerback Brandon Flowers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/chiefs-release-pro-bowl-cornerback-brandon-flowers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613_062810_brandon-flowers.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613_062810_brandon-flowers.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T18:20:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:25:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kansas City released Brandon Flowers on Friday after three weeks of voluntary workouts in which the former starter was conspicuously absent.\nAlready bumping up against the salary cap, the Chiefs will save about $7.25 million this season and $7.5 million next season.\nFlowers was due to make $5.25 million this season, and he carried a salary cap number of $10.5 million that made him difficult to keep.\nThat money could be used to help the team sign quarterback Alex Smith and linebacker Justin Houston to contract extensions.\nYou need to make sure you have a good 10 of them ready to go,\u201d Reid said."}
