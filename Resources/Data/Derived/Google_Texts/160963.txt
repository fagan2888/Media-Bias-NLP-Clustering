The Freelancers Union is ending its popular program that provides health insurance to thousands of its members — because the increase in rates resulting from ObamaCare is too expensive, according to a report.

The union for independent workers, which provides low-cost insurance to more than 25,000 members in New York state, decided to eliminate its insurance plan because new federal regulations would force it to increase premiums by 14 percent, according to The New York Times.

The union had been given a state one-year exemption from ObamaCare provisions, but announced Tuesday that the increase would conflict with its goal of providing low-cost insurance for its members, according to the report.

Freelancers Union members went ballistic on social media after learning they would have to switch. Those who do nothing will wind up in Empire BlueCross BlueShield, and they will likely no longer have access to out-of-network doctors.

“I’m infuriated,” Andrea Bertola Shaw wrote on Facebook. “I’ll be paying more and getting less coverage? What a joke.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Oklahoma ruled that tax subsidies vital to the implementation of ObamaCare are unlawful.

US District Judge Ronald White found the IRS rule that the Obama administration issued to set up tax-credit subsidies to help people pay insurance premiums was “an ­invalid implementation” of the law.
