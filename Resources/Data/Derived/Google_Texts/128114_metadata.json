But by almost any measure, life in the federal bureaucracy has been anything but cool during the Obama administration.\n\nThe 2.7 million civilian federal workforce has remained flat for much of Obama\u2019s tenure and even dropped by 71,000 jobs in the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Federal employees are in the third year of a pay freeze. And nearly half of all federal workers have been forced to take unpaid furlough days this year because of $85 billion automatic budget cuts that were mandated by sequestration.\n\nEven with the salary freeze, government workers are paid well compared with their counterparts in the private sector, according to the Washington Post. The average salary for a full-time, permanent position now stands at nearly $78,500 a year, according to the Office of Personnel Management, an increase of about $1,800 in the last two years. The median salary \u2014 the point at which half are above and half are below \u2014 is now $74,714, up from $69,550 in 2010.\n\nRELATED: WASHINGTON IN CRISIS AS SHUTDOWN, DEFAULT AWAIT\n\nWhile many federal employees have received no increases since the last general increase in January 2010, individual raises still can be paid to employees, if eligible, on promotion, for performance, or on completing waiting periods used in grade- and step-type pay systems.\n\nObama has signaled his desire to end the freeze and raise federal worker pay by one percent in fiscal 2014. But that proposal faces stiff opposition in Congress, which has been reluctant to provide any relief for federal workers. And, in the end, Congress, not the president will decide if civilian employees will see more on their paychecks in the coming year.\n\nNow comes the growing threat of a government shutdown early next week \u2013 one that would temporarily toss 800,000 or more federal employees out of work unless the White House and congressional Republicans can reach agreement on a short-term spending measure to keep the government operating beyond the Sept. 30 deadline.\n\nThose hundreds of thousands of \u201cnon-essential\u201d workers who may be told to stay home would see their salaries cut off throughout the crisis. And the more than two million other federal workers deemed \u201cessential\u201d who would be ordered to stay on the job would likely suffer interruptions or delay in receiving their salaries.\n\nWhile there is no law requiring that non-essential employees be compensated if they are ordered to stay home, Congress in the past has voted to reimburse their losses once the shutdowns ended, as was the case after the late 1995 and early 1996 shutdowns during the Clinton administration.\n\nBut Lisa Rein of the Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Congress might not be so generous this time around. The bitterly divided Congress includes many lawmakers who are unsympathetic to the plight of federal workers and could be loath to help them recoup their money, Rein reported.\n\nColleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told the Post, \u201cI\u2019m concerned when employees who were here remember that last time employees were paid and think it will happen again, because it\u2019s not a given at all.\u201d\n\n9 THINGS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nRep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA), who represents tens of thousands of federal workers in his district, says, \u201cUnfortunately, the ideology of the House majority is rabidly anti federal-employee. I think it\u2019s going to be very tough sledding to persuade sufficient numbers of them to keep their commitment to federal workers who will find themselves victims.\u201d Connolly added.\n\nFor all the complaining by federal workers and their allies, it\u2019s not all bad. Federal workers enjoy long-term job security, and they receive salaries and medical and retirement benefits that stack up pretty well when compared to what they would get in the private sector.\n\nThe federal government pays more in average wages and significantly more in benefits than the private sector, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. But the advantages mostly accrue to less-educated workers, while compensation for federal employees with professional and doctoral degrees lag significantly behind their private-sector counterparts.\n\nThe CBO found that, on average, the federal government pays about 2 percent more in total wages and about 16 percent more when the employer-provided benefits are factored in than workers with similar occupations and backgrounds in the private sector receive.\n\nThat may be little consolation for federal workers who \u2013 in the face of pay freezes, sequestration, furloughs and now a possible government shutdown \u2013 are feeling a bit like congressional pi\u00f1atas.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a Tea Party adherent who voted last Friday with his House GOP colleagues to demand the defunding of Obamacare in exchange for keeping the doors of the government open, told the Post that it\u2019s a shame federal workers are being caught up in this bitter partisan battle that could lead to a shutdown next week.\n\n\u201cI rail against the federal government,\u201d Chaffetz said, \u201cbut we have a lot of patriotic federal employees who should not be in the middle of this skirmish.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s a cruel irony that President Obama came into office four and a half years ago pro", "title": "Why It\u2019s Still Not \u2018Cool\u2019 to be a Federal Worker", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/24/Why-It-s-Still-Not-Cool-be-Federal-Worker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122011_closed_capitol_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/24/Why-It-s-Still-Not-Cool-be-Federal-Worker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122011_closed_capitol_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s a cruel irony that President Obama came into office four and a half years ago pro", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI rail against the federal government,\u201d Chaffetz said, \u201cbut we have a lot of patriotic federal employees who should not be in the middle of this skirmish.\u201d\nObama has signaled his desire to end the freeze and raise federal worker pay by one percent in fiscal 2014.\nFor all the complaining by federal workers and their allies, it\u2019s not all bad.\nBut by almost any measure, life in the federal bureaucracy has been anything but cool during the Obama administration.\nBut that proposal faces stiff opposition in Congress, which has been reluctant to provide any relief for federal workers."}
