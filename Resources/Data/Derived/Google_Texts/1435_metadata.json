The most cited example is his repeated pledge to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS, which our top commander had to explain is \"Indiscriminate bombing, where we don't care if we are killing innocents,\" and is \"inconsistent with our values.\"\n\nPresident Cruz vows to abolish marriage equality, because the Supreme Court ruling that allowed it is \"fundamentally illegitimate, lawless, and unconstitutional.\" In fact, he's calling for a Constitutional amendment that would subject Justices \"to periodic judicial retention elections.\"\n\nAnd a Cruz presidency would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Energy, and four other federal agencies; introduce another amendment that would end birthright citizenship; defund Planned Parenthood; privatize Social Security for future retirees; and push for a 10-percent flat tax, which the nonpartisan Tax Foundation says would cost the government $768 billion over 10 years.\n\nSome of that might appeal to 51,000 people in Iowa who occupy the theocratic wing of the Republican Party, but Cruz rarely makes sense to the public at large.\n\nHis celebration speech Monday night actually included an appeal to Reagan Democrats, yet he's running ads that condemn GOP politicians who strike deals with Democrats. He also seems to forget that by the time Reagan got to Washington, he had been a two-term governor who was willing to work with a legislature, and ultimately a drinking partner for Tip O'Neill.\n\nHe also predicted a landslide next November, an event that will \"once and for all drive the liberal elites and the Washington cartel into the Potomac and out to sea, never to be seen again.\"\n\nYou know, unifying speech.\n\nGive Cruz this much: He confounded the vast majority of pollsters, and he won despite his opposition to ethanol subsidies, which in Iowa takes Cruzian audacity. His ground game was superior and he rallied church pastors from all over the state to gather their flocks \u2013 and survived the Iowa Secretary of State accusing his campaign of voter intimidation to inflate the turnout.\n\nNew Hampshire is unlikely to be friendly territory for him, but he has an electoral firewall in the so-called SEC states. He'll be around for a while, and there's no telling how far he can go in this anti-establishment climate.
