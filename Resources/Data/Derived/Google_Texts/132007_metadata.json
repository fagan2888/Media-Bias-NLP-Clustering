(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) ( Matt Slocum )\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- LeGarrette Blount ran the Patriots into their third straight AFC championship game.\n\nThe 250-pound back had four touchdown runs and New England kept Andrew Luck from a second straight comeback win to beat the Indianapolis Colts 43-22 Sunday night.\n\nBlount scored on three 2-yard runs in the first half, then burst through the right side of the line and rambled 73 yards into the end zone, where he placed the ball gently on the ground made soggy by a game-long rain. He finished with 166 yards on 24 carries.\n\nOn the next series, Luck threw his third interception and the Patriots capitalized with Stevan Ridley's second touchdown run, a 1-yarder that finished the scoring with 11:12 left.\n\nThe Patriots (13-4) will face the winner of the game today between the Broncos and Chargers.\n\nBlount joined Ricky Watters, who had five touchdowns for San Francisco on Jan. 15, 1994, as the only players with four or more in a playoff game. And the six rushing touchdowns by the Patriots tied the 49ers' total in that game for second most in playoff history. Blount's big rushing performance came two weeks after he ran for 189 yards and returned two kickoffs for 145 yards in a 34-20 victory over Buffalo in the regular-season finale.\n\nBilled as a matchup between quarterbacks -- long-time great Tom Brady and second-year star Luck -- the Patriots' leader was content to hand off while Luck threw an interception on his second pass and never found consistency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe threw two touchdown passes to LaVon Brazill but also threw four interceptions.\n\nLuck threw three interceptions a week earlier but led the Colts from a 38-10 deficit early in the third quarter to a 45-44 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in a wild-card game.\n\nThe Colts trailed 21-12 at halftime against the Patriots and cut it to 29-22 on a 35-yard pass to Brazill with 5:01 left in the third. The Patriots dominated the rest of the way.\n\nBlount's first touchdown came on New England's first offensive play after Alfonzo Dennard intercepted Luck's pass and returned it 27 yards to the 2.\n\nBlount scored again on the Patriots' second series in which Brady completed all four of his passes.\n\nPatriots 43, Colts 22\n\nIndianapolis 7 5 10 0 -- 22\n\nNew England 14 7 8 14 -- 43\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nNE -- Blount 2 run (Gostkowski kick), 13:41.\n\nNE -- Blount 2 run (Gostkowski kick), 7:17.\n\nInd -- Brazill 38 pass from Luck (Vinatieri kick), 4:35.\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nNE -- Blount 2 run (Gostkowski kick), 10:54.\n\nInd -- FG Vinatieri 36, 5:35.\n\nInd -- Team safety, 2:18.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nInd -- FG Vinatieri 21, 10:03.\n\nNE -- Ridley 3 run (Ridley run), 6:18.\n\nInd -- Brazill 35 pass from Luck (Vinatieri kick), 5:01.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nNE -- Blount 73 run (Gostkowski kick), 12:55.\n\nNE -- Ridley 1 run (Gostkowski kick), 11:12.\n\nA -- 68,756.\n\nInd NE\n\nFirst downs 16 23\n\nTotal Net Yards 386 419\n\nRushes-yards 21-69 46-234\n\nPassing 317 185\n\nPunt Returns 3-5 5-36\n\nKickoff Returns 1-16 2-37\n\nInterceptions Ret. 0-0 4-50\n\nComp-Att-Int 20-41-4 13-25-0\n\nSacked-Yards Lost 3-14 2-13\n\nPunts 5-51.8 6-44.0\n\nFumbles-Lost 0-0 3-0\n\nPenalties-Yards 4-42 4-35\n\nTime of Possession 25:00 35:00\n\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\n\nRUSHING -- Indianapolis, D.Brown 17-63, Luck 1-5, Richardson 3-1.
