The American Geriatrics Society has advised against their use in the \u201cmedically ill or frail elderly.\u201d\n\nThe recommendation noted that while these drinks may help elders gain weight, there\u2019s no proof they improve quality of life, mood, functioning or even survival rates.\n\nAt the society\u2019s annual meeting, Dr. Paul Mulhausen, chief medical officer for the health management firm Telligen, noted that the main ingredients are water, sugar, oils and flavoring. He described them as \u201cliquid candy bars with vitamins.\u201d\n\nAn 8-ounce serving of Ensure Original \u201cmilk chocolate\u201d contains 9 grams of protein, 26 vitamins and minerals and 220 calories. But it also has no fiber and 15 grams of sugar. The same size bottle of Boost Original in \u201crich chocolate\u201d has a similar nutrition profile but also contains 240 calories and 28 grams of sugar.\n\nThat\u2019s almost twice as much as two frosted strawberry Pop-Tarts.\n\n\u2013 Richard A.
