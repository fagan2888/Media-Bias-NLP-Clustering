Ted Cruz says Republican leadership should make sure it receives \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d in the fight over raising the debt ceiling. But he\u2019s not holding his breath.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Republican leadership approaches every battle pre-emptively surrendering, saying we can get nothing,\u201d Cruz tells The Daily Signal.\n\nThe deadline to raise the debt ceiling is Nov. 3. The White House and House and Senate leaders are said to be close to a two-year budget agreement that lifts the debt ceiling. Cruz is hoping the White House agrees to meaningful concessions.\n\n\u201cThe last 55 times Congress has raised the debt ceiling, it has attached meaningful concessions 28 times.\u201d\n\nCruz would like to see Republican Senate leadership get a few items in return. His list includes making sure Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t receive $500 million in taxpayer dollars and that Iran doesn\u2019t receive a dime of funding under the current nuclear weapons deal with the U.S.\n\nHe also wants to find a way to incorporate Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s bill into the mix. It states that if the debt ceiling does not get raised, the U.S. government will still make sure its debts get paid and not default in any way. However, what Cruz wants and what GOP Senate and House leadership actually pursue have, so far, at least, been at odds with each other.\n\nCruz wants to see his leadership fight like the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cObama and the Democrats approach everything passionately committed to their principles. They\u2019ll crawl over broken glass with a knife between their teeth to advance their failed big-government principles.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
