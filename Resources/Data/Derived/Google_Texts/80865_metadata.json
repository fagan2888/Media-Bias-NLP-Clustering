On August 6, 1945, a bomb containing what they had made was dropped on a city in southern Japan\u2014Hiroshima.\n\nAt about 44 acres of footprint, K-25 was once the largest building on Earth (by certain methods of measurement). Here, for scale, is how K-25 compares with Central Park.\n\nFollowing World War II, K-25 remained in operation, enriching uranium for Cold War weapons and nuclear power plants. The gaseous diffusion operations were shut down in 1964; demolition began in 2008; last Thursday, it was completed. Clean-up is expected to wrap up in 2014.\n\nThe site is slated to become a \"massive industrial park.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "It took five years, but the Manhattan Project&#39;s K-25 site is no more.", "author": "Rebecca J.
