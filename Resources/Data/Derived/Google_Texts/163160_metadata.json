It is expected to charge investors about a 1.5 percent management fee and a 10 percent performance fee after it hits a return rate of about 6 percent.\n\n\u201cThere is a tremendous social need for this,\u201d said Shamez Alibhai, who will head the investment team and who has worked in real estate for 13 years. He has been at Cheyne since 2006.\n\nAs recently as 2012, government grants for social housing were about \u00a32.5 billion to \u00a33 billion, Mr. Alibhai said. Those funds were reduced to nearly \u00a3500 million after the British government cut expenses in the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u00a32.5 billion of capital withdrawn from the system,\u201d Mr. Alibhai said. \u201cWe hope to play our part replacing some of that.\u201d\n\nThe fund aims to balance financial and social returns. It is part of a growing trend of investing with an eye to improving society as well, an effort that includes so-called social impact bonds.\n\nBig Society Capital, a government-established finance group with a social mission, anchored the Cheyne fund with a seed commitment.\n\nThe group\u2019s chief executive, Nick O\u2019Donohoe, said Cheyne was an \u201cinteresting partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have significant resources,\u201d he said, \u201cand the ability to attract substantially more capital\u201d than a typical social impact organization.\n\nMr. O\u2019Donohoe acknowledged that the group was skeptical when it was first approached by Cheyne. But, he said, \u201cafter spending a considerable amount of time with Shamez and the principals of the organization, we recognized that they were doing this for the right reasons, that they had a genuine interest in creating a social impact.\u201d\n\nMr. Alibhai said the fund went to great lengths to ensure that it would be managed and measured for its social impact as well as its financial returns. A partner organization, New Philanthropy Capital, a charities research group, will sit on the investment committee to help evaluate potential investment opportunities. Along with financial statements, the fund will provide social audits, with metrics like which groups have been helped and whether rents are affordable and properties are well maintained.\n\nAlongside financial covenants will be social covenants, to make sure that those in greatest need are gaining access to the properties first, for example, and that staff members have been properly trained.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that the social responsibility element of the fund is embedded into the DNA of the fund,\u201d Mr. Alibhai said.\n\nSocial impact investing is on the rise. In December 2013, Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust raised $13.5 million from prominent clients like the billionaire investor and oil trader John Arnold for a social impact bond whose proceeds would finance a program to lower recidivism rates among former convicts in New York.\n\nGroups like the Bridges Ventures in Britain, founded in 2002, have been involved in social impact investing for a long time, with funds aimed at sustainable growth, property and the social sector. More recently, the French insurer and investment manager AXA Group started a social impact fund of funds with 150 million euros.\n\nSuch groups aim to fill the gaps where governments are increasingly falling short. Big Society Capital, the anchor investor, which is run separately from the government, was set up to build the social investment market in Britain so that charities and social enterprises could gain access to financing and in turn widen their impact. Financed in part by dormant English bank accounts, it has committed more than \u00a3165 million in investments to organizations that lend to charities and social enterprises.\n\nAs part of the due diligence for the Cheyne fund, Mr. Alibhai met with organizations \u2014 councils, municipal governments, housing organizations and the National Health Service \u2014 to determine whether demand existed for its offering. None turned him away for representing a hedge fund.\n\n\u201cWe never came across organizations who said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to explore this further because of what or who you are,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThe fund is structured as a real estate investment trust, with similar tax benefits to those in the United States. Returns are predicated on affordable rents and the fund\u2019s ability to generate attractive debt financing, Mr. Alibhai said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141127050007, "BN": "dealbook", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/dealbook", "hdl_p": "British Firm Starts Hedge Fund for Social Services", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/dealbook/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 27, 2014", "org": "Cheyne Capital Management LLP", "keywords": "Hedge Funds,Renting and Leasing (Real Estate),Social Impact Bonds,Cheyne Capital Management LLP,Great Britain,Financial Services,Hedge Funds,Top Headline 1", "GBLC": "Financial Services;Hedge Funds;Top Headline 1", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/dealbook/British Firm Starts Hedge Fund for Social Services ( 20141127 )", "description": "Cheyne Capital is setting up a new fund to buy property that it will then rent to organizations that deliver services through the National Health Service.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jenny Anderson", "SCG": "Dealbook", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jenny Anderson", "byl": "Jenny Anderson", "twitter": {"description": "Cheyne Capital is setting up a new fund to buy property that it will then rent to organizations that deliver services through the National Health Service.", "title": "British Firm Starts Hedge Fund for Social Services", "url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/hedge-fund-starts-property-vehicle-with-a-social-purpose/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/28/business/28HEDGE/28HEDGE-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@dealbook", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003259118, "news_keywords": "Cheyne Capital,Great Britain,Hedge fund,Rent,Social impact bond", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 27, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Top Headline 1", "published_time": 1417082407, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-11-30T02:17:03-05:00"}, "geo": "Great Britain", "utime": 20141130021703, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141127, "pdate": 20141127, "des": "Hedge Funds;Renting and Leasing (Real Estate);Social Impact Bonds", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/28/business/28HEDGE/28HEDGE-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "DealBook", "description": "Cheyne Capital is setting up a new fund to buy property that it will then rent to organizations that deliver services through the National Health Service.", "title": "British Firm Starts Hedge Fund for Social Services", "url": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/hedge-fund-starts-property-vehicle-with-a-social-purpose/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/28/business/28HEDGE/28HEDGE-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/hedge-fund-starts-property-vehicle-with-a-social-purpose/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "British Firm Starts Hedge Fund for Social Services", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/28/business/28HEDGE/28HEDGE-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe want to ensure that the social responsibility element of the fund is embedded into the DNA of the fund,\u201d Mr. Alibhai said.\nMore recently, the French insurer and investment manager AXA Group started a social impact fund of funds with 150 million euros.\nBig Society Capital, a government-established finance group with a social mission, anchored the Cheyne fund with a seed commitment.\nReturns are predicated on affordable rents and the fund\u2019s ability to generate attractive debt financing, Mr. Alibhai said.\nIt is part of a growing trend of investing with an eye to improving society as well, an effort that includes so-called social impact bonds."}
