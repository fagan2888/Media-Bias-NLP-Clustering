But the report said the fact-finding mission of Congress is not yet complete, and said the next Congress will have to continue this work.\n\nIt made several suggestions for fixing the IRS and allowing it to act in a bipartisan fashion again. Among other things, it suggested replacing the IRS commissioner with a bipartisan commission, removing the IRS as a regulator for political speech, and creating a private right of action for victims of information leaks by the IRS.\n\nThe report indicated that improper IRS activities began with a 2010 comment from President Barack Obama, who said some of the Tea Party groups were being funded with corporate money, and \u201cwe don\u2019t know where this money is coming from.\u201d That criticism was prompted by Democratic reactions to the Citizens United case in the Supreme Court, which many Democrats blamed for allowing the wealthy to pour more money into campaigns.\n\nFive days after Obama spoke in 2010, former IRS official Lois Lerner spoke at Duke University and said many wanted the IRS to \u201cfix the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pressure to \u2018fix the problem,\u2019 as articulated by Lois Lerner, originated with President Obama and senior party leadership,\u201d the report found. \u201cFor twenty-several months, from February 2010 until May 2012, the Internal Revenue Service systematically targeted conservative tax-exempt applicants for additional scrutiny and delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs prominent Democratic politicians and the media condemned conservative non-profit groups, the IRS sought ways to rein in the groups\u2019 political speech,\u201d the report found. \u201cLois Lerner initiated a \u2018c4 project\u2019 \u2014 careful to ensure that it was not \u2018per se political\u2019 \u2014 and called applications filed by Tea Party groups \u201cvery dangerous\u201d because she believed that they could undo existing IRS limits on non-profit political speech.\u201d\n\nThat led to additional scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. The report said that while a few groups were targeted with the words \u201cprogress\u201d or \u201cprogressive\u201d in their title, almost all were conservative-leaning organizations.\n\nThe decision to target conservative groups was followed by later decisions to cover it up, and blame lower level workers for the initiative.\n\nThe report also blamed Obamacare, which gave the IRS a key role in implementing Obama\u2019s health program, for turning the IRS into an arm of the White House, when it should have remained independent.\n\n\u201cEvidence shows an IRS responsive to the partisan policy objectives of the White House and an IRS leadership that coordinates with political appointees of the Obama administration,\u201d it found.\n\nIt said efforts to cover up the scandal were ultimately led by Obama himself. Obama initially said the IRS\u2019s actions were inexcusable, but later said there was not a \u201csmidgen of corruption\u201d at the IRS.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will release a report Tuesday that finds the Obama White House has turned the IRS into a political organization that has spent years attacking conservative groups.  \"The Internal Revenue Service has compromised its traditional position as an independent tax administrator,\" the...", "title": "Report Blames Obama White House for Weaponizing the IRS and Turning It Against Conservatives", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/12/22/report-blames-obama-white-house-for-turning-the-irs-into-a-political-weapon/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-8.06.08-PM.png", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "lois, lerner, irs, darrell, issa", "sailthru.tags": "darrell-issa, government, irs, lois-lerner, the-furnace, the-furnance, author-pete-kasperowicz, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 1962, "gplus-count": 4, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/908348", "categories": "darrell-issa,irs,lois-lerner,the-furnance,government,the-furnace", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 154, "description": "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will release a report Tuesday that finds the Obama White House has turned the IRS into a political organization that has spent years attacking conservative groups.  \"The Internal Revenue Service has compromised its traditional position as an independent tax administrator,\" the...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will release a report Tuesday that finds the Obama White House has turned the IRS into a political organization that has spent years attacking conservative groups.  \"The Internal Revenue Service has compromised its traditional position as an independent tax administrator,\" the...", "title": "Report Blames Obama White House for Weaponizing the IRS and Turning It Against Conservatives", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/12/22/report-blames-obama-white-house-for-turning-the-irs-into-a-political-weapon/", "image": {"width": 599, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-8.06.08-PM.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 395}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-12-22T20:11:23+00:00", "twitter-count": 830}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0db\"", "article_summary": "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will release a report Tuesday that finds the Obama White House has turned the IRS into a political organization that has spent years attacking conservative groups.\n\u201cEvidence shows an IRS responsive to the partisan policy objectives of the White House and an IRS leadership that coordinates with political appointees of the Obama administration,\u201d it found.\nThe report also blamed Obamacare, which gave the IRS a key role in implementing Obama\u2019s health program, for turning the IRS into an arm of the White House, when it should have remained independent.\nThe decision to target conservative groups was followed by later decisions to cover it up, and blame lower level workers for the initiative.\nObama initially said the IRS\u2019s actions were inexcusable, but later said there was not a \u201csmidgen of corruption\u201d at the IRS."}
