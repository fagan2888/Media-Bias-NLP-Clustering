Two suspected armed robbers are in custody after a Wichita police officer caught them in the act, and police said the duo are tied to other recent robberies.

Around 3:30 Friday morning, an officer was in the area of the Petro America convenience store at 2800 West Central, near St. Paul.

"An officer had been sitting in the are of this gas station, because there had been...several other gas stations, mainly on the east side of town, that had been robbed by the same suspect description persons," said Sgt. Kevin Kochendefer.

The officer watched two armed men enter the store and called for backup when the officer saw the clerks hands go up.

As the suspects exited the convenience store, officer chased the suspects for several blocks and took them into custody. Kochenderfer said the suspects had robbed the store and the clerk who was working.

Sgt. Kochenderfer didn't release the locations of all robberies to which the suspects are connected, but he did say the most recent one, before Petro America, was at 248 South Hillside.

Both suspects were booked into the Sedgwick County Jail.
