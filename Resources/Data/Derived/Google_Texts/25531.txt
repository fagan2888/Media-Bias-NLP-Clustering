The federal government spent more on health care in 2015 than on Social Security for the first time ever.

So finds the Congressional Budget Office, the government’s nonpartisan scorekeeping agency, in a 200-page report it released about fiscal 2015, which ended Sept. 30.



[SPECIAL REPORT: Health Care Index]

The federal government spent $882 billion on Social Security, compared with $936 billion in spending on health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and tax subsidies that help people pay for private health plans under Obamacare. The total represents a 13 percent jump in health care spending from fiscal 2014, according to the report.

Medicaid spending accounted for the largest increase in growth, at 16 percent or by $48 billion, because of the 30 states and District of Columbia that expanded the program to 9.6 million more enrollees under Obamacare.

Authors of the report warn that the federal budget deficit will increase in relation to the size of the economy for the first time since effects of the Great Recession began in 2009, projecting that the 2016 budget deficit will reach $544 billion, or $105 billion more than the previous year. The projected deficit would increase debt held by the public to 76 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2016.

If laws around federal programs remain unchanged, authors of the report write, the deficit will continue to grow over the next 10 years, becoming even larger than its average during the past 50 years. Health care programs are projected to total 5.5 percent of GDP in 2016 and to grow quickly in subsequent years, reaching 6.6 percent of GDP in 2026. Medicare is projected to account for about three-quarters of that growth as the baby boomer population continues to age into the program.

The report could give ammunition to Republicans and others opposed to Obamacare, who predicted such an outcome on the federal budget. Supporters of the law may call for strengthening it, or for putting more cost controls on medical care and on prescription drugs.
