But you and so many others are making a big assumption of something I did not say. I have never suggested a parent give any money to an adult child they deem less fortune. Because as you indicate less fortunate is in the eye of the beholder. What I was addressing and what the original person asked in this very forum was how to NOT feel slighted if a parent or parents give to siblings making less or in jobs not making as much as he did. Or rather how not to feel hurt if same siblings are spendthrifts.\n\nSo what's on the table is this. What if your parents give more to your siblings for whatever reason? What if those siblings don't appear to deserve the money when you have worked so hard to be a good saver and money manager? How do you respond.\n\nThat is where my advice came in. You feel grateful for what you have.\n\nBecause we can't control what others do. I never said what anybody is \"entitled to.\"\n\nSure parents should be fair in their handouts. But what if they aren't? And frankly they don't have to be fair in your eyes. It's there money.\n\nDo you sulk? Whine? Complain?\n\nYou keep doing what you are doing, which is the right thing with your money and not worry about what they are getting fair or not fair.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Post columnist Michelle Singletary offers her advice and answers your questions.", "title": "Color of Money Live", "og": {"site_name": "The Washington Post", "description": "Post columnist Michelle Singletary offers her advice and answers your questions.", "title": "Color of Money Live", "url": "https://live.washingtonpost.com/color-of-money-live-20150827.html", "image": "https://vforum-images.washingtonpost.com/2015_8/Singletary_Final_0_20160203085759.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washingtonpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "finance, color of money live, color of money, michelle singletary, singletary, personal finance, finances, money, saving money, investing, how to invest, what to invest, debt, getting out of debt, debt defeaters, debt defeater, banks, banking", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2ae\"", "article_summary": "What if those siblings don't appear to deserve the money when you have worked so hard to be a good saver and money manager?\nI have never suggested a parent give any money to an adult child they deem less fortune.\nYou keep doing what you are doing, which is the right thing with your money and not worry about what they are getting fair or not fair.\nBut you and so many others are making a big assumption of something I did not say.\nIt's there money."}
