And because it\u2019s a chronic condition, people require lifetime care.\n\nRelated: Diabetes Detection Up in Pro-Obamacare States\n\nIn 2011, the average annual health spending for individuals with diabetes was $14,093. Two years later, it had risen to $14,999, according to the Healthcare Cost Institute. In contrast, a person without diabetes spent about $10,000 less in medical costs in 2013. Pharmacy provider Express Scripts said earlier this year that 2014 marked the fourth year in a row that medication used to treat diabetes were the most expensive of any traditional drug class.\n\nIn all, diabetes costs totaled an estimated $245 billion in 2012, including both direct medical expenses and indirect costs from disability and lost work productivity.\n\nWhile some of the most popular diabetes drugs aren\u2019t particularly expensive, the new brand-name drugs that are continually being introduced offer more effective treatment and fewer side effects \u2014 but also come with a higher price tag. Less than half of the diabetes prescription treatments filled in 2014 were generic.\n\nNearly a century after its discovery in 1921, insulin is still a common form of treatment for the millions of people with type 1 diabetes, yet there is still no generic form available. Patent protection has been extended in some cases due to improvements in existing formulations. Once those patents expire, Andrews notes, biologically similar drugs could replace them and reduce the price by up to 40 percent.\n\nRelated: This Disease Hikes Health Care Costs By More than $10,000 a Year\n\nThe financial ramifications of diabetes don\u2019t just stem from the cost of drugs or medical treatment \u2014 it\u2019s also been proven that people with diabetes have a high-school dropout rate that is six percentage points higher than those without the disease, according to a Health Affairs study. In addition, young adults with diabetes are four to six percentage points less likely to attend college than those without the disease.\n\nDiabetes also contributes to lower employment and wages. On average, a person with diabetes earns $160,000 less over the course of their lives than people who don\u2019t develop the disease. By age 30, a person with diabetes is 10 percent less likely to be employed.\n\nSo even if it\u2019s not generating as many headlines as hepatitis C at any given point in time, the costs of diabetes can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The budget-busting price of Sovaldi, a drug used to treat hepatitis C has generated wave after wave of media attention, but it\u2019s far from the only drug creating cost problems for patients and insurers.
