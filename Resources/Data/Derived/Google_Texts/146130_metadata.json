Ne'eman said most passengers were fine and that they were being moved to a local church.\n\nAmtrak said its Northeast Corridor service between Wilmington and Philadelphia is suspended until early this afternoon. Keystone Service between New York and Harrisburg is not affected, Amtrak said.\n\nFederal Railroad Administration officials are at the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board was notified and is planning to send a team.\n\nThe derailment comes less than a month after an Amtrak train derailed in Kansas while headed from Chicago to Los Angeles, leaving 32 people injured.\n\nCNN contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amtrak said the train partially derailed after striking a backhoe that was on the tracks.", "language": "english", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/2-dead-in-Amtrak-crash-near-Philadelphia-374411911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/philadelphia+amtrak+crash.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Amtrak said the train partially derailed after striking a backhoe that was on the tracks.", "title": "2 dead in Amtrak crash near Philadelphia"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Amtrak said the train partially derailed after striking a backhoe that was on the tracks.", "title": "2 dead in Amtrak crash near Philadelphia", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/2-dead-in-Amtrak-crash-near-Philadelphia-374411911.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/philadelphia+amtrak+crash.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "2 dead in Amtrak crash near Philadelphia", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2 dead in Amtrak crash"}, "article_summary": "Credit: Instagram/@alexsweetTwo people were killed in an Amtrak crash near Philadelphia today, the Chester Fire Department told ABC News.\nThe derailment comes less than a month after an Amtrak train derailed in Kansas while headed from Chicago to Los Angeles, leaving 32 people injured.\nAmtrak Train 89 had 341 passengers and seven crew members on board at the time and was traveling from New York to Savannah, Georgia.\nAmtrak said its Northeast Corridor service between Wilmington and Philadelphia is suspended until early this afternoon.\nAmtrak said the train partially derailed after striking a backhoe that was on the tracks."}
