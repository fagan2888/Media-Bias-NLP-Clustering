The pope\u2019s statement is a sharp departure from many of the other leaders in the Church, who have recently been pressuring him to take a stronger stance on those issues.\n\n\u201cIt is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,\u201d Pope Francis told an Italian outlet. \u201cThe dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent.\u201d\n\nU.S. Catholic Bishops have been criticized for focusing almost exclusively on social issues \u2014 like advocating against marriage equality and fighting against Obamacare\u2019s birth control benefit \u2014 at the expense of the Church\u2019s other teachings on social justice issues.\n\nBut the leader of the Catholic Church said that the religion needs to \u201cfind a new balance\u201d on the moral teachings that it prioritizes. \u201cOtherwise, even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel,\u201d the pope explained.\n\nIn the United States, Catholic laypeople tend to disagree with the stance that the Bishops have staked out on social issues. Most Catholics support marriage equality, and a full 82 percent of Catholics think birth control is morally acceptable. And 63 percent of Catholics support a woman\u2019s right to choose and don\u2019t favor overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn recent months, Pope Francis has made a name for himself as somewhat of a populist leader. He has indicated he may welcome gay priests, personally called a rape victim to comfort her, condemned austerity policies for harming the poor, invited homeless people to eat with him at the Vatican, and gone out of his way to be welcoming toward atheists, Muslims, and women.\n\nIn the new interview, Francis pointed out that the Church should be \u201ca home for all, not a small chapel that can hold only a small group of selected people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In his first extensive interview since becoming the pope, Francis argues the Catholic Church needs to reassess its priorities.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In his first extensive interview since becoming the pope, Francis argues the Catholic Church needs to reassess its priorities.", "title": "Pope Francis: Catholic Church Is Too \u2018Obsessed\u2019 With Abortion, Birth Control, And Gay Marriage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/19/2650521/pope-francis-catholic-church/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cardinal-Francis-George-e1375829042554.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In his first extensive interview since becoming the pope, Francis argues the Catholic Church needs to reassess its priorities.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cardinal-Francis-George-e1375829042554-321x214.jpg", "title": "Pope Francis: Catholic Church Is Too \u2018Obsessed\u2019 With Abortion, Birth Control, And Gay Marriage", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cardinal-Francis-George-e1375829042554.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cardinal-Francis-George-e1375829042554.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-19T12:00:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe4f0c\"", "article_summary": "Health Pope Francis: Catholic Church Is Too \u2018Obsessed\u2019 With Abortion, Birth Control, And Gay Marriage CREDIT:Pope Francis CREDIT: WikimediaIn one of the first lengthy interviews he has given since ascending to the papacy in March, Pope Francis said he believes the Catholic Church has grown too \u201cobsessed\u201d with social issues like abortion, birth control, and gay marriage.\nIn recent months, Pope Francis has made a name for himself as somewhat of a populist leader.\nMost Catholics support marriage equality, and a full 82 percent of Catholics think birth control is morally acceptable.\n\u201cIt is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,\u201d Pope Francis told an Italian outlet.\nBut the leader of the Catholic Church said that the religion needs to \u201cfind a new balance\u201d on the moral teachings that it prioritizes."}
