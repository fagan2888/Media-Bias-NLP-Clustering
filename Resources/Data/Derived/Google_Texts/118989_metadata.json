Reporters may be hearing more about this movement, which has been tiny and on the cultural fringe in the U.S. but is now emerging enough to furrow some Christian brows.\n\nFew religious folks would argue in general against applying modern science, technology and medicine for human betterment. But ethical disputes are frequent on specific issues, for instance genetic manipulation of the human species or of vegetables, or experiments that destroy human embryos or risk harm to chimpanzees.\n\nIstvan defines transhumanism as \u201cbeyond human\u201d and explains that the movement is a union of \u201clife extensionists, techno-optimists, Singularitarians, biohackers, roboticists, A.I. proponents, and futurists who embrace radical science and technology to improve the human condition.\u201d\n\nFor many enthusiasts the chief goal is to totally eliminate human death, hopefully by 2045. The more optimistic Istvan thinks with a trillion dollars spent on life extension research \u201cwe will conquer human mortality within 10 years.\u201d But, he complains, \u201creligious extremists\u201d have so far prevented the dream.\n\nImmortality, anyone?\n\nHis fledgling political party\u2019s platform advocates shifting serious federal money from national defense to creating longer lifespans. Other spending should protect against risks from \u201cartificial intelligence, plagues, asteroids, climate change, and nuclear warfare and disaster.\u201d Another tenet is \u201cmorphological freedom,\u201d which translates as \u201cthe right to do anything to your body so long as it doesn\u2019t harm others.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this sounds too far out there for journalistic treatment. But an article in the online Christian Post contends that this \u201cmay very well be the next big science vs. religion battle.\u201d\n\nThe movement was taken quite seriously at a \u201cTranshumanism and the Church\u201d confab last September (click here for more information) sponsored by the lively Center for Science and Religion at Alabama Baptists\u2019 Samford University. Already, scholars in the American Academy of Religion have formed a \u201ctranshumanism and religion\u201d seminar to discuss the issues. Its co-convenor, Pittsburgh Seminary\u2019s Ronald Cole-Turner, was a major speaker at Samford and has edited the anthology \u201cTranshumanism and Transcendence: Christian Hope in an Age of Technological Enhancement.\u201d\n\nOne proponent of Christian transhumanism at Samford was Christopher Benek, associate pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He is upset that Istvan\u2019s faction is turning the cause in an atheistic direction. The Transhumanist Party, for example, proclaims an emphasis on \u201creason and secular values.\u201d Rather than the anti-religion wing\u2019s narcissism and self-glorification, Benek says, Christians should take moral responsibility to guide a humane version of \u201ctechnologies that significantly enhance the intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities of human beings.\u201d\n\nOther Christians think all this gives utopia a bad name.\n\nJohn Stonestreet of the Colson Center for Christian Worldview warns against the arrogance of those who dream of \u201creinventing the human species\u201d and for whom \u201cempirical science is the only measure of truth. . . Every other would-be re-inventor of humanity has failed. And so will the transhumanists. The only question is how much suffering will they cause along the way.\u201d\n\nHere is a link for information on the interrelated Extropy Institute, World Transhumanist Association, Humanity+", "article_metadata": {"description": "Were you perplexed by those 17 Republican candidates for president way back \r\nwhen?\r\n\r\nThe Religion Guy has no way to check this but attorney Ron Gunzburger\u2019s \r\nwww.politics1.com names hundreds of 2016 hopefuls who are running in some \r\nsense and catalogues 33 \u201cthird parties.\u201d The oldest is the 147-year-old \r\nProhibition Party, which captured 519 of the 128,556,837 presidential votes \r\ncast in 2012.\r\n\r\nThis listing includes the newly minted Transhumanist Party of Mill Valley, \r\nCalif,, and nominee Zoltan Istvan, businessman and Huffington Post \r\ncolumnist.
