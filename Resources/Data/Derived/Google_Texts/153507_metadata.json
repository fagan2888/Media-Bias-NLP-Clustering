But the landscape of employer-sponsored insurance had been changing to reduce costs even before Obamacare, though the law has helped accelerate that shift.\n\nThe newly formed conservative-leaning American Health Policy Institute asked member firms with 10,000 or more employees to provide internal and consultant analyses on what they expect the ACA to cost their businesses over the next decade. The survey doesn\u2019t account for other factors, like the rate of health care inflation, nor does it try to anticipate how employers may already be changing the way they provide insurance.\n\nThink tank president Tevi Troy, a former deputy health secretary under President George W. Bush, said this was the first comprehensive effort to determine costs large employers are anticipating because of the health care law.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is this is how these mostly Fortune 500 companies think the law will affect them,\u201d said Troy. \u201cThe fact is it\u2019s their internal analyses of what the cost will be, and this is what drives their actions.\u201d\n\nCritics of the survey, however, said it ignores how employers are already altering their health benefit strategies.\n\nThe survey, which will be released Wednesday, was provided ahead of time to the Washington Post. More than 350 company members of the HR Policy Association were asked to participate in the survey, and 103 employers representing 4.3 million covered lives responded.\n\nSurvey respondents identified the health care law\u2019s tax on high-cost health plans starting in 2018 as their largest anticipated cost stemming from the ACA. Under the law, firms will face a 40 percent excise tax on amounts surpassing $10,200 for an individual health plan or $27,500 for family coverage. The so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on health plans was included in the health care law partially as a funding mechanism and as a way to make businesses and consumers more conscious about how they consume health care.\n\nBradley Herring, a health economist, previously estimated about 75 percent of firms would have to pay the tax by 2028 if they didn\u2019t lower health plan costs. However, companies are already making efforts to avoid triggering the tax. A 2013 survey from Towers Watson, a professional services firm, found that more than 60 percent of businesses said they were thinking about the Cadillac tax as they structured health care benefits for this year and 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is very unlikely employers will sit still and let the tax hit them,\u201d said Bowen Garrett, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban Institute.\n\nCompanies identified other ACA costs, such as fees for a temporary reinsurance program and a new government-sponsored institute studying the effectiveness of care interventions. They also cited the law\u2019s preventive benefit requirements and a provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26 as adding costs. Those two provisions, which have been in effect since 2010, accounted for 1-2 percentage points of the 9 percent increase in employer-sponsored family coverage in 2011, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo defended the health care law's impact on businesses.\n\n\"Since the ACA passed, health care cost growth has slowed to the lowest level on record, and Americans have gained critical protections and benefits, which is good for businesses and good for working families,\" she said in a statement.\n\nSome major employers, like Target and Walgreens, have recently made major changes to employee benefits. Target dropped coverage for part-time workers, while Walgreen Co. moved employees onto a private exchange with a set contribution. Almost half of large employers, in a 2012 ADP survey, said they started to implement consumer-driven health plans and offer wellness incentives as a way to bring down costs.\n\nThe think tank\u2019s study is being released as the House is set to vote this week on a bill that would alter the ACA\u2019s employer mandate requiring mid-sized and large companies to provide insurance to full-time employees or pay fines. The bill would change the ACA\u2019s definition of full-time employee from 30 hours per week to the more traditional 40 hours.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Large employers see costs from the health law, though they're already changing health benefit strategies.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Large employers see costs from the health law, though they're already changing health benefit strategies.", "title": "Large employers see costs from Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/01/large-employers-see-costs-from-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/11/wonk1121.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jasonmillman"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/01/large-employers-see-costs-from-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "The survey aims to provide a glimpse into what costs the large employers expect if they don\u2019t react to the Affordable Care Act.\nThink tank president Tevi Troy, a former deputy health secretary under President George W.
