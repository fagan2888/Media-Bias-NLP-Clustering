Max Baucus\n\nThe White House announced Friday that President Barack Obama will nominate Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) as the next U.S. ambassador to China.\n\n\u201cFor more than two decades Max Baucus has worked to deepen the relationship between the United States and China,\u201d Obama said in a statement. \u201cThe economic agreements he helped forge have created millions of American jobs and added billions of dollars to our economy, and he\u2019s perfectly suited to build on that progress in his new role.\u201d\n\nBaucus said he was \u201chumbled by the nomination and deeply honored.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-China relationship is one of the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationships,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be presented with an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of my mentor, Mike Mansfield, who worked to strengthen and improve America\u2019s important relationships throughout Asia. I welcome this opportunity to continue to serve Montana and my country.\u201d\n\nMansfield, a Montana Democratic Senator, was the longest-serving U.S. ambassador to Japan.\n\nBaucus, Montana\u2019s longest-serving senator, is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and has immense experience in matters of trade. He has visited China multiple times and led the U.S. effort in the 1990s to bring the country into the World Trade Organization. Still, some observers have viewed Baucus as an odd choice for ambassador to China, as he is neither Chinese American nor speaks fluent Chinese. The Washington Post notes that the office was has been held by fluent Chinese speakers 24 out of the past 32 years.\n\nTapping Baucus will take a thorn out of the administration\u2019s side on some domestic issues, particularly Obamacare. Baucus has been a frequent critic of the implementation of the health care law, which has come as some surprise since he is one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s chief architects. In April, Baucus warned of a \u201chuge train wreck\u201d looming in the law\u2019s implementation.\n\nBaucus has recently released a series of sweeping tax reforms, including a plan to lower the corporate tax rate in exchange for moving offshore profits from U.S. companies back home. The senator, who planned to retire in 2014, will now pass his years of work to Ron Wyden, the Senator from Oregon who will likely succeed him on the Finance Committee. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock will appoint Baucus\u2019 interim successor. Jim Messina, who was Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign manager and one of Baucus\u2019 chiefs of staff, was approached for the position, but said Thursday that he is not considering the appointment.\n\nLast week Baucus, 72, told the New York Times that he\u2019s ready for \u201ca whole new adventure, a whole new chapter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House announced Friday that President Barack Obama will nominate Sen.
