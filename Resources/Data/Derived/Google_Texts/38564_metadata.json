Farooq Khan/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nA senior police officer overseeing the investigation of an acid attack on a young Indian doctor earlier this week said it is \u201cone of the most twisted cases\u201d he has ever dealt with \u2013 allegedly involving a jilted suitor who sought to disfigure the victim because she didn\u2019t return his affections.\n\n\u201cThis is a case that will shake everyone\u2019s conscience,\u201d said Tajinder Luthra, joint commissioner for Delhi police.\n\nOn Tuesday, two masked men threw acid into the face of a 30-year-old doctor while she was riding a scooter in Delhi, snatched her purse and fled. The woman, who hasn\u2019t been identified publicly, suffered chemical burns on her right hand and face and is at risk of losing vision in her right eye, Mr. Luthra said.\n\nThe robbery was a sham aimed at misleading police, said Pushpendra Kumar, deputy commissioner of police for western Delhi. Mr. Kumar said the real motive for the crime was far more complex.\n\nOn Thursday, police arrested a friend of the victim, another medical doctor, who police allege masterminded the attack \u2013 so that he would be able to woo the woman, who had earlier rebuffed his romantic advances.\n\n\u201cThe motive was rejection by the girl. The spurned doctor wanted to marry her by winning her over after he nursed her back to health,\u201d said Mr. Kumar.\n\nPolice also arrested two men on the motorbike, both minors under the age of 18, who were allegedly hired by the doctor to carry out the attack as well as a 20-year-old friend of the doctor who police say acted as an intermediary.\n\nNone of the accused, who are in police custody, could be reached for comment on Friday. Police said they didn\u2019t yet have legal representation.\n\nStudies suggest India has one of the highest incidences of acid violence. Women are often targeted for turning down advances by men, rejecting marriage proposals, and other kinds of domestic disputes.\n\n\u201cMen want to teach woman a lesson generally,\u201d Mr. Luthra said of assaults with acid. \u201cIn this case also the accused wanted to teach her a lesson that \u2018you are not choosing me. You are going to suffer for it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s top court has passed laws trying to restrict sales in order to prevent acid attacks.\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court of India said anyone under the age of 18 should be barred from purchasing hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acids, which are often used as cleaning products. Stores were also directed to keep details of quantities sold and addresses and identities of buyers.\n\nMr. Luthra said the source of the acid used in this attack is still under investigation.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A senior police officer overseeing the investigation of an acid attack on a young Indian doctor earlier this week said it is \u201cone of the most twisted cases\u201d he has ever dealt with \u2013 allegedly involving a jilted suitor who sought to disfigure the victim because she didn\u2019t return his affections.", "title": "Police Say Acid Attack on Doctor Was Plotted by a Rebuffed Suitor", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/26/police-say-acid-attack-on-doctor-was-plotted-by-a-rebuffed-suitor/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GE192_iacid1_G_20141226094038.jpg"}, "site": "WSJIndia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Police Say Acid Attack on Doctor Was Plotted by a Rebuffed Suitor", "description": "A senior police officer overseeing the investigation of an acid attack on a young Indian doctor earlier this week said it is \u201cone of the most twisted cases\u201d he has ever dealt with \u2013 allegedly involving a jilted suitor who sought to disfigure the victim because she didn\u2019t return his affections.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Suryatapa Bhattacharya", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "India Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "India Real Time", "article.summary": "A senior police officer overseeing the investigation of an acid attack on a young Indian doctor earlier this week said it is \u201cone of the most twisted cases\u201d he has ever dealt with \u2013 allegedly involving a jilted suitor who sought to disfigure the victim because she didn\u2019t return his affections.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-26T14:43:50-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/26/police-say-acid-attack-on-doctor-was-plotted-by-a-rebuffed-suitor/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-IRTB-27692", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A senior police officer overseeing the investigation of an acid attack on a young Indian doctor earlier this week said it is \u201cone of the most twisted cases\u201d he has ever dealt with \u2013 allegedly involving a jilted suitor who sought to disfigure the victim because she didn\u2019t return his affections.", "title": "Police Say Acid Attack on Doctor Was Plotted by a Rebuffed Suitor", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/26/police-say-acid-attack-on-doctor-was-plotted-by-a-rebuffed-suitor/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GE192_iacid1_G_20141226094038.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "India Real Time", "article.id": "BL-IRTB-27692", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-29T00:31:18-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc47e\"", "article_summary": "Students protested against an acid attack on a woman in Srinagar on Dec.12.\nMr. Luthra said the source of the acid used in this attack is still under investigation.\nThe spurned doctor wanted to marry her by winning her over after he nursed her back to health,\u201d said Mr. Kumar.\n\u201cMen want to teach woman a lesson generally,\u201d Mr. Luthra said of assaults with acid.\nOn Tuesday, two masked men threw acid into the face of a 30-year-old doctor while she was riding a scooter in Delhi, snatched her purse and fled."}
