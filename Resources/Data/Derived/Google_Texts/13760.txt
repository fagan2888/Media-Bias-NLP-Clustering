JOY REID, MSNBC: Congresswoman, you know the president obviously now has higher approval ratings. He goes into this State of the Union in better shape than he has been in previous [years]. But there's also this poll that shows Republicans taking the brunt of the public's criticism as being too stubborn in dealing with the president but also 45% of Americans say it is the president who has been too stubborn. Specifically in dealing with the Republicans, your Senate colleagues, are they going to be using the filibuster as aggressively as Republicans did?



REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL), DNC CHAIRWOMAN: Well, if past is prologue, then I think yes, very likely they will be. The obstruction that has been the hallmark of this Republican Congress in the House I think will now be adopted by the Senate. And, look, just the opening bell since the new Congress began saw more repeals or huge modifications by the Republicans to the Affordable Care Act to take health care away from people.



That they've made sure that they try to roll back the president's immigration policy so that we can kick more immigrants out of the country. This is not a signal that they're ready to sit down and bond and work together. And then to add insult to injury, they choose Joni Ernst to be the response for the State of the Union. This is a woman who decided that the best thing to do for education is to repeal the federal student loan program and opposes pell grants. College can't be paid for with a winning smile. It's going to take more than personality to make sure we can make life better for the middle class.
