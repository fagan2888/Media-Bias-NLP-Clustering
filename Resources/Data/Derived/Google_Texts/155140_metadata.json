The California Building Industry Association has challenged the law, arguing it would force developers to pass on to buyers of their new homes the costs for the below-market units, driving up already high Silicon Valley housing prices.\n\nSan Jose would require developers to offer 15 percent of units in new projects of 20 or more units at below-market rates, with a goal of avoiding concentrating affordable housing projects in redevelopment areas where they are already required. Developers could opt out of building the affordable units by paying a fee instead, which the housing industry has estimated could run about $122,000 per house.\n\nLast year, a Santa Clara County judge invalidated the law, concluding that San Jose city officials failed to show that new home construction creates an affordable housing shortage. But the San Jose-based 6th District Court of Appeal reinstated the law in June, concluding the lower court used the wrong analysis and must re-examine the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state Supreme Court will receive legal briefs on the conflict in the coming months and at some point set the case for oral argument.\n\nHoward Mintz covers legal affairs.
