Of the 7,820 students who voted, 46 percent voted for the fee and 54 percent voted against it. MU Libraries needed 60 percent of votes to approve the fee.\n\nGaunt said students have contacted him and offered to help advocate for increased library funding. He said even students who voted against the fee because they thought the money should come from someplace else have contacted him this week.\n\nThe library proposal called for a $15 per credit hour fee by the 2021-2022 school year. The fee would have been phased in over six years, starting at $5 per credit hour next school year. Once the fee was fully implemented, the library\u2019s revenue would have increased to about $30.7 million. MU Libraries\u2019 revenue for fiscal year 2014 was about $17.7 million.\n\nLibrary officials will meet with the faculty library committee and a recently created student advisory council to help decide where cuts can be made.\n\n\u201cWe will be laying out the details in a very transparent manner of where we are as a library and getting their input,\u201d Gaunt said.\n\nGraduate Professional Council President Hallie Thompson said she has heard mixed reactions from graduate students since the fee failed Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern with regard to access to research journals, because that\u2019s possibly one of the easiest areas to cut funding,\u201d Thompson said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"site": "@columbiatribune", "description": "Students and faculty will help University of Missouri Libraries decide what cuts to make in the future to balance the department\u2019s budget after students rejected a library fee this week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Library seeks input from students, faculty after fee fails"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/education/library-seeks-input-from-students-faculty-after-fee-fails/article_7ca5fdbf-8654-59e9-8d1c-4f2665cbbc1e.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "Students and faculty will help University of Missouri Libraries decide what cuts to make in the future to balance the department\u2019s budget after students rejected a library fee this week.", "title": "Library seeks input from students, faculty after fee fails"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "univeristy of missouri,mu libraries,library fee", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Students and faculty will help University of Missouri Libraries decide what cuts to make in the future to balance the department\u2019s budget after students rejected a library fee this week."}, "article_summary": "Students and faculty will help University of Missouri Libraries decide what cuts to make in the future to balance the department\u2019s budget after students rejected a library fee this week.\nMU Libraries\u2019 revenue for fiscal year 2014 was about $17.7 million.\nOf the 7,820 students who voted, 46 percent voted for the fee and 54 percent voted against it.\nGaunt said students have contacted him and offered to help advocate for increased library funding.\nStudents voted Monday through Wednesday this week."}
