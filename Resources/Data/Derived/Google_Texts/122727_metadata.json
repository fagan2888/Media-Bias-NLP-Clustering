The most egregious concern the substance of the fight, the identity of the perpetrators and the origins of the current eruption.\n\n(1) Substance\n\nPresident Obama indignantly insists that GOP attempts to abolish or amend Obamacare are unseemly because it is \u201csettled\u201d law, having passed both houses of Congress, obtained his signature and passed muster with the Supreme Court.\n\nYes, settledness makes for a strong argument \u2014 except from a President whose administration has unilaterally changed Obamacare five times after its passage, including, most brazenly, a year-long suspension of the employer mandate.\n\nArticle 1 of the Constitution grants the legislative power entirely to Congress. Under what constitutional principle has Obama unilaterally amended the law? Yet when the House of Representatives undertakes a constitutionally correct, i.e., legislative, procedure for suspending the other mandate \u2014 the individual mandate \u2014 this is portrayed as some extra-constitutional sabotage of the rule of law. Why is tying that amendment to a generalized spending bill an outrage, while unilateral amendment by the executive (with a Valerie Jarrett blog item for spin) is perfectly fine?\n\n(2) Perpetrators\n\nThe mainstream media have been fairly unanimous in blaming the government shutdown on the GOP. Accordingly, House Republicans presented three bills to restore funding to national parks, veterans and the District of Columbia government. Democrats voted down all three. (For procedural reasons, the measures required a two-thirds majority.)\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid won\u2019t even consider these refunding measures. And the White House has promised a presidential veto.\n\nThe reason is obvious: to prolong the pain and thus add to the political advantage gained from a shutdown blamed on the GOP. They are confident the media will do a \u201cGOP makes little Johnny weep at the closed gates of Yellowstone, film at 11\u201d despite Republicans having just offered legislation to open them.\n\n(3) Origins\n\nThe most ubiquitous conventional wisdom is that the ultimate cause of these troubles is out-of-control tea party anarchists.\n\n(Orlin Wagner/AP)\n\nBut is this really where the causal chain ends?\n\nFrom Social Security to civil rights to Medicaid to Medicare, never in the modern history of the country has major social legislation been enacted on a straight party-line vote. Yet Obamacare \u2014 which revolutionizes one-sixth of the economy, regulates every aspect of medical practice and intimately affects just about every citizen \u2014 passed without a single GOP vote.\n\nThe Democrats insist they welcomed contributing ideas from Republicans. Rubbish. Republicans proposed that insurance be purchasable across state lines. They got nothing. They sought serious tort reform. They got nothing. Why? Because, admitted Howard Dean, Democrats didn\u2019t want to offend the trial lawyers.\n\nMoreover, the administration was clearly warned. Republican Scott Brown ran in the most inhospitable of states, Massachusetts, on the explicit promise to cast the deciding vote blocking Obamacare. It was January 2010, the height of the debate. He won. Reid ignored this unmistakable message of popular opposition and conjured a parliamentary maneuver \u2014 reconciliation \u2014 to get around Brown.\n\nNothing illegal about that. Nothing illegal about ramming it through without a single opposition vote. Just totally contrary to the modern American tradition \u2014 and the constitutional decency \u2014 of undertaking major social revolutions only with bipartisan majorities. Having stuffed Obamacare down the throats of the GOP and the country, Democrats are now paying the price.\n\nI thought the Republicans\u2019 defunding demand impossible and, therefore, foolish. I thought that if, nonetheless, they insisted on making a stand, it should not be on shutting down the government, which voters oppose 5-to-1, but on the debt ceiling, which Americans favor 2-to-1 as a vehicle for restraining government.\n\nTactics are one thing, but substance is another. It\u2019s the Democrats who have mocked the very notion of settled law. It\u2019s the Democrats who voted down the reopening of substantial parts of the government. It\u2019s the Democrats who gave life to a spontaneous, authentic, small-government opposition \u2014 aka the Tea Party \u2014 with their unilateral imposition of a transformational agenda during the brief interval when they held a monopoly of power.\n\nThat interval is over. The current unrest is the residue of that hubris.\n\nletters@charleskrauthammer.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles Krauthammer", "twitter": {"description": "Krauthammer: The Obamacare/shutdown battle has spawned myriad myths.
