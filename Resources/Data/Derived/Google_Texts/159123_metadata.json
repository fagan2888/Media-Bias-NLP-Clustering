Our businesses have added 12 million new jobs. Nationwide, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 5.5 percent today. Our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high. After five years of the Affordable Care Act, more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained the security of health coverage. And in perhaps the most hopeful sign of all, wages are finally on the rise.\n\nThis progress is a direct result of American drive and determination. It has been a long, hard road, but America is coming back.\n\nAs any American will tell you, however, we still have work to do. In our 21st Century economy, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure. It means preparing Americans to earn good jobs, and building a competitive economy so that our businesses can keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.\n\nThese ideas aren't about ideology. I've proposed them because they work. Unfortunately, last week Republicans in Congress unveiled a budget that represents the opposite of middle-class economics. It would hand out big new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and let taxes go up for students and working families. It would cut investments in education to their lowest levels since 2000 and double the number of Americans without health insurance.\n\nThis week, Republicans put forward another big economic plan, and once again, its centerpiece was another huge tax cut for those at the very top. This new tax cut would cost more than $250 billion, and it would apply to just one-tenth of one percent of Americans - in Alabama, it would apply to fewer than 50 people per year. I don't think our top economic priority should be helping a tiny number of Americans who are already doing extraordinarily well, and asking everybody else to foot the bill. Our top priority should be helping everybody who works hard get ahead.\n\nThat priority is what brought me to Birmingham. Because, as I said during my visit to Lawson State Community College, one way to make sure paychecks go farther is to make sure working families don't get ripped off.\n\nThat's why, five years ago, we passed historic Wall Street reform to turn the page on the kind of recklessness that led to the worst economic crisis in decades. And as part of that reform, we created an independent consumer watchdog with just one mission: looking out for ordinary Americans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already put over $5 billion back in the pockets of more than 15 million families. And this week, they took an important first steps towards cracking down on some of the most abusive practices involving payday loans.\n\nEvery year, millions of Americans take out these loans. In Alabama, there are four times as many payday lending stores as there are McDonald's. In theory, these loans help you deal with a one-time expense, but in reality, most payday loans are taken out, at least in part, to pay for previous loans. You borrow money to pay for the money you already borrowed. That means people often end up trapped in a cycle of debt. If you take out a $500 loan, it's easy to wind up paying more than $1,000 in interest and fees.\n\nThe step the CFPB announced this week is designed to change that. The idea is pretty common sense: if you're a payday lender preparing to give a loan, you should make sure that the borrower can afford to pay it back first. It's one more way Wall Street reform is protecting working families and taxpayers. And it's one more reason it makes no sense that the budget Republicans unveiled last week would make it harder, not easier, to crack down on financial fraud and abuse.\n\nProtecting consumers and making paychecks go farther should not be a partisan issue. It's about shared values of honesty and fair play, a basic bargain that says that in America, hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded. When our country lives up to these ideals of fairness and opportunity for all, every one of us is better off for it. And for every day I have the privilege of serving as your President, I will never stop fighting to make sure ordinary citizens in Alabama, and across our great country, have a fair shot to get ahead.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "obama in birmingham, payday loans, opinion", "title": "'Why I came to Birmingham' by President Barack Obama", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "By President Barack Obama Earlier this week, I visited Birmingham to speak about what I call \"middle-class economics\": the idea that our country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by...", "title": "'Why I came to Birmingham' by President Barack Obama", "url": "http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/03/why_i_came_to_birmingham_by_pr.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alphotos/photo/2015/03/26/17363343-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alphotos/photo/2015/03/26/17363343-large.jpg", "description": "By President Barack Obama Earlier this week, I visited Birmingham to speak about what I call \"middle-class economics\": the idea that our country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by...", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Why I came to Birmingham' by President Barack Obama"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, March 27, 2015,  8:01 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, March 27, 2015,  2:57 PM", "article_author": "Guest Voices", "Description": "By President Barack Obama Earlier this week, I visited Birmingham to speak about what I call \"middle-class economics\": the idea that our country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.&nbsp; Today, we are in a 60-month streak of private-sector job creation.&nbsp; Our businesses have added 12 million new jobs.&nbsp; Nationwide, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 5.5 percent today.&nbsp; Our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high.&nbsp; After five years of the Affordable Care Act, more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained the security of health coverage.
