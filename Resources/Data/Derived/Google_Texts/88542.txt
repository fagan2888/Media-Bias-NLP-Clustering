PHILADELPHIA â€” Philly residents already know their city is a world-class place, but it never hurts to have someone confirm that distinction once in a while.

The Organization of World Heritage Cities has named Philadelphia a UNESCO World Heritage City.

Philadelphia is the first city in the United States to earn this designation.

City leaders have spent the last two years pursuing the title. Other World Heritage Cities include Paris, Rome, Cairo and Tel-Aviv.

Cities earning this title must have made significant impacts on the world and be home to UNESCO World Heritage sites. Independence Hall was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.

How will this designation benefit Philadelphia? Increased tourism is the most obvious answer, according to a story on Philly.com.

Officials with the city and the World Heritage organization noted in the story that there are other long-term benefits.

Philadelphia will now have access to programs that can help maintain and promote its heritage and the city could establish education and business partnerships with other World Heritage cities.

"As a World Heritage City, Philadelphia is being officially recognized on the global stage for its wealth of contributions to the world as the epicenter of American democracy and for its enduring commitment to preserving the unique historical and cultural assets in our diverse community," Mayor Michael Nutter said in a statement. "As we celebrate this milestone, the next step is to focus on the future and how we can optimize this World Heritage City recognition to attract more people to visit, invest, work, study and live in Philadelphia."

The city will celebrate the new designation with a "Toast to World Heritage PHL" at the Independence Visitors Center on Nov. 11 at 4 p.m.
