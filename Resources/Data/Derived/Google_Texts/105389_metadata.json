I think we need to make the case that our policies are better for everybody.\u201d\n\nJindal, speaking Monday to a dozen reporters gathered at The Heritage Foundation for a briefing on his new education reform plan, returned several times to the seriousness of what eventually will be the choice between a Democrat and a Republican to succeed President Obama in November 2016.\n\n>>> Bobby Jindal on Anti-Common Core Moms: \u2018I Wouldn\u2019t Bet Against Them\u2019\n\n\u201cAs Republicans, I think we need to make the point that our policies help every child who aspires to join the middle class,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cSchool choice, to me, is a great example \u2026 of a policy that is consistent with our principles but also benefits all kinds of children, all kinds of parents across the political spectrum, across every kind of line that the Democrats want to divide us by.\u201d\n\nHe said:\n\nI think this next election has to be a debate worthy of the voters. We\u2019ve got important decisions to make. It\u2019s not just going to be about who can tell the best joke or give the best speech. We had that election, and we got this president who needs six years of on-the-job training because he\u2019s never run anything before.\n\nReferring to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the overwhelming Democratic favorite, he added:\n\nWe don\u2019t need four more years of this. And I do think Secretary Clinton would be a continuation of that, by the way. Instead, we need a Republican Party that stands up and says we\u2019re not a top-down party, we\u2019re a bottom-up party that believes in the American people and freedom and the American dream\u2014not being about a bigger, larger, more expensive government that\u2019s all about redistribution.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t win, Jindal said, by casting themselves as \u201ccheaper Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this next election has to be a debate worthy of the voters.\u201d\u2013@BobbyJindal\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want us to do is say, \u2018Well, if they\u2019re willing to spend this much, we\u2019ll spend half as much and call it less bad.\u2019 You\u2019ve seen that in the Obamacare replacement debate,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have already said, \u2018Hey, look, it\u2019s too late, you can\u2019t repeal all the [Obamacare] taxes; he\u2019s already created an entitlement program, so we\u2019ve got to create one that\u2019s smaller.\u2019 That\u2019s a mistake, to me.\u201d\n\n>>> Jindal Emphasizes Teacher Tenure Reform, School Choice in Sweeping Education Plan\n\nSo, one reporter asked, why is the two-term Louisiana governor and former congressman struggling to gain traction among his party\u2019s other unannounced White House hopefuls in early polls?\n\n\u201cLook, I live in a state that\u2019s farther away from major media markets, I get it,\u201d Jindal , 43, said:\n\nI don\u2019t think this election will be decided by the insiders. I don\u2019t think the voters want the donors, the political consultants, the establishment, to pick their candidate, to clear the field. I know there are a lot of Republicans who are wringing their hands and say, \u2018Well, this is messy. We might have too many debates and it might go on too long.\u2019 Well, the reality is democracy is messy.\n\nThe nomination battle \u201cis going to be a long process,\u201d Jindal predicted, in part because the party has \u201cmore credible candidates than we\u2019ve had in a long time\u201d and none is \u201cpre-ordained.\u201d\n\nThe job of Republican primary voters will be to test and put forward an authentic, conservative alternative to the Democrats\u2019 nominee, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has made the decision that they want to be the party of the far left,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cYou can see that in their policies, in small ways like on [the] Keystone [oil pipeline] and in big ways in terms of their blocking school choice and their doubling down on their failed policies as evidenced by the president\u2019s [State of the Union] speech.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'I think we need to make the case that our policies are better for everybody,' the Louisiana governor says of the Republican presidential contest.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "'I think we need to make the case that our policies are better for everybody,' the Louisiana governor says of the Republican presidential contest.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Urges 2016 Race \u2018Worthy of the Voters\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rsphotos022948.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-10T14:12:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CbQV7i"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "'I think we need to make the case that our policies are better for everybody,' the Louisiana governor says of the Republican presidential contest.", "creator": "@KenMac55", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rsphotos022948.jpg"}, "title": "Bobby Jindal Urges 2016 Race \u2018Worthy of the Voters\u2019", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-02-10T03:01:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-10T14:12:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bobby Jindal, 2016 presidential race, Bobby Jindal for president, Bobby Jindal Common Core, Bobby Jindal school choice, Bobby Jindal Republican nomination"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc1d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we need to pander, I don\u2019t think we need to change our principles.\nI don\u2019t think the voters want the donors, the political consultants, the establishment, to pick their candidate, to clear the field.\nReferring to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the overwhelming Democratic favorite, he added:We don\u2019t need four more years of this.\nIf he runs for president, Bobby Jindal says he\u2019ll be ready to make the case that conservative policies help the most Americans.\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has made the decision that they want to be the party of the far left,\u201d Jindal said."}
