The student plan expires July 31.\n\nThe college acknowledged the decision, announced July 10, doesn't leave much time for students to find new coverage. It points students to a section on the Wheaton College website where they can learn about how to find a private health insurance plan or one on the federal public health insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cWe regret that we were not able to provide earlier notice of this significant change, which affects roughly a quarter of our student body,\u201d Paul Chelsen, Wheaton College vice president for student development, wrote in a July 22 announcement on the college's website inviting students to an information session about finding new health insurance plans. \u201cThe college is considering all of its options and will explore the possibility of again offering a (student health insurance plan) in the future if circumstances allow us to do so in good conscience.\u201d\n\nA Wheaton College spokeswoman did not return a message to comment.\n\nThe college's lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting not to have to comply with the mandate, is pending. Earlier this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit denied the college's request for preliminary relief.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_19:43:24", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "title": "Wheaton College ends student health insurance, citing Obamacare mandate", "taxo_Industries": "Health Insurance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150728/NEWS03/150729801/AR/0/Wheaton-College-student-health-insurance.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Students at the west suburban Christian liberal arts school will have to scramble to find new coverage.", "title": "Wheaton College ends student health insurance, citing Obamacare mandate", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150728/NEWS03/150729801/wheaton-college-ends-student-health-insurance-citing-obamacare-mandate", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150728/NEWS03/150729801/AR/0/Wheaton-College-student-health-insurance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Students at the west suburban Christian liberal arts school will have to scramble to find new coverage.", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150729801", "published_at": "2015-7-28", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150728/NEWS03/150729801/AR/0/Wheaton-College-student-health-insurance.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Wheaton College ends student health insurance, citing Obamacare mandate"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "Students at Wheaton College who have health insurance through school have just a few more days to find new coverage.\nIt points students to a section on the Wheaton College website where they can learn about how to find a private health insurance plan or one on the federal public health insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov.\nThe west suburban Christian liberal arts college will not renew its student health insurance plan for the 2015-16 school year in light of the Obamacare mandate to provide contraceptives, which the college opposes for religious reasons.\n\u201cThe college is considering all of its options and will explore the possibility of again offering a (student health insurance plan) in the future if circumstances allow us to do so in good conscience.\u201dA Wheaton College spokeswoman did not return a message to comment.\nThe student plan expires July 31."}
