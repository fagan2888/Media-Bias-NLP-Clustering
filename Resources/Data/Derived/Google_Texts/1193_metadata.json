As a lifelong Catholic and Cincinnatian, a student, and a product of the Dominican and Jesuit traditions, I know firsthand the difference a Catholic education can yield in the life of a child, not only from the perspective of holistic faith-formation, but also in an academic sense given the rigor and individualization of Catholic curricula. The unique merging of challenging academic content with Catholic doctrine in a socially-enriching environment is a school choice that I value exceedingly, which is why the Archdiocese\u2019s adoption of the untested Common Core State Standards, which jeopardizes this distinct brand of education, dismays me.\n\nYour Excellency, the exploration of quintessentially Catholic works is among the most valuable and characteristic functions of a Catholic institution. Given that CCSS drives standardized assessments, which shape the curricula of Catholic teachers who will now be evaluated by their pupils\u2019 test scores in accordance with federal mandate, and given that Common Core ELA standards lend no credence to Catholic texts or concepts, where is the foreseeable value in the imposition of these standards? What a travesty that Catholic educators should be discouraged from assessing both the literary and theological implications of Augustine\u2019s \u201cConfessions\u201d and other religious works in the classroom simply because they do not fit national consortia\u2019s conception of what it means to be \u201ccollege and career ready,\u201d and what a pity that the Church in Cincinnati should condone such an insular and utilitarian understanding of preparedness. What a shame that Catholic education should be robbed of its definitive tenets and made to be like any other nationalized option, thereby decreasing school choice and indicting the rich heritage of Christian learning.\n\nMoreover, if the Church contends that parents, clergy and Catholic educators are to serve as a child\u2019s primary influences in learning and faith-formation, how might one reconcile the Catholic model with reforms that remove parents from the education process, reduce teachers to paper-pushers, and concern learning with the vocational rather than the metaphysical, thereby elevating state over church? Your Excellency, our Archdiocese already had standards; they regularly outperformed the standards of other local schools. Why, then, should we abandon them and adopt untried standards that cannot be altered due to national copyright, that experts have deemed developmentally inappropriate, that violate the principles of federalism via Race to the Top, and that mine students\u2019 longitudinal data? I implore you to heed the mounting concerns of your flock and to reconsider your adoption of Common Core for the sake of your Archdiocese\u2019s children and the integrity of Catholic education itself.\n\nIn response to Mittermeier\u2019s letter, Jim Rigg, superintendent of Catholic schools for the archdiocese of Cincinnati, responded, \u201cAs someone who is not an educator in our schools, Mr. Mittermeier is evidently not aware of the stance of the Archdiocese in regards to the Common Core.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis statements that the Archdiocese is \u2018adopting\u2019 Common Core and that our curriculum does not present the Catholic faith are inaccurate,\u201d Rigg continued, adding that in order to achieve the goal of forming children in both faith values and academics, \u201cwe must ensure that our programs are high quality and up-to-date. The Common Core movement represents an enormous paradigm shift in the way that knowledge, in both public and private schools, is delivered to students.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs schools obligated to provide superior teaching and learning, we would be remiss in ignoring such a significant movement,\u201d Rigg wrote. \u201cHowever, we are not \u2018adopting\u2019 the Common Core. We are \u2018adapting\u2019 the standards. These words are more than just semantics.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdaptation means that we take the Common Core standards, which are integrated into Ohio\u2019s Learning Standards, make them more rigorous, and infuse them with the Catholic faith.\u201d\n\nReilly, however, said that Catholic education leaders are mistaken in their analysis of what the Common Core actually encompasses.\n\n\u201cIronically, I fear that some Catholic leaders may be falling into the very trap of \u2018close reading\u2019 that is one of the great flaws of Common Core,\u201d he said. \u201cConfining analysis to the standards alone, as if they are the baseline for education, and then trying to \u2018infuse\u2019 them with Catholic instruction, makes it highly difficult to appreciate the standards\u2019 significant conflicts with the traditional methods and mission of Catholic schools.\u201d\n\nReilly commented further on Mittermeier\u2019s concern about the removal of parents from the education process with the Common Core standards.\n\n\u201cThe notion that parents are the primary educators of their children is countercultural but central to Catholic teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is its practical application in the Common Core matter? Parents were never involved in the decision to embrace this \u2018enormous paradigm shift\u2019 in Catholic education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI rejoice in the great love and concern for faithful Catholic education that is exhibited in Mr. Mittermeier\u2019s letter and the strong assurances of similar love and concern by Dr. Rigg,\u201d Reilly continued. \u201cTheir exchange is encouraging, but only the beginning to a much more robust, deeply considered conversation that still needs to occur with Catholic parents and educators, acknowledging that there is no need for Catholic schools to rush into this.\u201d\n\nIn December of 2013, Cardinal Newman Society launched its program titled \u201cCatholic Is Our Core,\u201d a project to help parents become involved in the debate about the Common Core standards and to emphasize that Catholic faith is the \u201ccore\u201d of Catholic education.\n\nThe new program came on the heels of a letter sent to the United States Catholic bishops by over 130 Catholic scholars, requesting that the bishops abandon any implementation of the Common Core standards.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we are convinced that Common Core is so deeply flawed that it should not be adopted by Catholic schools which have yet to approve it,\u201d the letter reads, \u201cand that those schools which have already endorsed it should seek an orderly withdrawal now.\u201d\n\nCatholic scholar Anne Hendershott, a professor of sociology at Franciscan University, even compared Sister Dale McDonald\u2019s \u201cGold and Platinum Textbook Partners\u2018\u201d affiliation with the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA) as an assist to getting Common Core into Catholic schools, to Sister Carol Keehan\u2019s Catholic Health Association helping to shepherd the passage of ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want the future of Catholic education to be determined by publishers, university professors and the NCEA, which has taken substantial funds from the Gates Foundation to promote Common Core,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nBut starting from our schools\u2019 primary mission of forming students in the faith, respecting parents as their children\u2019s primary educators, and preparing students intellectually to make value judgments and display more than utilitarian functionality, there\u2019s no question that we would never end up with the standards and teaching methods that Bill Gates and his band of reformers would like to impose.\n\n\u201cBravo for Catholic schools and Mr. Mittermeier\u2019s parents,\u201d Reilly concluded. \u201cIf Bill Gates wants workforce-ready graduates, why wouldn\u2019t he seek to emulate Catholic schools rather than be a party to their decline?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Common Core Has Significant Conflicts with Mission of Catholic Schools, Says Education Leader", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Common Core Has Significant Conflicts with Mission of Catholic Schools, Says Education Leader", "title": "Common Core Has Significant Conflicts with Mission of Catholic Schools, Says Education Leader -
