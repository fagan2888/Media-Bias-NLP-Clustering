Brighton police announced Saturday night they had arrested a 24-year-old man they believe drove a stolen Lexus into a patrol car while escaping and then stole a pickup after he crashed the first stolen car.

Cesar Irreza is being investigated for multiple possible violations, according to a Brighton police news release. The convicted car thief is on probation, according to court records.

A witness called police at 5:45 p.m. Friday after spotting a fugitive driving a stolen white Lexus near North 19th Avenue and Longs Peak Street in Brighton.

Officers spotted the car and attempted to pull it over.

The suspect drove the stolen car into the patrol car while speeding away.

Brighton police officers gave chase, pursuing the car into Hudson.

Irreza allegedly crashed the car into an irrigation ditch on Colorado 52 near Evergreen Street.

He allegedly ran from the car into a nearby neighborhood.

A resident later reported that his white 2005 GMC 1500 pickup was stolen by a man matching the description of Irreza. Police are still trying to locate the truck with Colorado plate 326MKJ.

At about 7:06 a.m. Saturday, Brighton police located and apprehended Irreza at a gas station in Lochbuie.

He was a passenger in a vehicle and was arrested without incident.

He is being held at the Adams County Detention Facility on charges of aggravated motor vehicle theft, aggravated habitual traffic offender, vehicular eluding, hit and run, reckless endangerment and reckless driving.
