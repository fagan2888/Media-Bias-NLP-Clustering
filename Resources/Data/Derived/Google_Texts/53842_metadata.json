I had to go to a hospital and that TMs where they found I had lymphoma in my back.\"\n\nAfter a seven-year battle during which she underwent three surgeries, chemotherapy and steroid treatments the cancer never went away.\n\nDuring those seven years, Buiturerira never went into remission.\n\nSix months ago, Buitureira made the risky decision to go off her medications.\n\n\"I stopped the medicine myself because I wanted to see if I was going to stay the same stage or what was going to happen, obviously it progressed,\" Concepcion Buitureira said.\n\nHer husband of 25 years, Luis Buitureira, didn't support this decision.\n\n\"She just felt tired of the steroids, she said that thing makes her mean and she was never happy with that,\" Luis Buitureira said. \" I always tell her honey you got to take it because the doctor's says so and she said I am tired, I don't want to do it no more.\"\n\nHowever, a week ago after once again being in so much pain that she couldn't walk, tests revealed that Concepcion's cancer had gone from stage 1 to 3 in 6 months.\n\nNow she is receiving radiation with the help of relatives since her family doesn't have the money to pay for it or health insurance.\n\nButureira is one of many in this country who is currently uninsured.\n\nShe says she never got insurance because she never thought that she needed.\n\nHowever, Buitureira tells Action 4 that she is currently working on getting health insurance before the March 31st deadline to enroll for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInsurance she will need for future case since her doctors tell her she needs to go get treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a chance to live longer but that will cost the Buitureira family over 8 thousand dollars.\n\n\"We just need to get her there and with everybody TMs help I know we can do it,\" Luis Buitureira said.\n\nConcepcion Buitureira isn't giving up either.\n\n\"It's not that I am scared but I still have my boys, my mother,\" Concepcion Buitureira said. \"I mean I still think I have a life to live, I am 46 years old.\"\n\nRight now, the family is doing everything they can to raise money.\n\nThey are selling enchilada plates from Isabel TMs Caf at Port Isabel for $4.50.\n\nTo buy plates contact the Buitureira family at 956-579-5883.\n\nThe family also plans on having bake sales to raise funds and will be opening a bank account for donations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Concepcion Buitureira never expected that she would still be battling cancer seven years after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin TMs lymphoma.", "title": "Seven-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not over for Laguna Vista woman", "og": {"site_name": "KGBT", "description": "Concepcion Buitureira never expected that she would still be battling cancer seven years after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin TMs lymphoma.", "title": "Seven-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not over for Laguna Vista woman", "url": "http://valleycentral.com/news/local/seven-year-battle-with-non-hodgkins-lymphoma-not-over-for-laguna-vista-woman", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/30b6765c-725f-49e2-b7ca-b0f1acc16926-CANCER11.jpg?1440608159435", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "http://twitter.com/kgbt", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/30b6765c-725f-49e2-b7ca-b0f1acc16926-CANCER11.jpg?1440608159435", "description": "Concepcion Buitureira never expected that she would still be battling cancer seven years after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin TMs lymphoma.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Seven-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not over for Laguna Vista woman"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 938960942857073}, "keywords": "news,local,TX", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbs4rgv", "published_time": "2014-03-24T04:35:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc48a\"", "article_summary": "Concepcion Buitureira never expected that she would still be battling cancer seven years after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin TMs lymphoma.\n\"It's not that I am scared but I still have my boys, my mother,\" Concepcion Buitureira said.\n46-year old Concepcion Buitureira says that she knew something was wrong when she felt constantly tired doing her daily routines and a growing pain in her legs.\nTo buy plates contact the Buitureira family at 956-579-5883.\n\"We just need to get her there and with everybody TMs help I know we can do it,\" Luis Buitureira said."}
