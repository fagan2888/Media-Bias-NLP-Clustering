Are Mark Zuckerberg, management, venture capitalists, investment bankers, stock market analysts, traders and securities\u2019 market regulators all concealing a different kind of animal underneath the facade presented in Facebook\u2019s public financial disclosures?\n\nAs voters continue to ask tougher questions concerning the current state and future prospects of the American economy, the time has come to re-examine whether Facebook common shares truly deserve their super-high priced valuation level.\n\nJust 10 years old as a company, Facebook generated an impressive 36 cents of free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) for each dollar of revenue earned during 2013. This strong performance markedly outpaced results for 2012, when Facebook generated just 8 cents of free cash flow for each dollar of revenue.\n\nSEE ALSO: Facebook: \u2018Sweeping\u2019 government requests for user data up 24 percent\n\nBut are market participants overvaluing Facebook shares?\n\nAs of Friday, Facebook common shares were priced at $75.60 each, a level that valued the entire company at $210.8 billion. Subtracting Facebook\u2019s excess cash, the company had an \u201centerprise value\u201d of $196.8 billion.\n\nAt current levels, Facebook\u2019s enterprise value is 25 times its 2013 revenues and 68.8 times its 2013 free cash flow.\n\nSEE ALSO: Facebook app increases voter turnout, researchers say\n\nAre such massively high valuation levels reasonable and defensible?\n\nFacebook does not charge its valuable user base any money for the privilege of inserting personal information into its website and then spending as long as those users wish to communicate with old friends and make new ones.\n\nSince its inception, Facebook has instead chosen to be a conduit where manufacturers and service providers can display advertisements, hoping that Facebook users will be induced to make purchases.\n\nOne key question is what the Facebook community looks like, broken down by age, location, income and spending level. A second key set of questions revolves around how engaged and active members of the Facebook community truly are.\n\nOverall, advertising generated 88.7 percent of revenues in 2013, with payments made for \u201cvirtual\u201d products constituting the balance.\n\nThe need for disclosure\n\nJudging from Facebook\u2019s minimal geographic disclosures, performance inside the United States is strong, though growth is slowing, whereas outside the United States, Facebook generates pre-tax losses on more rapidly growing revenues.\n\nInside the United States in 2013, Facebook earned 41 cents of pre-tax income on each dollar of domestic revenue. However, outside America, where Facebook generated 54 percent of its total revenue, the company lost 10 cents on each dollar of foreign sales.\n\nThe company should be able to present far more granular information concerning core advertising revenues, breaking down its market by age, geography and class of product/service sold, yet it chooses not to do so.\n\nIn 2014, how much do individual advertisements actually influence purchasing behavior, particularly inside America?\n\nConsumer behavior does vary substantially according to a variety of factors, most notably age and income.\n\nOne imagines that consumer preferences harden over time, meaning that advertisements targeting younger, more impressionable consumers have more significant influence than those targeting older buyers, whose selection preferences and practices are more firmly set.\n\nDo Facebook advertisers enjoy greatest success with younger members of their community \u2014 if so, this may be cause for serious concern, as these consumers always are stretched financially.\n\nFacebook owes the investing community more detailed data it must be able to deliver to set the record straight.\n\n\u2022 Charles Ortel serves as managing director of Newport Value Partners (NewportValue.com), which provides economic research to executives and to investment firms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A friend once hid an elephant in plain sight for months.
