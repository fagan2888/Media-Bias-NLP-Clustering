A group of aspiring Republican policymakers\u2014including Mike Lee, Paul Ryan, and Marco Rubio\u2014are consulting with conservative scholars and proposing new ideas to redesign the federal government. This resurgence of reform conservatism is a real, growing movement, but at least one major blockade stands in its way: the reflexive Republican opposition to increased spending.\n\nNew York Times columnist Ross Douthat, a member of the reform conservatism brotherhood, demonstrated this in a back-and-forth over inequality with former White House economist Jared Bernstein. Helping the poor means putting more money into anti-poverty programs, Bernstein had written, and paying for those programs would require raising taxes on the rich. In response, Douthat agreed on the need to increase spending on these programs. But the money, he said, should come from elsewhere in government:\n\nGiven that our existing tax code, like the zoning policies mentioned above, has a heavy pro-rentier and pro-rich bias, why couldn\u2019t we start by cutting or capping existing tax subsidies \u2014 for expensive homes, for expensive health insurance, for being a wealthy taxpayer in a high tax state \u2014 and put that money to work first? This would involve \u201cnew revenue,\u201d in a sense, but you wouldn\u2019t have to raise tax rates (as we already just did) in order to get it, and you would be redistributing unearned, effectively-subsidized riches rather than just hacking away more indiscriminately at the idle and entrepreneurial alike.\n\nIn principle, Douthat is right\u2014and Bernstein says as much in a follow-up. But the actual politicians in the Republican Party\u2014the ones who would have to take actual votes, to make these things happen\u2014would never support curtailing the mortgage-interest deduction and using that money to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. Grover Norquist\u2019s infamous anti-tax pledge forbids policymakers not just from raising taxes, but also from supporting \u201cany net reduction or elimination of credits and deductions, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\u201d Norquist\u2019s pledge may not command quite the fealty it once did, as Republicans reluctantly accepted higher taxes on the rich in the fiscal cliff deal and new \u201cfees\u201d in the Murray-Ryan budget. Even so, all but 16 of the 233 House Republicans and seven of the 45 GOP senators have signed it. And it\u2019s not like Republicans are running around calling for the kind of reforms Douthat seems to have in mind.\n\nWhich is too bad. The elimination of tax expenditures is a cause that could win support from conservatives and liberals alike. Those expenditures totaled more than $1.2 trillion in 2013, just slightly less than the $1.3 trillion the federal government collected in individual income taxes. They also overwhelmingly benefit the rich: the top 20 percent of households collected more than half of the expenditures. Economists also widely agree that they are federal spending in another form. Congress could limit tax expenditures and use the money for antipoverty programs without expanding the size of government. The federal government would just be realigning its fiscal priorities to focus on the poor.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "If you talk to smart conservatives these days, they are very excited about the future.
