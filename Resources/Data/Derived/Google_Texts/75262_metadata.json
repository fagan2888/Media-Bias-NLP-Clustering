Additional sessions will focus on science and engineering in addition to filmmaking and game design.\n\nWhile their peers partied, slept late or hit the beach, 18 of Florida\u2019s best and brightest headed to the USF campus to learn the basic science underlying diabetes health; perform hands-on research in USF labs; visit the university\u2019s research centers, including the Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation; and carry out field research at Fort De Soto Park.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a party person anyway,\u201d said Dominic Montas, who will be a junior this fall at Seminole High School in Sanford. \u201cI find this stuff to be more interesting, more fun. I want to get a head start on my college career, and I\u2019m pretty sure this is a really good way to set me apart from everybody else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have time for parties and such later.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the incentive most cited among the participants \u2014 to get a leg up on their peers as they take aim at higher education. There\u2019s motivation for the university as well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a major issue across the country in terms of students remaining in hard-core science and technology majors,\u201d said Richard Pollenz, associate dean and director of the school\u2019s Office for Undergraduate Research and an organizer of Pre-College.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nJust 4 in 10 freshmen who start in the critical STEM fields \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 graduate in one of those fields. And in the new era of performance-based funding, USF and Florida\u2019s other public universities are being judged on how many of their graduates are in programs that the state considers of strategic emphasis, including the critical STEM fields.\n\nUSF reported that 26 percent of bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded in 2012-13 were in STEM fields, and the school wants to push that number to 31 percent by 2016-17.\n\n\u201cA lot of it deals with the fact that the students have to go through a lot of rote-level courses before they can get some experiential components, especially majors-level courses,\u201d Pollenz said. \u201cExperiments like the one we\u2019re doing here give the students hands-on activities, so they can see the application of particular experiments to what they\u2019re learning in the classroom. This has been shown to make a huge difference for the students\u2019 ability to better connect to the major and stick it through.\u201d\n\nOne morning last week, students learned how to use high-end digital pipettes to conduct a standard curve assay. It\u2019s a common college-level lab exercise in measuring and graphing properties such as concentration of a protein then extrapolating those properties onto an unknown sample.\n\nPollenz put the level of the exercise at the sophomore college. A procedure planned the next day might be undertaken in a junior college lab. Many of the participants in Pre-College will be juniors in high school this fall.\n\n\u201cYou empower them and they will be successful,\u201d Pollenz said. \u201cIf the student gets this and they get it early, this is what makes the difference for them staying in the discipline. And that\u2019s the whole point here.\u201d\n\nThe group last week appeared to get it.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nChaya Bhat, who will enter her senior year this fall at Robinson High in Tampa, said she appreciated the opportunity to plow into the \u201cinquiry aspect\u201d of research.\n\nIn high school, \u201cwe\u2019re allowed to do experiments and things like that, but we\u2019re not often allowed to question and explore things in a deeper sense,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re given a standard textbook, and it\u2019s, \u2018Read this, read that,\u2019 and it\u2019s more about learning the information instead of learning the knowledge.\u201d\n\nShanteria Knowles, an incoming senior from Deerfield Beach High School in Broward County, has Type I diabetes and said she hoped the session would help her gain insight into her own condition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I wasn\u2019t well-educated about it before, but I just wanted to go in-depth to see where this chronic illness came from, the scientific reasoning,\u201d she said.\n\nTuition for the STEM Academy on Diabetes & Medicine was $1,295. Other Pre-College residential programs run in the same ballpark. Two-day commuter programs cost less.\n\nThe early Pre-College numbers are encouraging to USF. Of 14 soon-to-be college seniors in the inaugural 2012 course, 10 applied and were accepted to USF and five enrolled in 2013. Four of those were in STEM fields and three were still in those disciplines after their first year.\n\nOf 21 potential students in 2013, 15 applied to USF and 14 were accepted for this fall. So far, three of those have committed to USF, with others still able to do so.\n\nIn addition to the scientific work in the lab and field, Pre-College students also have to navigate the social aspects of dorm life. There were light complaints about thin walls and scheduling bathroom and shower time with a dorm roommate, but the students seemed to be adjusting.\n\n\u201cThe biggest step was realizing that next year, when we head off to college, this is what it\u2019s going to be. It\u2019s the idea of slowly starting to prepare yourself,\u201d said Bhat. \u201cThis is kind of like dipping your toes in the water and getting a feel for what it\u2019s really going to be like.\u201d\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 14 Jun 2014 18:08:31 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 She was missing an end-of-the-school-year party thrown by her friends at King High School, but their attempts to rub it in wouldn\u2019t rile Mallika Bhatta.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 She was missing an end-of-the-school-year party thrown by her friends at King High School, but their attempts to rub it in wouldn\u2019t rile Mallika Bhatta.", "title": "High-schoolers try college life in USF summer program", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/high-schoolers-try-college-life-in-usf-summer-program-20140614/", "image": {"width": 2210, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140614/ARTICLE/140619640/EP/1/2/EP-140619640.jpg", "height": 3000}, "updated_time": "2014-06-14T18:44:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 She was missing an end-of-the-school-year party thrown by her friends at King High School, but their attempts to rub it in wouldn\u2019t rile Mallika Bhatta.", "title": "High-schoolers try college life in USF summer program", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140614/ARTICLE/140619640/AR/0/AR-140619640.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-06-14T18:08:31Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T18:44:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf616\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the scientific work in the lab and field, Pre-College students also have to navigate the social aspects of dorm life.\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a party person anyway,\u201d said Dominic Montas, who will be a junior this fall at Seminole High School in Sanford.\n\u2014 She was missing an end-of-the-school-year party thrown by her friends at King High School, but their attempts to rub it in wouldn\u2019t rile Mallika Bhatta.\nIn high school, \u201cwe\u2019re allowed to do experiments and things like that, but we\u2019re not often allowed to question and explore things in a deeper sense,\u201d she said.\nMany of the participants in Pre-College will be juniors in high school this fall."}
