They listen attentively as Leah Ricci gives a lecture on the merits of fiber and where to get it. As far as lectures on fiber are concerned, this one is pretty rousing.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like vegetables and fruit, but now we\u2019re all eating more of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan anyone name some foods that are high in fiber?\u201d she asks.\n\nImmediately the participants begin to throw out suggestions.\n\n\u201cBeans. Apples. Greens. Seeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do all of these foods have in common?\u201d Ricci asks.\n\n\u201cThey all come from plants,\u201d shouts out Paula Marie Parker.\n\nParker and the others are all students in a program at the Native American Health Center called VeggieRx, which teaches participants about nutrition and the merits of incorporating more fruits and vegetables and physical activity in their lives and the lives of their families.\n\nThe 14-week program is exclusively for people who are overweight, obese or at risk for diabetes. They get hands-on nutrition lessons and learn to cook healthy meals while tracking their physical activity and weight loss. The program has been going for several years and is run by the nonprofit Fresh Approach which provides vouchers for to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nMelissa Cannon, a dietitian at the Native American Health Center, reached out to Fresh Approach and asked them to bring VeggieRx to her clinic this year.\n\nVeggieRx is by far the most popular nutrition class her clinic runs, Cannon says. A big driver, she says: \u201cThey get free food.\u201d\n\nThe hope of these nutrition programs, Cannon says, is to break down some of the barriers to educating about health and nutrition which can be especially tough for low-income and multi-ethnic families. What\u2019s surprised her the most about offering VeggieRx has not only been the turnout \u2014 they have about 22 participants who consistently attend \u2014 but also the way that many of the participants have formed a healthy eating camaraderie with one another.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of people who did our six-week Food as Medicine course who are now coming to this class,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten to know each other, and that\u2019s really neat.\u201d\n\nOne of those people is Robert Davila, 60, of Oakland, who said the hands-on nature of VeggieRx has made a real difference in his life. Cannon is his dietitian and encouraged him to sign up. As a diabetic, he said learning about food labels has proved to be an eye-opener. He said he\u2019s made little changes in his diet since starting the program, including switching out most of his processed foods for whole grains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really been surprised,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hesitant at first, but it\u2019s really been worth it to me. I didn\u2019t really realize how important something like a food label could be to my health.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial Component Is Really Important\u201d\n\nDr. Jennifer Falbe, a fellow at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health has studied community health programs in depth. She described multiple barriers to teaching health and nutrition to multi-ethnic, low income groups including language barriers, limited access to the internet or transportation, and some families just needing one-on-one support to navigate signing up for a program or service.\n\nOne key factor in keeping people involved in health programs, she says, is a shared social connection.\n\n\u201cHaving a social component is really important to keep people coming,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a big part of the effectiveness of Weight Watchers.\u201d\n\nThat social connection is one big reason Mindy Woolbert, 62, from Oakland, enjoys the program. She comes with her sister and her sister-in-law. Together, she said, they try to keep each other accountable.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times you hear how you\u2019re supposed to eat healthy, you can always hear it once more,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like vegetables and fruit, but now we\u2019re all eating more of them.\u201d\n\nFalbe adds that because minority communities experience a much higher prevalence of obesity and chronic disease associated with being overweight, it\u2019s important to provide greater attention. In an ongoing study that links low-income overweight or obese children and families with physical activity programs in San Francisco, Falbe\u2019s team is finding that having someone in the clinic work closely with families and individuals as they sign up, as well as providing one-on-one support in languages other than English, can often be effective in connecting families with community programs and convincing them to continue to attend.\n\nCannon also says many people she sees are reluctant to shop at farmers markets, a specific barrier that VeggieRx addresses. Her clients tend to see farmers markets as expensive places to shop \u2013 and geared to white people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real stigma attached,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of our population here is multi-ethnic, and that\u2019s a barrier in it of itself.\u201d\n\nFresh Approach provides $7 per person per week in vouchers to be used at farmers markets, and participants are drawn to the extra benefits.\n\n\u201cWe want to provide enough to allow them to make healthy changes in their household,\u201d said. Laura deTar, nutrition program manager for Fresh Approach\n\nFresh Approach\u2019s dataset is limited but shows effectiveness. In a follow up earlier this year with 13 families who participated in the program in 2012, they found that nearly 70 percent of the families said they were eating more fruits and veggies and were more physically active. Eighty-four percent reported that they had maintained or reduced their body mass Index.\n\nBack in the classroom, the Fresh Approach team is bringing in bowls of colorful fruits and vegetables they chopped just minutes before. All the produce, which includes things like beets, Armenian cucumbers, Asian pears and heirloom tomatoes, was purchased earlier that day at the uptown Oakland farmers market.\n\nDeTar demonstrates creating a balsamic dressing from scratch while instructor Ricci begins reading the ingredients off the back of a store-bought bottle of salad dressing.\n\n\u201cHow much sugar does that have?\u201d asks one participant.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see \u2026 27 grams per serving,\u201d answers Ricci. That\u2019s almost seven teaspoons of sugar.\n\nAs the list goes on, more and more of the crowd begin to shake their heads.\n\nLater, after chowing down on their salads \u2014 with healthier home made salad dressing \u2014 Paula Marie Parker talked about why she loved the class.\n\n\u201cKnowledge is power and most of us here didn\u2019t study nutrition and were raised by parents who didn\u2019t either. Here it\u2019s free and the staff is caring.\u201d\n\nThen chuckling she adds, \u201dAbout my health, I\u2019m serious as a heart attack.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The program -- for people who are overweight, obese or at risk for diabetes -- teaches people how to cook a healthier diet.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"At Native American Health Center, the Prescription Is Vegetables\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/09\\/23\\/at-native-american-health-center-the-prescription-is-vegetables\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-23 12:07:08\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-25 11:58:11\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21714,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Diabetes\",\"Nutrition\",\"Obesity\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/09\\/VeggieRx1.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The program -- for people who are overweight, obese or at risk for diabetes -- teaches people how to cook a healthier diet.", "title": "At Native American Health Center, the Prescription Is Vegetables", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/09/23/at-native-american-health-center-the-prescription-is-vegetables/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/09/VeggieRx1-640x426.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "diabetes,nutrition,obesity", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbef6\"", "article_summary": "By Brittany PattersonIn Oakland\u2019s Fruitvale neighborhood, 20 people sit inside a colorful classroom at the Native American Health Center.\nOne key factor in keeping people involved in health programs, she says, is a shared social connection.\nMelissa Cannon, a dietitian at the Native American Health Center, reached out to Fresh Approach and asked them to bring VeggieRx to her clinic this year.\nLaura deTar, nutrition program manager for Fresh ApproachFresh Approach\u2019s dataset is limited but shows effectiveness.\nParker and the others are all students in a program at the Native American Health Center called VeggieRx, which teaches participants about nutrition and the merits of incorporating more fruits and vegetables and physical activity in their lives and the lives of their families."}
