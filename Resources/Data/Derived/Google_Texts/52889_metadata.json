He delivered his most personal remarks after an unarmed 17-year-old boy was gunned down in Florida by a man who found him to be suspicious, and then again when that man, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of any crime. \u201cYou know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, aside from his now typical quick bit of lofty rhetoric, it seems almost is if Obama is uncomfortable with the subject at times.\n\nObama has also weighed in on the deaths of both Brown and Garner.
