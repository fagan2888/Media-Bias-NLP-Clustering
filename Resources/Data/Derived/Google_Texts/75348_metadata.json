Now many from that generation face a new challenge... paying for healthcare.\n\n\"If you\u2019re either a young individual or a company that employs primarily young people \u2013 the impact is going to be greatest on that group,\" said Rick DeBartolo, a Senior Vice President at LMC Insurance in Des Moines. \"That would suggest to a person you\u2019re going to see a significant premium increase.\u201d\n\nTake Kelley Mills, for example, she\u2019s 23 and works three jobs. From 8 to 4 she\u2019s a bookkeeper for her dad\u2019s small glass company in Des Moines. When she\u2019s done she drives 20 miles up to Huxley and teaches dance until late into the evening; Then on the weekend she bartends at a golf course.\n\n\u201cI like what I do, If I hated my jobs, I\u2019d quit one,\u201d Mills said.\n\nWhile Mills works constantly, she says she can only afford to pay for so much.\n\n\u201cMy car\u2019s insured, I have renter\u2019s insurance\u2026 but I do not have health insurance. My parents don\u2019t have health insurance, so obviously I\u2019m fending for myself,\" Mills said.\n\nMills graduated with a liberal arts degree from Des Moines Area Community College with an interest in accounting. But she couldn\u2019t find work right out of college\u2026 every job she applied for wanted 5 years of experience. But many young people like Mills have to work numerous jobs to make ends meet.\n\n\"If we just look at the number of people ages 20 to 24, that very young adult workforce, we\u2019ve had persistent growth in the number of those persons employed in Iowa,\" said Iowa State economist Dave Swenson. \"But the group of people that are 25-29 in Iowa hasn\u2019t shown very many improvements.\u201d\n\nSwenson said Iowa is adding low wage jobs in trade, retail and restaurants more than any other types of work. He says Iowa educates more young people than it can employ. Many of these young people are in Mills\u2019 situation. They can\u2019t afford health insurance. But Mills would qualify for a subsidy. When all is said and done she\u2019d have to pay around 35-dollars a month. Mills says she could swing that cost. But it\u2019s not always that cut and dry. Take Ryan Frederick for example.\n\n\u201cI graduated with a business degree in the middle of the housing crisis,\" Frederick said. \"Which is about the worst possible time you could ever have a business degree.\u201d\n\nFrederick is 26. Except for four years he spent at Iowa State, he\u2019s lived in the small town of Orient\u2026 in west central Iowa. Frederick started an appraising business out of a spare bedroom at his parent\u2019s house. On this day he drives his car down a rural Adair county road and snaps pictures of properties on his cell phone.\n\nMillennials, like Frederick, would contribute to the pool of participants by spreading the risk across the age spectrum. Because they don\u2019t need as much care, they\u2019ll help subsidize sicker enrollees. Frederick says he pays 175 dollars a month\u2026 his plan was a 98 dollar monthly cost when he bought it two years ago. He was even more discouraged after meeting with his insurance agent.\n\n\u201cShe kind of grabbed me by the shoulder and laughed when I said my health insurance was going up,\" Frederick said. \"She says just hold on, if you don\u2019t double or triple next year you\u2019ll be lucky. And I just got wide eyed because double or triple my health insurance and I ain\u2019t gonna have health insurance.\u201d\n\nFrederick says it's hard to predict whether he'll qualify for a subsidy; his income fluctuates with the real estate market. But the Affordable Care Act could provide opportunities for some young Iowans. Rick Debartolo, the vice president at LMC Insurance, says many older Iowans approaching Medicare could start getting out of the workforce because they\u2019re only working for the healthcare benefits.\n\n\u201cWe know it exists with a lot of employers, there\u2019s a lot of people that work simply because they\u2019ve got a health problem, if they quit their job, they\u2019d have COBRA for a period of time and then they\u2019re out of luck,\" Rick DeBartolo of LMC Insurance said. \"Now it\u2019s an option for an older person that really the only reason they\u2019re working is health insurance, they can retire if they want sooner.\u201d\n\nBut DeBartolo advises any young person to find some way to buy healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Editor Note: The Millennials in the piece were found because they signed up for the IPR Insight Network.
