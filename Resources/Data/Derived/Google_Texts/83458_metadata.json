She is a graduate of Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. She is a former news reporter for The Daily Signal and a former intern for TheBlaze. You can find her on Twitter: @kgscanlon.\n\nThe National Organization for Women made headlines recently when they released a list of The Dirty 100: organizations that have \u201cfiled in opposition to the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nRest assured, ladies! NOW has vowed, \u201cAttacks on reproductive rights keep coming. But NOW is fighting back.\u201d\n\nI could make the case that the list should be called, \u201cOur War on the Catholic Church\u201d (take a minute and read the list). But I won\u2019t, because there is another issue I would like to address: their hypocrisy. They claim to be an organization for women, in reality they are anything but.\n\nMegyn Kelly recently addressed the controversy on her show \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d with former NOW President Patricia Ireland:\n\nIreland argued that there is an opt-out procedure in place for religious organizations, and that by not using that established procedure, The Little Sisters of the Poor (and apparently the other 99 organizations) think they are above the law.\n\nKelly argued that the opt-out procedure includes \u201csigning a permission slip\u201d for someone else to provide contraceptive coverage. She also argued that the nature of a law that would mandate a nun \u201csign a permission slip\u201d for behavior she doesn\u2019t condone should be called into question.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nuns. Are you Catholic? I am. We follow rules. It is not a religion for wusses. And the Little Sisters of the Poor know that,\u201d said Kelly.\n\n\u201cBless their hearts,\u201d said Ireland condescendingly.\n\nWatching this interview, I couldn\u2019t stop asking myself a question:\n\nAren\u2019t nuns\u2026 women?\n\nAnd, as such, shouldn\u2019t a feminist argue that they deserve respect; that they should be able to make their own choices \u2013 and live as they please?\n\nI once had a mentor explain to me that \u201cfeminism is the radical idea that women are people.\u201d\n\nTherefore, as people, women are entitled to the same rights as men; one of which is the free practice of religion. But to pseudo-feminists like Ireland, the ideology is limited to demanding not birth control, but free birth control.\n\nThe distinction is important: No one is suggesting birth control should be illegal or inaccessible. The Sisters merely don\u2019t want to have to be the ones to pay for it, or be forced to formally condone someone else paying for it, or anything else that goes against Church teaching.\n\nA nun does not give up her womanhood when she puts on a habit. Nor does she give up her humanity. Therefore as people, these nuns are entitled to the same rights as any other person; including the aforementioned free practice of religion.\n\nYou see, pseudo-feminists would have you believe that religion is the realm of men \u2013 a patriarchy hell-bent on oppressively keeping women in the stone ages.\n\nIs it really so difficult to believe that there are women who want to exercise their right to practice their religion? Or that there are women who simply love Jesus?\n\nIn the Catholic Church, there are women who love Jesus so much that they choose (freely choose!) to become His bride; living a chaste, humble life of service and prayer.\n\nSuch as the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nAs they \u201cimpose their beliefs\u201d on their employees, they operate 200 homes that serve over 13,000 elderly poor on five continents.\n\nSaid Sister Camille Rose:\n\n\u201cThe unique mission of the Little Sisters of the Poor is the care of the elderly poor. We welcome them into homes and we care for them as we would like to care for Jesus Christ\u2026. We celebrate the gift of life, the joy of living\u2026 we try to make them happy in whatever way we can, sometimes that\u2019s through parties, good care, good food, love, attention\u2026.\u201d\n\nHow despicable.\n\nTake a minute and look at these nuns NOW has declared an enemy. Please.\n\nIronically, it is their commitment to the poor \u2013 all poor, not just Catholic poor \u2013 that puts the sisters in this situation. As Townhall.com reported [emphasis added]:\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor are not considered to be a \u201creligious employer\u201d and exempt from the mandate as they employ and care for people of all faith backgrounds.\n\nA woman who has her right to the free practice of her religion taken away has suffered a violation of her human dignity. Forcing a nun to \u201csign a permission slip\u201d for behavior she doesn\u2019t condone is an unconscionable assault on this right.\n\nI fail to see how an organization can be \u201cfor women\u201d when they get their kicks bullying nuns.\n\nTrue feminists should look out for all their sisters \u2013 even their little ones.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
