There\u2019s no chance. It just happened to be the right time.\u201d\n\nRam then served consecutive aces, taking charge in the tiebreaker en route to the title.\n\nThe 31-year-old American, ranked 161st, also won on Newport\u2019s grass courts in 2009. The two titles are his only victories on the ATP Tour.\n\nAfter upsetting top-seeded John Isner in his first match of the week, Ram said the courts were \u201cconducive\u201d to his style.\n\n\u201cWhenever you sneak by a match like that, as good as John is, you feel like you\u2019re going to be in the hunt,\u201d Ram said.\n\nThe match ended when Karlovic hit a backhand return into the net.\n\n\u201cI wish we had more of them out there, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he said about the grass surface next to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 36-year-old Karlovic also lost in the final in Newport last year, falling to Lleyton Hewitt. The 6-foot-11 Croatian player was seeking his seventh ATP title.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about in crucial moments \u2014 to be able to do that,\u201d Karlovic said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say about it. He was there and hit unbelievable shots.\u201d\n\nRam broke serve once in the first-set tiebreaker, hitting a forehand cross to go up 5-4. He followed that one with an ace, too.\n\n\u201cI just felt like for some reason I stepped up in the breakers this week,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were no better shots than his return in the final tiebreaker.\n\n\u201cThis year, in the end, he was a little luckier and that was it,\u201d Karlovic said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about one or two points and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nRam, who will move in the ATP top 100 and secured a spot in the U.S. Open, took home $84,250 for the victory. Karlovic earned $44,370 in his 14th career final.\n\nIsner was the last American to win the title at Newport, doing it in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado-born Rajeev Ram wins grass-count event at Newport", "title": "Colorado-born Rajeev Ram wins grass-count event at Newport", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/19/colorado-born-rajeev-ram-wins-grass-count-event-at-newport/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_040802_rajeev-ram.jpg", "height": 405}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_040802_rajeev-ram.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T16:06:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:30:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfb8\"", "article_summary": "Ram won the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships for the second time Sunday, beating second-seeded Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (5), 5-7, 7-6 (2).\nAfter upsetting top-seeded John Isner in his first match of the week, Ram said the courts were \u201cconducive\u201d to his style.\nNEWPORT, R.I. \u2014 Rajeev Ram knew it was the shot of the match.\nThe match ended when Karlovic hit a backhand return into the net.\nWith the score tied 1-all in the third-set tiebreaker, Ram lunged from his right to left, barely getting a backhand return on a 136 mph serve before the ball sailed just inside the sideline."}
