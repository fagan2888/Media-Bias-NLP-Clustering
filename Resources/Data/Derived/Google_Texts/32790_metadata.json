Minnesota House of Representatives\n\nAt the end of the 2015 legislative session, state Rep. Duane Quam (R-Byron) started working on his version of a so-called religious freedom bill \u2014 similar to the one Indiana passed amid boycott threats this spring.\n\n\u201cWhat I wanted it to do is not have civil or criminal penalties for a person or group that was following their strongly-held religious beliefs,\u201d Quam says. \u201cIn other words, government couldn\u2019t make them do something.\u201d\n\nWhile initially inspired by the Little Sisters of the Poor fighting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate, the bill would seem to permit Kim Davis-types to do their marriage license-denying thing or allow venue owners to refuse gay weddings with impunity. Quam admits the bill, which was first reported by the Rochester Post-Bulletin, is broad by design and says there should probably be some exemptions. His hope is that it would force an uncomfortable conversation and allow various interests to \u201cadd their brick\u201d instead of bickering over something already written.\n\n\u201cI tried to have it short and general so that we could at least have a consensus that we don\u2019t want government overly intrusive. But we do need to have these protections,\u201d Quam says.\n\nWhile Quam and others frame these types of laws as protecting religious liberties, opponents see it as legalized discrimination.\n\nOutFront Minnesota executive director Monica Meyer, for one, isn\u2019t crazy about Quam\u2019s bill or a similar, narrower one sponsored by Sen. Paul Gazelka, R-Nisswa. The LGBTQ advocate says Minnesota already has strong religious exemption policies and that businesses should treat potential customers fairly and evenly.\n\n\u201cYou open a business to the public to serve all people,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that you are supporting every customer that comes in the door, [that] you know their full life story, and that you have to be a part of every part of their life.\u201d\n\nWhile Meyer appreciates Quam\u2019s talk-it-out mentality and says she\u2019d happily chat with him, don\u2019t expect Quam\u2019s or Gazelka\u2019s bills to win OutFront\u2019s rainbow seal of approval.\n\n\u201cEither of the bills would really start to carve out discrimination and say that it\u2019s OK, say that it\u2019s fine to discriminate against some people sometimes,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the end of the 2015 legislative session, state Rep.
