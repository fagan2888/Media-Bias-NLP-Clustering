In 2008, Russian forces intervened on behalf of breakaway provinces in Georgia -- and the Bush administration responded feebly. Georgia is largely considered to have lost that war.\n\nCheney acknowledged that the two situations are \"reminiscent,\" but did point to a few steps the Bush administration took. Georgian soldiers were flown back from Iraq, U.S. ships were sent into the Black Sea, and the U.S. \"provided various kinds of supplies.\"\n\nThat was all Cheney had.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Dick Cheney Dick Cheney\n\n1 of 20 Dick Cheney In this Oct. 6, 2011, file photo former Vice President Dick Cheney speaks at the third annual Washington Ideas Forum in Washington.
