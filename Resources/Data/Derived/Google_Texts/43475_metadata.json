Some of those barriers were anticipated by both the Obama administration and administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Others took supporters of the ACA by surprise.\n\nObstacles to ACA enrollment in the Hispanic community included cultural factors, lack of information about Obamacare, financial limitations and fears of giving the federal government information in the belief it could be used to deport family members.\n\nThe end result: Latinos, who make up 25 percent to 30 percent of the uninsured in Connecticut but only 14 percent of the state\u2019s population, are expected to remain over-represented in the ranks of the uninsured for years -- despite Obamacare.\n\nOne problem that could have been predicted is related to culture. Latinos, especially newcomers and older Hispanics, are less likely to use the Internet or have broadband at home than other Americans. Yet the principal way to sign up for the Affordable Care Act in Connecticut is through the website Access HealthCT.com, named after Connecticut\u2019s insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhen they set up the health exchanges, they were not thinking of Latinos or other low-income populations,\" said Sophia Segura-Perez of the Hartford\u2013based Hispanic Health Council.\n\nSegura-Perez said a lot of the marketing for Access Health CT drives people to the website.\n\n\u201cJust by doing that, we\u2019ve left a lot of people out of the picture,\u201d Segura-Perez said. \u201cThe Latino population has not been targeted. It took some time to get our voice out there, to say, \u2018We are here.\u2019\u201d\n\nSegura-Perez is one of dozens of bilingual \u201cassisters\u201d in the state hired by Access Health CT who are helping to enroll Latinos in the ACA. The Hispanic Health Council is one of six \u201cnavigator\u201d organizations in Connecticut tasked with enrolling people in Obamacare.\n\nBut the Hispanic Health Council, which covers Greater Hartford, has been able to enroll only about 100 people a month, most of whom are Latinos who prefer signing up for health care face-to-face.\n\nPercent Hispanic, by ZIP code Search Source: US Census, 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates\n\nSegura-Perez said many Hispanics also have problems enrolling through the Access Health CT call center because they can\u2019t afford to buy many minutes on their cellphones, and phone registration is a lengthy process.\n\nElena Rios, president of the National Hispanic Health Foundation and a strong supporter of the ACA, said the problems Latinos face in enrolling in health insurance is nothing new.\n\n\u201cHispanic enrollment in every single public program, even the school lunch program, is dismal,\u201d Rios said.\n\nNot Affordable Care\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that nationwide, nearly 8 in 10 uninsured Latinos may qualify for Medicaid, the government-run health program for the poor, or a similar program for children known as the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Other Hispanics may qualify for tax breaks that would lower their monthly insurance premiums.\n\nBut Rose Pudlin, director of community programs at the Fair Haven Community Health Center in New Haven, said even with a reduced premium, many Hispanics think the cost of health insurance is too high. She said they would rather pay a penalty to the IRS for their decision to remain uninsured, especially since the penalties for low-income people are nominal this year.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s heartbreaking because these people need insurance, but they really can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Pudlin, who manages a group of assisters.\n\nLow- and moderate-income Americans, or households that earn $45,960 a year or less, are eligible for the federal tax breaks that can substantially reduce monthly premiums.\n\nBut private insurance offered though Access Health CT, available in policies labeled bronze, silver or gold, also carries deductibles and co-pays that have to be paid out of pocket. The more coverage and the lower the co-pays and deductibles, the higher the premiums. And buying even a \"bronze\u201d insurance plan, the least expensive, can be too costly for many Hispanics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea in theory,\u201d said Latrona Kelly, deputy director for the immigrants' rights group, Junta for Progressive Action, of the ACA. \u201cBut there are still challenges to getting affordable health care. It\u2019s an additional bill for people living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\nThe process of enrolling Latinos in person can also be laborious and slow.\n\nPudlin said it often takes three or four visits to sign someone up in the exchange, and it\u2019s a victory when the process is completed.\n\nShe says \u201cit will continue to be the case\u201d that Latinos are most likely to remain uninsured.\n\nPudlin worries that the false notion that the ACA will solve the problem of the nation\u2019s uninsured will result in a lack of support for clinics like hers that serve those without health coverage.\n\n\u201cOur biggest fears are that our funds will be cut,\u201d she said.\n\nShut out of ACA\n\nConnecticut has several advantages over other states. Its exchange website has operated fairly smoothly, and the state has decided to implement the ACA\u2019s provision that expands Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($15,856 for an individual).\n\nA Supreme Court challenge to the ACA resulted in a 2012 decision that upheld the constitutionality of most of the health care law, but determined that states could opt out of the law\u2019s provision that expanded Medicaid. In a blow to White House efforts to maximize coverage of the uninsured, several states with large Latino populations, including Texas and Florida, decided against expanding their Medicaid coverage, leaving Latinos to fall through a crack in the ACA.\n\nThat\u2019s because people shut out of Medicaid are also unlikely to earn enough to qualify for premium tax credits that begin at 100 percent of the federal poverty level. That means an individual must earn at least $11,670 to qualify for federal help in buying a health insurance policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten used to saying to people, \u2018you don\u2019t qualify for that program because you make too much money.\u2019 Now we say, \u2018you don\u2019t qualify for the ACA because you make too little money,\u2019\u201d said Jose E. Camacho, executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers.\n\nWhile Connecticut does not have the same problem as Texas, many Latinos in the state are shut out of the Medicaid program for other reasons.\n\nOne is that immigrants who lack permanent legal status are not allowed under the ACA to enroll in Medicaid or even shop for a private policy on a state insurance exchange.\n\nDanilo Machado, a 20-year-old student at The University of Connecticut's Stamford branch, said he was uninsured until he enrolled in the school's health care program.\n\n\u201cThankfully, I haven\u2019t had any major health issues,\u201d he said.\n\nMachado received provisional legal status under a program implemented by the Obama administration aimed at helping undocumented children.\n\nA native of Colombia, Machado, a sophomore majoring in English, worries about what will happen when he graduates and loses his health coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping I\u2019m legal by then,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers shut out of the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage include legal residents who have been in the United States less than five years.\n\nThey can buy private insurance on the exchange and are eligible for tax breaks, but many of them don\u2019t know it, said Kate Gervais, who manages the state\u2019s navigator and assister programs.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while to get the message across,\u201d Gervais said.\n\nGood enough?\n\nAnother stumbling block to Hispanic enrollment has been the delay in rolling out the Access Health CT website. While the English-language site went up on Oct. 1, the first day of the open enrollment period, the Spanish-language website was not operational until late February, about a month before the end of enrollment March 31.\n\nKevin Counihan, the CEO of Access Health CT, said he wanted to make sure the Spanish-language website was more than just a literal translation of the English-language website.\n\n\u201cIt required building a second website,\u201d he said.\n\nBut several assisters interviewed for this story said the Spanish-language website is difficult to read. Rather than use it, they say they translate and interpret the English-language website when they are trying to enroll Latinos.\n\nCounihan said that in the first two weeks of operation, the Spanish-language website has signed up about 1,400 people.\n\n\u201cIs that good enough? Who knows?\u201d Counihan said.\n\nHe said he does not know how many Connecticut Latinos have signed up for health coverage because, for the first six weeks of operation, application forms did not ask about ethnicity. After that, Access Health CT adopted the federal application form which does ask about ethnicity and race, but makes answers to those questions voluntary.\n\nCounihan said he hopes to determine how many Hispanics have enrolled after the close of the enrollment period on March 31.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest segment to reach,\u201d he said of the Latino community.\n\nAnd the hardest -- specific -- target? According to Counihan, it's a 37-year-old Hispanic man.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Access Health Ct features a young Hispanic male in a Spanish-language YouTube video aimed at promoting enrollment. The young man, identified as Oscar Maldonado from Norwalk, says he worked for 14 years in restaurants and could not afford health insurance \u2013 until now.\n\nA television ad aimed at Latinos features Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra pitching the ACA. Another ad promises those who signed up for coverage they\u2019d have a chance to win tickets to a concert featuring the rapper Pitbull.\n\nBut most Spanish-language marketing consist of dubbed English-language ads.\n\nNevertheless, Jason Madrak, chief marketing officer for Access Health CT, said there is a sustained effort to enroll Latinos.\n\nAccess Health CT\n\nThose efforts included canvassing potential enrollees at the Puerto Rican parade and the Ray Gonzalez jazz festival. There is also a half-hour show promoting the Affordable Care Act that has run for months on the Spanish-language Telemundo television channel. And Obamacare ads air on Spanish-language radio.\n\nOutreach also included the hiring of Andrea Ravitz, whose title is \u201cmulticultural marketing manager.\u201d\n\nRavitz said she partnered with supermarkets to distribute flyers in stores selling the ACA.\n\n\u201cWe went to places where people feel comfortable,\u201d she said.\n\nYet even Counihan concedes Latinos are likely to remain over-represented among the nation\u2019s uninsured.\n\n\u201cI believe so, but I can\u2019t prove it yet,\u201d he said.\n\nAccessHealthCT received about $146 million from the federal government to set up and promote the exchange. Counihan said about $15 million was spent on marketing. But there was no separate budget to reach out to Latinos.\n\nAfraid of Obamacare\n\nThe federal government has had its own problems enrolling Latinos.\n\nA major failing involved the Spanish language website, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, which did not launch until early December, two months after the English-language HealthCare.gov website.\n\nWhen it was finally functional, CuidadoDeSalud.gov was criticized for containing grammatical and translation errors so severe that site users derided it as being written in \"Spanglish.\"\n\nLike Connecticut, the federal government has no figures on Hispanic enrollment.\n\nBut California does, and it\u2019s not happy about them.\n\nThe state has spent millions of dollars in outreach to Hispanics, who represent 50 percent of California\u2019s uninsured people.\n\nIn January, 28 percent of Californians who enrolled for coverage identified themselves as Latino, an improvement over the period from October through December, when it was 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are not where we want to be,\u201d said Lizelda Lopez, spokesperson for Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nOne problem that cropped up in California, and in many other states, including Connecticut, blindsided the White House.\n\nLatinos often come from \u201cmixed\u201d families -- a term used if one or both parents are undocumented, but their children are not. Many of these families hesitate to provide the personal information needed to register for health care because they fear the information will be turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\n\nThose concerns prompted Jeh Johnson, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to broadly distribute a statement in Spanish two weeks ago that said ICE has implemented a policy prohibiting it from using marketplace enrollment information for immigration purposes.\n\n\u201cUndocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in the health care marketplaces,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEven so, I\u2019ve heard that some people who live in the United States and are eligible to enroll in the marketplace are hesitant to do so because they fear the information will be shared with immigration officials and used to deport undocumented family members. That\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nIn early March, Vice President Joe Biden held a roundtable discussion with representatives of the nation\u2019s largest Latino organizations, who have partnered with the White House in promoting the ACA, to urge them to disseminate the message that enrolling in a state marketplace would not put family members in jeopardy.\n\nMeanwhile, President Obama has taken to the airwaves in the past week, urging Latinos to sign up for health care.\n\n\u201cThe main thing for people to know is that any information you get, you know, asked with respect to buying insurance, does not have anything to do with \u2026 the rules governing immigration,\u201d Obama said in an interview with Spanish-language Univision Deportes.\n\n\u201cIf you have a family where some people are citizens or legally here, and others are not documented, the immigration people will never get that information,\u201d Obama said.\n\nGervais said assisters in Connecticut are facing the same problem with potential enrollees.\n\n\u201cThey think that having an undocumented member in your family means your family is in danger,\u201d she said.\n\nBut even Latinos who have legal status are shying away from signing up for care.\n\nSegura-Perez of the Hispanic Health Council said she recently tried to enroll a young Latino man who had a green card and is waiting for his citizenship. But the young man decided to remain uninsured.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to do anything that would hurt his chance to become a citizen,\u201d she said.\n\nCounihan said it will take years to bring the numbers of uninsured Latinos down and reach many others who don\u2019t have health care.\n\n\u201cThis is a four- to five-year implementation,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/24/cts-latinos-face-hurdles-in-enrolling-in-obamacare/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, Washington, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, connecticut, Dannel Malloy, Fair Haven Community Health Center, HIspanic Health Council", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/24/cts-latinos-face-hurdles-in-enrolling-in-obamacare/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "No group of people in Connecticut is more likely to be uninsured than the state\u2019s Latinos, and Obamacare won\u2019t change that.", "title": "CT\u2019s Latinos face hurdles in enrolling in Obamacare", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/24/cts-latinos-face-hurdles-in-enrolling-in-obamacare/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/03/Segarra-in-Accesshealth-video.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/24/cts-latinos-face-hurdles-in-enrolling-in-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9202\"", "article_summary": "The Hispanic Health Council is one of six \u201cnavigator\u201d organizations in Connecticut tasked with enrolling people in Obamacare.\nElena Rios, president of the National Hispanic Health Foundation and a strong supporter of the ACA, said the problems Latinos face in enrolling in health insurance is nothing new.\nAccess Health CT videoWashington \u2013 No group of people in Connecticut is more likely to be uninsured than the state\u2019s Latinos, and Obamacare won\u2019t change that.\n\u201cWe are not where we want to be,\u201d said Lizelda Lopez, spokesperson for Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nNevertheless, Jason Madrak, chief marketing officer for Access Health CT, said there is a sustained effort to enroll Latinos."}
