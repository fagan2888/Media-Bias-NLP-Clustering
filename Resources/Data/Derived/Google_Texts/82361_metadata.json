Personally, he doesn\u2019t see it that way \u2014 he was just doing his job. But because he did that job so well, he helped cultivate a fan base.\n\nI have one of them in my household, my 15-year-old son who has become quite a hockey fan and likes to draw me into debates about some of those intricacies such as line combinations and what defensive pairings might work better \u2014 and not just with the Lightning.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of other such stories around town among Lightning fans, and Chief played a big role in that.\n\n\u201cYou could almost see it around town, in almost any setting,\u2019\u2019 said Rick Peckham, the play-by-play voice of the Lightning who has worked alongside Taylor since 1995-96. People would say, \u2018Hey, Chief,\u2019 and he has certainly earned that with the passion, but also with the hardened hockey fans from the North who grew up with the game when they were young. He can pick apart things that they appreciate, too. It\u2019s not just the passion, or getting on the refs or getting excited when the Lightning are doing well or taking them to task when they are not doing well. He picks up stuff. When I watch a game again, it\u2019s like, \u2018How did he pick that up?\u2019 He\u2019s got that nailed down in the context of how that helped the play that followed, or a tiny little thing that happened four or five seconds before a goal was scored.\u2019\u2019\n\nPeckham and Taylor have a special chemistry that has been a big part of hockey becoming a tradition in a non-traditional market, and the chemistry was almost instantaneous.\n\n\u201cWe had gotten along great just from opposing teams (Taylor with Philadelphia, Peckham with Hartford),\u2019\u2019 Peckham said. \u201cWe knew each other for 11 years, so for the most part the chemistry was pretty instant because of that. We spent a lot of time together, families got together socially right off the bat.\u2019\u2019\n\nI can tell you, that chemistry is evident even away from the broadcast booth as I\u2019ve had the pleasure to get to know both broadcasters through my time covering the team. The passion for the team each displays is genuine and that comes across on TV so well, it\u2019s almost second nature and something fans no doubt look forward to each time they turn on Sun Sports.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 20 years, and it\u2019s been a treat to watch the two together.\n\nNo doubt the Lightning have already had plenty of inquiries regarding the position and will have their pick of some of the top available names to serve the same role next season.\n\nBut it won\u2019t be the same, and that seat will be a big one to fill for whoever assumes the position.\n\nEnjoy the broadcasts for however long this season goes because it\u2019s been a fun ride.\n\neerlendsson@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7835\n\nTwitter: @erlendssonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 13 Dec 2014 21:01:31 -0400", "Description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Enjoy the final year of an important era in Lightning hockey because next season just won\u2019t be the same.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Enjoy the final year of an important era in Lightning hockey because next season just won\u2019t be the same.", "title": "Bolts Beat: Telecasts won\u2019t be same without Chief in booth", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/bolts-beat-telecasts-wont-be-same-without-chief-in-booth-20141213/", "image": {"width": 161, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141213/ARTICLE/141219622/EP/1/1/EP-141219622.jpg", "height": 227}, "updated_time": "2014-12-13T21:01:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Enjoy the final year of an important era in Lightning hockey because next season just won\u2019t be the same.", "title": "Bolts Beat: Telecasts won\u2019t be same without Chief in booth", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141213/ARTICLE/141219622/AR/0/AR-141219622.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-13T21:01:31Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-13T21:01:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde872\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Enjoy the final year of an important era in Lightning hockey because next season just won\u2019t be the same.\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of other such stories around town among Lightning fans, and Chief played a big role in that.\nThe role Taylor has played in helping so many learn and understand the game can\u2019t be understated.\nTaylor took over the color commentator role for the 1993-94 season and has been a presence in the booth ever since.\nBobby \u201cThe Chief\u2019\u2019 Taylor will step away from the broadcast booth after this season and slide into an analyst role for the pregame and postgame shows as well as during intermissions."}
