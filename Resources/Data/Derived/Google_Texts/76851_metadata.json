Businesses and airports in Israel shut down as television and radio stations go silent and highway stand empty. That holiday began at sunset Friday and ends Saturday night.\n\nMuslims are marking Eid al-Adha, a three-day holiday that started Saturday across much of the Middle East. It commemorates the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim \u2014 or Abraham as he is known in the Bible \u2014 to sacrifice his son in accordance with God\u2019s will, though in the end God provides him a sheep to sacrifice instead. On the start of Eid al-Adha, Muslims slaughter sheep, cattle and other livestock, and give part of the meat to the poor. Parents often buy new clothes for their children for the holiday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "author": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "title": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/04/ap_photos_major_muslim_jewish_holidays_coincide/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/philippines-eid-al-adha.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/philippines-eid-al-adha.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "AP PHOTOS: Major Muslim, Jewish holidays coincide", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde17d\"", "article_summary": "The Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur coincide once every 33 years, as Judaism and Islam rely on lunar calendars.\nOn the start of Eid al-Adha, Muslims slaughter sheep, cattle and other livestock, and give part of the meat to the poor.\nMuslims are marking Eid al-Adha, a three-day holiday that started Saturday across much of the Middle East.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsMajor holidays for both Muslims and Jews are both being marked this Saturday across the Middle East, the first time this has happened since 1981.\nBusinesses and airports in Israel shut down as television and radio stations go silent and highway stand empty."}
