The Avalanche Sunday acquired center Shawn Matthias, 28, from the Toronto Maple Leafs, giving up center Colin Smith — who was with the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League — and a fourth-round draft choice this year.

Matthias, 28, has 75 goals and 73 assists in 459 NHL games with Florida, Vancouver and Toronto.

He is making $2.3 million this season and could be an unrestricted free agent July 1, so this potentially falls under the heading of a rental deal for the Avalanche stretch run.

The native of Mississauga, Ontario was a second-round Detroit draft choice in 2006, after his second of four seasons in major junior with the Belleville Bulls.

In February 2007, the Red Wings traded his rights to Florida as part of the deal that sent Todd Bertuzzi to Detroit.

Matthias made his NHL debut in a four-game cameo with Florida in January 2008, shortly after he played for Canada’s gold-medal team in the 2008 World Junior Championships in the Czech Republic.

Matthias, 6-foot-4, 231 pounds, was dealt to Vancouver late in the 2013-14 season. He and goaltender Jacob Markstrom went to Vancouver in the deal that sent goalie Roberto Luongo to the Panthers.

Matthias had a career-high 18 goals, with nine assists, the next season with the Canucks and signed with the Maple Leafs as a free agent last summer. This season, he has six goals and 11 assists in 51 games with Toronto.

He didn’t join the team for Sunday’s game at Vancouver and instead will meet the Avalanche in Denver and be available for Wednesday’s game against San Jose.

Smith, 22, was a seventh-round Colorado choice in 2012 and played one game for the Avalanche, against Montreal on Dec. 1, 2014. He had 13 goals and 34 points with the Rampage this season.
