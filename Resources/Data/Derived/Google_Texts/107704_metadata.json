Bernie Sanders, the two top-polling candidates seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, will be the focus of attention in Tuesday\u2019s first Democratic debate.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 On the campaign trail, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders shy away from direct mentions of each other.\n\nBut when the two top-polling candidates in the race for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination face off for the first time Tuesday in the initial Democratic debate, it will be hard to escape the fact that they have different approaches to major issues, from war to paychecks.\n\nAlthough the two will share the Las Vegas debate stage with former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, attention will focus on Clinton and Sanders. A preview of where the two top candidates differ:\n\nSuper PACs\n\nSanders pledges not to accept support from any of the political-action committees (PACs) that can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals. He has introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which allowed the committees to proliferate, and says one of his criteria for picking Supreme Court justices will be a willingness to overturn the decision. \u201cThat nominee will say that we are going to overturn this disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United,\u201d Sanders said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in May. \u201cBecause that decision is undermining American democracy. I do not believe that billionaires should be able to buy politicians.\u201d\n\nClinton has not ruled out super-PAC money and is benefiting from at least two working primarily on her behalf, Priorities USA Action and American Bridge 21st Century. She has said, however, she would appoint Supreme Court justices \u201cwho value the right to vote over the right of billionaires to buy elections\u201d and would push for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.\n\nGuns\n\nSanders opposed the 1993 Brady bill, which established federal background checks and a waiting period for potential gun owners. He has explained that he represents a largely rural state where guns \u201cmean different things to people\u201d than in more urban states. As a result, he\u2019s argued that he could play a role in bringing opposing sides together. He notes that he later voted for and supports a ban on semi-automatic weapons, closing the so-called gun-show loophole and tightening background checks.\n\nClinton, after the Roseburg, Ore., community-college shootings, called for gun control and said she\u2019d act unilaterally if Congress failed to tighten gun-show and Internet sales loopholes. She also backs legislation to prevent domestic abusers from buying and possessing firearms and would seek to repeal a 2005 law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which prevents gun manufacturers and dealers in some cases from being sued. Sanders voted for the law in 2005; Clinton voted against it.\n\nHealth care\n\nSanders has championed single-payer, universal-health care.\n\nClinton has said she would expand coverage through the existing Affordable Care Act.\n\nIraq war\n\nClinton, then a New York senator, voted in October 2002 to authorize military force against Iraq. In her 2014 book, she said she voted \u201cafter weighing the evidence and seeking as many opinions as I could.\u201d She subsequently said she got it wrong and should not have voted for authorization.\n\nSanders, then a member of the House of Representatives, voted against the use of force in Iraq, saying in 2002 that he was worried about the \u201cproblems of so-called unintended consequences\u201d and that \u201cwar must be the last recourse in international relations, not the first.\u201d\n\nUSA Patriot Act\n\nSanders voted against the surveillance law passed by Congress in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and has voted against its reauthorization since.\n\nHe wrote in Time magazine in May that he \u201cbelieved then and am even more convinced today that the law gave the government far too much power to spy on Americans and that it provided too little oversight or disclosure.\u201d\n\nClinton voted for the Patriot Act in 2001 as a U.S. senator. She, however, voiced support in May for legislation that President Obama endorsed to end the government\u2019s bulk collection of phone records.\n\nSyria\n\nClinton called for a no-fly zone in Syria the day after Russia began a bombing campaign in the country to support President Bashar Assad.\n\nSanders opposes a \u201cunilateral American no-fly zone in Syria which could get us more deeply involved in that horrible civil war and lead to a never-ending U.S. entanglement in that region.\u201d\n\nCollege\n\nSanders proposes a \u201cCollege for All Act\u201d that would make college a right, eliminating tuition at all four-year public colleges and universities. He says the U.S. should ensure \u201cevery qualified American in this country who has the ability and desire to go to college is able to \u2026 regardless of the income of his or her family.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s \u201cNew College Compact\u201d promises that students would \u201cnever have to borrow to pay for tuition, books and fees to attend a four-year public college in their state,\u201d though it would require that students work 10 hours a week.\n\nKeystone pipeline\n\nSanders opposes the pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada into the U.S. He helped \u201clead the effort in the Senate against the Keystone pipeline,\u201d he told \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in June, \u201cbecause I think, if we\u2019re serious about reversing climate change, you don\u2019t excavate and transport some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world.\u201d\n\nClinton, who as secretary of state oversaw the department\u2019s yet-to-be-completed review, refused for months to say where she stood. On Sept. 22 she announced her opposition, saying the project is a \u201cdistraction from important work we have to do on climate change.\u201d\n\nMinimum wage\n\nSanders introduced legislation in July to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. He called the current federal minimum wage \u2014 $7.25 an hour \u2014 \u201ca starvation wage,\u201d and said employees who work 40 hours a week \u201chave a right not to be living in poverty.\u201d\n\nClinton has stopped short of endorsing a federal $15-an-hour measure. She has supported legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 and backs local efforts in Los Angeles and New York to raise the minimum wage to $15. But she noted in July that \u201cwhat you can do in L.A. or in New York may not work in other places.\u201d\n\nTrade\n\nSanders has voted against U.S. trade pacts, saying they\u2019re bad for American workers. He has been a sharp critic of what he calls Obama\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact involving the United States and 11 other nations, and vows to \u201cdo all that I can\u201d to thwart the agreement in the Senate.\n\nClinton supported Obama\u2019s trade deal as his secretary of state, but after months of not saying where she stood, she came out in opposition Oct. 7, saying the pact doesn\u2019t \u201cmeet the high bar I have set.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vermont Sen.
