There is a movement in the policy community to begin charting a path to the best method for implementing the practice, which requires budget scorekeepers to estimate the macroeconomic effects of federal fiscal policy.\n\nThe movement was on display at the Brookings Institution on Monday, where a group of experts gathered for a forum entitled \u201cDynamic Scoring: Now What?\u201d\n\nRelated: More Americans Say Thumbs Up on the Economy\n\nThe topic is politically freighted in a way that most debates about the esoterica of budget scoring are not. Movement conservative Republicans have long been in favor of dynamic scoring because they believe that tax cuts spur economic growth and increase government revenue. This makes tax cuts cheaper from a budgetary perspective and easier to justify in the context of federal deficits.\n\nAt the beginning of the new Congress, House Republicans passed a rule requiring that dynamic scoring be used to produce an official estimate of legislation\u2019s cost. Until now, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax bills, and the Congressional Budget Office, which scores other spending bills, have generally offered dynamic analysis on a limited, advisory basis.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, conservatives\u2019 general position is that if estimators know a policy change will have significant macroeconomic effects, it is foolish not to consider those effects when assessing its impact on the budget.\n\nDemocrats and some more moderate Republicans are opposed to making a dynamic score part of the official judgment of the cost of legislation because estimates from dynamic scores tend to be uncertain \u2013 sometimes wildly so.\n\nRelated: Economic Freedom in U.S. on the Rise, Study Says\n\nLen Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution summed up the two sides of the debate succinctly.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018pro\u2019 of including a dynamic score is that it removes a constraint on estimators. If they actually knew what the macroeconomic effect was, they could improve their estimates by including it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018con\u2019 is that there are so many cases where they have no idea \u2013 in a lot of cases don\u2019t even know the sign of the effect.\u201d\n\nAlthough the event, hosted by Brookings\u2019 Hutchins Center for Fiscal and Monetary Policy, was meant to move the discussion toward the implementation phase, for much of the event, participants wound up addressing the more fundamental question of whether or not dynamic scoring is a good idea in the first place.\n\nFor some, such as Jane Gravelle, a senior specialist in economic policy with the Congressional Research Service, the answer was clearly \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for dynamic scoring,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: The Dark Shadow hanging Over the Economic Recovery\n\nFormer Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin argued that the uncertainty of estimates in dynamic scoring models hardly makes them unique in the field of budget analysis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a long list of things in conventional scoring that are comparably uncertain,\u201d he said, adding that the decision to use dynamic scoring for the official estimate would ultimately advance the practice.\n\n\u201cI think there is a big advantage in actually putting it into the formal score,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s advisory and we had this range of estimates coming out of a range of models, you were basically out there trying to give a masters level graduate course in macroeconomics in three minutes in front of a committee and that\u2019s just not feasible.\u201d\n\nPutting it in the score, he said, will require Congress to pay more attention to the process, and will generate more interest among academics and researchers.\n\nRelated: Major Changes to Medicare Coming for Senior Healthcare\n\n\u201cIt might not be perfect the first time, but putting it into the process actually kicks off a dynamic that I think \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 is beneficial. We learn more about public policy when the numbers matter.\u201d\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe use of dynamic scoring to produce precise estimates of the cost of federal legislation is supposed to provide better information to lawmakers. But the degree of controversy over its introduction suggests that budget scores will simply become a point of political argument, with each side challenging scorekeepers\u2019 assumptions rather than accepting their advice as unbiased.\n\nBurman, for his part, echoed many economists, who argue that the number of assumptions necessary to dynamically score a major tax or spending bill, and their interconnectedness, creates large margins of error that delivering a single point estimate of a bill\u2019s cost would obscure.\n\nBowing to the reality that Congress has already made its decision, Burman called for transparency in the process \u2013 particularly a clear sense of how wide the margin of error of a particular estimate is.\n\n\u201cI would follow the model of the Capital Weather Gang,\u201d he said, referring to the authors of a popular DC-area weather blog published by The Washington Post. \u201cThey put out a forecast and the forecast includes the level of confidence.\u201d\n\nOne of the arguments used to defuse criticism of the Republican move is the relatively small number of bills it would actually affect. The language of the rule adopted by Congress says that it would automatically apply only to bills that effect the federal budget by an amount greater than .25 percent of Gross Domestic Product, or about $40 billion.\n\nRelated: $1 Billion a Year in Redundant Obamacare Programs\n\nRepublicans note that in the last Congress only three bills would have triggered the analysis.\n\nHowever, Chye-Ching Huang, a tax policy analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that the rule actually gives the Budget Committee chair the ability to request a dynamic score of any bill he or she deems \u201cmajor,\u201d regardless of size. She noted that bills that might otherwise trigger an unwelcome dynamic score could be broken into pieces in order to escape the threshold.\n\nAlan Viard, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who generally supports the change, appeared to concede that the latitude allowed the Budget chair is a flaw. \u201cMy hope is that the budget chairs do not abuse the discretion that, in my opinion, [the rule] mistakenly gives them.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A Republican-backed rule that will require major pieces of legislation to be subject to \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d by budget analysts continues to roil the policy community.
