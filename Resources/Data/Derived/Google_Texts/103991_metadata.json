One of the multiple paths to this end may be the use of reverse auction services to strategically source and negotiate contracts.\n\nThe average health system is comprised of many regional providers. Each of these providers requires goods and services to fuel their operations \u2013 everything from maintenance, legal and IT to medical and surgical equipment and pharmaceuticals. And they may all be purchasing these products from different vendors.\n\n[See also: Outcomes matter to hospital supply chain]\n\nAs a result, the health system is not effectively leveraging its purchasing power to get the best prices from the best suppliers, according to Oscar May, director of healthcare for Ariba, a SAP Company.\n\n\u201cThe first step in evaluating whether a service is right for a reverse auction is to determine where there is spend that can be consolidated,\u201d he said. \u201cInnovative providers have found that by connecting to a business network, they could discover, connect and collaborate with suppliers who can meet their needs on both fronts.\u201d\n\nMay said providers using Ariba\u2019s Discovery reverse auction platform can search for suppliers of the goods and services they need, view detailed profiles of their capabilities and even get ratings from other providers who have used them.\n\n\u201cBy reaching out and touching more suppliers we are able to increase competition and as a result of increased competition we are able to get more value for the products and services in the prices that we\u2019re paying,\u201d said Karen Sherrill, senior commodity manager at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. OSU Wexner uses the Ariba Discovery platform.\n\n\u201cWe are able to reach a large crowd of suppliers, they\u2019re able to narrow down and disqualify themselves,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cThose who feel they qualify can go on to the next step and continue on with the process. It\u2019s very streamlined, very efficient, and suppliers can realize business opportunities much quicker.\u201d\n\nWorld Energy Solutions is another firm that has organized reverse auctions for healthcare providers. The Worcester, Mass.-based firm operates online exchanges for energy and green commodities and serves various industries.\n\nPhil Adams, World Energy\u2019s president, said his company uses an \u201cAnglo-Dutch\u201d reverse auction approach in their online auctions, which is designed to get suppliers to offer their best prices.\n\n\u201cHospitals have a very sophisticated procurement process and are always looking to be careful with their costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can clearly see the value proposition in the reverse auction method.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/turn-it-around-vendors", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/0913-HFN-SS-Auction-Adams.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Healthcare providers must carefully balance the need to control costs against their mission to deliver the highest quality care.
