Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly praised Friday's United States Supreme Court decision that ruled state laws banning same sex marriage is unconstitutional, calling the ruling a victory. Mr. Cook shared his thoughts on Twitter, which is becoming a common place for Apple executives to share their thoughts and opinions.

Apple CEO Tim Cook praises SCOTUS marriage equal rights ruling

The Supreme Court ruling prevents states from prohibiting couples from marrying based on the gender of their partner. Thanks to the decision, states can no longer pass laws banning gay marriage, or withhold rights from same sex couples.

Mr. Cook commented on the ruling today saying,

Today marks a victory for equality, perseverance and love.

Tim Cook first confirmed he is gay last year while openly pushing for equal rights for all people. At the time he said, "embracing people's individuality is a matter of basic human dignity and civil rights."

Whether or not gender should come into play for marriage equality has been a social hot point for years, often turning violent during fights to oppress rights for same sex couples. Today's ruling won't change that contention for some people, but it is a big step forward for equal rights and a good reminder that sometimes the government shouldn't be trying to control our lives.

While Mr. Cook's public equal rights stance isn't what pushed the Supreme Court into today's ruling, but it may have given at least some people hope that they'll get to live in a world where they're accepted for who they are, regardless of who they love.
