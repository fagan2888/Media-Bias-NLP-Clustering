Tin prices rallied Thursday, propelled higher by concerns over tight supply from Indonesia, the world’s largest supplier of the metal.

The price of tin, which is used in everything from computer chips to batteries, rose 1.9% to $22,285 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange Thursday, its highest price in almost a month. So far this week, tin prices have gained almost 5%.

The gains came as PT Timah (TINS.JK), the world’s largest integrated tin producer, Wednesday declared force majeure, saying new Indonesian government regulations requiring all tin to be traded locally before export mean it can’t fulfill contracts to directly ship tin to buyers.

Indonesia’s Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan said last week that this move will improve price transparency, avoid smuggling and prevent sellers from declaring prices below what are actually received–which means lower state revenue from royalties and taxes, but many producers have halted shipments while they amend contracts with buyers.

“[The force majeure] has put the cat among the pigeons, hence why we are seeing higher prices,” said Gayle Berry, a metals analyst at Barclays. “The market is starting to realize that this could seriously tighten tin supplies. Meanwhile, there isn’t much tin on the LME and some of that may not be immediately available, it could be stuck behind a warehouse queue.”

Some industry participants, meanwhile, doubted the lasting impact of Indonesia’s new regulations.

“We’re only a few days into the new exchange,” said Charles Swindon, managing director of metals trading firm RJH Trading. “I think it’s highly likely there will be some kind of u-turn.”

The London Metal Exchange declined to comment on Indonesia’s new trading requirements.
