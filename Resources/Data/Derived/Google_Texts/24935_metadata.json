The loans don\u2019t have to be repaid until the borrower sells, moves out or dies.\n\nMany borrowers turned to reverse mortgage during the financial downturn as a way to meet basic living expenses, but some were so strapped they couldn\u2019t pay insurance and property taxes and lost their homes.\n\nThose defaults, which coincided with a sharp drop in home values, not only took a toll on the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s reputation, but also its finances. The response was to ratchet down on underwriting, limit lump sum withdrawals, and better protect consumers and the lending program.\n\nAfter peaking at around 114,000 in 2007, reverse mortgage volumes are running closer to 60,000, Bell said.\n\nSome financial planners advise consumers against piling on debts while retired. But Harold Evensky, a respected certified financial planner, gave reverse mortgages a boost when he advocated two years ago that they be taken out to serve as standby credit lines.\n\nCredit lines can allow retirees to keep more of their money in higher-returning investments like stocks rather than low-yielding and safe alternatives like certificates of deposits. Access to a credit line can prevent retirees from having to tap riskier assets during downturns. And the higher returns, over time, will help retirees make it through the added years in retirement.\n\nOf course, that assumes there are retirement assets. About half of U.S. households have a negative net worth. And Bell said of baby boomers who have saved, the average amount is only $125,000.\n\n\u201cWe have this looming crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver a test market for reverse mortgage rebranding", "title": "Denver a test market for reverse mortgage rebranding", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/18/denver-a-test-market-for-reverse-mortgage-rebranding/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T19:33:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-18T19:33:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb05d\"", "article_summary": "Tighter rules on reverse mortgages have reduced their popularity with seniors, something the industry hopes a new ad campaign can change.\nAfter peaking at around 114,000 in 2007, reverse mortgage volumes are running closer to 60,000, Bell said.\nDenver is one of three markets, along with Philadelphia and Seattle, where the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association is testing a new marketing approach, said Peter Bell, the association\u2019s president.\n\u201cIt is now being pushed very heavily to financial planners and CPAs as a financial planing tool,\u201d said Jim Spray, an independent mortgage broker in Arvada who specializes in reverse mortgages.\nReverse mortgages allow qualified homeowners, age 62 or older, to tap their home equity in either a lump sum, monthly payments or as a credit line."}
