Three others, including one police officer, were wounded. According to Ed Reinhold, the FBI Special Agent in Charge, the Marines were killed at a recruitment center where the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marines all share offices. President Obama described the attack as a \u201cheartbreaking circumstance\u201d while cautioning that \u201cwe don\u2019t know all the details.\u201d According to CBS News, U.S. Attorney Bill Killian said officials were treating Thursday\u2019s attack as an \u201cact of domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe gunman was identified as Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, 24, of Hixson, Tennessee. Federal officials said that he was not under investigation at the time of the attack.\n\nThe violence in Tennessee represents the first attack on a U.S. military recruitment center since 2009, when Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, a 23-year-old man unhappy about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, opened fire on two men standing near a recruitment center in Little Rock, Arkansas, killing one. Recruitment centers, by their nature, are open to the public, and Chattanooga\u2019s Armed Forces Career Center had no additional security at the time of the attack.\n\nIn a statement released after the attack, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam said that \u201clives have been lost from some faithful people who have been serving our country, and I think I join all Tennesseans in being both sickened and saddened by this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt Schiavenza", "description": "The gunman was identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "The gunman was identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.", "title": "Four U.S. Marines Killed in Attack at Tennessee Military Recruitment Office", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/defense/2015/07/four-us-marines-killed-attack-tennessee-military-recruitment-office/118042/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/07/17/071715chattanooga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/07/17/071715chattanooga/open-graph.jpg", "description": "The gunman was identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Four U.S. Marines Killed in Attack at Tennessee Military Recruitment Office"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-17T13:35:24Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/07/17/071715chattanooga.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Four U.S. Marines Killed in Attack at Tennessee Military Recruitment Office", "keywords": "marine corps, tennessee, shooting", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/07/17/071715chattanooga/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "marine-corps,tennessee,channel-defense,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "The gunman was identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez."}, "article_summary": "A gunman opened fire at two military recruiting stations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Thursday morning, killing four U.S. Marines before dying in the attack.\nAccording to Ed Reinhold, the FBI Special Agent in Charge, the Marines were killed at a recruitment center where the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marines all share offices.\nIn a statement released after the attack, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam said that \u201clives have been lost from some faithful people who have been serving our country, and I think I join all Tennesseans in being both sickened and saddened by this.\u201d\nThe violence in Tennessee represents the first attack on a U.S. military recruitment center since 2009, when Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, a 23-year-old man unhappy about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, opened fire on two men standing near a recruitment center in Little Rock, Arkansas, killing one.\nRecruitment centers, by their nature, are open to the public, and Chattanooga\u2019s Armed Forces Career Center had no additional security at the time of the attack."}
