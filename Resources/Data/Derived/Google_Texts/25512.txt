How opinions change when reality rears it’s ugly head.

Longtime Obamacare cheerleader and liberal mouthpiece Bill Maher has changed his tune on the unpopular healthcare law.

Speaking on his HBO show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” Friday the comedian said the cumbersome law is causing insurance to be too expensive and confusing.

“You know it’s the signature achievement of obviously this president and like many liberals I’ve been screaming how great it has been and ‘it’s working’ and ‘there’s no doubt,’” he said.

“But The New York Times on Sunday did an article that basically said, you know, when Obama said if you like your plan nothing will change,” Maher said.

“Well, everything has changed. 46 percent of people are having trouble paying health care costs now, up 10 percent from a year ago because the deductibles went up, the co-pays went up. They can’t see the doctor they used to see because he’s in a different network. They go to get questions answered and they’re talking to somebody reading a script in the Philippines. Its like your prostate cancer is being handled by Comcast now.”

But Maher stopped short of blaming Obama. Instead he blamed the insurance companies.

“People are just not going (to the doctor) because it’s more expensive, too confusing and I think this was intentional,” he said. “I think the insurance companies wanted this to happen because that’s how they make money.”

Of course, Maher’s solution is to go even further to the left with what many people have long suspected was Obama’s ultimate plan.

“We should have a single payer system,” he proclaimed.

Some people never learn.
