DeMille Award for lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes ceremony, and it\u2019s tempting to crack jokes about these two enduring but seemingly irrelevant American institutions. Tempting but wrong. Whatever you make of the opaque, unpredictable and often bewildering genius of the man born 78 years ago as Allen Stewart Konigsberg \u2014 my own feelings are immensely mixed, and given the length and variety of his career, whose aren\u2019t? \u2014 he doesn\u2019t belong to the same category as the Globes in any way. Woody Allen famously doesn\u2019t attend the Oscars, even when he\u2019s likely to win one (he made an exception in 2002, but only to talk about filmmaking in New York after 9/11), so there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll show up for the Oscars\u2019 self-evidently whorish second cousin. In fact, I feel confident in saying this award means nothing to Allen, and possibly less than that. The honorary Palme des Palmes he received at Cannes in 2002, or his lifetime Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival (in 1995!) \u2014 those he cared about.\n\nYes, Allen received a career achievement award from the most venerable of European film festivals nearly 20 years ago, which only highlights the difficulty of talking about his career. Which one do you mean? There are various ways of carving up Allen\u2019s career, which encompasses 44 feature films (I think) as a writer-director across almost half a century. There are the funny movies versus the serious ones, the Diane Keaton period and the Mia Farrow period, the movies set in New York and the globetrotting period, the ones where Woody is the star and the ones where he ventriloquizes through someone else. Those are all somewhat valid distinctions, but in considering all of Allen\u2019s films from \u201cWhat\u2019s Up, Tiger Lily?\u201d through \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d (he has another, \u201cMagic in the Moonlight,\u201d with Emma Stone and Colin Firth, already in the can), I found them naturally dividing into four categories that seem thematically, philosophically and technically distinct from one another.\n\nEach of these periods has its own highlights and lowlights, but it\u2019s the differences between the periods that seem most striking to me, and that begin to lend some shape and clarity to a discussion of Allen\u2019s bewildering output. I use that industrial term deliberately. Allen has reliably made a movie every year since the late 1970s (OK, he skipped 1981, but made up for it by releasing two in 1987), and it has sometimes felt as if the pace and the intense productivity were more important to him than the question of whether each individual picture was actually any good. As he recently told Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times, \u201cthe Colin Firth-Emma Stone film is over and history to me. \u2018Blue Jasmine\u2019 is ancient history.\u201d Allen has, in a certain sense, demystified the artistic process; it barely seems possible that the same person made \u201cBananas,\u201d \u201cSeptember\u201d and \u201cMelinda and Melinda,\u201d to cite three extreme examples. (I once saw him, at a Cannes press conference, unable to remember the title of the latter film.)\n\nTwo of my periods overlap, as we will see. In fact, I think the transition zone of the mid-1990s, approximately from \u201cHusbands and Wives\u201d to \u201cSweet and Lowdown,\u201d could be classified as its own period. That was the end of Allen\u2019s romance with New York and the end of his period of concentrated cinephilia, when he self-consciously followed in the footsteps of European idols like Fellini and (especially) Ingmar Bergman. It was in that period that he left behind the withering Manhattan intelligentsia that had long been his principal audience (which included an entire generation of film critics), in search of a younger and larger audience that could ensure his late-career viability. He didn\u2019t find it in a misguided attempt to make Hollywood entertainment (\u201cCurse of the Jade Scorpion,\u201d anyone?) but ultimately did find it \u2014 first in Europe, and then at home \u2014 with a series of middleweight, misanthropic comedies and thrillers shot in picturesque locations with all-star casts.\n\nIf the public\u2019s view of Allen was conditioned, for many years, by a longing for his \u201cearly, funny movies\u201d (as the invading aliens put it in \u201cStardust Memories\u201d) and later by the tabloid scandal over his love affair, and subsequent marriage, with his longtime girlfriend\u2019s adopted daughter, those questions have now faded. I\u2019m not a huge fan of Allen\u2019s later films \u2014 my favorite of his post-New York movies is probably the openly mean-spirited \u201cVicky Cristina Barcelona\u201d \u2014 and as numerous readers have reminded me, I\u2019m a critical outlier on the lavishly praised \u201cBlue Jasmine,\u201d which I found a rickety and silly construction built around a remarkable Cate Blanchett performance that goes right to the edge of painful self-parody. But there\u2019s no doubting the scale of Woody Allen\u2019s achievement, or his prodigious, voracious creativity. He shaped an entire mode of neurotic and self-conscious American comedy, he nurtured an entire generation of brooding art-house depressives (myself very much included) and then, of all things, he reinvented himself, in his mid 70s, as a commercially successful filmmaker with a worldwide middle-class audience.\n\nWhen He Was Funny: 1966-1976\n\nKey Works: \u201cBananas,\u201d \u201cSleeper,\u201d \u201cLove and Death\u201d\n\nThe first movie to carry Woody Allen\u2019s name as a director was \u201cWhat\u2019s Up, Tiger Lily?,\u201d which is somewhere between an idiotic practical joke and a brilliant work of Situationist d\u00e9tournement. Allen redubbed a grade-B Japanese action movie with gag-laden Borscht Belt dialogue about a secret egg-salad recipe, exposing the essentially mannered and artificial quality of the original film. Indeed, all of Allen\u2019s \u201cearly, funny movies\u201d \u2014 from the crime farce \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d to the pseudo sci-fi of \u201cSleeper\u201d to the surrealistic sketch comedy of \u201cEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex\u201d \u2014 are spoofs that entirely reject any claims of realism, and I think that\u2019s important when considering his later movies. He\u2019s always been interested in frame and genre, never in trying to represent the world-as-it-is, and those of us who understood \u201cInteriors\u201d or \u201cCrimes and Misdemeanors\u201d in the latter context were making a categorical error.\n\nTurning Point: \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d\n\nWhat many critics and fans still regard (justifiably) as Allen\u2019s best and funniest film actually began life as a murder mystery to be called \u201cAnhedonia.\u201d The decision to recut the movie as a romantic comedy focused on Diane Keaton\u2019s character (and her iconic wardrobe choices) happened during post-production, and reflects the immense influence of editor Ralph Rosenblum on this stage of Allen\u2019s career. Allen biographers have suggested that Rosenblum, across the course of \u201cSleeper,\u201d \u201cLove and Death\u201d and \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d essentially taught Allen how to structure a dramatic film and began to push him more toward a heightened level of naturalism or realism. As I\u2019ve just said, I think any use of those terms with respect to Allen\u2019s career should be viewed with extreme caution.\n\nThe Bergman of Manhattan: 1977-1997\n\nKey Works: \u201cManhattan,\u201d \u201cStardust Memories,\u201d \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d \u201cCrimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d \u201cHusbands and Wives\u201d\n\nThese are without doubt the works of highly self-conscious drama-tinged comedy, and comedy-tinged drama, for which Allen will be remembered the longest. Some of them haven\u2019t aged as well as others: Given what we would later learn about Allen\u2019s personal life, it\u2019s difficult to overlook the fact that \u201cManhattan\u201d (although it remains a lovely movie to look at, and often very funny) is about a 42-year-old guy who\u2019s dating a teenager. \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d although a revelatory work of dysfunctional family dramedy at the time, has been imitated (and outdone) so often over the years that it no longer looks like anything special. I loved his smaller and more serious Bergman imitations back then (\u201cInteriors,\u201d \u201cSeptember,\u201d \u201cAnother Woman\u201d and so on) but don\u2019t feel much desire to revisit them now. A strain of misanthropy, self-mockery and even self-hatred that surfaces most clearly in this period has endured through all of Allen\u2019s subsequent work, major and minor. \u201cCrimes and Misdemeanors\u201d and \u201cHusbands and Wives\u201d still seem to me Allen\u2019s dramatic masterpieces, and a great many of his later films feel like attempts to sugarcoat and repackage the bleak insights into human nature found in those two films, such that a larger audience will swallow them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's puzzling comic genius, from the \"early, funny movies\" to the mid-career masterpieces to Euro-self-parody", "title": "Making sense of Woody Allen\u2019s confusing career", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America's puzzling comic genius, from the \"early, funny movies\" to the mid-career masterpieces to Euro-self-parody", "title": "Making sense of Woody Allen\u2019s confusing career", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/making_sense_of_woody_allens_confusing_career/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/sleeper_midnight_paris.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's puzzling comic genius, from the \"early, funny movies\" to the mid-career masterpieces to Euro-self-parody", "title": "Making sense of Woody Allen\u2019s confusing career", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/sleeper_midnight_paris.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, blue jasmine, cate blanchett, Comedy, Diane Keaton, Editor's Picks, Golden Globes, Movie Awards Season, Movies, Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As I\u2019ve just said, I think any use of those terms with respect to Allen\u2019s career should be viewed with extreme caution.\nThere are various ways of carving up Allen\u2019s career, which encompasses 44 feature films (I think) as a writer-director across almost half a century.\nBut there\u2019s no doubting the scale of Woody Allen\u2019s achievement, or his prodigious, voracious creativity.\nYes, Allen received a career achievement award from the most venerable of European film festivals nearly 20 years ago, which only highlights the difficulty of talking about his career.\nA strain of misanthropy, self-mockery and even self-hatred that surfaces most clearly in this period has endured through all of Allen\u2019s subsequent work, major and minor."}
