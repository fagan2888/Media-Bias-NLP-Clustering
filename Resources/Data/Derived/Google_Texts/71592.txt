Folk/rock singer-songwriter Jake Bugg has a lengthy touring schedule ahead of him before opening select dates on the Black Keys fall North American arena tour. But the 20-year-old singer is looking forward to being the support act for a change.

“That’s going to be interesting, some big shows,” Bugg tells Billboard at the 2014 Bonnaroo. “I haven’t done a support tour for a little while. I forgot how good it was to have a few drinks, although I can’t drink in his country. You can get a bit more drunk quicker.”



Bugg is currently touring behind his second album, “Shangri La,” which was released last year. After Bonnaroo, the singer will play a handful of U.S. theater shows before appearing at numerous other festivals across the globe, including Firefly, Glastonbury, Summerfest, Reading and Leeds. In later October, he’ll open for the Black Keys. Bugg says being on the road is the only place he gets to work on new material.



“Writing on the road is the only opportunity I really get,” he says. “That’s how I managed to do the second album, because I had to tour. But that’s my outlet. When I get a little moment to myself or a little bit of spare time, that’s what I love to do more than anything — write songs. That’s when I can escape the stresses and reality of the real world.”
