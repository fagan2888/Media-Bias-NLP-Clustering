The Center for Health and/& Economy (H&E) will be led by former Congressional Budget Office Director and American Action Forum President Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Princeton Professor Uwe Reinhardt, and University of Minnesota Professor Stephen Parente. The 11 member H&E board includes nationally recognized academic experts in health economics, and spans the ideological spectrum.\n\nH&E will be a resource for health care data and will issue projections, analyses, and \u201cscores\u201d of how various health care proposals would affect the U.S. The data and projections are based off two microsimulation models: A \u201cMedicare Model,\u201d analyzing the effects on those 65 plus, and an \u201cUnder 65\u201d model analyzing the rest of the population.\n\nThe two models will provide insight into how current law or proposed changes affect: the number of insured Americans, the price of health insurance, the efficiency and accessibility of health care, and the federal budget.\n\nCollectively the board of H&E possesses a diverse set of views and a comprehensive library of research upon which H&E analyses are predicated. Short biographies on each of the board members can be found on the Center\u2019s website at: http://healthandeconomy.org/\n\nH&E also has several new reports out today including:\n\nAnnual Baseline Report: This report is H&E\u2019s baseline estimation for the state of American health care over the next ten years, for residents under 65 years old. The report estimates the effects of current health care law on insurance participation, premium costs, and the efficiency of health care systems.

H&E compares the prices, subsidies, and policies available to young adults with those available to Americans approaching retirement age. Read the report Here\n\nHR 574 Report: This report analyzes the impact of HR 574, the Medicare Physician Payment Innovation Act of 2013, sponsored by Rep. Allyson Schwartz (PA-13), as compared with current law. The proposal repeals Medicare\u2019s \u201cSustainable Growth Rate\u201d provision, reduces Medicare\u2019s reliance on the fee-for-service payment method, and implements new payment models. Our analysis finds that compared with current law, the proposal increases the federal budget deficit by at least $153 billion over ten years.
