A series of awful polls from across different networks and educational institutions are confirming what the #NeverTrump movement has been saying for months: Donald Trump is unelectable — even against Hillary Clinton.

Last week, we reported that Trump’s disapproval ratings among women and young Americans are above 70 percent, according to Fox News and others.

But now, a Quinnipiac University poll confirms that Trump is losing to Clinton in the general election outside the margin of error, and it appears to be driven by distaste among younger voters and women.

In the poll of more than 1,400 voters, Trump loses voters ages 18-to-29 by 26 percent. He’s losing women by 16 percent.

While Republicans usually have gender and age gaps, these disparities are particularly large. While a Republican can get away with age and gender gaps, Trump is seeing age and gender canyons.

It’s also important to note that this poll only shows him losing to Clinton by 6 percent overall — while the RealClearPolitics average of polls says she is beating him by 11.2 percent. This isn’t an anti-Trump poll by any means, and if Trump wants to be competitive in November, he needs to figure out how to work some demographic miracles.

While Trump does bring in new voters, the polls show he’s alienating more than he’s bringing in.
