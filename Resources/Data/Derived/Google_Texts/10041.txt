Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a head injury in Sunday’s 2-1 overtime loss at Winnipeg, practiced Monday at team headquarters and is scheduled to play Tuesday night against the San Jose Sharks at the Pepsi Center.

The Avs’ leader in average ice time (21:48), Johnson left Sunday’s game early in the third period and did not return.

“If it was in the first period I would have came back, but how long the concussion protocol takes I wasn’t able to,” Johnson said. “I started feeling a lot better last night and this morning. Things cleared up pretty fast and, I’ve been down that road before and didn’t want to go down it again. I don’t want to miss any hockey here.”

Forward Jesse Winchester, who has not yet played for the Avs after suffering a concussion in the preseason, has been medically cleared and might make his season debut Thursday against the visiting New York Islanders, Avs coach Patrick Roy said.

Winchester was signed as a free agent last summer and expected to bolster the third- and fourth lines.

“Feeling good and eager to get back with the guys,” Winchester said. “I felt pretty good in the preseason and was having fun. Just have to regroup and give some energy to the guys when called upon.”

Roy doesn’t foresee any lineup changes Tuesday against the Sharks, and Semyon Varlamov will again start in goal.
