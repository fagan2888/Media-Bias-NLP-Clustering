CEDAR RAPIDS, IA (CBS2/FOX28) - Donald Trump's speech may have crossed several lines, according to one national publication.

On Tuesday the business mogul announced his run for president in a New York speech.

On Wednesday USA TODAY published a piece fact checking Trump's claims.

The article says he made "false and misleading statements on the economy, trade, health care and terrorism."

Some of Trump's initiatives include repealing the Affordable Care Act, strengthening the power of the U.S. economy in the international marketplace and creating jobs.



From USA TODAY:

Trump claimed that economic growth has "never" been below zero until last quarter's drop, which is far from true. It has been below zero 42 times since 1946.

He said "there are no jobs" to be had. In fact, there were 5.4 million job openings recorded at the end of April, the most in 15 years.

He said the "real" unemployment rate is "anywhere from 18 to 20%" and "maybe even 21%." We see no factual basis for this opinion.

He boasted he would have blocked new Ford plants in Mexico by threatening to impose a 35% tax on vehicles and parts made in Mexico and shipped to the U.S. But only Congress can impose taxes and such a tax would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Trump claimed the five Taliban leaders exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl "are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us." But all five remain in Qatar, where they continue to be monitored and are subject to a travel ban, according to the State Department.

He also made the misleading claim that health care premium costs are going "up 29, 39, 49 and even 55%." He's talking about some proposed rate increases on the individual market that still need regulatory approval. There are also proposed rate decreases or single-digit increases that did not have to be submitted for review.
