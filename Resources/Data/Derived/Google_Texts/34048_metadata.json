To eliminate trips that could lead to falls, management at The Sequoias required residents to have walkers valet parked once they reached their table, then remain seated while staff served the meal.\n\nThat lasted until a woman sued to stop the policy, infuriated that it infringed on her freedom of movement. A compromise was reached: Residents are now allowed to take their walkers to the buffet at less busy times.\n\n\u201cI do like to pick out my own food,\u201d said Hammer, a retired music teacher. \u201cI can tell you, as a child of the Depression, they always bring me too much.\u201d\n\nAs the population ages and people live longer in bad shape, the number of older Americans who fall and suffer serious, even fatal, injuries is soaring. So the retirement communities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes where millions of Americans live are trying to balance safety and their residents\u2019 desire to live as they choose.\n\nThose who study and manage retirement facilities and nursing homes say there is heightened attention to preventing falls. Trying to anticipate hazardous conditions, retirement facilities like The Sequoias hire architects and interior designers, some of whom wear special glasses that show the building as an old person would see it.\n\nThe dangers are real. The number of people older than 65 who died after a fall reached nearly 24,000 in 2012, the most recent year for which fatality numbers are available \u2014 almost double the number 10 years earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe rate of severe falls has been increasing for Americans older than 65. Researchers say that there has also been a rise in diseases linked to falls: diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. In some cases, the medication to treat the disease can increase the risk of falling.\n\nAnd more than 2.4 million people older than 65 were treated in emergency departments for injuries from falls in 2012 alone, an increase of 50 percent over a decade. All told, in the decade from 2002-12, more than 200,000 Americans older than 65 died after falls. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in that age group.\n\nFALLPROOF DESIGN?\n\nSome facilities have begun to install floor lighting, much like that on airplanes, that automatically turns on when a resident gets out of bed, illuminating a pathway to the bathroom, said Dr. Lewis A. Lipsitz, a professor of medicine at Harvard who is also vice president of academic medicine at Hebrew SeniorLife, a senior housing, research and health care organization in the Boston area. Others are installing energy-absorbing flooring in bathrooms, to reduce the impact of a fall.\n\nBut many residents do not, or refuse to, recognize their own gradual deterioration, leaving them vulnerable despite efforts to protect them. Institutions offer sessions on avoiding falls and improving balance and fitness. But some residents will not go near them \u2014 until after they have fallen.\n\n\u201cAs the saying goes in the Army,\u201d Hammer said, \u201cthey can\u2019t make you do anything, but they can make you wish you had.\u201d\n\nHammer likes to tell a joke about a stingy Texas millionaire who was told \u201cYou can\u2019t take it with you.\u201d Her eyes display a hint of mischief as she recalls the punch line: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, I ain\u2019t a-goin\u2019.\u2019 \u201d A feisty independence characterizes many residents of The Sequoias. Former professors, physicians and executives, they are accustomed to telling others what to do, not the other way around.\n\nAndrea Dapper, administrator of The Sequoias, is responsible for the health and safety of its more than 300 residents. She watches them shuffle past her street-level office window, with and without walkers and canes, on their way to nearby Japantown, or the opera, symphony or ballet. And she worries. The population at The Sequoias is aging, as people live longer in general, and the older the residents get, the higher their risk for falling.\n\nStairs are a particular hazard. The carpeting on the stairs at The Sequoias used to be a uniform color. Then a wide white accent stripe was installed at the top and bottom so residents could see the line clearly, even with blurry, yellowed vision and limited depth perception. The hue of the stripe was chosen by a committee of residents.\n\nEvaluations of residents\u2019 living quarters are regular. \u201cWe measure bed height, toilet height and the need for grab bars,\u201d Dapper said.\n\nIn many apartments, the lip on the shower edge is black against the white tile because the contrast with the rest of the bathroom makes it more visible, said Ray Boudewyn, director of engineering for Northern California Presbyterian Homes and Services, the nonprofit company that owns and operates three facilities in the San Francisco area.\n\nSometimes adult children do not grasp the many common risks for the elderly. When Boudewyn introduced black toilet seats at The Sequoias, some of the residents\u2019 families complained, saying they looked ugly and institutional. Then he showed them how the contrast of the black seat against the white toilet helped residents see it far better than a white seat.\n\nWhen finishing an apartment with trim, paint and thresholds, architects and designers put on tinted glasses to see as an older person might. The glasses cast a darkened, yellow hue. Boudewyn said he sometimes uses Vaseline to blur his glasses in order to see the rooms as patients who have cataracts would.\n\nCarpeting is fine, and softer for absorbing a fall if it happens. But it needs to be able to accommodate an elderly person\u2019s shuffle. As for the evenness of surfaces, Boudewyn said, \u201can eighth of an inch is our threshold\u201d for tripping danger.\n\nKEEPING WATCH\n\nAt The Sequoias\u2019 San Francisco facility, the vast majority of residents, 265, are living in their own apartments, and 14 are in assisted living. There is also a 50-bed skilled-nursing section and a smaller one for residents with dementia.\n\nKeeping an eye on everyone living independently is impossible, Dapper said. But a group of Sequoias staff members who refer to themselves as \u201cthe iffy committee\u201d meet monthly to evaluate residents who seem to be growing less steady on their feet. If a cane or walker seems advisable, a staff member will suggest it to the resident, ever so gently.\n\nHousekeepers at The Sequoias are trained not merely to clean an apartment but to inspect it for quiet hazards \u2014 scatter rugs that seem easy to trip on, or furniture that could topple if grabbed for support.\n\nThe Sequoias has an extensive \u201cfalls education\u201d program and an annual safety fair. But falls continue, with vexing persistence. This year, the fall rate declined slightly in both the independent-living and skilled-nursing units, according to Jill Dicus, the nurse manager at the assisted-living and memory units, but increased in the assisted-living unit.\n\nPeople often resist the transition to a cane or walker, as it can feel stigmatizing. Hammer\u2019s own resistance ended last year after an embarrassing fall \u201cin front of God and everybody\u201d at her exercise class.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using a walker, really use it and stop pretending you don\u2019t need it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took the fall to destroy my confidence in walking without my walker.\u201d\n\nWhen someone does fall, residents often stay quiet about it.\n\nSequoias staff members encourage residents to report their falls to the nursing staff, as it indicates a risk for a subsequent fall. Yet \u201cresidents have a fear that they\u2019ll be whisked away and put somewhere else,\u201d said Donna Alexander, director of nursing. She said that if a nurse observes a bruise or a cut, a fall is the prime suspect. And \u201cthe minute a resident doesn\u2019t show up for a meal or doesn\u2019t come to an activity, the nursing staff knows about it.\u201d\n\nSome residents become vigilantes.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to say they\u2019re turning someone in,\u201d Hammer said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018You should keep an eye on so and so.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGEARING DOWN\n\nGeriatricians often refer to the gradual narrowing in an elderly person\u2019s life. Travel tapers off, so that trips out of town grow rare and, then so do trips beyond the neighborhood, house, bedroom and bed.\n\nA similar progression occurs in the domains over which older adults assert their independence. Until recently, David Hammer, Eleanor\u2019s husband, was among the most outspoken residents at The Sequoias.\n\nFrom the day they moved into their two-bedroom apartment in 2004, Hammer made his strong opinions known, especially when it came to the chairs used in exercises classes. Like many residents, he refused to wear an electronic pendant for summoning aid in an emergency.\n\nTerrence Murphy, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine who studies falls, said he bought his mother a pendant but she refused.\n\n\u201cI think most of us with aging parents go through this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou try to reason with them, and they just don\u2019t want to accept that they are in mortal danger if they have an injurious fall when they\u2019re on their own. They don\u2019t realize that deep inside their bodies, they are aging, and that when they fall alone in their house, it\u2019s likely to be catastrophic if they don\u2019t get help in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nOne night in September 2012, while his wife was out of town, he fell in the bedroom and fractured his femur. With no way of calling for help, he lay on the floor until the next morning, when a member of the housekeeping staff found him.\n\nDavid Hammer\u2019s accident changed him dramatically. He became easily agitated, and frustrated by his hampered mobility. Within a few months, he moved to the facility\u2019s assisted-living floor and was put in a program that pinpoints residents at high risk of falling. But in a fit of aesthetic righteousness, he insisted that his furniture be placed farther apart than the staff considered safe. A few weeks later, he fell and, with nothing to grab on to, broke his wrist.\n\nLate last spring, a neurologist gave Hammer a tentative diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, a particularly brutal form of dementia. Immediately after meeting with the Hammers, Dicus said, she started thinking about what to do next. But she wasn\u2019t quick enough.\n\nA week later, Hammer fell again, while walking unsupervised in the hallway of the assisted-living unit, fracturing his femur a second time. He is now in the skilled-nursing unit in a wheelchair and is not likely to leave.\n\nEXERCISE OPTIONAL\n\nThough the risk of a fall increases significantly once people reach their 80s, researchers have found that people 85 and older in excellent health have no greater risk than someone 20 years younger. For places like The Sequoias, the challenge is to encourage people to work at keeping themselves strong. The Sequoias offers exercise classes, which help with balance. But they are optional and only a small percentage of residents attend them.\n\nIt is not so much laziness that accounts for the limited attendance, but denial. A sluggish foot, eyesight that fails to catch a step down, slowed reflexes \u2014 these creep up slowly, often imperceptibly.\n\nIndeed, many of the people who attend the class are in rehabilitation for an injury.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/AGING_FALLS_INJURIES_4.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdf3\"", "article_summary": "Sequoias staff members encourage residents to report their falls to the nursing staff, as it indicates a risk for a subsequent fall.\n\u201cIt took the fall to destroy my confidence in walking without my walker.\u201dWhen someone does fall, residents often stay quiet about it.\nThe population at The Sequoias is aging, as people live longer in general, and the older the residents get, the higher their risk for falling.\nThose who study and manage retirement facilities and nursing homes say there is heightened attention to preventing falls.\nAll told, in the decade from 2002-12, more than 200,000 Americans older than 65 died after falls."}
