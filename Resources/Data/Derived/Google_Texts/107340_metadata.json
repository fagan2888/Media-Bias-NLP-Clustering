David Vitter followed through Thursday on his threat to hold up President Obama\u2019s pick to lead the government\u2019s personnel office, saying he still doesn\u2019t understand why Congress was granted small-business status that \u201cexempted\u201d it from Obamacare, even though it employs thousands.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican told acting Office of Personnel Management Director Beth F. Cobert that he used his senatorial privileges to place a formal hold on her nomination as permanent director, because she failed to respond to his queries.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act required members of Congress and their official staffers to buy insurance on the law\u2019s health exchanges, but the Obama administration \u2014 through OPM \u2014 decided in 2013 that if they used the D.C. small-business exchange, they could still get their employer subsidies to cover premiums.\n\nRegular Americans who buy plans through the exchange are restricted from having employers contribute to their premiums.\n\nFor months, Mr. Vitter has asked OPM to explain its rationale for deeming Congress small enough to use D.C.\u2019s \u201cSHOP\u201d exchange for employers of 50 workers or less.\n\n\u201cAs much as federal bureaucrats enjoy hiding behind layers of red tape, we have now reached the point where OPM can no longer avoid explaining how Congress was allowed to purchase health insurance as a small business \u2014 when it clearly is not,\u201d Mr. Vitter said in a statement. \u201cMs. Cobert\u2019s nomination will not move forward in any capacity until the American people have received answers as to why Washington\u2019s Obamacare exemption exists.\u201d\n\nLeaders on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform rejected Mr. Vitter\u2019s stance at a hearing Thursday.\n\nChairman Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican, said Ms. Cobert would be a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d for the agency, which was rocked by a massive data breach last year.\n\nRanking member Elijah Cummings, Maryland Democrat, called the senator\u2019s hold \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\nOPM has defended its Obamacare rule, saying it made sense to use a SHOP to administer what amounted to an employer-based contribution to members\u2019 health care, while shepherding members into an exchange as required by the 2010 health overhaul.\n\nThe agency said it picked D.C.\u2019s portal simply because Congress is located in the District of Columbia.\n\nLast week, Mr. Vitter said Capitol Hill lawmakers and staff were receiving tax-reporting forms that describe Congress as a large employer subject to the health care law\u2019s \u201cemployer mandate.\u201d\n\nHe said Congress \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d and he would like to know if the disconnect amounts to a violation of the tax code.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
