But we do. Time to save the Arctic.'\n\nDoctor Who star Peter Capaldi adds: 'We know this planet is a fragile one. Yet we stand and watch as the Arctic shrinks\u2026The time has come to stop watching. We must act.'\n\nThe campaign also features the Duchess of York, Jerry Hall, Stella McCartney, Chris Martin and Tom Hiddleston.\n\nCo-star: Poldark hunk Aidan Turner also appears in the campaign and wears a Save The Arctic t-shirt", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Facial,oil,daily,body,scrubs,staying,sun,Supermodel,Kate,Moss,reveals,stays,youthful,41", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3167074/Facial-oil-daily-body-scrubs-staying-sun-Supermodel-Kate-Moss-reveals-stays-youthful-41.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The 41-year-old supermodel has shared some of her beauty secrets and says a daily scrub is essential for keeping in shape.
