Thomas Jewell, a black man who helped organize the rally, acknowledged that some people have misrepresented the flag\u2014attaching movements and meanings to it that don\u2019t belong. He said, \u201cIf you look a little deeper, you\u2019ll find out what it was all about. The flag was never meant to be racist. It\u2019s a heritage thing. It\u2019s a Southern thing.\u201d\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
