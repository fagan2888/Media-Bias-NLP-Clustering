About one in five people surveyed ranked cited taxes or personal health as the most difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that people don\u2019t want to talk about money, investments, tax strategies, or even how much to put aside for a child\u2019s education,\u201d Karen Wimbish, Wells Fargo Retail Retirement Director said in a statement. \u201cBut not spending time today to think about the future can be costly in the long run.\u201d\n\nRelated: The No-Fear Guide to Financial Planning in 2014\n\nWomen in particular have a hard time talking about money. Half of women polled said they found such conversations difficult, compared to just 38 percent of men. That could be because they feel less confident in their financial knowledge: 45 percent of women grade their own financial literacy a \u2018C\u2019 or lower, compared to just 35 percent of men.\n\nDespite their unwillingness to discuss money, Americans cite it as one of their greatest concerns. Nearly 40 percent reported that money represents the biggest stress in their life, and a third report losing sleep worrying about money.\n\nEven so, 42 percent of those surveyed said they lacked a detailed investment or financial plan, or even a budget to help manage their spending.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans would rather have a discussion about religion, politics, or even death, than talk about their personal finances.", "title": "The One Subject Most Americans Won\u2019t Talk About", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/20/One-Subject-Most-Americans-Won-t-Talk-About", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Financial_Advisor_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/20/One-Subject-Most-Americans-Won-t-Talk-About", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Financial_Advisor_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Americans would rather have a discussion about religion, politics, or even death, than talk about their personal finances.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Americans would rather have a discussion about religion, politics, or even death, than talk about their personal finances, according to a study released today by Wells Fargo.\nWhen asked about the chat topics they find challenging, 44 percent of those surveyed cited personal finances, beating out death (38 percent), politics (35 percent), and religion (35 percent).\nDespite their unwillingness to discuss money, Americans cite it as one of their greatest concerns.\nAbout one in five people surveyed ranked cited taxes or personal health as the most difficult.\nNearly 40 percent reported that money represents the biggest stress in their life, and a third report losing sleep worrying about money."}
