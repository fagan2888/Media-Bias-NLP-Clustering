Affordable Care Act Expenses Create Opportunity for Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL)

Randy Binner, Managing Director at FBR Capital Markets, says Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) is seeing an opportunity around Affordable Care Act expenses, similar to what the company has experienced in Japan.

Aflac is basically a Japanese insurance company based in the United States. It’s always been like that. So when you see an Aflac commercial here in the U.S., they have enough people here in the U.S. to write insurance for in the area that they pioneered: supplemental health products. …They have a huge opportunity in this country around the potential for the Affordable Care Act to make health insurance more expensive for Americans. We are seeing health insurers exit the exchanges. The beginning of that process is quite likely happening.

Binner says Aflac got big in Japan because of the country’s socialized health care system and shrinking population.
