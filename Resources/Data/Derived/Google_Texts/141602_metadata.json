No big surprise there. But when I clicked over to the poll itself I found a couple of things related to immigration that were kind of interesting.\n\nFirst, CNN asked \"Just your best guess, do you think the number of immigrants coming to the United States illegally has increased or decreased in the last few years?\" Among Republicans, 83 percent thought it had increased. Granted, asking about the \"last few years\" is a little ambiguous, but if you assume at a minimum that it means less than a decade, then 83 percent of Republicans are woefully misinformed. As you can see from the Pew data on the right, the illegal immigrant population dropped considerably in 2008 and 2009 and has been basically flat ever since.\n\n(By the way, among Democrats 61 percent think immigration has increased. That's a little better, but still not exactly a proud moment in voter awareness. It isn't just Fox News that's keeping us all misinformed.)\n\nThe second interesting question was one that asked about which issues were most important. This kind of thing always has to be taken with a grain of salt, but even so it's a little surprising how little Republicans actually care about immigration. For all the attention it's gotten from Donald Trump, only 9 percent said it was their most important issue, the lowest showing of any of the issues CNN asked about. The economy and terrorism/foreign policy were far and away the biggest worries among Republicans. Also surprisingly, health care didn't register very high either. The tea party may be yelling endlessly about the need to repeal the worst law since the Fugitive Slave Act, but among all Republicans, only a few rate it as a critical issue.\n\nSo....immigration and Obamacare probably aren't going to be gigantic issues this year among Republicans\u2014or in the general election. As usual, the economy will be #1, and #2 will probably be terrorism and foreign policy in general.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/immigration", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Sorry Donald, most Republicans don't actually care that much about illegal immigration"}, "twitter": {"title": "Sorry Donald, most Republicans don't actually care that much about illegal immigration", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/07/immigration", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "This kind of thing always has to be taken with a grain of salt, but even so it's a little surprising how little Republicans actually care about immigration.\nFor all the attention it's gotten from Donald Trump, only 9 percent said it was their most important issue, the lowest showing of any of the issues CNN asked about.\n(By the way, among Democrats 61 percent think immigration has increased.\nGreg Sargent has an item today noting that by a 63-34 percent margin in a new CNN poll, Republicans believe the main focus of immigration policy should be stopping the flow of illegal immigration and deporting the illegal immigrants who are already here.\nBut when I clicked over to the poll itself I found a couple of things related to immigration that were kind of interesting."}
