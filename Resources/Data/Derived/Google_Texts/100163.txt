In a bit of odd news this Christmas Eve, Santa Claus was shot in the back by a pellet gun in Southeast DC during a charity toy giveaway. The incident was filmed by ABC 7 and is quickly going viral on the internet.

Per ABC 7 reporter Kris Van Cleave's Twitter, Santa is doing okay. There are currently no suspects in the shooting, but it's safe to say the culprit has earned himself a spot on the naughty list this year.

This is just really sad. The last place someone should expect to get shot by a pellet gun would be during a charity giveaway. Santa could have been seriously hurt if he had been struck in the face. I'm glad everyone is okay.
