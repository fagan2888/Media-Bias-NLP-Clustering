“Like any family doctor who has practiced for 30 years, I know what it’s like to make a decision that leads to the death of a patient. The appropriate intervention gone badly, the symptom after consideration mistakenly reassured. … I can tell you, it cuts like a knife. You face the family and fight back the tears. You wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and wish you had that moment back.

And sometimes one night leads to a dozen. My wife will tell you, it’s a load to carry.

Gov. McCrory and Sen. Berger, you now carry that same weight, whether you will admit it or not. Welcome to this our unfortunate fraternity: those who carry the blood of others on our hands. Like it or not, we are all three members.

Some in Rockingham County will surely die — if some haven’t already — because of your partisan decision to reject Medicaid expansion.

Please embrace our shared humanity. The two of you have the power to get this done.

Re-approach this issue with an open mind and you will experience a change of heart.

Until then, I hope you’ll wake up some nights in a cold sweat, knowing you have committed a terrible wrong. Shame on you for your complicity thus far in denying basic health insurance to the most vulnerable residents of our state.

Shame on the rest of us for letting you get away with it.”
