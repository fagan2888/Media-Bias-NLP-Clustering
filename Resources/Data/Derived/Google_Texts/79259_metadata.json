Those student-athletes also aren\u2019t covered by workplace compensation in the case of a serious injury that might result in their athletic scholarship being withdrawn.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s How Much Americans Will Bet on March Madness\n\nCollege coaches, meanwhile, can benefit tremendously under the current system, with many earning millions. Some have argued that coaches\u2019 salaries, which are often higher than those of university presidents, could also easily pay for tuition or room and board for hundreds of students at their schools, many of whom are using student loans to afford their education.\n\nRedfin, a real estate broker, selected 10 schools participating in the NCAA championship tournament and figured out how many students at the schools could have their annual tuition or room and board costs covered by their basketball coach\u2019s annual salary.
