Why more and more women are delaying motherhood\n\n\n\nA recent survey shows money is the number-one reason for delaying motherhood \u2013 but are our expectations just too high? Emma Elms reports on the rise of economic infertility\n\n\n\n\n\n'I'd like the freedom to be financially comfortable, not to have arguments about money in front of the kids'\n\n\u2018We\u2019re barely surviving as it is\u2019\n\nDanelle Jordan (right), 25, from London, goes to law school every day, works mornings and evenings, and on Saturdays runs her cupcake business on the side.\n\n\n\nNext year she\u2019ll finish college and become a trainee solicitor but, despite the multiple income streams, she just can\u2019t imagine how she and her partner Chris, a sales manager, will ever have the children they dream of. And it\u2019s nothing to do with fertility issues \u2013 it all boils down to money.\n\n\u2018Even in five years\u2019 time I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to afford to have children,\u2019 she says. Danelle, who shares a rented one-bed flat with Chris, imagined becoming a mum by the time she was 30, but says it\u2019s no longer an option.\n\n\n\n\u2018If it did happen we wouldn\u2019t be giving our children the kind of life we\u2019d want to,\u2019 she says. \u2018I\u2019d like the freedom to be financially comfortable, not to have arguments about money in front of the kids, as my parents often did in front of me \u2013 now they\u2019re divorced.\u2019\n\nSeeing her sister pregnant has made the reality of economic infertility hit home. \u2018My sister\u2019s only a year and a half older than me and lives in Australia, where we\u2019re from, and is pregnant. But for me, with the cost of living in London, it\u2019s just too difficult. It\u2019s not out of the question for us to leave London, but both our jobs are here. Assuming I worked after having a baby, we\u2019d then need childcare, which would be equivalent to one of our monthly wages. Grandparents couldn\u2019t help with childcare either \u2013 my family\u2019s in Australia and Chris\u2019s mum lives in Florida.\u2019\n\nLike many people, Danelle sees buying a home as a non-negotiable prerequisite for having a baby. While many of our European cousins never own their home and rent for life, the UK system does not always offer the security of a long-term let.\n\n\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t want the drama of having a two-month notice period to move out,\u2019 says Danelle, \u2018and the wear and tear from a baby on a rented house can end up costing you a fortune and even prevent you getting your deposit back. Finding a house near good schools and parks is a job in itself, so I\u2019d want to know I wouldn\u2019t have to keep moving. But the prospect of saving a 20 per cent deposit to buy a house in London is out of the question. For us to be able to afford a baby now, Chris would need to be earning a lot more and I\u2019d still need a part-time job. At the moment, we\u2019re barely surviving as it is.\u2019\n\nDanelle and her partner Chris\n\n'Even in five years' time I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to afford to have children'\n\nDanelle is not alone. A major new YouGov survey*, carried out for the First Response Early Result Pregnancy Test campaign (firstresponsefertility.com), showed that money is a major factor in our decision to delay motherhood: nearly half (46 per cent) of women in Great Britain say the single main reason women delay motherhood is because of money and the costs involved in raising a child.\n\nRecent figures from insurer LV=\u2019s annual Cost of a Child report \u2013 which outlines the expense of raising a child until the age of 21 \u2013 found that it now costs a total of \u00a3222,000 \u2013 that\u2019s \u00a34,000 more than last year and \u00a382,000 more than ten years ago. This total is set to hit \u00a3350,000 over the next decade. However, the calculations involved make the assumption that parents will stump up for university fees, which have more than doubled in ten years, and budgets for \u00a316,000 per child for holidays and nearly \u00a34,500 for pocket money, which are clearly not essential.\n\nThe problem may be that we are setting our expectations too high as to what we want to lavish on our children. In pre-recessionary times it was more achievable to have the house, the designer buggy, the 12 months of maternity leave. But our expectations seem to have remained stuck in that time frame while economic reality has moved on.\n\n\n\nTotal childcare costs have shot up from around \u00a340,000 per child ten years ago to more than \u00a363,000 today\n\nPsychologist Dr Cecilia d\u2019Felice believes the \u2018Bugaboo mentality\u2019 \u2013 where we feel our future offspring should be kitted out with top-of-the-range baby gear \u2013 is holding many would-be mothers back. \u2018Our materialistic culture reflects the erroneous idea that what you buy for or do with your baby shows how much you love them,\u2019 she says. \u2018But of course there are many ways to show love to a baby, and a newborn doesn\u2019t notice if it\u2019s in a Bugaboo or not.\n\n\u2018For many new mothers there is so much uncertainty after having a baby, leaving them stressed and scared, so buying all the kit is a way of reassuring themselves they are doing everything \u201cright\u201d. Since the birth of Prince George, there have been scores of media articles about new baby products aimed at people for whom money is no object, so consumer pressure is greater than ever for young mothers on realistic budgets. Being flexible, understanding that change is inevitable and letting go of unrealistic standards all help women to adapt and enjoy motherhood,\u2019 says d\u2019Felice.\n\nFor a generation of women wanting to \u2018have it all\u2019, sacrificing that hard-won career for a baby can feel like a big decision too. \u2018To an ambitious, hard-working woman, having a baby can look like a series of major losses \u2013 loss of income, promotion, status and freedom \u2013 which all contribute to a hesitating culture when it comes to embracing family life,\u2019 observes d\u2019Felice. \u2018The myth of \u201cperfect\u201d child-rearing, an invention of the advertising industry, has little to do with what babies really need and sets women up to feel like failures, whatever they do.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n'I'd always be worrying. \u201cCan we pay the mortgage this month?\u201d\u2019\n\n'I fear that if I leave it too long, I won't be able to have a baby'\n\nFrancesca Rees Dellow (right), 32, a full-time nanny from London, and her husband James, a youth worker and MA student, earn more than \u00a350,000 between them, which on a national level is a decent income.\n\n\n\nDespite feeling broody since her 20s, Francesca has put her baby dream on hold until they\u2019re able to save up enough for her to afford a year\u2019s maternity leave.\n\n\n\n\u2018The mothers I work for can afford to take a year off on maternity leave, whereas if I didn\u2019t save enough I\u2019d have to be back at work within three months. Realistically, could I then take my baby to work with me? My mum would help out two or three days a week, but not full-time.\u2019\n\nFrancesca and her husband part-own a two-bedroom flat under a shared-ownership scheme, which they chose with a view to raising a family. \u2018It sounds like we earn a lot of money, but we have to pay rent and a mortgage and my husband is also paying off his student debt, so our outgoings are high.\n\n'I just don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m where I want to be yet, in terms of being able to provide for a family. Ideally I\u2019d like to have \u00a32,000 saved up to cover all the new baby equipment and \u00a35,000 to cover a year off. The longer I stay in this current job, the more I can save.\u2019\n\nFrancesca knows she\u2019s setting her standards high, but says she wants to replicate her own comfortable upbringing. \u2018Maybe we could scrape by on one income for a while, but I don\u2019t feel we could. I\u2019d always be worrying, \u201cCan we pay the mortgage this month?\u201d It\u2019d be a case of, \u201cRight, I can\u2019t buy that for the baby, because we need the money to pay the mortgage.\u201d\n\n\u2018The other option \u2013 moving out of London to a more affordable area \u2013 doesn\u2019t appeal, as my mum lives 15 minutes from me and when I have a baby I would really like her support.\u2019\n\nFrancesca worries that waiting for her savings to accumulate could mean paying a different price. \u2018Fertility-wise, I\u2019m not that old yet, but if I wait another couple of years it might be harder for me to have a baby. Like every woman, my greatest fear is that if I leave it too long I might have difficulty conceiving.\u2019\n\n'Ideally I\u2019d like to have \u00a37,000 saved to cover baby equipment and a year off'\n\nThe previous generation was less bothered about waiting for the perfect bank balance before taking the plunge. Maybe that\u2019s because the cost of raising a child has since hit an all-time high.\n\n\n\nResearch from LV= shows more than three-quarters of parents have been forced to make cutbacks, with more than four in ten saying they\u2019re curbing spending on luxuries such as holidays. Total childcare costs have also shot up from around \u00a340,000 per child ten years ago to more than \u00a363,000 today.\n\nAs well as prompting us to postpone motherhood, finances can be a key reason for parents deciding to remain a one-child family, according to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, which showed the number of families with just one dependent child has hit 47 per cent. It\u2019s likely to rise to more than 50 per cent over the next decade.\n\nBut is it really worth sacrificing a sibling to give your sole heir the \u2018perfect life\u2019?\n\n\u2018You often hear middle-class parents talk about wanting to provide the best possible life for their child, in terms of holidays and a private education, etc,\u2019 says d\u2019Felice. \u2018Especially if you\u2019ve had these things in your own life, there can be a strong sense that you should be able to do the same for your offspring. For some parents this feeling is so strong that they will stop at one child, rather than having two children and giving them what they perceive to be a \u201csecond-rate\u201d lifestyle.\u2019\n\nMaybe the real problem is that today we are spoilt for choice. As Francesca says, \u2018In our grandmothers\u2019 day, children just didn\u2019t have as much. I very much doubt whether my grandmother took my mum to any baby classes to develop her social skills \u2013 but I\u2019d like to, just so I\u2019m not home alone with my baby all the time!\n\n\u2018There are so many things for babies now that you can charge parents a fortune for \u2013 and they seem to be willing to pay. I know that having a child should just be about love, not how many toys or gadgets they have, but the problem is we know what\u2019s available \u2013 such as that buggy with an iPhone holder\u2026\u2019\n\nAlready Googling it? Stop right there.\n\nfirstresponsefertility.com\n\n'I often wonder what my generation did wrong'\n\nby Daisy Buchanan, 28\n\nDaisy with her boyfriend Chris\n\nI\u2019d always dreamed of having a big family. I\u2019m the eldest of six and loved growing up amid all the games, noise and fun that come with having five people to play with. But graduating in the middle of a recession means I\u2019ve given up all hope of having children myself. In my early 20s, I believed that having a family would just happen when the time was right \u2013 all I had to do was work hard, get my career on track and look for the perfect partner. Surely meeting the right guy would be the hardest bit? But, ironically, getting together with my boyfriend Dale is what made me realise I would always be too broke for babies. We\u2019re both writers, and although we love our jobs, we don\u2019t earn enough to save. Most of our money is swallowed up by rent and bills \u2013 and things would become downright precarious if we had a baby to look after.\n\nAs freelancers we have no company maternity pay or paternity leave. We\u2019ve considered changing careers, but that would push our dream even further out of reach, as retraining would cost money and eat into the time we need to spend earning. We know we\u2019re lucky to be working at all \u2013 we\u2019d probably struggle to find jobs in any industry we were newly qualified to work in.\n\nThe cost of childcare doesn\u2019t make sense. If we spent \u00a370 a day on a nursery and I worked three days a week, that would mean our childcare would cost nearly \u00a31,000 a month, yet I would only earn about \u00a31,200 a month working part-time, making just \u00a3200 profit. From that, I\u2019d still need to pay \u00a3600 rent a month, plus another \u00a3150 for bills \u2013 so we\u2019d be in the red from the moment the baby was born, and that\u2019s before food.\n\nMaybe one way of making it work would be asking my parents to help with childcare, but as they live in Dorset, this would mean moving in with them \u2013 tricky, as a lot of my work is London-based. Mum and Dad have only just stopped looking after children, and are enjoying their independence. It would be selfish for me to turn up on their doorstep with a baby and expect them to help out!\n\nI couldn\u2019t consider having children until I\u2019d bought a house. When you\u2019re renting, your landlord can put your rent up or sell the property at a moment\u2019s notice. It\u2019s a situation I have to put up with, but I could never force a child to endure the same insecurity.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I have a luxury lifestyle to give up. I\u2019ve got used to worrying about money and I don\u2019t mind having cereal for dinner every so often, but it would be irresponsible to have a child if there\u2019s even a chance I wouldn\u2019t be able to feed him or her properly. Growing up, I wasn\u2019t spoiled but I felt secure. I knew my parents could feed and clothe us and there was always enough money left over for school trips, toys and piano lessons. I\u2019m in awe of mothers who manage on little money. I don\u2019t think kids need the latest toys and fashions, but I believe they need to know that their mum and dad will be able to look after them, no matter what.\n\nI often wonder what my generation did wrong. My friends and I think ourselves lucky to be employed, even though we all worked hard at school and university because we\u2019d been told that was the best route to a well-paid career. As the cost of living increases and salaries stay static, the situation seems hopeless. Some people might daydream about the lottery win that lets them buy a mansion \u2013 but my numbers need to come up soon if I\u2019m ever going to have babies.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Too,poor,push,Why,more,women,delaying,motherhood", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-2492830/Too-poor-push-Why-more-women-delaying-motherhood.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "A recent survey shows money is the number-one reason for delaying motherhood \u2013 but are our expectations just too high?
