We don't begrudge paying high salaries in other industries and other kind of professions.\u201d\n\nWith Friday's closure of Coronation Park, the county is now expected to find a real estate agent to start marketing the portion of the Oak Avenue facility once used by the day-care centre.\n\nThe on-site Ontario Early Years Centre (OEYC) will remain as a tenant of the facility until at least Dec. 31, 2015.\n\nbarbara.simpson@sunmedia.ca", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, Local, Provincial, Canada, World, Sports, High School Sports, Local Hockey, Hockey, Basketball, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Lacrosse, Curling, Other Sports, Entertainment, Local, Movies, Music, Television,  Celebrities, Life, Health, Food, Travel, Money, Opinion, Editorial, Letters, Column, Your Newspaper, Social medias, Events, UR, News, Sports, Life, Entertainment, Money, Opinion, Marketplace, Photos, Videos, Contests, Polls, Weather, Sitemap, Event Submission", "author": "nurun.com", "og": {"image": "http://storage.theobserver.ca/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297635849760_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=320x&stmp=1417209233603", "site_name": "Sarnia Observer", "description": "As Sarnia's Coronation Park Day Nursery joined the ranks of other municipally-run day cares being shuttered across Ontario, NDP leader Andrea Horwath insisted to reporters Friday that public sector child-care centres still have a role to play in the province.", "title": "Horwath touts public sector child care"}, "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ff9\"", "article_summary": "Horwath and Sarnia city councillor-elect Brian White toured the 42-year-old day care only hours before it shuttered its doors permanently Friday.\nBut, she insisted the Ontario Liberal government only moved backwards this week with Friday's closure of Coronation Park Day Nursery.\nWhile Horwath went on to point to studies that suggest not-for-profit and public sector day-care centres provide \u201chigher quality\u201d care, she did contend that parents should have the choice to place their children where they see fit.\nAs Sarnia's Coronation Park Day Nursery joined the ranks of other municipally-run day cares being shuttered across Ontario, NDP leader Andrea Horwath insisted to reporters Friday that public sector child-care centres still have a role to play in the province.\nWhen asked whether the Canadian and Ontario governments who are both saddled with multi-billion-dollar deficits have money for expanding child-care services, Horwath pointed to Liberal misspending."}
