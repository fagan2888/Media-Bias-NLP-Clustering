That was a big part of the white opposition to Obamacare\u2014fueled by the rants of right-wing politicians.\n\nThe narrative of the Black mother using food stamps to buy crab legs and steak persists, despite the reality of the food stamp population. According to data from 2013, 40.2 percent of the recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were white, while 25.7 percent were Black, 10.3 percent were Hispanic and 2.1 percent were Asian. That means the true face of food stamps in America is white.\n\nThe falseness of mainstream narrative is damaging because it affects how willing politicians and the public are to provide assistance for Americans who need it. And based on a survey conducted in 2013 for the Associated Press, a huge majority of Americans at some point in their lives are \u201cin need.\u201d The study found that four out of five U.S. adults struggle with joblessness, near-poverty or reliance on welfare for at least part of their lives\u2014demonstrating how far the reality of American life is from the popular narrative that describes this as the land of opportunity.\n\nDuring the recession a few years ago, numerous stories were sprinkled throughout the media on politicians, celebrities and others taking the food stamp challenge to show how difficult it was to feed a family on the average benefit amount, which was a little over $4 a day. But still the narrative persists of these food stamp recipients inappropriately lavishing their families with the food of the wealthy.\n\nGloria Dickerson, who runs a program in Drew, Miss., one of the poorest communities in the country, said she has never understood the American impulse to punish the poor.\n\n\u201cPeople start complaining about the poor, saying when they get their money they buy steak for dinner,\u201d she told Atlanta Blackstar. \u201cWe know that\u2019s not really true, but I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Well, what do you them to buy, just bread? Don\u2019t you want a steak now and then?\u2019 Just because you\u2019re poor doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want some pleasure in life. Poor people want to be joyful too. They gotta have some pleasure. I want pleasure. You want pleasure. Everybody wants pleasure.\u201d\n\nDickerson grew up poor and needy in Drew in the segregated 1950s and 60s and went on to accumulate university degrees and eventually rise to the position of comptroller of the Kellogg Foundation. Now 61, she came back to start a program called We2gether Creating Change, where she spends much of her own money to provide academic enrichment and extracurricular enrichment to the children of Sunflower County, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, a place where jobs and resources are extremely scarce.\n\nDickerson even started a food pantry when she realized families didn\u2019t have enough to eat.\n\n\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s okay to take everything from them because they\u2019re poor?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that thinking. I guess because I grew up poor and went to bed hungry. I wanted for stuff. That\u2019s human nature. What you see around, what you see on TV, all that culture around you, you want some of it. Why would you expect a human being not to want that? They want stuff just like you. They\u2019re human beings just like you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "The stories are cranked out on a regular basis, often prompted by screams from some conservative lawmaker: Poor people use food stamps to buy fancy food.
