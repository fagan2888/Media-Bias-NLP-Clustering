Detroit's Henry Ford Health System plans to build a $110 million cancer center, officials announced on Monday, as part of a $500 million expansion of the system's campus.

The center would open in the summer of 2018.

According to the healthcare provider, the 144,000 square foot center will include a rooftop garden and feature a skyway walk that links to the Henry Ford Hospital next door. In addition to inpatient cancer treatment, the center will include an ambulatory wing and offices for other outpatient cancer support services.

Henry Ford said the center will offer the benefit of having all cancer-specific physicians working on the same floor, will include on-site exercise and wellness programs, will feature a cancer retail services center and will include several technology enhancements.

The center will also feature research departments designed to support clinical study into future treatment options, including precision medicine.

On the financial side, the center will also staff financial navigators to help guide patients through the costs of treatment.

"The facility will be modern in its technology and, most importantly, address the physical and emotional needs of our cancer patients by offering greater flexibility with their care, and expanded support services for the duration of their disease," system CEO John Popovich Jr. said in a statement.

The cancer center would anchor Henry Ford's $500 million expansion of its South Campus, a major community improvement project that has seen the system demolish 100 blighted buildings on the 300 acre area.

Henry Ford has already opened the Cardinal Health Distribution Center on the site, and plans to attract more companies to the new hub.
