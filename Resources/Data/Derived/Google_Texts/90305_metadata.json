They argue President Obama\u2019s policies were on the ballot last fall\u2014and he lost.\n\n\u201cThe message from voters was an emphatic rejection of President Obama\u2019s policies, which he said were on the ballot,\u201d Richard Viguerie, chairman and founder of Conservative HQ, and one of the signers of the mandate said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s Capitol Hill leaders have an obligation to the voters who entrusted them with this historic majority to stop Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive amnesty, repeal Obamacare and return health care choices to doctors and patients, and, most importantly, to end the culture of lies, lawlessness and corruption with which Barack Obama has infected our government,\u201d Viguerie said.\n\nSandy Rios, director of governmental affairs for the American Family Association, added: \u201cThe \u2018Citizens Mandate\u2019 should remove all ambiguity. The people spoke \u2026 and make no mistake \u2026 THIS is what they said.\u201d\n\nThe 53 signatories also included conservative leaders such as Phyllis Schlafly, Dan Bongino, James Dobson and Brad Thor.\n\nAccording to the signers, the 114th Congress has a golden opportunity to reverse years of business-as-usual in Washington.\n\nThe Citizens Mandate declares that lawmakers should:\n\n1) \u201cFight for our founding principles, smaller government and constitutional rights:\u201d The new Congress should fight for constitutional, limited government. They should prevent the corrosive practice of \u201cusing the law to artificially create winners and losers.\u201d\n\n2) \u201cShine the light of oversight on abuse of power:\u201d Congress should conduct hearings to hold government officials responsible for law-breaking, the misuse of taxpayer funds and political targeting.\n\n3) \u201cPromote and fight for limited, accountable government:\u201d Members of Congress should fight efforts on gun control, amnesty, bailouts and other \u201clawless\u201d initiatives. They should work to uncover the truth about the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.\n\n4) \u201cReturn to Regular Order:\u201d Legislation should begin in subcommittees, not the White House. Lawmakers should be given \u201cadequate time\u201d to carefully and thoughtfully consider each individual bill. More decision making should fall to \u201cmembers, senators and the public,\u201d rather than congressional leadership.\n\nThe group also issued recommendations on which issues should receive attention and focus from Congress first. They include working to prevent a nuclear Iran and overturning the president\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nFailure to stop Obama\u2019s agenda, the signatories say, would be a \u201cbase betrayal of both the principles Congress swore to defend and those who entrusted them to do just that.\u201d They warn that they will \u201ctake stock of Congress\u2019 progress annually.\u201d\n\nYou can read the mandate here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of conservative leaders has a message for Congress: Remember what voters told you in November.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of conservative leaders has a message for Congress: Remember what voters told you in November.", "title": "Seeking to Hold Congress Accountable, Conservatives Release 'Citizens Mandate'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150116_NewCongress.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-16T13:12:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IPNQgA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of conservative leaders has a message for Congress: Remember what voters told you in November.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150116_NewCongress.jpg"}, "title": "Seeking to Hold Congress Accountable, Conservatives Release 'Citizens Mandate'", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives,Senate", "published_time": "2015-01-16T03:01:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T13:12:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Congress, conservatives, 114th Congress, Washington, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0862\"", "article_summary": "They argue President Obama\u2019s policies were on the ballot last fall\u2014and he lost.\nA group of conservative leaders has a message for Congress: Remember what voters told you in November.\nA group of 53 conservative leaders and organizations released the mandate Thursday.\n3) \u201cPromote and fight for limited, accountable government:\u201d Members of Congress should fight efforts on gun control, amnesty, bailouts and other \u201clawless\u201d initiatives.\nThe Citizens Mandate declares that lawmakers should:1) \u201cFight for our founding principles, smaller government and constitutional rights:\u201d The new Congress should fight for constitutional, limited government."}
