All data via RCP:\n\nThough polling is less plentiful a year later, the clusters of data are largely similar.\n\nOverlapped, the data show that individual polls deviate from the average slightly less \u2014 and the average is mostly the same.\n\nRepublicans have pounced on the Obamacare one-year anniversary to take note of the lack of change.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is as unpopular as ever,\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Wednesday. \u201cThis law is still hurting our nation as it has increased the cost of healthcare and limited options for doctors.\u201d\n\nAnd the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP\u2019s campaign arm working to usher in a Senate majority this fall, released a video dinging vulnerable Democratic incumbents for parroting claims about the capacity of consumers to retain their health plans and doctors under the law.\n\nThe obstacle facing Republican criticism of the law, however, continues to be Obamacare\u2019s entrenchment, which helped impel Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to lead the ill-fated \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d charge last year. A healthy majority of people who have purchased healthcare plans through a government exchange are pleased with the coverage, and despite the law\u2019s unfavorable marks, individuals would rather see Congress \u201cwork to improve the law\u201d rather than repeal it outright by a 63 percent to 33 percent margin, per recent numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "After a 40-shot tennis rally that'd make even Rafael Nadal collapse, the numbers have hardly budged.", "title": "Charts: Obamacare's dismal approval has hardly budged one year...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/10/commodus-home-600x202.jpg", "height": 202}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/10/01/charts-obamacares-dismal-approval-hardly-budged-one-year-later/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "reince-priebus", "published_time": "2014-10-01T12:25:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-01T12:38:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef0e\"", "article_summary": "Overlapped, the data show that individual polls deviate from the average slightly less \u2014 and the average is mostly the same.\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average of polls between Sept. 1 and 29 of last year, 39 percent of Americans approved of the healthcare law, and 52 percent disapproved.\nAll data via RCP:Though polling is less plentiful a year later, the clusters of data are largely similar.\nAccording to a year-over-year average, those numbers now stand at 41 percent approve and 51 percent disapprove.\nObamacare debuted to mixed-to-negative reviews last October 1, with less than 40 percent of Americans signaling their approval in the run-up to the rollout."}
