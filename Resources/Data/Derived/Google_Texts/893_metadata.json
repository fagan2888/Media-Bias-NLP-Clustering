If I were that same writer seeking a name for a ludicrously West Coast, loft-style cyber-advisor with geeks laser-focused on outcoding and unseating Wall Street asset managers, I would name it FutureAdvisor, except I would discard the name because it is too literal; too stupidly obvious. If I wrote a book keeping those names and having BlackRock marry FutureAdvisor with a mouse-removes-thorn-from-lion\u2019s paw underlying premise, I\u2019d be banished forever from publishing circles. Fortunately, I write nonfiction where seeming absurdity can and does occur, sanctified by free enterprise\u2019s quasi-religious tenet that self interest guides economically wise decisions. If Obama came up with a deal like this, the Koch brothers would have Obamacare-style coronaries. We have been slow to report this story because the early analysis was unsatisfying. Millennial this, millennial that, software-as-a-service, blah, blah, blah. That stuff may not be wrong per se but it seems to miss bigger points relative to how Larry Fink, 63, CEO of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, sees the world and manages its risk and its opportunities and why he is buying the company of Bo Lu \u2014 improbably exactly half his age at 31.5 years \u2014 other than to just mess with us scribblers.\n\nBlackRock is a roll-up winner looking to stay on a roll.\n\nCobbling together bits of State Street Corp., Merrill Lynch, Quellos Group, R3 Accounting LLC and Barclays, the giant New York-based asset manager has created something truly greater than the sum of its parts \u2014 a $5 trillion asset manager with a market cap of $52 billion.\n\nAnd now, BlackRock has rolled up San Francisco-based FutureAdvisor out of petty cash. BlackRock, which earns more than $800 million per quarter, paid $152 million for the robo-advisor \u2014 or about two weeks worth of cash flow.\n\nThe deal stemmed from a 2014 personal introduction that FutureAdvisor co-founder Bo Lu gained with BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink \u2014 a fateful meeting.\n\n\u201cThe BlackRock deal is watershed moment in the robo-advisor movement,\u201d says Trizic Inc. co-founder and CEO, Brad Matthews. See: After Schwab robo launch, Trizic phones leap off the hook as Wall Street brokers and bankers come calling \u2014 and VCs write checks.\n\n\n\nBrad Matthews: The BlackRock deal is\n\nwatershed moment in the robo-advisor movement.\n\n\n\nTimely exit\n\nFutureAdvisor\u2019s decision to bail on its vision of taking the Silicon Valley express to greatness as a next-generation financial advisor comes down to simple math. The firm had $21 million of VC capital invested and a $152 million payday is a good return on that amount \u2014 especially when you consider that its asset growth had stalled out at around $650 million and it was rapidly burning through cash, according to Will Trout senior analyst at Celent LLC.\n\n\u201cThe FutureAdvisor guys did good to get out,\u201d Trout says. \u201cThey\u2019re the winners in this.\u201d See: FutureAdvisor responds to Schwab\u2019s market entry with a truly free offer and big backing from Fidelity and TD Ameritrade.\n\nThe math gets even simpler when you examine the burn rate, according to Lex Sokolin, principal of New York-based wealth manager Vanare LLC and Nest Egg Wealth Inc., a wealth management platform. See: An insider reveals turbo-contents of the In|Vest conference in New York, a summit of VCs, robo-founders and big banks.\n\n\u201cWith 50 bps in fees, it generates about $3 million in revenue (not accounting for free services and discounts),\u201d he emails. \u201cAnd it is unlikely that a standalone robo-advisor that is trying to win the market is profitable until AUM of $5 billion to $10 billion. With a staff of 50, the cost structure is probably $5 million to $10 million in compensation and other personnel expenses.\u201d\n\nInsiders say Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital drove the sale. (The shared parent of Fidelity Investments, FMR, was a big original investor). Sequoia partner Alfred Lin, former chairman of Zappos, sits on FutureAdvisor\u2019s board of directors. Lin, also on the Airbnb Inc. board and that of a host of other startups, has a reputation as a master negotiator. According to TechCrunch, Lin helped effect Zappos\u2019 later acquisition by Amazon.com Inc. for $1.2 billion. Lin also consulted with Tellme Networks Inc., a telephone services company, when it sold to Microsoft for $800 million.\n\n\n\nJon Xu provided the engineering brilliance\n\nsought by BlackRock.\n\nWhat BlackRock knows\n\nBut the interesting wrinkle here is that BlackRock might also be a big winner \u2014 even by its own as-measured-in-trillions-of-dollars reckoning.\n\n\u201cI do think BlackRock guys know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trout says.\n\nWhat \u201cBlackRock guys know\u201d is how to deliver what clients need \u2014 risk management \u2014 even if said clients think what they want is absolute return. See: How Google Love can put an RIA onto an equal marketing footing with BlackRock.\n\nIn other words, BlackRock got to its lofty perch as the world\u2019s biggest asset manager by being much more of a hedge fund manager. It has always sold asset management and risk management in bundled form through BlackRock Solutions, a 2,000-employee unit, a risk management subsidiary. See: Unfazed by its misfire, BlackRock is taking a second shot at the 401(k) market, this time with a whiter hat.\n\nThe risk of risk\n\nFutureAdvisor will be part of that unit \u2014 in a thoughtful pellet-of-uranium sort of a way, according to Steve Winks, principal of Sr. Consultant in Richmond, Va.\n\n\u201cBlackRock has cracked the code on the industry providing individualized [fiduciary] advice,\u201d he writes in an email. \u201cMutual funds can\u2019t because they can only provide generalized and very narrow investment mandates defined by prospectus. Broker-dealers can\u2019t acknowledge or support advice because they fear fiduciary liability. BlackRock solves these impediments to advisory services innovation with the acquisition of FutureAdvisor. BlackRock accomplishes this without the broker-dealer having to exercise investment acumen. And it is free for brokers to use.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s winning streak can be traced back to its long-held habit of managing its own risk as zealously as that of clients \u2014 a good example being when it bought iShares from Barclays Global in 2009 for $13.5 billion, perhaps a bargain rate given the state of the markets at that time. That was an effective straddle of the high margin but endangered the actively managed asset-management world and the smaller, lower-margin but burgeoning, passive index market. See: How BlackRock plans to grow iShares using advisors as one key.\n\n\n\nAlfred Lin negotiated the big pay\n\nday from BlackRock.\n\niShares issues\n\nBut now iShares itself faces some risk of disruption with the advance of robo-advisors that perform automated investment management. See: How BlackRock plans to grow iShares using advisors as one key.\n\nThe good news about robo-advisors for Fink is that the term is almost synonymous with distributor of exchange traded funds. BlackRock controls 38% of the ETF market. The bad news for Fink is that robo-advisors don\u2019t seem to favor iShares to the degree that classic RIAs do. RIAs appreciate the size, quantity of choices and quality of iShares, as measured by liquidity, close-tracking of benchmarks and minimized taxes. See: Mark Wiedman vows to ETF managers that BlackRock won\u2019t compete (directly) in the asset allocation game.\n\nRobo-advisors are less nuanced and more impervious to brands. They seek to build portfolios out of the cheapest materials for the plainest vanilla investors \u2014 the mass affluent. In this model, every basis point takes on a magnified importance in this hyper-commoditized arena.\n\nTwo of the top four robo-advisors \u2014 Wealthfront Inc. and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services \u2014 use Vanguard ETFs almost exclusively, part of the reason Vanguard, a late entrant to ETFs, has been gaining market share \u2014 nearing 20% \u2014 for a while. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, the robo-advisory of Charles Schwab & Co., also favors Vanguard ETFs when it\u2019s not favoring its proprietary ETFs, which tend to be even cheaper. See: Coming from behind, Vanguard is gobbling up ETF market share.\n\nNew York-based robo-advisor Betterment Inc. declined to respond to a request for information about which ETFs its algorithms gravitate toward.\n\n\n\nFutureAdvisor looks out through its loft\n\nwindow to the BlackRock side of\n\nMarket Street.\n\nEnd-client run\n\nThis is a really big problem if you believe that proximity to the end-customer implies pricing power.\n\nThat said, it seems probable that BlackRock now intends to use FutureAdvisor not for retail distribution, but rather as an internal resource and technology tool to help it better serve its RIA, brokerage and other institutional customers in their quest for investor dollars. But BlackRock\u2019s path to becoming the robo-inside of its enterprise clients may face other obstacles, according to Trizic\u2019s Matthews, whose robo-advisory technology business is aimed at banks and other large financial institutions.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to re-skin a B-to-C company [like FutureAdvisor] and turn it into a B-to-B company,\u201d he emails. \u201cIf the architecture and the technology are built for a B-to-C solution, it\u2019s virtually impossible to pivot and create a multi-tenant, enterprise SAS solution. Also, FutureAdvisor built a team to power a retail business, not an enterprise technology platform. You have to throw all of that away when you become a B-to-B company.\u201d See: How Jon Stein plans to make the most of $45 million of VC money in remaking the RIA business.\n\nTrout disagrees. \u201cBlackRock can handle it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe front-end of FutureAdvisor is what is valuable here: I\u2019m talking about digital/seamless onboarding, robust aggregation and CRM capabilities that extend to retirement assets. Remember, Wealthfront maintains 'blinders\u2019 to all assets outside its purview and so enables a 360-degree perspective on the client and holistic advice.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy black dog loved his visit\n\nto FutureAdvisor, and BlackRock executives also\n\nfell under its ethereal spell.\n\nBoth FutureAdvisor and BlackRock declined to respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhen Fink met Lu\n\nFutureAdvisor came into being as a 2010 start-up venture of two ex-Microsoft engineers, Bo Lu and Jon Xu, in the Y Combinator. The bulk of their $21 million of financing arrived only last year in a $15.5 million raise headed by Sequoia, which valued the company at $75 million at the time.\n\nBlackRock nation seemingly wasn\u2019t its destiny at the time.\n\nIn May 2014, CNBC reporter Eric Rosenbaum concluded an interview (as noted first in Trout\u2019s blog with FutureAdvisor) with Lu by asking, \u201cSo who acquires FutureAdvisor ultimately, or who do you become?\u201d\n\nReplied Lu: \u201cNo one acquires us. We become the next-generation financial advisor.\u201d\n\nFutureAdvisor became the next feather in the BlackRock cap after Fink and Lu met, which led to BlackRock executives making visits to the robo-advisor\u2019s San Francisco loft offices. Despite it being what one observer called an oil-and-water match-up, the BlackRock executives told the FutureAdvisor founders that the atmosphere reminded them of their own humble beginnings.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://riabiz.com/a/4949175858888704/why-blackrocks-purchase-of-futureadvisor-for-152-million-could-be-a-deal-of-destiny", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-02T12:52:56.542100-07:00", "author": "Brooke Southall"}, "image": "http://riabiz.com/i/6142766430027776/h", "type": "website", "title": "Why BlackRock's purchase of FutureAdvisor for $152 million could be a deal of destiny"}, "keywords": "Larry Fink, Bo Lu, Will Trout, Lex Sokolin, Alfred Lin, Steve Winks, BlackRock, Future Advisor, Celent, Vanare, Nest Egg, Sequoia Capital", "description": "One huge reason that BlackRock bought FutureAdvisor for $152 million - FutureAdvisor will nestle into BlackRock's risk management unit armed with iShares while Wealthfront and Schwab favor Vanguard ETFs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It has always sold asset management and risk management in bundled form through BlackRock Solutions, a 2,000-employee unit, a risk management subsidiary.\nBlackRock, which earns more than $800 million per quarter, paid $152 million for the robo-advisor \u2014 or about two weeks worth of cash flow.\nThe deal stemmed from a 2014 personal introduction that FutureAdvisor co-founder Bo Lu gained with BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink \u2014 a fateful meeting.\nIn other words, BlackRock got to its lofty perch as the world\u2019s biggest asset manager by being much more of a hedge fund manager.\nWhat \u201cBlackRock guys know\u201d is how to deliver what clients need \u2014 risk management \u2014 even if said clients think what they want is absolute return."}
