NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) â€” A second man has pleaded guilty to his role in the theft of more than $400 from a group of Girl Scouts selling cookies at a Massachusetts store.

Cassidy Michalski, of Deerfield, was sentenced to three years of probation after pleading guilty Wednesday to theft, assault and battery with a deadly weapon and shoplifting. The Daily Hampshire Gazette (http://bit.ly/1TQx63c ) reports that the first charge was downgraded from unarmed robbery in a plea deal.

Authorities say Michalski served as the getaway driver after Nicholas Taverna stole a cash box from the 11- and 12-year-old scouts selling cookies at a Walmart in January 2013.

Prosecutors say the men had planned to steal cellphones from the store to sell for heroin money.

Taverna received the same sentence earlier this week.
