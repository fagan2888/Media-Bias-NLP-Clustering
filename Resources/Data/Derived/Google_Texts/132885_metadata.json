Now he\u2019s showing them how it\u2019s done off the field.\n\nThe Broncos 38-year-old star quarterback capped his record-setting season by moving up three spots to No. 5 among American athletes on The Fortunate 50, the annual rankings by Sports Illustrated and Fortune of the highest-paid athletes.\n\nManning reportedly pulled in $12.5 million in endorsements from companies like Papa John\u2019s, Gatorade, DirecTV and Buick last season. Add in his $25 million salary and the surefire Hall-of-Famer took in $37.5 million last year.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nManning\u2019s total earnings put him at No. 2 among NFL players, trailing only Aaron Rodgers, who reportedly earned $45.8 million last year ($40 million in salary, $5.8 million in endorsements), thanks in part to a $35 million signing bonus.\n\nBoxer Floyd Mayweather again ranked No. 1 on the list with $105 million, thanks to his fight against Marcos Maidana in May. LeBron James ($57,067,500) and Kobe Bryant ($50,453,805) sat at No. 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nManning ranked No. 8 on the list in 2013 with a total of $31 million ($18 million in salary, $13 million in endorsements), reigning as football\u2019s biggest endorser.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aaron Rodgers,endorsements,Floyd Mayweather,Peyton Manning,Sports Illustrated", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Peyton Manning ranked No. 5 on The Fortunate 50's list of highest-paid athletes in the U.S., raking in $37.5 million last season with endorsements and salary.", "title": "Peyton Manning moves up to No. 5 on list of highest-paid athletes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/06/17/peyton-manning-moves-5-list-highest-paid-athletes/28007/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/05/peyton-manning-ota-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Peyton Manning ranked No. 5 on The Fortunate 50's list of highest-paid athletes in the U.S., raking in $37.5 million last season with endorsements and salary.", "title": "Peyton Manning moves up to No. 5 on list of highest-paid athletes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/06/17/peyton-manning-moves-5-list-highest-paid-athletes/28007/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/05/peyton-manning-ota-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Peyton Manning ranked No. 5 on The Fortunate 50's list of highest-paid athletes in the U.S., raking in $37.5 million last season with endorsements and salary."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf490\"", "article_summary": "Add in his $25 million salary and the surefire Hall-of-Famer took in $37.5 million last year.\n1 on the list with $105 million, thanks to his fight against Marcos Maidana in May.\n5 among American athletes on The Fortunate 50, the annual rankings by Sports Illustrated and Fortune of the highest-paid athletes.\n8 on the list in 2013 with a total of $31 million ($18 million in salary, $13 million in endorsements), reigning as football\u2019s biggest endorser.\nManning reportedly pulled in $12.5 million in endorsements from companies like Papa John\u2019s, Gatorade, DirecTV and Buick last season."}
