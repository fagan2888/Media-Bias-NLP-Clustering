Americans are more concerned about jobs and the economy, and besides, some recent polls show that Americans are less religious and moving to the left on social issues.\n\nThat\u2019s the conventional wisdom. But there\u2019s a problem \u2013 conventional wisdom can be, and often is, wrong.\n\nThe fact is, social issues are bound to play a role in 2016, possibly a big one \u2013 if only because most of the Republican candidates keep talking about them. The ever-expanding field includes three men who are known chiefly for their opposition to marriage equality, legal abortion and church-state separation.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson are considered second-tier candidates (maybe third-tier, actually), but even some of the GOP front-runners sound like tent evangelists these days.\n\nConsider Jeb Bush, who is announcing his candidacy today. Bush has a checkered history when it comes to church-state relations, and that\u2019s putting it charitably. I like to think of him as the nation\u2019s first \u201cfaith-based\u201d governor. As Florida\u2019s chief executive, he championed a private school voucher plan that diverted tax money to mainly religious schools. (The Florida Supreme Court invalidated the program, but it is being exported to other states. Nevada adopted a version of it recently.)\n\nBush established \u201cfaith-based\u201d prisons in the state and went so far as to sponsor a school reading project centered on the Chronicles of Narnia, a Christian allegory. He also rammed special legislation though the statehouse that made it possible for Domino\u2019s Pizza magnate Thomas Monaghan to create his own \u201cCatholic\u201d town called Ave Maria.\n\nBush\u2019s intervention in the Terri Schiavo case is well known, but his vociferous opposition to legal abortion has attracted less attention. Bush once described himself as \u201cprobably the most pro-life governor in modern times\u201d and on several occasions intervened to prevent minors or incapacitated women from obtaining abortions. As governor, he signed legislation outlawing certain types of abortions; he has now thrown his support behind a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks. He has praised efforts to curtail Americans\u2019 access to birth control and criticized the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd let\u2019s look at Scott Walker. The Wisconsin governor -- techincally not a candidate yet, but he sure sounds like one -- for many years was more interested in busting unions than pushing religion. (Although, as a member of the legislature, Walker did throw a holy fit when a prison hired a Wiccan priestess as chaplain.) Suddenly Walker is saying he\u2019s not sure President Barack Obama is a Christian, refusing to say if he accepts the reality of evolution and calling for strict anti-abortion laws.\n\nHere\u2019s another reason social issues will loom large for at least some of the campaign: marriage equality. In a matter of weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court will hand down a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case that may extend same-sex marriage nationwide. Some states, chiefly Indiana, North Carolina and Michigan, are already passing legislation designed to blunt the effects of this ruling by making it harder for gay couples to get married, adopt children and so on.\n\nThe Obergefell decision will lead to a new round of battles. Some states will seek to pass legislation granting the owners of for-profit business (such as florists, bakers, photographers, caterers, etc.) the right to refuse service to same-sex couples under the guise of \u201creligious freedom.\u201d Some will even try to extend this \u201cright\u201d to government officials, such as magistrates and licensing clerks.\n\nGOP candidates will be forced to take a stand on these bills. Most will be happy to endorse them because that gives them an opportunity to shore up conservative bona fides with some of that old-fashioned gay bashing. (Walker has already endorsed a constitutional amendment to overturn a ruling that hasn\u2019t come down yet.) Some unannounced candidates \u2013 I\u2019m talking to you, Bobby Jindal \u2013 have been riding the anti-LGBT wave for months.\n\nThere\u2019s one more reason why social issues aren\u2019t going away quietly: The Religious Right doesn\u2019t want them to \u2013 and the Religious Right is too powerful a force in the GOP to be ignored.\n\nReligious Right organizations have already sponsored several \u201cbeauty pageants\u201d to size up the candidates. More are on the way this summer and fall. Although I strongly disagree with the agenda of the Religious Right, I acknowledge that the movement\u2019s voters are often a force to be reckoned with come Election Day because they tend to turn out.\n\nSimply put, issues like marriage equality, abortion, the role of religion in public schools and yes, even what pronoun to use when referring to Caitlyn Jenner matter to these voters. GOP aspirants can\u2019t dodge them \u2013 and many don\u2019t want to.\n\nPolls do indicate that the long-term prognosis for the Religious Right is not good. Its core constituency is aging; millennials, even self-identified Republican ones, are openly accepting of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. In addition, interest in institutionalized religion is waning in America. (But don\u2019t confuse this with a lack of interest in religion generally; Americans remain a spiritual people.) As fundamentalist churches lose members, they will be less effective as units for political organizing.\n\nThe long-term demographics are interesting but none of this is going to play out so quickly that it upsets the political applecart next year. What will matter is turnout and what type of coalition each party\u2019s standard-bearer can cobble together. A candidate doesn\u2019t necessarily win because lots of people agree with him or her; a candidate wins because the people who agree with him or her take the time to go to the polls.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls know this \u2013 and they know what types of messages will engage their base of so-called \u201cvalues voters.\u201d Most Americans don\u2019t want a campaign focused on social issues. But a close election that hinges on turning out base voters may create a perfect storm where the \u201cculture wars\u201d become powerful enough to push other issues out of the picture.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcead4\"", "article_summary": "Conventional wisdom holds that social issues won\u2019t have much impact on the 2016 presidential election.\nThere\u2019s one more reason why social issues aren\u2019t going away quietly: The Religious Right doesn\u2019t want them to \u2013 and the Religious Right is too powerful a force in the GOP to be ignored.\nHere\u2019s another reason social issues will loom large for at least some of the campaign: marriage equality.\nThe fact is, social issues are bound to play a role in 2016, possibly a big one \u2013 if only because most of the Republican candidates keep talking about them.\nPolls do indicate that the long-term prognosis for the Religious Right is not good."}
