She agreed to do it.\n\nNow, Rath is running for Congress, taking on longtime U.S. Rep. Robert Brady, D-1, of Philadelphia.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s so random,\u0094 Rath said last month. \u0093This wasn\u0092t my dream job. This wasn\u0092t on the bucket list, but now it is.\u0094\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from her role as the minority inspector of elections, Rath does not have a history in politics.\n\nShe serves as a sales consultant for Biomet, which manufactures medical devices. The job requires her to spend a couple days each week in the operating room, where she recommends various medical devices to some of the area\u0092s leading surgeons.\n\nA Connecticut native, Rath earned an economics degree at Penn State University. Following graduation, Rath worked in a management position for Pepsi before moving to Philadelphia 10 years ago.\n\nRath said she decided to run, in part, due to feeling frustrated by the use of federal tax dollars. She noted that more than half of the district\u0092s residents make less than $50,000 and that the district\u0092s unemployment rate of 15.4 percent is more than double national rate.\n\n\u0093My question to Brady is what have you really done to help people?\u0094 Rath said.\n\nBrady acknowledged the substantial amount of poor residents living within the district, but said he has consistently tried to better their lives.\n\n\u0093We\u0092ve been working on it, doing everything we can do,\u0094 Brady said.\n\nBrady said he has pushed for extended unemployment benefits and an increase in the federal minimum wage. He noted his support of the Affordable Care Act and pointed to funding he brought back for fire and police departments.\n\nBrady also noted he had a large role in saving the refineries in Philadelphia and Marcus Hook.\n\n\u0093I did that without any publicity,\u0094 Brady said. \u0093I kept it quiet until we made the announcement. I had to work tirelessly behind the scenes to get that done.\u0094\n\nRath seeks to reform the health care system, saying the individual mandates created by the ACA are hurtful to small businesses and caused many to lose their health coverage.\n\nShe said endlessly pouring money into public education may not be the best solution to improving failing public schools. Instead, she supports both charter schools and school vouchers.\n\nYet, Rath does not embody the stereotypical establishment Republican.\n\nShe seeks to improve the Philadelphia region\u0092s energy efficiency, saying it is critical to the region\u0092s future.\n\nRath also wants to amend \u0097 not repeal \u0097 the ACA, saying the medical device tax needs to go. She supports an annual increase to the minimum wage, arguing a yearly index is the fairest way to prepare businesses and assist workers. She is pro-choice, though she personally opposes abortion.\n\nAlso, in a party that is viewed by detractors as being too old, white and male, Rath is an urban Millennial woman who supports Congressional term limits.\n\n\u0093The idea is go in, have an impact, and leave,\u0094 Rath said.\n\nRath recognizes the difficulties in unseating Brady, who not only is among the city\u0092s most prominent Democrats, but also serves a district that heavily leans Democratic.\n\nBrady, a nine-term incumbent, had $695,640 in his campaign coffers at the conclusion of the first quarter.\n\nRath, who declared her candidacy late, did not report any campaign contributions during the first quarter. Joseph McColgan, Rath\u0092s campaign manager, insisted she will be well-funded.\n\n\u0093We will have enough money to be competitive,\u0094 said McColgan, who unsuccessfully ran for City Council in 2011. \u0093There\u0092s no doubt about that.\u0094\n\nRath has been the underdog in the past. As a walk-on to the Penn State lacrosse team, she said gaining the courage to rise to a challenge is the hardest part.\n\nWhen walking to her first lacrosse practice, Rath recalled, she nearly turned back to her dorm room out of fear.\n\n\u0093The idea is you\u0092ve got to keep walking \u0097 you\u0092ve got to make it to the field,\u0094 Rath said. \u0093Once you get to the field, you give it what you\u0092ve got. How much different would my life had turned out if I had not walked to the field?\u0094", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Elections, Elections news, Primos Elections news, PA Elections news, US Elections news, world Elections news.", "title": "Newcomer Republican from Philly to challenge Rep.
