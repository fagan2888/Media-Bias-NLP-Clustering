Sen. Ted Cruz (R- Texas) has been blasted by the mainstream media since his presidential campaign announcement Monday, but if he expected an easier interview from Fox News, he didn’t find it on “The Kelly File.”

Megyn Kelly kicked things off by pointing out the similarities between Cruz and President Obama and saying that some critics have said that they tried the senator-turned-president thing to not much success.

“There are marked differences between my background and Barack Obama’s. We’re both first term senators. We both went to Harvard. But there are marked differences. In his time in the Senate, he was basically a backbencher. He did not lead on any issues of real significance,” Cruz replied.

“In my time in the Senate, there are a lot of faults I have, but nobody would accuse me of being a backbencher. What I try to do is lead on the great challenges of the day, whether it’s stopping Obamacare or stopping the out of control debt or stopping executive amnesty or defending our Constitutional rights or standing with Israel or stopping Iran from getting nuclear weapons.”

“Yes, you’ve led the fight on certain issues, but what have you actually accomplished?” Kelly interjected.

Cruz said that his main accomplishment has been “stopping bad things from happening,” specifically noting how he helped put a stop to Obama’s proposals on gun control reform after Newtown.
