Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Our long national funk isn't over.\n\nThe stock market has been booming and jobs growing, but Americans are facing the new year with the most downcast expectations in nearly a quarter-century \u2014 a disconnect that reflects prosperity's limited reach and assessments that Washington's dysfunction isn't going to get better any time soon.\n\nAn end-of-the-year USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll finds an overwhelming 71% of those surveyed are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today. Just 49% predict 2015 will be better \u2014 the first time since 1990 that optimism for the year ahead has dipped below 50%.\n\nThose attitudes have fueled developments as disparate as the rise of the Tea Party movement and coast-to-coast protests over the police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., says Matthew Dowd, a strategist for George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. \"There's a general sense of anger and frustration that nothing seems to change,\" he says. \"They don't trust that anybody has their back.\"\n\nPessimism persists even though voters in last month's elections shook up who's in charge \u2014 Republicans will take control of the Senate as well as the House next month \u2014 and despite evidence that the economic recovery is on a stronger footing. In the past, those factors might have sparked a more upbeat public mood.\n\nNot this time.\n\nFor one thing, the improving economy hasn't boosted everybody. While the jobless rate has declined to 5.8%, many people have given up looking for work and others are underemployed. A record-breaking stock market mostly helps those who own stocks.\n\nFor another, dismay over governmental gridlock may be dampening the impact of good news \u2014 a case of politics trumping pocketbooks.\n\nIn the poll, 81% say the country is more politically divided these days than in the past, the highest percentage in a decade. Seventy-seven percent predict that situation isn't going to get better over the next five years. More than a third expect it to get worse.\n\nThe nationwide telephone survey of 1,507 adults, taken Dec. 3-7, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nThe public's dyspeptic mood complicates the political landscape for the 2016 presidential race, which is poised to begin in earnest early next year.\n\n\"Voters' lack of confidence in the political system goes beyond their disgust with what they see as mindless partisanship,\" says Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin, a strategist for Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. \"They also think the system is largely controlled by wealthy special interests that only look out for themselves. This feeling of mistrust extends to the economic system itself, which a large majority believe works for the wealthy rather than for all Americans.\"\n\nSeventy-six percent of poll respondents predict that President Obama and Republican leaders in Congress won't make significant progress in fixing the problem is that worries them most. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nWHAT'S WRONG?\n\nAsk Americans to name the biggest problem facing the country and the state of the economy tops the list, cited by 14%, while 10% cite unemployment. Concern about immigration was cited by 12%. Unhappiness with government is cited by 10%.\n\nNo other issue breaks into double digits. Concern about the deficit and crime has declined from 2012. Just 1% name morality or global warming. As the two-year anniversary of the devastating Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting approaches, the percentage who mention gun control has dropped from 8% in 2012 to less than 1% now.\n\nWhatever their concern, more than three of four respondents predict that Obama and Republican leaders in Congress won't make significant progress during the next year in fixing whatever the problem is that worries them most.\n\nWhile Republicans scored big gains last month in congressional and gubernatorial elections from Massachusetts to Colorado, views of the GOP haven't improved. Instead, they've soured a bit since before the midterms. Even in victory, the party's favorable-unfavorable rating is now underwater by 20 percentage points, 37%-57%.\n\nRepublicans won not because voters were convinced they had the answers but because \"patience ran out\" for Obama and Democratic policies to work, says David Winston, a pollster who advises the House Republican leadership, among others. That gives the GOP no more than an opportunity to win them over.\n\n\"What Republicans need to realize, this wasn't a mandate for any particular policy,\" Winston says. \"People are saying, 'Let's hear your ideas.' This is not a done deal.\"\n\nViews of the Democratic Party are only a stitch better: 41% favorable-54% unfavorable.\n\nAnd views of Congress just keep sinking: 22% favorable, 71% unfavorable.\n\nPresident Obama's overall approval rating seems stuck at a tepid 42% in part because it's problematic for him to take credit for good economic news when so many Americans believe the country fundamentally has gotten off on the wrong track. In the survey, those who \"very strongly\" approve of the job he's doing hits a new low of 24%; those who \"very strongly\" disapprove hits a new high of 40%.\n\nOn seven of eight specific issues, from handling immigration to terrorism, Obama's disapproval rating is higher than his approval rating. (On energy policy, it's tied, at 41%-41%.)\n\nIn his farewell speech this week, Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor said, \u201cPeople all around our nation look at Washington and they shake their heads. \u2026 The political environment today grinds the trust and confidence out of our system.\u201d (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nNOT-SO-GREAT EXPECTATIONS\n\nAmericans are braced for more stalemate over the next two years.\n\nA 54% majority predict Obama won't offer Republican congressional leaders much cooperation. Even more, 70%, say Republican congressional leaders won't cooperate much with the White House.\n\nThose expectations are more negative than they were in 2006, when the midterm elections in the sixth year of president George W. Bush's tenure delivered Senate control to the opposition party.\n\nHow much does it matter? Voters who are divided on issues from Obamacare to the battle against the Islamic State agree that the failure of Republicans and Democrats to work together is damaging the nation; 71% say it's hurting \"a lot.\" Most see an impact even in their personal lives.\n\nOn these questions, there is almost no partisan divide.\n\n\"This is an area where the American people are way ahead of Washington,\" Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, a Democrat who lost his bid for a third term, said this week in a farewell speech on the Senate floor. \"People all around our nation look at Washington and they shake their heads. ...The political environment today grinds the trust and confidence out of our system. Let me tell you, that is not good for anybody.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Diuun4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Our long national funk isn't over.
