Mitchell Etess, Mohegan Sun\u2019s chief executive officer, Mohegan Gaming Authority, said the authority has purchased one-half of the team, which is being moved to Connecticut to play at the Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\n\u201cIt is a very exciting day for us,\u201d Etess said. The team has not yet been renamed.\n\nMohegan Chairman Kevin Red Eagle Brown said he was a huge sports fan, and added, \u201cWe are bringing home to roost a sport that began right here in this region. Going centuries back, it was a sport that was used to train and prepare young warriors either to go to war, or to return from war. It was a way for the community to reach out and embrace them, and it helped the warriors strike a balance with a sharpness of mind to prepare them for what lay ahead.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Mohegan Sun Likely to Bring Creator's Game Pro Team to Tribal Land\n\nBrown said the game created a bond between the team and the community and expects that will happen once again. \u201cHere at Mohegan Sun, excitement is what we do, and if we can put this traditional sport in this venue and have our community take part, I am excited about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the second sports team purchase for the Mohegan Sun; the Connecticut Sun is a Women\u2019s Basketball League, and for the last twelve years, CEO Etess has overseen team operations on behalf of the tribe.\n\nBrad Brewster, one of the team's owners, reported that four of the top 25 lacrosse teams across the country come from Connecticut, more than any other state except New York.\n\nNational Lacrosse League games average 9,500 fans per game, said NLL commissioner, George Daniel. The sport is considered the fastest growing sport in the country, and lacrosse is the third highest professional indoor sports in attendance, behind the National Basketball League and the National Football League, he added.\n\nThere are currently nine franchises, and this franchise will play in the eastern division against Minnesota, Buffalo, Rochester, Toronto, and in the western division, with Edmonton, Calvary, Vancouver and Colorado. The home games will run at Mohegan Sun from December to May.\n\nThe investment in the team, reported by the Hartford Courant, is $1.5 million, with players earning approximately $20,000 annually.\n\nKevin Brown, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Nation, said that the tribe\u2019s involvement will be identical to any Mohegan Sun business venture. \u201cWe are the management board of all things Mohegan.\u201d\n\nThe Philadelphia Wings team started 27 years ago. President Michael French said the team was sad about relocating and leaving friends behind, but added, \u201cWe are thrilled and excited to actually be in a partnership with the Mohegan Sun and tribe. We think this is an extremely healthy market, we have a great nucleus and a great team that wanted to stay together, that wanted to play together. We didn\u2019t know about relocating, but now that we have seen the venue and made friends with our new partners, it is going to be a great new opportunity for us to get more of the Championship rings that we earned back in Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nFrench once played for the team, and grew up in Canada, where some of his best friends and lacrosse teammates were Native. He added, \u201cThis the Creator\u2019s game, a Native American game, and it is going to bring us closer to that. We can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chairman Brown, lacrosse is a very popular sport on the reservation and surrounding areas. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive around here on the weekends without seeing a kid with a Lacrosse stick.\u201d Brown said, \u201cI think this can drive another opportunity for families throughout the area to spend some time with their kids at this great facility,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMontville High just started a lacrosse team, so for the young people, they are on the cusp of something really blowing up,\u201d Mohegan tribal member Bill Donehey said. \u201cNow they have something real close by, especially right here in Connecticut. It's going to do nothing but improve the high school team. They are going to go to the meet and greets and meet professionals, and I just think it\u2019s exciting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As part of its ongoing push for portfolio diversification, the Mohegan Tribal Nation announced the p", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/10/buying-lacrosse-team-mohegans-latest-gamble-156301", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/mohegan_lacrosse.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Buying a Lacrosse Team Is Mohegan's Latest Gamble"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/10/buying-lacrosse-team-mohegans-latest-gamble-156301", "dc": {"title": "Buying a Lacrosse Team Is Mohegan's Latest Gamble"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-10T07:30-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Buying a Lacrosse Team Is Mohegan's Latest Gamble"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc990d\"", "article_summary": "As part of its ongoing push for portfolio diversification, the Mohegan Tribal Nation announced the purchase of the Philadelphia Wings Lacrosse Team on Thursday, August 6.\n\u201cMontville High just started a lacrosse team, so for the young people, they are on the cusp of something really blowing up,\u201d Mohegan tribal member Bill Donehey said.\nWe think this is an extremely healthy market, we have a great nucleus and a great team that wanted to stay together, that wanted to play together.\nKevin Brown, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Nation, said that the tribe\u2019s involvement will be identical to any Mohegan Sun business venture.\nNational Lacrosse League games average 9,500 fans per game, said NLL commissioner, George Daniel."}
