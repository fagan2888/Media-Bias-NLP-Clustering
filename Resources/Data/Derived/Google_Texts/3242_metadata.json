Five days later, a woman walked backstage unchecked at a gala dinner where Obama was a featured guest. Months after that, two people strolled unnoticed past a Secret Service checkpoint into the first layer of the White House grounds.\n\nThe incidents were among a half-dozen previously undisclosed security breaches since 2013 that were detailed in an extensive, bipartisan congressional investigation of the inner workings of the Secret Service.\n\nIn a critical report to be released publicly Thursday, House investigators describe the once-elite force as an \u201cagency in crisis\u201d that has failed to fix many of the deeply ingrained problems exposed last year amid a string of humiliating security lapses, according to a copy of the report obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nRelated: Average Secret Service Agent Had Just 25 Minutes of Training in 2013\n\nThe report offers detailed assessments of the failings of the Secret Service during several well-publicized security incidents, including the agency\u2019s halting response to a 2011 shooting at the White House and an incident last year in which an armed man with an arrest record was able to board an elevator with Obama.\n\nMore broadly, the report assessed the Secret Service as an agency that remains deeply troubled, despite recent attempts at reform. It concludes that the service has a \u201cstaffing crisis,\u201d with fewer personnel today than in 2014, when an administration panel recommended adding 280 new staff members and Director Joseph P. Clancy took over vowing to enact the reforms.\n\n\u201cThe agency\u2019s recent public failures are not a series of isolated events, but the product of an insular culture that has historically been resistant to change,\u201d states the report, compiled by the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nThe staffing decline, which includes the uniformed-officer division that guards the White House, is \u201cperhaps the greatest threat\u201d to the Secret Service, the report says. Among other factors, the report points to past budget cuts and \u201csystemic mismanagement\u201d by the agency.\n\nAlthough Clancy assured lawmakers earlier this year that there were \u201cno greater priorities\u201d for him than hiring the right number of staff, the agency\u2019s roster has dropped from 6,367 full-time employees at the end of September 2014 to 6,315 one year later \u2014 its lowest point in a decade.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Finds New Excuses for Its Incompetence\n\nMorale is \u201ccritically low,\u201d contributing to a drop in personnel through attrition. The report also blames the decline on \u201csystemic mismanagement\u201d and an inefficient hiring process that hampers recruitment of high-caliber staff.\n\n\u201cThe high attrition rate means that the personnel who remain are significantly overworked, and morale is at an all-time low,\u201d the report says. The report also warns that the agency\u2019s new hiring system \u201coverburdens USSS with low quality applicants.\u201d\n\nThe report also warns that Obama and 2016 presidential candidates face heightened danger if the administration does not swiftly fix the agency\u2019s problems.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight Committee, said the report should spur further action by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe situation is getting worse not better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president is in jeopardy, and he better personally get involved in fixing this.\u201d\n\nRelated: Secret Service Cited Again for Embarrassing Lapse\n\n\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, said that he supported the report\u2019s findings but that it \u201cmay not be exactly how I would have written it.\u201d\n\nCummings said he, too, is deeply concerned about the safety of the president and the first family and worries there is a cultural problem at the agency.\n\nCummings said Congress shares some blame for making some of the biggest funding cuts in agency history in 2011.\n\nA Secret Service spokesman said the agency received the report late Wednesday and would not comment until officials had time to review the full findings.\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service recognizes that the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is legislatively mandated to exact oversight on the Secret Service,\u201d said spokesman David Iacovetti. \u201cWe are reviewing the report at this time and will carefully assess any recommendations made by the committee.\u201d\n\nThe investigative report is highly critical of the Secret Service\u2019s management, saying its nature is to cover up problems and punish those who flag concerns. While Clancy has promised to encourage staff to come forward with their complaints, the report says he and his team have largely failed to set a new tone.\n\nThe agency \u201ccannot repair itself without first restoring the trust of its employees and increasing personnel dramatically,\u201d the report states. \u201cWhether from missteps at the executive level or at the field office supervisor level, it is clear many of the rank-and-file have lost confidence in USSS\u2019s current leadership.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s probe uncovered a number of previously unreported breaches \u2014 including several that occurred about the time last fall that the agency was already under fire for its mistakes.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Officer Arrested In Child Sexting Sting\n\nThe most dramatic finding involved new details surrounding an incident at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s awards dinner in Washington on Sept. 27, 2014, in which a man gained entry by posing as Rep. Donald Payne Jr. (D-N.J.). The man got backstage past a distracted Secret Service staffer and then was escorted to meet and talk with Obama. The impersonator\u2019s entry to the event was reported at the time but not that he got so close to the president.\n\nThat incident came just days after a knife-wielding fence jumper had been able to race into the East Room of the White House. And it followed another high-profile breach, when an armed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contractor with an arrest record was able to step onto an elevator and stand within arm\u2019s reach of Obama.\n\nThe new investigation also found that in October 2014, a day after Julia Pierson resigned under fire as director, a woman got backstage at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s gala being attended by the president.\n\nSeven days later, the House inquiry found, an employee was allowed to enter a Los Angeles hotel where Obama and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett were staying without being properly screened for weapons or having his bag checked.\n\nOther previously unreported episodes affected other officials.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Head Resigns After Multiple Lapses of President\u2019s Security\n\nIn April 2013, four people went fishing on a small lake in the back yard of Vice President Biden\u2019s Delaware home and were not discovered until neighbors called the Secret Service to report the security breach. The alarm system at Biden\u2019s home had been failing for some time.\n\nIn spring 2014, a Czech citizen with an expired visa entered the property of former president George H.W. Bush and stayed for an hour without being detected.\n\nThe report blasted Secret Service officials in several instances for failing to examine its own mistakes and asserted that Clancy and some of his predecessors had provided Congress with information that was false and misleading about the extent of problems.\n\nThe report said Clancy gave inaccurate information about the incident involving the man on the elevator with Obama when he said no other armed security contractors came within close proximity to the president. But an internal review of the breach suggested that there were several unscreened and armed guards in the area.\n\nThe report noted that after the Secret Service took four days to discover that bullets from the November 2011 shooting had struck the White House residence, the agency\u2019s inspection team did not immediately open a file on the case. The division instead opened a file in October 2014, only after a Post report the previous month detailed the agency\u2019s handling of the incident, the report says.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Blows Another Security Assignment\n\nCongressional investigators criticized testimony from former Secret Service director Mark Sullivan after the April 2012 scandal in which 13 agents were implicated in bringing prostitutes back to their hotel before the president\u2019s arrival in Colombia.\n\nSullivan, appearing about a month after the episode, assured lawmakers that the behavior of the agents and officers involved did not point to a larger cultural problem in which such behavior was tolerated by managers. But the investigation found that several agency employees had previously acknowledged to Secret Service investigators that they had engaged in similar misconduct elsewhere, including having had sex with foreign nationals in Italy, Russia, Ireland and New York City.\n\nSullivan could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe report cited a number of colorful e-mail exchanges between Secret Service staff suggesting that arranging liaisons with prostitutes was a widely known and accepted practice. Before the Colombia trip, one senior supervisor e-mailed 54 employees, cracking that the motto of the trip was \u201cUna Mas Cerveza Por Favor,\u201d Spanish for \u201cone more beer, please.\u201d In another note, an agent wrote to a colleague, \u201cSwagg \u00adcologne-check/Pimp gear-check/Swagg sunglasses-check/Cash for dem hoes-check.\u201d\n\nThe report said that the openness of the communication indicates that the Secret Service employees \u201cdid not believe their misconduct would be punished.\u201d\n\nThe report said Clancy could move the agency forward but is hampered by being a 27-year veteran of the Service.\n\n\u201cThe Committee believed \u2014 and still does \u2014 that new senior leadership from outside the agency would be best positioned to enact the reforms that the agency desperately needs,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cUSSS leadership needs to honestly acknowledge the problems plaguing the agency . . . because only then can the agency truly set about moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nRosalind S.
