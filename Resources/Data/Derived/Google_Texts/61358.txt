Sioux Falls, SD

South Dakota drivers can expect to pay more at the pump this weekend.

Overall, the state average has reached $2.07 a gallon. Average prices across the state are over $2 for the first time in 21 days.

According to AAA, Watertown and Yankton are seeing the highest gasoline prices per gallon, at $2.25 and $2.21 respectively. Sioux Falls drives should see prices near $2.13 per gallon, and Rapid City average prices are still below $2.

AAA said rebounding oil prices and a reduction in refinery output during conversion to summer-grade fuels are to blame. The market also faces uncertainty during a 5,200-member-strong strike at refineries and chemical plants.
