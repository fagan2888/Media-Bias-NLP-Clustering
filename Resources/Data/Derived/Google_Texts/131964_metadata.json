The puck that came sliding down the ice from beyond the red line somehow went between his legs and nestled in the net behind him.\n\nMany of the Washington Capitals fans who didn\u2019t even see the puck go in started taunting him with chants of, \u201cMa-son, Ma-son.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing Mason could do but wonder after his \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d blunder handed the Capitals a 4-1 win Saturday night in Game 2 and a 2-0 lead in the first-round playoff series.\n\n\u201cCan say it over and over again, \u2018It\u2019s a bad goal,\u2019\u201d said Mason, his face flush after about as embarrassing a miscue as an NHL goaltender can make. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t good. My fault, obviously. Put the team in a tough position after that. Just a bad goal.\u201d\n\nJason Chimera got credit for the goal, the game-winner, on a 101-foot tip-in on a play that would have been icing had it not gone on net.\n\nCoupled with power-play goals by Alex Ovechkin and John Carlson, an even-strength insurance goal by Nicklas Backstrom and 41 saves from Braden Holtby, the Capitals are in control of the series.\n\nA 5-on-3 penalty kill and several notable saves by Holtby made Washington players feel better than Mason\u2019s gaffe did. Ovechkin said the Capitals will \u201ctake it,\u201d though Holtby felt awful as a fellow goalie.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even watch the replay of it,\u201d said Holtby, who made 19 first-period saves to match his total from Game 1. \u201cEven as an opposing team, you want to earn your goals and whatnot (instead of) weird bounces like that. I feel for him.\u201d\n\nIt was 1-0 early in the second period when Mason did a split to stop Carlson from scoring his second goal of the game and third of the series. Mason was slow to get up and remained in the game, but less than a minute later made the mistake that will be shown on bad-goal blooper reels for decades.\n\nAfter defenseman Karl Alzner backhanded the puck from his goal line, Chimera tipped it from the Capitals\u2019 side of the red line. It slid five-hole on Mason, who thought about directing the puck into the corner but simply whiffed.\n\n\u201cBecause it was spinning so much, it kind of started redirecting in front so he had no chance to play it,\u201d Alzner said. \u201cUnfortunate for him, it went in the net.\u201d\n\nOvechkin, who set a physical tone with big hits on Michael Raffl and Brayden Schenn and later scored his 37th career Stanley Cup playoff goal, hadn\u2019t seen anything like Chimera\u2019s fluke goal since his childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little kid, Andrei Markov scored a goal from behind the net,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cSometimes that kind of stuff happens.\u201d\n\nTeammate Ryan White skated over to console Mason, who was phenomenal in Game 1 and one of the biggest reasons the Flyers even made the playoffs. Mason, who stopped 19 of 23 shots but not the one from Chimera that no one will soon forget, appreciated the support.\n\n\u201cJust let him know we have his back and that\u2019s about it,\u201d forward Wayne Simmonds said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to play well for us, and we have no doubts about that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Holtby continues to play at an elite level. After tying Martin Brodeur\u2019s single-season wins record, Holtby has stopped 60 of 61 shots so far in the first round to boost his NHL-best career playoff save percentage to .938.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s making saves all over the place and sometimes you\u2019re just shocked when he gets to stop the puck,\u201d said Capitals forward Marcus Johansson, who had two assists. \u201cHe wins games every week and he\u2019s done it all year. He was a huge part in this one.\u201d\n\nHoltby was the best player on the ice for 5-on-3 and 4-on-3 penalty kills as Washington improved to 7 for 7 when down a man or more. The power play is 3 for 8 thanks to goals by Carlson and Ovechkin after finishing the regular season 0 for 12 and going 3 for 28 in the 2015 playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe learned a lot from last year,\u201d coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cThe adjustments we\u2019ve made \u2026 have been really, really smart.\u201d\n\nThe Flyers will need to make plenty of adjustments as the series shifts to Philadelphia for Game 3 Monday. Jakub Voracek scored their only goal of the series during 4-on-4 play in the second period, but the Flyers came up empty where it mattered after outshooting the Capitals 42-23.\n\n\u201cNot a pretty one, but we\u2019ll take it,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s done, we\u2019ll move forward and Game 3 ahead.\u201d\n\nNOTES: F Scott Laughton entered the Flyers\u2019 lineup in place of Sean Couturier, out for the series with an apparent left shoulder injury. \u2026 Carlson became the first Capitals defenseman with power-play goals in consecutive playoff games since Al Iafrate in 1993. \u2026 With 71 playoff points, Ovechkin is one shy of tying Dale Hunter for first on the franchise\u2019s career list.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Steve Mason craned his neck toward the ceiling in utter dismay.
