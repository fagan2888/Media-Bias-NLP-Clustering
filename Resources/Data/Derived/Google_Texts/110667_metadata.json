Williamson had previously served as state health officer since 1992, and he\u2019s also chair of the Alabama Medicaid Transition Task Force.\n\n\u201cThis is so hard for me,\u201d Williamson said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve done almost 20 years in this job. It was the hardest thing.\u201d\n\nFor the past several years, the doctor has held two of the largest jobs in state government and worked to transition the state\u2019s Medicaid program to managed care in a state that consistently struggles to fund Medicaid.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s announcement comes at a time when Medicaid could face a large funding cut to fix the Alabama\u2019s General Fund woes.\n\nThe Alabama Hospital Association is one of the state\u2019s most fervent proponents of expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare. Dr. Williamson will not be able to lobby DPH for two years after his departure.\n\nGovernor Robert Bentley (R-AL) thanked Williamson for his work and wished him the best at his new position in a press release. However, Williamson will be sticking around until he assumes his Hospital Association role to ensure a smooth transition for Medicaid changes.\n\n\u201cWe still have challenges to address at Medicaid, including agency funding and full implementation of the regional care organizations.\u201d The Governor wrote. \u201cI know as Dr. Williamson transitions out of his role as Chair of the Medicaid Transition Task Force, he will work closely with Acting Medicaid Commissioner Stephanie Azar on a smooth transition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The current head of the Department of Public Health will be leaving his position to assume the presidency of the state hospital association in Nov.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 Dr. Don Williamson, longtime head of the Alabama Department of Public Health, announced on Wednesday that he will be leaving his current office to become the president[...]", "title": "Longtime Alabama state health officer leaving to head hospital association - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1107, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/YH-Don-Williamson.png", "height": 552}, "updated_time": "2015-08-06T14:58:00-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/alabamas-longtime-state-health-officer-leaving-to-head-hospital-association/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Robert Bentley", "published_time": "2015-08-05T16:06:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T14:58:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2982\"", "article_summary": "The Alabama Hospital Association says Williamson will take over as president of the private organization sometime this November.\nWilliamson had previously served as state health officer since 1992, and he\u2019s also chair of the Alabama Medicaid Transition Task Force.\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 Dr. Don Williamson, longtime head of the Alabama Department of Public Health, announced on Wednesday that he will be leaving his current office to become the president of the Alabama Hospital Association.\nThe Alabama Hospital Association is one of the state\u2019s most fervent proponents of expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare.\nHowever, Williamson will be sticking around until he assumes his Hospital Association role to ensure a smooth transition for Medicaid changes."}
