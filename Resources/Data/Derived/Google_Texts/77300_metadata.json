Ted Cruz (R-TX), former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, conservative talk radio host and intellectual Mark Levin, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak, who has been one of the leading intellectuals on blocking the Iran deal and was the first to propose that the states can lead the charge to block it, Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson, Center for Security Policy\u2019s Frank Gaffney, Breitbart\u2019s Sonnie Johnson, Citizen United\u2019s David Bossie, Glenn Beck, and some of the leading conservative Representatives in Congress will rally against the Iran Deal on Capitol Hill. The Tea Party Patriots and the Center for Security Policy are organizing the Wednesday afternoon event.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nJenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots told Breitbart News before the event, \u201cWe\u2019re excited we\u2019re going to be able to let Congress know the majority of Americans think this Iran deal is bad for America. We hope that Congress, especially the senators who have come out in favor of the deal, will vote to put America and America\u2019s security above party loyalty.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News will provide live updates of the speeches and the Stop Iran rally throughout the afternoon below.\n\nJenny Beth Martin reminds the crowd that \u201cCongressman Louie Gohmert told you today that they already delayed the vote on the rule because of you being there.\u201d She said Reps. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Mike Kelly (R-PA) have said that \u201cit\u2019s up to you as to what\u2019s going to happen inside the halls of Congress over the next few days\u201d\n\nShe urges the crowd to \u201ckeep up the work and know that you are making a difference.\u201d She asks the crowd to encourage those\u2013whether they are Republicans or Democrats\u2013who are doing the right thing by putting America and America\u2019s national security first and thank them.\n\nShe says to remind those who support the agreement that you are their constituent and they must stop the deal.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the sanctions lifted. We do not want to fund terrorism,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we do not want to see a nuclear-armed Iran and a certainly not a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nRep. Richard Hudson (R-NC):\n\n\u201cNot since 2000 years before the birth of Christ when the King of Troy accepted the gift of a wooden horse and brought it into a city has a leader made more tragic a mistake on behalf of their people than this Iran Deal\u201d\n\nBreitbart\u2019s Sonnie Johnson: Voters Will Come for Dems Who Support Iran Deal in \u201916\n\nShe notes that the first time she rallied with the Tea Party on Capitol Hill was in opposition to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHow are your premiums these days? Did you get to keep your doctor? she asks.\n\nShe says the second time she rallied with Tea Partiers on Capitol Hill was to call for the IRS to be audited, and she points out that Lois Lerner resigned with her retirement in tact.\n\nRegarding Iran, Johnson says, \u201cour president doesn\u2019t think that we\u2019re in a religious war\u2026 he doesn\u2019t think that this is a religious fight\u2026 He may not even believe in the God of Israel.\n\n\u201cBut we know Iran believes in the God of Israel\u2013that\u2019s why they hate them so much,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know it is a miracle against miracle that Israel was defeated and scattered through the wind and has now reconstituted herself, back on her land, promised by her God. That\u2019s what makes you mad. You know, Iran, the promise of Abraham, you know the strength given to Moses\u2026 Obama is leading you on a path to weaponization that will not prosper. Trust us, nothing he touches prospers. Ask the House in 2008 when he controlled it and lost it in 2010. Ask the Senate when he controlled it in 2012 and lost it in 2014. Ask the Democrats who are supporting this bill now in 2016 when they feel the Obama touch and the American voters come for them too.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS): Iran Treaty \u2018Gift to All Those Who Chant Death to America\u2019\n\nHe blasts the treaty, which he says is a \u201cgift to Iran, it is a gift to radical Islam, a gift to all those who chant \u2018Death to America.'\u201dRep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL): Iran Deal \u2018Gratuitous Insult\u2019 to Lives/Memories of U.S. Solders Killed by Iranian-Backed Groups\n\nHe served in Iraq in 2007 in a Sunni dominated area. He said, according to intelligence reports, that the top \u201csource of death for our service members was from Iranian-backed groups killing our soldiers with Iranian-made bombs.\u201d\n\nDeSantis says lifting sanctions on the Iranians responsible for those deaths is a \u201cgratuitous insult to the lives of the memories of the people I served with and sacrificed on our behalf.\u201d He says the deal just rubs \u201csalt in the wounds\u201d of families who have lost someone at the hands of Iranian-backed terror.\n\nRep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ): Iran Got Elevator and We Got the Shaft\u2026.Let\u2019s Squash Obama\u2019s Iran Deal By Giving Them Nuclear Option\n\n\u201cIn order to squash the President\u2019s nuclear deal, let\u2019s give them the nuclear option,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the modern filibuster in the Senate so that we can start getting the will of the people done.\u201d\n\nRep. Ted Yoho (R-FL): Negotiate With Iran Only After it Denounces Terrorism, Releases U.S. Hostages, Stops Burning American Flag\n\nHeurges Americans to tell all Members of Congress who are voting for the deal that this will be their last vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. President, we do have a constitutional republic,\u201d he says. \u201cI know you have a pen and a phone, but they are not a substitute for the other two branches of government.\u201d\n\nHe says America should negotiate with Iran only when it denounces denounces terrorism, releases four American hostages, and stops burning the American flag\n\nRep. Steve King (R-IA): Obama Willing to Deal Away Security of World for Own Legacy\n\nHe points out that in 2008, candidate Obama told Iran that if \u201cyou unclench your first, we\u2019ll extend our hand.\u201d\n\nHe says America is still waiting for Iran to unclench their fist and Obama is groveling in front of Iran saying what it would take to make a deal.\n\n\u201cThe president has decided to created a legacy which to him is a treaty agreement with Iran regardless of what\u2019s in it,\u201d King notes, pointing out that \u201ca bad deal is worse than no deal\u201d as Netanyahu said.\n\nHe says the deal puts the \u201csurvival of humanity at stake\u201d and \u201cCongress is the last stop not only to save Israel but to save the nuclear non-proliferation agenda for the world\n\nKing says \u201ctens of millions of people will die\u201d if the deal is approved and future generations will wonder why Obama dealt away the security of the world for his own legacy.\n\nTrent Franks (R-AZ) : Iran Deal Will Make Obama \u2018Father of the Iranian Nuclear Bomb\u2019\n\nHe points out that the Iranian mullahs have openly bragged about how their weapons have killed hundreds of U.S. marines. He said it is \u201cunbelievable\u201d that the deal legitimizes and empowers the most prolific state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\u201d He points out that Bill Clinton made a far better deal and North Korea still developed nuclear weapons. delivered nuclear weapons\n\nFranks says if the deal goes through Obama will be known as \u201cthe father of the Iranian atomic bomb.\u201d\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX):\n\nHe says Americans have already made a difference, pointing out that they figured out that the show vote on the Iran Deal would allow Obama to release the money and go forward as if the treaty had been ratified. He says that show vote has been stopped for now.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, you are making a difference,\u201d he tells the crowd. \u201cThey are willing to change the song because you\u2019ve figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nRep. Lee Zedlin (R-NY): Not Even Sec. Kerry Has Read Verification Agreement\n\nHe says Americans oppose the Iran Deal not to create war\u2013\u201cwe oppose this deal to prevent it.\u201d\n\nZedlin says the Iran deal is a \u201cfatally flawed treaty.\u201d He points out that Americans are not on the inspection teams and the verification agreement still has not even been presented to Congress.\n\nHe points out that \u201cnot even Secretary Kerry has read it and he was the lead negotiator.\u201d\n\nGlenn Beck says when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress last year, the Torah portion that was studied in synagogues was the story of Esther. He compares God\u2019s message to Esther with Netanyahu\u2019s message to America.\n\n\u201cAmerica has a special role just like the role of Esther,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we can recognize it and save lives or we can deny it and lose our role and lose our lives.\u201d\n\nBeck says that \u201cin this week\u2019s Torah portion, we are told of the story of the early Israelites where Moses stood on the edge of the promised land and commanded God\u2019s people choose life or death, light or darkness, or they would be swept from their promised land.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we are faced with the exact same choice\u2013choose life and light over darkness and death.\u201d\n\nBeck says he has a \u201crenewed hope because we are no longer fooled by those who have made good evil and evil good.\u201d\n\nHe says with the deal, Iran will be able to accomplish in \u201cmere minutes\u201d more than Hitler did in over a decade.\n\nBreitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak: States Can Block Iran Deal, Prevent Tax Dollars from Going to Iran.\n\nPollak wishes a happy Jewish new year to the Tea Party and blows the shafar, which he notes is a reminder to \u201creturn to our values.\u201d\n\nHe notes that he stood five years ago in D.C. with the Tea Party against Obamacare and declares those at the rally are now all \u201chonorary Jews\u201d and jokes that \u201cyou now control the world.\u201d He thanks \u201ceach and every one of you\u201d as a Jewish-American for \u201cstanding up for America and for standing up for Israel.\u201d He says \u201cwe are here not just to stop the Iran deal but to bear witness\u2026 that we the people say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe as a nation should not make life or death decision on the basis of one fraction of one party\u2019s vote,\u201d he says, point out that there are Democrats on the right side of the deal.\n\nHe points out that Democrats\u2013like his California Representative (Air Force Veteran Rep. Ted Liu)\u2013is voting against the deal. He notes that Rep. Dan Lapinski (D-IL) from his home state is voting against the deal even though he represents a district with hardly any Jews and a lot of Muslims.\n\nPollak says Sens. Manchin, Schumer, and Menendez must get their colleagues to submit the deal as a treaty if they think it is such a great deal. He points out that the Obama administration has already submitted 13 treaties.\n\nHe says though Hillary Clinton said \u201cshe would go to war to prevent Iran from going nuclear\u2026 we remember what she did or did not do in Benghazi.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd President Barack Obama\u2013you said we, those of us here, are making common cause with the Iranian regime\u2026that we are making common cause with people who shout \u2018death to America,'\u201d Pollak continued. \u201cWe have not forgotten that you sat in Jeremiah\u2019s Wright\u2019s church for 20 years, and he had a lot to say about America.\u201d\n\nPollak says he wants to end on a positive note and reminds the audience that the states can resist the Iran Deal. He urges all to call their governors and state Representatives to keep the sanctions in place and to pass constitutional amendments in the states to \u201cprevent your tax dollars from going to the Iranian regime.\u201d\n\nHe says the shafar is a reminder to \u201creturn to our values\u201d and says it is time to \u201cremind this Congress to return to the oath they took to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nPollak was the first to point out that the states can block the Iran Deal and has been one of the leading intellectuals in the Iran deal debate.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows: He points out that Khomeni has declared that Israel will not exist in 25 years and he points out that since \u201cwe can\u2019t change their attitude, let\u2019s say no to this deal.\u201d\n\nSarah Palin: Obama \u2018Never Clenched a Fist Against Wicked Regime Where Anti-Semitism and Holocaust Denial is Official Ideology\u2019\n\nPalin says Obama \u201cnever clenched a fist against a wicked regime where anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial is official ideology.\u201d She blasts Hillary Clinton for spinning \u201cfaster than one of those Iranian centrifuges.\u201d She says the Iran Deal is a betrayal of American hostages and Americans. She says the the blood of American soldiers is on the Ayatollah\u2019s hands \u201cand we dare shake that hand.\u201d\n\nPalin says \u201cyou don\u2019t reward terrorism, you kill it. You don\u2019t lift sanctions, you crack down on their assets. You cut off their oil and drill baby drill for our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t retreat, we reload against any foe daring to test us\u2026 and that is what Iran just did,\u201d Palin said. She tells Congress \u201cyou gotta kill the deal\u201d because you \u201ccan\u2019t pass it to see what\u2019s in it this time\u201d like Congress did with Obamacare.\n\nShe tells Congress Obama is \u201cplaying you\u201d because he disrespects Congress and the Constitution. She also says Obama doesn\u2019t trust Americans to choose their own lightbulbs but will trust the Iran Death Cult.\n\nDuck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson:\n\n\u201cThey said God was dead back when I was in college but He wasn\u2019t. They lied,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they said the Tea Party was dead. Not true.\u201d\n\nHe says he was \u201canti\u201d when \u201canti wasn\u2019t even cool.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t do deals with people screaming at the top of their lungs and showing \u201cdeath to you.\u201d\n\nHe says he loves Israel because \u201cthey wrote the Bible\u201d and that is why \u201cyou never want to put them in unnecessary danger.\u201d\n\nMark Levin: \u2018Barack Obama Makes Neville Chamberlain Look Like George S. Patton\u2026\n\nThe \u201cGreat One\u201d first thanks the crowd except for the \u201cmalcontents over there.\u201d He says \u201cwe are here to tell the world that we the American people reject the cowardice and surrender by our government to the genocidal terror regime in Iran.\u201d He says \u201cwe are here to tell the world that the American people are more resolute than ever\u2026 to destroy those who threaten to wage war against us, our society, and our ally Israel.\u201d\n\nLevin says \u201cthis enemy makes a grave error in confusing the appeasement of a president and a Democrat party and the capitulation of a Republican Congress with the strength and fortitude of the American people.\u201d\n\nHe says never before has a U.S. president and a political party consented to funding the enemy and entered into an agreement with a terrorist regime that holds American people hostage, murders its citizens, and seeks weapons to destroy America. Levin warns that the Iran Deal \u201csows the seeds of war.\u201d He says it is clear that the Democrats no longer represent the party of Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy and is now the Democrat Party of Saul Alinsky, Bill Ayers, and Barack Obama. He said Democrats will \u201chave blood on its hands for the rest of time\u201d because of the Iran Deal.\n\nLevin says Republicans in Congress should take some of the scaffolding and \u201cuse it on their damn spines\u201d because the GOP leadership is \u201crecklessly and deliberately avoiding any serious confrontation with a disastrous imperial president.\u201d He says Republicans in Congress can stop this \u201cby invoking the treaty clause right now\u201d and \u201csuspend the filibuster rule and vote against lifting sanctions right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can stand between Obama and the Iranian terrorist regime and protect our nation and our allies, but they won\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cGone is the party of Dwight David Eisenhower, gone is the party of Ronald Reagan; instead we get the party of McConnell and Corker and Boehner (crowd boooos).\u201d\n\nLevin says Republicans need to be told this is \u201cnot about getting along with Obama but stopping Obama.\u201d\n\nLevin warns that Americans have been threatened better and far stronger than the seventh-century throwbacks in Iran that chant \u201cdeath to America\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve obliterated every damn one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people do not stir quickly (USA! USA! USA! chants from the crowd), but when we do stir, you will regret it,\u201d Levin says. \u201cTell the Republicans in Congress it\u2019s time to step up, enforce the Constitution, and stop this fraudulent deal.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump: Trump Guarantees the Four Americans Iran Is Holding Hostages Will Be Back in America Even Before He Takes Office If He\u2019s Elected President\n\nTrump says he has spent a lifetime negotiating deals and never in his life has he seen a deal \u201cso incompetently negotiated than the Iran deal.\u201d He guarantees that the four American prisoners in Iran will be back in America even before he takes office if he becomes president.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX): Obama Administration \u2018Will Become Quite Literally the World\u2019s Leading Financier of Radical Islamic Terrorism\u2019 if Iran Deal Goes Through:\n\nHe says if the deal goes through, the Obama administration will \u201cbecome quite literally the world\u2019s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d He points out that $100 billion will flow directly to Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and other radical Islamic terrorists who will use the \u201cbillions to murder Americans, Israelies and Europeans.\u201d Cruz also says the deal abandons four American hostages, including Christian pastor Saeed Abedeni and in an \u201cIranian hellhole\u201d and it is a \u201cdisgrace to abandon Americans in Iranian hellholes.\u201d\n\nCruz says the deal will \u201cfacilitate and accelerate\u201d the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and calls out Democrats in the Senate for putting party loyalty above what is good for the nation. He says \u201csadly\u201d it is becoming rare to find Scoop Jackson Democrats or John F. Kennedy Democrats, or Joe Lieberman Democrats who put national security above party loyalty.\n\nCruz also sends a warning shots to the banks who may release funds to Iran, saying \u201cthere will come a president who is not Barack Obama\u201d who will hold them to account.\n\nCruz asks Democrats how they will look the parents of the U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq by Iranian weapons since the deal lifts sanctions on the man who authorized the killings (Gen. Soleimani).\n\nJenny Beth Martin points out that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has been leading the effort in organizing the rally.\n\nFrank Gaffney: \u201cIf Republican leaders in the Senate and House do not stop the deal\u2026 their names will be on the bombs.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Security Policy\u2019s Gaffney said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) said that \u201cmy name will not be on this bomb\u201d when he announced his opposition to the deal. Gaffney said Sens. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) will have their names on the bombs. He said the names of the GOP leaders will be on the bombs as well if they do not stop the deal, which they can.\n\nGaffney says that \u201cwhen we are all asked in the years ahead what did we do to stop this disaster, we were here, we were here working against it\u2026\u201d Gaffney said \u201cwe must not rest\u201d because \u201cthis will not be over in the next few days.\u201d\n\nDave Brat: \u201cI think I know what happens when leadership in Washington does not listen to their voters\u201d\n\nRep. Dave Brat (R-VA), who ousted former House Majority Eric Cantor (R-VA) in a primary, said the Iran Deal is a product of weak leadership in Washington. He told the crowd that \u201cleadership in Washington is ignoring you, the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hey, I\u2019m Dave Brat from Virginia, and I think I know when leadership in Washington does not listen to their voters.\u201d\n\nHe said Senators should be voting up or down on a treaty. When Brat mentions Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), the crowd loudly boos. Brat said McConnell and Boehner must allow Congress to have 60 days to review the deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "***Live Updates*** Palin, Trump, Cruz, Mark Levin Headline Stop Iran Rally", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "***Live Updates*** Palin, Trump, Cruz, Mark Levin Headline Stop Iran Rally", "title": "***Live Updates*** Palin, Trump, Cruz, Mark Levin Headline Stop Iran Rally\u00a0 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/stop-iran-nuclear-deal-rally-in-florida-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-09T13:34:21-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/09/live-updates-palin-trump-cruz-mark-levin-headline-stop-iran-rally/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "***Live Updates*** Palin, Trump, Cruz, Mark Levin Headline Stop Iran Rally", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/stop-iran-nuclear-deal-rally-in-florida-AP.jpg", "title": "***Live Updates*** Palin, Trump, Cruz, Mark Levin Headline Stop Iran Rally\u00a0 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-09-09T09:54:11-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,National Security,2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-09-09T13:34:21-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde20e\"", "article_summary": "Breitbart\u2019s Joel Pollak: States Can Block Iran Deal, Prevent Tax Dollars from Going to Iran.\nHe said Democrats will \u201chave blood on its hands for the rest of time\u201d because of the Iran Deal.\nRon DeSantis (R-FL): Iran Deal \u2018Gratuitous Insult\u2019 to Lives/Memories of U.S. Solders Killed by Iranian-Backed GroupsHe served in Iraq in 2007 in a Sunni dominated area.\nRep.
