That\u2019s more than double the number who look to the web first, and more than five times the number who turn to print.\n\nSo television news steers, to a great degree, our political discourse. But unlike text on the page or screen, it remains more difficult to analyze. TV arrives as sound and moving images\u2014both of which algorithms have a harder time making sense of.\n\nThat\u2019s why a recent pilot project from the Internet Archive is so welcome. Using the Archive\u2019s massive archive of television news, Georgetown scholar Kalev Leetaru tracked all the locations mentioned on U.S. television news between June 2009 and October 2013, then plotted them on a world map.\n\nOn the foundation\u2019s blog, archivist Roger Macdonald writes that the map constitutes the \u201cfirst large-scale glimpses of the geography of American television news, beginning to reveal which areas receive outsized attention and which are neglected.\u201d\n\nInternet Archive\n\nLeetaru\u2019s project isn\u2019t the first to examine quantitatively how TV news represents the world.
