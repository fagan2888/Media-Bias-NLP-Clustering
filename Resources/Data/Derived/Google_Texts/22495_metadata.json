Rick Scott has asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 250 additional Zika tests.\n\nSo far, 32 Floridians have caught the Zika virus while traveling outside the country. Only three of those cases are considered active infections. Central Florida is up to five Zika cases in Brevard, Orange, Osceola and now Seminole counties.\n\nCentral Floridians have caught Zika in Puerto Rico, Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nZika is mainly spread by yellow fever mosquitoes, found year-round in Florida. Officials are asking residents to dump any standing water to keep the mosquitoes at bay.\n\nIn addition, the CDC is studying 14 more cases of Zika that may have been contracted sexually. Three more countries have been added to the list of those pregnant travelers or those looking to become pregnant.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
