The new plan is expected to be approved and to take effect in January, although it will be open to public comment for 60 days.\n\nMedicare\u2019s plan comes as many patients, families and health providers are pushing to give people greater say about how they die \u2014 whether that means trying every possible medical option to stay alive or discontinuing life support for those who do not want to be sustained by ventilators and feeding tubes.\n\n\u201cWe think that today\u2019s proposal supports individuals and families who wish to have the opportunity to discuss advance care planning with their physician and care team,\u201d said Dr. Patrick Conway, the chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which administers Medicare. \u201cWe think those discussions are an important part of patient- and family-centered care.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Conway said a final decision on the proposal would be made by Nov. 1. The plan would allow qualified professionals like nurse practitioners and physician assistants, as well as doctors, to be reimbursed for face-to-face meetings with a patient and any relatives or caregivers the patient wants to include. Dr. Conway said the proposal did not limit the number of conversations reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThe reality is these conversations, their length can vary based on patients\u2019 needs,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019re short conversations \u2014 the person has thought about it. Sometimes, they\u2019re a much longer conversation. Sometimes, they\u2019re a series of conversations.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMajor medical organizations endorsed Medicare\u2019s proposal. The National Right to Life Committee opposed it on grounds that it could lead to patients\u2019 being pressured to forgo treatment.\n\nThe reimbursement rate paid under the proposal and other details will be determined after public comments are received, Dr. Conway said. People covered by Medicare account for about 80 percent of deaths each year.\n\nBecause Medicare often sets the standard for private insurers as well, the new policy would prompt many more doctors to engage patients in such discussions about their preferences. Some private health insurance companies have recently begun covering such advance care planning conversations, and more are likely to do so once Medicare formally adopts its new rules.\n\nEfforts to support end-of-life planning were derailed in 2009 during the debate over the Affordable Care Act. The next year, Medicare decided through its regulatory powers to allow coverage for \u201cvoluntary advance care planning\u201d in annual wellness visits. But soon after, the Obama administration capitulated to political pressure and rescinded that part of the regulation.\n\nAs a big part of the American population ages, and more people live longer with grave illnesses, a growing number of people want to be able to talk over options with their doctors \u2014 deciding, for example, whether they want to die at home or in the hospital, or under what circumstances they would want life-sustaining treatment.\n\nLast September, a national nonpartisan panel of medical, legal and religious leaders issued a far-reaching report saying that the country\u2019s system for dealing with end-of-life care was seriously flawed and should be overhauled. Among its recommendations was that insurers reimburse health providers for advance care planning conversations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFilling out advance directives can help, and some states have created central databases of these forms so they are easier for a patient\u2019s doctor or specialist to find in moments of crisis. But end-of-life experts, and the members of the national panel, said simply checking boxes on a form was of limited value because many patients needed several conversations to consider their options and to talk them over with their families.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward,\u201d said Dr. Diane Meier, a member of the national panel and the director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care. \u201cI think it\u2019s great news that Medicare, the major payer for health care in the U.S., is now formally recognizing that advance care planning is worthy of its attention and reimbursement and that in fact is a way to restore power and control to patients.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to pay for it. You have to make sure people know what they\u2019re doing and are well trained.\u201d\n\nDr. Meier said that in the final policy, Medicare should identify and require documentation of specific components of end-of-life discussions. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want to have is a check-box,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2018Yes I had a conversation \u2014 I\u2019m billing for it,\u2019 should not be enough.\u201d\n\nBurke Balch, the director of the National Right to Life Committee\u2019s Powell Center for Medical Ethics, said his organization objected to Medicare\u2019s plan under current circumstances. \u201cWe feel there is pervasive bias against treatment that is occurring in advance care planning that involves nudging individuals to reject lifesaving medical treatment,\u201d he said. He said such pressure on patients was \u201cmotivated in large part by a desire to cut health care costs.\u201d\n\nMr. Balch said his organization was trying to find a congressional sponsor for a bill that would instead direct Medicare to produce materials about end-of-life decisions that reflect a range of views, including those \u201cconcerned with protecting people\u2019s right to treatment.\u201d\n\nIn the rural upstate New York community of Dundee, Dr. Joseph Hinterberger, a family physician who has been conducting end-of-life discussions with his patients at no cost, took a different view. He praised several aspects of the plan and suggested also covering social workers and other trained providers.\n\n\u201cI think what it will mostly do is decrease confusion at the end of life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will potentially decrease unnecessary use of resources because it will be very clear what the patient did and did not want. And it should also make it easier for physicians and other caregivers to make decisions because they can say, \u2018We all know what Mildred\u2019s wishes were. We shall not tread upon them.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150708164432, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare is proposing to reimburse doctors for having conversations with patients about whether and how they would want to be kept alive if they became too sick to speak for themselves.", "title": "Medicare Plans to Pay Doctors for Counseling on End of Life", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/health/medicare-proposes-paying-doctors-for-end-of-life-counseling.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003788294"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/09/us/09medicare/09medicare-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/health/medicare-proposes-paying-doctors-for-end-of-life-counseling.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003788294", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/health/medicare-proposes-paying-doctors-for-end-of-life-counseling.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 8, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Medicare,Living Wills and Health Care Proxies,Death and Dying,Health Insurance and Managed Care", "news_keywords": "Medicare", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Pam Belluck", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/09/us/09medicare/09medicare-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAM BELLUCK", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Medicare is proposing to reimburse doctors for having conversations with patients about whether and how they would want to be kept alive if they became too sick to speak for themselves.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/09/us/09medicare/09medicare-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Medicare is proposing to reimburse doctors for having conversations with patients about whether and how they would want to be kept alive if they became too sick to speak for themselves.", "CG": "health", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/pam_belluck/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "section": "Health", "modified": "2015-07-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2015-07-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "09medicare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150709114501, "hdl_p": "Medicare Plans to Pay Doctors for Counseling on End of Life", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/health/medicare-proposes-paying-doctors-for-end-of-life-counseling.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/09/us/09medicare/09medicare-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Medicare is proposing to reimburse doctors for having conversations with patients about whether and how they would want to be kept alive if they became too sick to speak for themselves.", "title": "Medicare Plans to Pay Doctors for Counseling on End of Life"}, "pdate": 20150708, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000003788294, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Medicare Plans to Pay Doctors for Counseling on End of Life", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09b6\"", "article_summary": "The next year, Medicare decided through its regulatory powers to allow coverage for \u201cvoluntary advance care planning\u201d in annual wellness visits.\nAmong its recommendations was that insurers reimburse health providers for advance care planning conversations.\nSome private health insurance companies have recently begun covering such advance care planning conversations, and more are likely to do so once Medicare formally adopts its new rules.\nEfforts to support end-of-life planning were derailed in 2009 during the debate over the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cWe feel there is pervasive bias against treatment that is occurring in advance care planning that involves nudging individuals to reject lifesaving medical treatment,\u201d he said."}
