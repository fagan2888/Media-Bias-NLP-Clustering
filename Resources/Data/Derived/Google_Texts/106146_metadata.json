Gonzales said they need more toys mainly for toddlers and pre-teens, both for boys and girls.\n\nLast year, they had about 25 bicycles to give away. This year, they only have three, Gonzales said.\n\nTo donate a gift, contact Ramon Gonzales at (520) 971-8271. Donations can be dropped off at 2019 W.
