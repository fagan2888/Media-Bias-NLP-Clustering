ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- PlanSource, a leading provider of cloud-based health exchange and benefits administration technology, partnered with the state of Utah in 2013 to build Avenue H, the state's online health insurance marketplace for small businesses. Today, Avenue H has become one of the most successful state-run exchanges in the country.

Seventeen states and the District of the Columbia operate exchanges under the framework of the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) established by the Affordable Care Act. With more than 650 employers and more than 14,000 consumers on the system, Utah's Avenue H has the second highest enrollment rate among state exchanges, surpassing states with much higher populations, including California and Massachusetts.

"PlanSource was uniquely qualified to make Avenue H a success," said Patty Conner, Director of Avenue H. "Compared to other technology providers we considered only PlanSource was able to fully automate the entire employer onboarding and shopping experience. This, combined with its cost effectiveness, intuitive user interface and powerful administrative tools, has helped us get people insured faster and allowed us to work much more efficiently. In fact, the Avenue H team is able to run the system with only 5 full-time employees."

Avenue H offers 75 health plans and 45 dental plans from multiple carriers, and allows employees to compare plans and providers to select the option that is best for their families. It includes an online quoting mechanism and a unique provider search tool, which lets consumers look up their preferred healthcare providers and see which are in the Avenue H carrier network. Employers can choose the dollar amount they will contribute to each employee's health care plan using a defined contribution model, making their costs more controllable and predictable.

Avenue H: a model for state exchanges

"We are honored to partner with the state of Utah and Avenue H," said Scott Carver, President of PlanSource. "They have a truly visionary approach to providing health care. Their online marketplace is a model for other states and has allowed thousands of citizens of Utah to quickly and easily get the coverage they need. PlanSource is proud to have played a small part in their success."

Utah established Avenue H in 2010. After three years, state officials knew they needed to improve the efficiency of their benefits enrollment, selection and shopping processes. They partnered with PlanSource to consolidate on a single technology platform. In less than 4 months, Avenue H successfully launched the new automated solution powered by PlanSource OneMarket. An enrollment process that previously took employers as long as 90 days to complete can now be executed in a matter of minutes.

Avenue H's unique flexibility and contribution has seen unprecedented success, including:

More than 650 employers on the exchange (25% growth from inaugural enrollment season)

More than 14,000 consumers covered via Avenue H

88% renewal retention rate

Avenue H, with more choices available in one place, will continue to help Utah's small businesses control costs while offering expanded health coverage options to their employees. For more information on Avenue H, visit http://plansource.com/case-study-avenue-h/.
