Rosa DeLauro is a Democrat. Her opponent, James Brown, a Republican.\n\nDeLauro, 71, is seeking her 13th term in the House of Representatives. Brown, 45, has never served in office and favors limiting the number of terms a representative can serve.\n\nBrown\u2019s campaign fund had about $6,600 at last report. DeLauro has raised more than $1 million.\n\nBrown has attacked and condemned many of DeLauro\u2019s positions and votes, calling her an Obama \u201crubber stamp\u201d and demanding her resignation. DeLauro has ignored her opponent in her political mailings and ads.\n\nDeLauro is passionate about protecting social programs, strengthening food safety rules, and promoting Obamacare. Brown\u2019s platform includes the elimination of the Department of Education, tighter enforcement of the nation\u2019s borders and overturning the Affordable Care Act\n\nBrown's campaign, in one political observer's words, will be an \"uphill battle, to say the least.\"\n\nQuixotic, might be another word.\n\nThe New Haven-based 3rd District has been continuously represented by a Democrat since 1983. DeLauro took over in 1991 from Democrat Bruce Morrison. Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than two-to-one. The district supported President Obama by a similar margin in both 2008 and 2012.\n\nDeLauro won her last election with about 77 percent of the vote. She is well connected in both New Haven and Washington, and refers to her district as home to \u201cthe first hamburger ever made and the best pizza in the world.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s seeking her 13th term because \u201cI love what I do,\u201d she says. Her motivation stems \u201cfrom growing up in an Italian Catholic household\u201d where both parents were New Haven aldermen.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t work on omnibus legislation but they worked on behalf of the people they represented,\u201d DeLauro said. She calls herself an advocate for the disadvantaged and the middle class. \u201cMy folks were there for them, and I will be there for them,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nThe DeLauro campaign web site ignores Brown and stresses her efforts in Congress, including obtaining a National Heritage Area designation for the Naugatuck River Valley, her fight against the Pentagon over their purchase of Russian-made helicopters and her push to strengthen federal equal pay laws. Her campaign slogan is \"fighting for people.\"\n\nBrown is a math teacher at Stratford\u2019s Frank Scott Bunnell High School who has taken a leave in order to campaign. His stance on most issues is 180 degrees from DeLauro's, giving voters starkly different choices this year.\n\nThat is, if Brown can get his message out.\n\nJames Brown for Congress\n\nBrown, who is affable and eloquent, said he has adopted a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d strategy that involves campaigning at fairs, train stations, malls, concerts on village greens and everywhere else a crowd congregates.\n\nHe also sends out blast e-mails advertising his itinerary, soliciting campaign funds, laying out his positions, and attacking DeLauro.\n\nBrown said he decided to run for Congress because he did not like the direction the country is heading in, with growing budget deficits and a federal government that he believes encroaches on personal liberties.\n\n\"People are really tired of what\u2019s going on in Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown will be on the ballot on Nov. 4 because he won 86 percent of the delegate votes in the Connecticut Republican Convention, beating out Steve Packard, another candidate who wanted to run against DeLauro.\n\nIn a way, DeLauro\u2019s popularity paved the way for his candidacy by dissuading other Republicans from running, Brown said.\n\n\u201cMore experienced people would think it\u2019s not a good political move,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, this is actually not a bad district in terms of getting my name on the ballot.\u201d\n\nBrown is running on his outsider status. He argues that the House of Representatives should reflect the nation\u2019s population and be composed of math teachers and other \u201cregular Americans\u201d instead of \u201ccareer politicians\u201d -- like DeLauro. That\u2019s why he supports term limits.\n\nUphill battle\n\nRon Schurin, political science professor at the University of Connecticut, calls Brown's candidacy \u201can uphill battle, to say the least.\u201d\n\nBrown said he realizes he\u2019s an underdog. But that doesn\u2019t matter to him.\n\n\u201cMy focus has never been on the results of Election Day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end result. It\u2019s getting your message out.\u201d\n\nConnecticut state Sen. Joe Markley, a Republican, said he sat down with Brown last winter \u201cand talked to him about the challenges of running.\u201d\n\nBut Markley said Brown was determined to \u201cput his life on hold\u201d in the hopes of \u201cgoing down and fixing the mess in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him,\u2019 Markley said. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of candidate the public is crying out for, if they only could recognize him as such.\"\n\nSchurin said the district's Democratic bent makes DeLauro a good fit, especially since minorities are now more than a fourth of the district\u2019s population and a growing constituency.\n\nDeLauro has also been on the front lines of a Democratic campaign to address the concerns of women, including their rights to birth control and equal pay \u2013 a move she also hopes will lock in those female votes.\n\n\u201cShe is definitely part of the liberal wing of the Democratic caucus,\u201d Schurin said.\n\nDeLauro is a member of the House Democratic leadership \u2013 she\u2019s co-chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee \u2013 and close to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, but she sometimes veers to the left of her leadership.\n\nFor instance, she resented the compromises Pelosi made on the Affordable Care Act in an effort to win broader support for the health care bill, Schurin said. More recently, DeLauro split with Pelosi over whether to give President Obama authority to arm and train Syrian rebels. DeLauro voted against doing so.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the few positions she shares with Brown, who also opposed the idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the U.S. to be involved in endless military actions,\u201d he said.\n\nDeLauro\u2019s seat on the House Appropriations Committee allows her to fight against GOP cuts to social programs, like food stamps or Head Start. She\u2019s also a strong advocate for Sikorsky Aircraft and other defense contractors in the district.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown says he wants to focus on border security, not because he has any rancor toward immigrants, but because of his concern that terrorists may slip across the border.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming into this country, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he became aware of border issues during the few years he taught school in Harlingen, Texas, a town that\u2019s a stone's throw from the Rio Grande.\n\nHe would like a repeal of the Affordable Care Act because, he says, \u201cI\u2019m a free market guy,\u201d but concedes it's not likely.\n\n\"Yes it's helping some people,\" Brown said of the ACA. \"But it's killing others.\"\n\nA live wire\n\nBrown was born and raised in Newtown, attended the University of Connecticut and is recently divorced. Although he quit teaching math, he continues to coach high school track teams.\n\nHe said part of the attraction he's had to politics is that, \"I'm an issues kind of person.\"\n\nDeLauro worked for the city of New Haven, and for its mayor, for several years before she came to Washington, D.C., to serve as former Sen. Chris Dodd\u2019s chief of staff. She divides her time between the Capitol; the Capitol Hill home she shares with her husband Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster; and the 3rd District, where she holds countless roundtables and events.\n\nBoth in Washington and Connecticut she lives up to a New York Times description of the lawmaker as \u201ca live wire whose words rush out like sparks.\u201d\n\nDeLauro has been touring all the diners in her district. She says some of the diner\u2019s patrons would rather continue with their meals, but many are happy to see her and \u201cexpress their views to a member of Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m everywhere and will continue to campaign all over the district,\u201d DeLauro said. The lawmaker, however, doubts she\u2019ll spend money on television advertising.\n\nShe welcomes Brown\u2019s challenge as proof of the success of American democracy.\n\n\u201cWe live in such a great democracy sometimes we take it for granted,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cThis is a place where people can express their views\u2026even run for office if they want.\u201d\n\nAs far as the prospects of returning to a Congress that\u2019s likely to remain in gridlock and a House of Representatives that\u2019s likely to remain under GOP control, DeLauro said she doesn\u2019t get frustrated.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just sit on the sidelines, you stand up and fight for those things you believe in,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/03/brown-vs-delauro-a-lively-but-lop-sided-congressional-race/", "news_keywords": "Politics, Washington, Affordable Care Act, Congress, Democrat, immigration, James Brown, re-election, Republican, Rosa DeLauro", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/03/brown-vs-delauro-a-lively-but-lop-sided-congressional-race/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The Democratic and Republican candidates in the race for the 3rd District congressional seat are nearly as far apart in their political views as anyone can be, setting the stage for a lively, if a bit lopsided, campaign.", "title": "Brown vs. DeLauro a lively, but lopsided, congressional race", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/03/brown-vs-delauro-a-lively-but-lop-sided-congressional-race/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/10/DeLauro-Brown-combo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/10/03/brown-vs-delauro-a-lively-but-lop-sided-congressional-race/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf001\"", "article_summary": "Brown has attacked and condemned many of DeLauro\u2019s positions and votes, calling her an Obama \u201crubber stamp\u201d and demanding her resignation.\nWashington \u2013 The candidates in the race for the 3rd District congressional seat are about as far apart in their political views as two people can be, setting the stage for a lively, if lopsided, campaign.\nBrown is a math teacher at Stratford\u2019s Frank Scott Bunnell High School who has taken a leave in order to campaign.\nBrown, 45, has never served in office and favors limiting the number of terms a representative can serve.\nHe also sends out blast e-mails advertising his itinerary, soliciting campaign funds, laying out his positions, and attacking DeLauro."}
