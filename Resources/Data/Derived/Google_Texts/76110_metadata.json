I don\u2019t look at myself as person of stature or significance or anything else.\u201d\n\nArmed with spreadsheets, Leahy had met with Brown at a diner in Windham to talk about the burden of Obamacare on her small software and professional services businesses. That\u2019s when he presented her with a polished black plaque, emblazoned with the words, \u201cWomen for Scott Brown.\u201d A press release followed. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to award Janice with a Hero Award to celebrate her determination to maintain a business despite government red tape and burdensome regulations that make for a very tough environment not only for women-oriented businesses, but for everyone,\u201d Brown said in the statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I support full repeal of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\n\nLeahy, a Republican, says she was left confused and embarrassed by the whole episode. She also says she is not sure she will vote for Brown in November, given his 2012 vote against an equal pay bill, an issue close to her heart given that she works in a male-dominated industry. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about his vote against it and I would need to know more about it before I vote for him,\u201d Leahy says. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet which way I\u2019ll vote in November.\u201d\n\nThe episode is emblematic for Brown, who has been struggling to connect with women in his bid to unseat Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Although Brown and Shaheen are neck-and-neck in polls overall\u2014with Brown garnering 44% of likely voters to Shaheen\u2019s 46%\u2014Brown is losing women to Shaheen by 39% to 53%, according to an Aug. 21 WMUR Granite State poll.\n\nHe has tried to chip away at this deficit on the campaign trail. Brown\u2019s campaign defines \u201cThe Women for Brown \u2018Hero\u2019 Awards\u201d as commendations \u201cmeant to recognize individuals who are contributing to the economic life of New Hampshire, helping our community thrive and building strong families, sometimes despite adverse circumstances.\u201d Emails to the campaign asking about how the honorees are selected went unanswered.\n\nThe awards have been timed to underscore policy talking points the campaign has sought to spread. The second plaque was given to Naswa Resorts owner Cynthia Markis and her mother, Hope, for operating their business despite high energy and Obamacare costs. And Brown gave a third award to Commandant Peggy LaBrecque, who runs the state\u2019s only longterm care facility for veterans, on Veterans Day, using the event to highlight a package of veterans policy initiatives he unveiled that day. Repeated calls for comment to Markis and LaBrecque went unanswered.\n\nShaheen is the first woman in U.S. history to be elected both governor and senator. If Brown loses, he\u2019ll also make history: He\u2019d be the first man to lose two Senate races to two women. In 2012, he lost his Senate seat in neighboring Massachusetts to Elizabeth Warren. Shaheen\u2019s campaign says Brown\u2019s awards are patronizing towards women. \u201cNew Hampshire women aren\u2019t looking for plaques, they are looking for a Senator who stands up equal pay for equal work and protecting access to basic health services like mammograms \u2014and Scott Brown has proven he can\u2019t be trusted to do that,\u201d says Harrell Kirstein, a Shaheen campaign spokesman.\n\nBrown\u2019s challenge is shared by Republicans across the country. Unlike 2010, the GOP wave year when Republicans won the female vote for the first time since Ronald Reagan, women have helped Democrats stay competitive so far in several races across the country this year, including New Hampshire, North Carolina and Louisiana. Democrats have made a concerted effort to appeal to female voters, hoping to avoid another wave of losses like in 2010. They\u2019ve introduced a women\u2019s economic agenda and have repeatedly hit Republicans for waging a \u2018War on Women,\u2019 over access to abortion and contraceptives.\n\nLeahy says she now sees the award as a thing meant to mean more for Brown than her. \u201cI think it\u2019s his push to show women in the area he understands inherently their issues, what\u2019s near and dear in their hearts,\u201d Leahy says.\n\nBut she noted that Brown has a tough task ahead of him, given the pride the state now has in having an entirely female Congressional delegation, which includes Brown\u2019s rival Shaheen. \u201cI do think it\u2019s the coolest historical thing that we have full female congressional delegation,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cBeing a woman, I like that that\u2019s brought to the forefront all the time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recipient is puzzled and embarrassed by the honor", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In a tight race against Jeanne Shaheen, Brown tries a unique, if not entirely successful, way to appeal to women", "title": "Losing Women, Scott Brown Offers Them \"Hero\" Awards", "url": "http://time.com/3292527/scott-brown-jeanne-shaheen-new-hampshire/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/scott-brown.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/scott-brown.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "In a tight race against Jeanne Shaheen, Brown tries a unique, if not entirely successful, way to appeal to women", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Losing Women, Scott Brown Offers Them \"Hero\" Awards"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "scott brown, jeanne shaheen, elizabeth warren, senate, new hampshire, 2014 midterm elections, massachusetts, obamacare, women, hero awards", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "scott brown, jeanne shaheen, elizabeth warren, senate, new hampshire, 2014 midterm elections, massachusetts, obamacare, women, hero awards"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe284a\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s when he presented her with a polished black plaque, emblazoned with the words, \u201cWomen for Scott Brown.\u201d A press release followed.\nJanice Leahy, a small businesswoman in New Hampshire, still doesn\u2019t understand why Republican senate candidate Scott Brown gave her a \u201chero\u201d award when they met in May.\nAlthough Brown and Shaheen are neck-and-neck in polls overall\u2014with Brown garnering 44% of likely voters to Shaheen\u2019s 46%\u2014Brown is losing women to Shaheen by 39% to 53%, according to an Aug. 21 WMUR Granite State poll.\nIf Brown loses, he\u2019ll also make history: He\u2019d be the first man to lose two Senate races to two women.\n\u201cI\u2019m no hero."}
