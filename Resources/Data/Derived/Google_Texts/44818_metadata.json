Sam Cruz worked at the Belvedere from 1988 until it closed in December 2013. He is now working for Shadow Hills Golf Club & Events Center as head chef, putting his first-hand knowledge of the Belvedere favorites to use.

He said people from out of town were excited to learn that they would be able to get some of the Belvedere favorites once again.\n\n\"I think it's great for Fremont County and for the Holts,\" he said.\n\nShadow Hills Golf Club & Events Center offers on-site and off-site catering, a full-service bar, outdoor seating, a ballroom for dining and events, accommodating up to about 200 people, outdoor seating and an enclosed patio dining area that seats about 40 people.
