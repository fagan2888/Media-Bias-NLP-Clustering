SRA International has opened two San Antonio enrollment assistance centers to provide free, confidential help to uninsured consumers wishing to apply for tax credits and sign up for 2016 health insurance coverage.

The northern center is at 842 N.W. Loop 410 in Suite 111, while the southern center is at 1950 S.W. Military Drive. Consumers are urged to make appointments first by calling 210-347-1274.

Both enrollment centers will be open six days a week and will stay open late on Tuesdays for consumers who are unable to stop by during daytime hours. The hours of operation at both facilities will be 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesdays.

Each site has 16 enrollment assistants to help the general public at no cost. Those assistants will help consumers review their 2016 health insurance coverage options, find out if they qualify for tax credits to help pay their premiums and sign up or re-enroll in a health plan for next year.

SRA International is a federal contractor for HealthCare.gov.
