Although she hasn\u2019t officially announced her bid for retiring Rep. Henry Waxman\u2019s (D-CA) seat, the Washington Post reports that Fluke has filed for the endorsement of California\u2019s Democratic party, which is the first step in the process.\n\nThe field is expected to be fairly crowded, and there\u2019s no telling what Fluke\u2019s chances are. But the fact that she\u2019s prepared to make a run provides yet another example that Democratic politicians aren\u2019t afraid to take an bold stance on reproductive rights this year.\n\nFluke was catapulted into national headlines in 2012 after the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh\u2019s infamous attacks against her. Limbaugh called the Georgetown law student a slut for supporting Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive coverage requirement, suggesting that she was having so much sex that she couldn\u2019t afford her own birth control. (Of course, that\u2019s not actually how birth control works in practice.) Although other prominent conservatives furthered that line of attack, Fluke didn\u2019t back down. She became an unapologetic spokeswoman for women\u2019s reproductive health care, speaking out against the GOP\u2019s \u201cWar on Women\u201d at the Democratic National Convention and partnering with Planned Parenthood to promote health reform.\n\nRight-wing pundits have transformed Fluke into somewhat of a symbol \u2014 she embodies the conservative assumption that birth control coverage has more to do with women\u2019s promiscuity than their overall reproductive and economic freedom. But that hasn\u2019t stopped her from seriously thinking about running, and likely won\u2019t stop Democrats from rallying around her. She\u2019s already won an unofficial endorsement from Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY).\n\nIn fact, Fluke\u2019s decision to pursue a seat in Congress bears some similarities to the career of another women\u2019s health champion who\u2019s reviled by the right: Wendy Davis. The Texas state senator has become the public face of a groundswell of reproductive rights activism in the Lone Star State, and is currently making a high-profile run for governor. Although conservatives have smeared Davis as an \u201cAbortion Barbie,\u201d that hasn\u2019t put a damper on her political career.\n\nIn an interview with ThinkProgress last month, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, Ilyse Hogue, pointed to Davis as a prime example of a new wave of public officials who are being rewarded for taking a strong position in favor of abortion rights and women\u2019s health care.\n\n\u201cWhen you actually take a strong, courageous stand on abortion access as part of a full suite of reproductive freedom, voters reward you. We\u2019re going to see more of that, and we\u2019re going to incentivize more of that,\u201d Hogue noted.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have recently begun to do exactly that, coupling women\u2019s health issues within a larger context of all of the policies that will help women attain freedom and equality. New proposals in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Minnesota all bundle several policies \u2014 like pay equity, maternity leave, and workplace discrimination protections \u2014 into one package intended to advance women\u2019s position in society. In his recent State of the Union, President Obama took a similar approach, calling for an end to \u201cMad Men\u201d-era policies that undermine women\u2019s success.\n\nRepublicans are gearing up to emphasize their opposition to reproductive rights \u2014 in fact, at the most recent Republican National Convention, GOP delegates passed a resolution declaring that candidates should not stay silent on their anti-choice views.
