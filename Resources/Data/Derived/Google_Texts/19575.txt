Sen. Tom Cotton Tom CottonDems to GOP: Cancel Memorial Day break GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' Reid: We're not breaking the budget deal MORE (R-Ark.) slammed Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonWhy superdelegates shouldn't support Sanders Young Turks host offers million for Trump, Sanders debate An all-female ticket? Not in 2016 MORE on immigration Monday, suggesting she's shifted her policy to try to win over voters.

Pressed on whether or not she would deport children that were already in the country, she said, "I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either."

Cotton suggested her comments were at contrast with remarks she made in 2014, when she told CNN that the U.S. government should "send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay."

At the time, she was talking about a wave of undocumented minors coming from Central America and suggesting that parents must be warned against sending children on a "dangerous journey."

But Cotton added that "we've come to expect such opportunism from the House of Clinton" and that last week's remarks will bolster attempts by families to send their children into the United States illegally.

"I... can't imagine a more opportunist and irresponsible position than the one taken by Hillary Clinton, as she panders for votes, she limited deportation priorities to violent criminals and terrorists," Cotton said from the Senate floor.
