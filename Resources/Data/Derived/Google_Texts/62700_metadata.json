But now, after all those years, he\u2019s a part of a growing Ethiopian community in Colorado of more than 27,000 whose size and closeness was clear here Sunday at a festival celebrating the Ethiopian New Year.\n\nIn a way, a bit of the African nation moved to Colorado with Hailu.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to teach our kids,\u201d said Hailu, who has three young children. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t even speak our language.\u201d\n\nOrganizers expected about 1,000 people to attend the celebration at Del Mar Park where red, yellow and green Ethiopian flags hung from the trees. There was music, food and the happy shouts of playing children who danced around their parents, gathered in the shade and shielding themselves from the summer sun\u2019s last rays.\n\n\u201cThis is very important because this is not just a holiday for a specific church or mosque,\u201d said Shifferan Hajito, who runs the Ethiopian Community of Colorado, which organized the event. \u201cThis is regardless of religion, regardless of color.\u201d\n\nThe majority of Ethiopians living in Colorado escaped religious and cultural prosecution in their homeland, settling in the Denver area because the setting \u201clooks like home,\u201d Hajito said.\n\nThe Ethiopian New Year, which actually happened Thursday, is based off the country\u2019s 13-month calendar. Because of the extra month, it is actually only 2007 in Ethiopia.\n\n\u201cIt definitely connects me here with my roots,\u201d said 29-year-old Helen Tekle, who moved to the United States from Ethiopia when she was 7. \u201cPeople here who grew up like me and other teenagers tend to forget.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s Ethiopian community celebrates their new year in Aurora", "title": "Colorado\u2019s Ethiopian community celebrates their new year in Aurora", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/14/colorados-ethiopian-community-celebrates-their-new-year-in-aurora/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140914__20140915_A2_Mulugetap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140914__20140915_A2_Mulugetap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-14T17:16:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:23:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabf9\"", "article_summary": "AURORA \u2014 Mulugeta Hailu moved from Ethiopia to Denver over two decades ago seeking an escape from political persecution.\nBut now, after all those years, he\u2019s a part of a growing Ethiopian community in Colorado of more than 27,000 whose size and closeness was clear here Sunday at a festival celebrating the Ethiopian New Year.\n\u201cThis is very important because this is not just a holiday for a specific church or mosque,\u201d said Shifferan Hajito, who runs the Ethiopian Community of Colorado, which organized the event.\nIn a way, a bit of the African nation moved to Colorado with Hailu.\nThe move meant leaving his homeland and rich culture behind as he left for greener pastures."}
