Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announced in a press release January 2 that she had called the meeting, which will take place at 10 a.m. in room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Murkowski is the committee\u2019s ranking member. The legislation to be considered at the January 8 meeting is identical to the bill reported favorably by the committee on June 18, 2014, Murkowski said. The business meeting will be webcast live on the energy panel\u2019s website.\n\nThe $8 billion Keystone XL Pipeline would carry oil from tar sands in Canada through Indian country and American states all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill with a 252\u2013161 vote on November 14.\n\nIn calling the meeting, Murkowski makes good on a vow she made November 18 to bring the pipeline issue to the new Congress after the Senate failed that day to pass legislation that would have launched construction of the controversial project. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that we couldn\u2019t get the votes tonight to approve this important infrastructure project, but this isn\u2019t over. The Keystone XL pipeline will be a top priority next year for the new majority,\u201d Murkowski said in a press release that night.\n\nThen, in what might be considered an astounding case of cognitive dissonance, the senator said, \u201cThere is little dispute about whether this pipeline is in the national interest. It will boost our economy, our security, and our competitiveness.\u201d\n\nThere has been vigorous dispute of the claimed national interest that Keystone would serve and thousands of Native peoples, environmentalists and \u201cordinary\u201d people have protested the project on environmental grounds since it first came to light six years ago. Additionally, there was an unforgettable incident of Keystone-related high drama in the Senate on the night the vote to begin pipeline construction fell one short of the 60 votes needed to pass.\n\nMoments after the failed vote was announced, Greg Grey Cloud, an enrolled member of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe who was standing in the gallery of the Senate hall, began to sing an honor song to celebrate the defeat of the bill. People were talking and milling about on the Senate floor when Grey Cloud began to sing but, transfixed by the soulful sound of a human voice in full-throated song, all heads turned to find its source. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, ordered the sergeant-at-arms to \u201crestore order\u201d in the gallery and moments later Grey Cloud was hauled off and arrested, but a video of the incident went viral on the Internet.\n\nAccording to the Senate\u2019s roll call website Murkowski was in attendance at the Senate and was likely to have heard Grey Cloud\u2019s song of celebration that the Keystone bill had been defeated.\n\nRELATED: Rosebud Leader on Keystone: \u2018Test Us \u2013 You\u2019ll See an Indian Uprising\u2019\n\nRELATED: Video: Watch Lakota Song Unhinge Sen.
