Near-perfect weather greeted participants and onlookers at the 20th annual Tampa Bay Veterans Day Parade on Saturday in the Town ’N’ Country area.

The parade, which is on Hanley Road between Barry Road and Paula Drive, is among the state’s largest such Veterans Day events, with more than 60 marching and rolling units.

Parade organizers each year recognize one special “honoree,” and this year it was Hillsborough County sheriff’s Cpl. Robert “Scott” Carr, a former U.S. Marine.
