CONTRIBUTED\n\nBy Virginia Burroughs\n\nContributing Writer\n\nIn the small Missouri town where Dr. Ann DeClue grew up, there were no female doctors; she thought that must be a \u201cman\u2019s job,\u201d but liked the sciences so became a medical technologist.\n\n\u201cI had worked in Boston several years, and was visiting my sister in Chicago,\u201d recalls DeClue. \u201cWhen I complained about being bored with my job, she asked what I really wanted to do, and I said \u2018go to medical school\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s the first time I ever thought about it as something I could do.\n\n\u201cIt took me a while after that to picture myself as a doctor, but eventually I looked into it, had to take a few courses and then my entrance exam.\u201d\n\nShe was accepted at Chicago\u2019s Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, where she graduated, completing her residency at Mercy Hospital Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI was 29 when I started medical school, and when I got out, I had my own practice in the Chicago area from 1998-2006. That was a time of lots of hospital mergers and HMO\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWhen her husband was transferred to Maryland, she worked for a year at a VA outpatient clinic in West Virginia, then went back into the private sector.\n\nHer husband found a new position in the Warren County area last November, and the couple moved to Springboro. \u201cI spent time getting to know the area, applied for an Ohio medical license, and started looking at health care systems,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was drawn to the Premier Health Network because I liked their values and the people I met. There was a space available in Lebanon, so I started a practice there. I\u2019d joined the Lebanon Chamber of Commerce, and they had a ribbon cutting for me, which was very nice.\u201d\n\nDeClue practices general internal medicine, but a special interest is women\u2019s heart health. \u201cIn Chicago, I worked on the Go Red for Women Campaign, a preventive initiative of the American Heart Association, and had worked in a program to identify risk factors in younger women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about this being an age of prevention and taking a more holistic approach to health care, in part because of the Affordable Care Act. I think we\u2019re moving towards something good that will help many people.\u201d\n\nDeClue\u2019s practice, located at 990 Belvedere Dr. Suite A in Lebanon, is accepting new patients.
