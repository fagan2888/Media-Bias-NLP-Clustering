It has open enrollment now through March 31, so various health-care organizations and insurance brokers are getting trained and certified to be application counselors.\n\nThe Santa Barbara County Department of Social Services has counselors available now, and the Public Health Department, Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics and American Indian Health Services will have application counselors available starting in November.\n\nThe application process was originally estimated to take 30 minutes per person, but has increased to 90 minutes. Some people need two appointments to decide what insurance company to join and then which of the four plan levels to buy, Snyder said.\n\nOnly Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield have plans for Santa Barbara County on the exchange. If people want coverage by Jan. 1, they have to apply by Dec. 15.\n\nOne of the major problems with the state site has been the lack of a providers list, so consumers can\u2019t check which doctors, clinics and hospitals are included in the health plans. It\u2019s a problem for providers seeking answers, too.\n\nIt was clear from Thursday\u2019s seminar that many providers aren\u2019t sure about their own contracts with insurance companies, and whether they will be accepting patients with Covered California insurance plans.\n\nCenCal Health can\u2019t help with that, since it is not allowed to give contract advice and doesn\u2019t know what every individual agreement includes, Freeman noted.\n\nOne person brought up the example of Sansum Clinic, which is not signed up to be a provider for any exchange plans even though the organization wants be included.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was news to us,\u201d Sansum Clinic CEO Dr. Kurt Ransohoff told Noozhawk earlier this month. \u201cWe had operated under the assumption we would be in the network.\u201d\n\nSansum's primary- and specialty-care services handle 61,000 patient visits monthly, and neither type of provider is included in the exchange\u2019s insurance plans.\n\nThat means, if nothing changes, people who buy any kind of plan through the state exchange won\u2019t be able to use their insurance to see doctors at Sansum Clinic next year.\n\n\n\nThe insurance companies are creating \u201cnarrower\u201d networks of providers to try and make the insurance plans more affordable to consumers, Freeman said. As an impact, they seem to be offering lower reimbursements to providers \u2013 including doctors and clinics \u2013 but saying there are fewer providers in the pool, so a larger volume to make up the difference.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Giana Magnoli can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
