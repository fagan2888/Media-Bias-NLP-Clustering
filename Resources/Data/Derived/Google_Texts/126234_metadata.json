That rise has enriched investors by some $900 billion in 2015, as Matt Krantz at USA Today points out.\n\nAs Krantz also notes, though, some shareholders have done far, far better than the broader market. Jeff Bezos, for example.\n\nThe Amazon CEO has benefitted from a 40 percent rise in his company\u2019s stock in 2015, adding a whopping $9.5 billion in paper gains to his already sizable net worth to lift it to $38.2 billion, good enough for 11th highest in the world, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index.\n\nRelated: 7 Quirky Economic Indicators \u2013 from Dogs to Guns\u200b\n\nAMZN data by YCharts\n\nAs well as Bezos has done, four foreign billionaires have actually made more in 2015: Pan Sutong, chairman of Hong Kong investment conglomerate Goldin Group, has made more than $20 billion; Wang Jianlin, the founder and chairman of another Chinese conglomerate, Dalian Wanda, has made $19.4 billion; Zhou Qunfei, China\u2019s richest woman, has added nearly $11 billion; and Patrick Drahi, the French chairman and largest shareholder of Luxembourg-based telecom company Altice, has gained $9.7 billion.\n\nBezos may be far ahead of the U.S. pack, but the USA Today analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ shows some other CEOs of American companies have fared extremely well as a result of their stock holdings, too. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has made more than $1 billion on paper, while Google\u2019s Larry Page has gained just under $1 billion. And as shares of drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance have surged more than 11 percent this year, acting CEO Stefano Pessina has profited to the tune of $645.6 million. The CEOs of salesforce.com, Under Armour, Starbucks, Mohawk Industries, Constellation Brands and Netflix have all seen paper gains of more than $260 million so far in 2015.\n\nYou can see USA Today\u2019s full list here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The stock market has inched its way to one record high after another this year, with the S&P 500 gaining a solid if unspectacular 3.5 percent so far.
