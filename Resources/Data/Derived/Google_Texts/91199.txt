Bregal Builds Up Hunting Group Acrus with Tink's Acquisition

Arcus previously acquired scent-control brand Dead Down Wind

Bregal Partners-backed Arcus Hunting has closed a deal for hunting-supply business Tink's.

Tink's, headquartered in Covington, Georgia, makes deer lures, scents and other products to attract deer, including the Doe-In-Rut deer lure. The business, officially called Pat Acquisition LLC, was sold by Nashville private equity firm Frist Capital LLC. Tink's president Phil Robinson will be president of Arcus when the deal closes.

The acquisition is Arcus' second investment, following a November deal for scent-control brand Dead Down Wind. The company will continue to look for acquisitions in the bow hunting and archery accessories space.

Arcus is backed by New York private equity firm Bregal, which announced in May that it would start to focus on consumer goods. The firm set aside $100 million to invest in consumer goods companies in partnership with consumer brand expert Michael Magerman.

Harris Williams acted as Bregal's financial adviser for the deal, while Sidley Austin LLP provided legal advice. Bass Berry & Sims plc advised Frist Capital.
