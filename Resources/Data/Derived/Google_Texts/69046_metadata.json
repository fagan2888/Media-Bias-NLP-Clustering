Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. will be joining Colorado and Washington State in legalizing marijuana within their jurisdictions. Local municipalities around the country are experimenting with decriminalization as well, while other countries are taking a serious look at legalization as well. Uruguay legalized marijuana in a contorted government controlling fashion earlier this year and the country's legalization project could well fail but that failure's not stopping countries like Guatemala from considering their own legalization plans.

Privateer Holdings, a legal marijuana-oriented private equity firm, is hoping to change that, by licensing the name of perhaps the world's most well known marijuana user, Bob Marley. NBC News reports:\n\nMarley Natural will look like a modern consumer product, cleanly packaged and marketed with the help of the same agency that branded New Balance and Starbucks Coffee.

Sorry, folks, no pre-rolled joints. \"This is what the end of prohibition looks like,\" said Brendan Kennedy, the CEO of Privateer Holdings, which owns Marley Natural and plans to run it out of a loft space on Manhattan's Lower East Side. \"Bob Marley started to push for legalization more than 50 years ago. We're going to help him finish it.\"\n\nAccording to Forbes, Marley is the fifth highest earning dead celebrity, ranked between Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Legal marijuana is an estimated $2 billion a year industry in the United States.
