Gary Peters and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, said \u201ca special enrollment period would provide more time for Flint residents to enroll in quality health plans that are vital to their future health.\u201d\n\nFederal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services have been responding to the crisis in Flint, where drinking water has been found to have high levels of lead and researchers have found both an increased number of children with high lead levels in their blood and a rising number of cases of Legionnaires' disease, which may be related.\n\n\n\nIn a statement released by Peters\u2019 and Kildee\u2019s offices they said that quality health care is \u201cone factor that can help mitigate some of the adverse physical, cognitive and behavioral effects of lead exposure, particularly for young children who are most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nExperts say that lead poisoning, especially in children, can have lifetime impacts, affecting IQ and potentially leading to learning disabilities, speech and language problems and an increased risk for behavioral issues. In adults, it can be a contributing factor in increased blood pressure and hypertension, kidney problems and reproductive issues in men and women, the EPA says.\n\nThe deadline for enrollment under the ACA for coverage in 2016 is Jan. 31. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on health issues, the Flint area was one of the lowest areas for eligible recipients on the state insurance marketplace signing up in Michigan in 2015, at 37%.\n\nPeters and Kildee also asked DHHS to \u201ccommit additional resources to assist Flint families to secure health care coverage\u201d before the Jan. 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cThe health implications of this catastrophe are severe and its impact is irreversible, but signing Flint residents up for quality health care insurance will improve their long-term health outcomes,\u201d they said.\n\nPeters, Kildee and U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, also D-Mich., also sent a letter to Gov. Rick Snyder on Friday urging him to request a disaster declaration from the Small Business Administration which, if granted, could free up low-interest loans for businesses, homeowners and others impacted by the crisis.\n\nSnyder already lost a bid for a presidential disaster declaration in Flint because the statute limits those to natural disasters, fires and explosions. But the Michigan members of Congress said he could still receive a physical or economic disaster declaration from the Small Business Administration.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: 703-854-8947 or tspangler@freepress.com.
