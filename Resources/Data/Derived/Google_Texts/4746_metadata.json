The state had the usual problems (worse, I believe, than in most states) getting its system and its web site up and running. Once the enrollment period got underway, the dominant insurer turned out to be PreferredOne. Reportedly offering the lowest premiums in the nation, PreferredOne signed up nearly 60% of all MNSure participants. So it was a bombshell when PreferredOne announced earlier this week that it will no longer participate in the state\u2019s exchange, saying that \u201ccontinuing to provide this coverage through MNsure is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nIt seems a foregone conclusion that this will lead to higher premiums, at a minimum. PreferredOne\u2019s decision also calls into question the economic viability of the Obamacare model. State officials tried to downplay the significance of the dominant carrier\u2019s exiting the market:\n\nA day after a key insurance player announced its exit from MNsure, leaders of the state\u2019s insurance exchange called the move a normal evolution of a competitive marketplace and laid out plans to improve the upcoming enrollment period for both consumers and brokers. \u2026 [MNSure CEO Scott Leitz] reiterated that he \u201cfully anticipated\u201d that plans would change from year to year. \u201cIt is a competitive marketplace,\u201d he told the board, \u201cand we don\u2019t pick winners and losers.\u201d\n\nUnder Obamacare, you could say that the government only picks winners. Through 2016, taxpayers will subsidize insurance companies\u2019 losses. Such subsidies were considered necessary to induce carriers to participate in the government-sponsored exchanges, despite the likelihood that the risk pool on the exchanges would be unfavorable. The fact that a company with 60% of the Obamacare exchange market considers the business unsustainable, even with federal subsidies, is ominous.\n\nIn Minnesota, PreferredOne\u2019s decision will probably continue to reverberate. Individuals with PreferredOne policies purchased on the exchange will see those policies automatically renewed, unless they do something different. The catch is that, with PreferredOne no longer participating in MNSure, those people will no longer be eligible for Obamacare subsidies, so they will see premium increases\u2013in many cases, huge ones.\n\nThis sort of thing will keep happening for years to come. Democrats are smugly telling reporters that Obamacare is now an established fact and we should all get used to it. In reality, the law is like a series of bombs timed to go off as various deadlines kick in. Ultimately, the awful economics of the law can\u2019t be denied. Premiums and deductibles will rise, and coverages will shrink, insofar as they are able to given the law\u2019s expansive and sometimes irrational mandates. By 2017, when the federal government will stop reimbursing insurance companies\u2019 losses, premiums will be far higher than when Obamacare went into effect. The Democrats apparently hope that no one will notice. To me, that seems unlikely.\n\nThe Minnesota PreferredOne story doesn\u2019t appear to have gotten any national attention, which makes me wonder whether similar developments are occurring around the country, each one only a local news story. Obamacare may be crumbling, one state at a time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Obamacare in Minnesota is called MNSure.
