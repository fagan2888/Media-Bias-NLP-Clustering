He also shaped some of the policies and regulations in the Affordable Care Act. Now he\u2019s turning his attention to health IT startup Valera Health, which seeks to develop an infrastructure for behavioral health care coordination.\n\nMaybe it would be overstating things to say technology startups addressing behavioral health represent a popular area, but it is certainly getting a lot of attention with some high profile companies such as Quartet Health, Lyra Health, ShareCare and Big White Wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, it\u2019s an open question what will be the winning approach and that\u2019s encouraging a lot of experimentation.\n\nValera Health is designed to be an end-to-end solution and takes a multifaceted approach that includes patient assessments, data analytics and remote patient monitoring. It takes data sets from providers and payers and uses them to identify patients with chronic conditions with a propensity towards behavioral health problems. It involves patients\u2019 use of an app to report how they feel in a simplified questionnaire. Patients\u2019 use of their mobile devices is assessed to see how active they are, how much they\u2019re read, how much they\u2019ve slept. Another aspect of its program are behavioral health coaches who communicate with patients and the rest of the care team. It also plans to include machine learning.\n\nAmong its advisers are Dr. Sachin Jain, CMO at CareMore Health System; Dr. Henry Chung, Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the CMO of Montefiore Medical Center, a Pioneer ACO; and Chip Kahn, CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals.\n\nIn a phone interview, Tsang, Valera Health CEO and co-founder, said he sees this move as a natural evolution of his career. When he was the CMO at Charles B Wang Community Health Center, which is part of New York University School of Medicine, much of their patient population were uninsured or underinsured Asian immigrants from China and Korea.\n\nHe noted that about 20 percent of its patients had some sort of behavioral health issue, but it only had one psychiatrist who was bilingual \u2014 he spoke Mandarin.\n\nThere was a high demand for psychosocial services. So they made the psychiatrist a consulting member of its primary care team. \u201cWe used a collaborative care model as a way to bring psychosocial services into primary care,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cWe found this model extremely effective.\u201d\n\nSo despite the fact that a lot of other companies are developing their own approach to integrating technology with behavioral health, Tsang said his background has given him a unique perspective.\n\n\u201cI know what the challenges are, what the issues are and what\u2019s effective. I think that\u2019s critical for developing the next generation of technology to be true to the model.\u201d\n\nTsang said behavioral health has become a greater priority for some states, given that one in four adults have some sort of mental health problem and more than 60 percent of them are not getting any care. He noted that CMS grants have been awarded to at least 10-12 states with a priority to integrate mental health and medical services within the Medicaid system.\n\nIt is in the process of developing pilot projects so payers an clinical partners can assess its platform. It is also in discussions for a pilot with a specialty mental health provider that works with psychosis patients.\n\nTsang contributed to the development of ACO regulations along with the development of a national framework for the use of health information technology and electronic health records to improve coordination and quality.\n\nLooking back on that work, he expresses frustration with the limited progress of interoperability. On the subject of payment reforms and ACOs, Tsang says the most successful ACOs, are the ones that were fully positioned to do risk-sharing because they had the right care processes and technology infrastructure in place. That kind of balance will inform the success of programs going forward, including his own company.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Valera Health is designed to be an end-to-end solution and takes a multifaceted approach that includes patient assessments, data analytics and remote patient monitoring.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Valera Health is designed to be an end-to-end solution and takes a multifaceted approach that includes patient assessments, data analytics and remote patient monitoring.", "title": "Former chief medical officer of Merck subsidiary turns attention to behavioral health startup", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AppScreenshot2-1.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-20T20:32:44-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/behavioral-health-technology/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AppScreenshot2-1.png", "description": "Valera Health is designed to be an end-to-end solution and takes a multifaceted approach that includes patient assessments, data analytics and remote patient monitoring.", "card": "summary", "title": "Former chief medical officer of Merck subsidiary turns attention to behavioral health startup - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,behavioral health, health IT, New York, New York City, Startups, Thomas Tsang, Valera Health, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Valera Health", "published_time": "2015-11-17T09:51:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T20:32:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now he\u2019s turning his attention to health IT startup Valera Health, which seeks to develop an infrastructure for behavioral health care coordination.\nAnother aspect of its program are behavioral health coaches who communicate with patients and the rest of the care team.\nIt takes data sets from providers and payers and uses them to identify patients with chronic conditions with a propensity towards behavioral health problems.\nIt is also in discussions for a pilot with a specialty mental health provider that works with psychosis patients.\n\u201cWe used a collaborative care model as a way to bring psychosocial services into primary care,\u201d Tsang said."}
