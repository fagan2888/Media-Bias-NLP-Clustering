At a July concert in Atlanta, Mr. Keith invited members of the U.S. military on stage to spotlight their service as a special tribute to the July 16 shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. Marines and one U.S. Navy sailor, according to WSB-TV 2, Atlanta. The report noted that the \u201cmost heartwarming\u201d moment at Mr. Keith\u2019s concert was when the mother of one of the four soldiers killed during the shooting also took the stage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met so many great, brave servicemen and -women over the years and had so many wonderful experiences, that I can barely remember them all,\u201d Mr. Keith said in a press statement regarding his work with the USO. \u201cI love our nation\u2019s troops and I won\u2019t ever stop doing my part to extend my thanks.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Mr. Keith\u2019s shows so popular, though, is that he mixes that flag-waving patriotism with plenty of songs about pure fun. On his current Good Times & Pick Up Lines tour, Mr. Keith has opened concerts with a rendition of the patriotic \u201cMade in America\u201d before moving into other hits including \u201cWhiskey Girls,\u201d \u201cBeer for My Horses\u201d and more that revved up the dancing, singing and partying crowd for his most patriotic songs, including \u201cCourtesy of the Red, White & Blue.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Keith brings his show to the D.C. area this week, don\u2019t be surprised if he rolls out a few new songs too. Mr. Keith just announced the Oct. 9 release of his latest album, \u201c35 mph Town,\u201d which includes \u201cDrunk Americans,\u201d his latest single.\n\nif you go\n\nWHAT: Toby Keith\u2019s Good Times & Pick Up Lines Tour, along with Chris Janson and The Raging Idiots\n\nWHERE: Jiffy Lube Live, 7800 Cellar Door Dr., Bristow, Virginia, 20136\n\nWHEN: Saturday, 7 p.m.\n\nINFO: Tickets $30 to $200 by calling 703/754-6400 or visiting LiveNation.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you're ready to celebrate the red, white and blue while whooping it up to some country music, you won't want to miss the upcoming Toby Keith concert.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If you\u2019re ready to celebrate the red, white and blue while whooping it up to some country music, you won\u2019t want to miss the upcoming Toby Keith concert.", "title": "Country Times: Toby Keith brings his American pride to D.C.", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/3/toby-keith-brings-his-american-pride-to-dc/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/03/8_3_2015_ap783265315301-38201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/03/8_3_2015_ap783265315301-38201.jpg", "description": "If you're ready to celebrate the red, white and blue while whooping it up to some country music, you won't want to miss the upcoming Toby Keith concert.", "card": "summary", "title": "Country Times: Toby Keith brings his American pride to D.C."}, "Author": "Nancy Dunham      -  Special to the Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Toby Keith"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Keith just announced the Oct. 9 release of his latest album, \u201c35 mph Town,\u201d which includes \u201cDrunk Americans,\u201d his latest single.\n\u201cI write songs everyday,\u201d said Mr. Keith after his recent induction into the hall of fame.\nIf you\u2019re ready to celebrate the red, white and blue while whooping it up to some country music, you won\u2019t want to miss the upcoming Toby Keith concert.\nThe report noted that the \u201cmost heartwarming\u201d moment at Mr. Keith\u2019s concert was when the mother of one of the four soldiers killed during the shooting also took the stage.\nif you goWHAT: Toby Keith\u2019s Good Times & Pick Up Lines Tour, along with Chris Janson and The Raging IdiotsWHERE: Jiffy Lube Live, 7800 Cellar Door Dr., Bristow, Virginia, 20136WHEN: Saturday, 7 p.m.INFO: Tickets $30 to $200 by calling 703/754-6400 or visiting LiveNation.com"}
