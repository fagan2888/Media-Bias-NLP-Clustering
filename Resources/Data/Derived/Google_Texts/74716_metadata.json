And the facilities are expected to receive even more patients as events unfold.\n\nObvious, if perhaps obscured in the political conversation, is that health insurance itself is neither health care, a guarantee of access to health care nor, fundamentally, good health. If facilities or providers do not accept a particular insurance plan for whatever reason \u2014 most likely because it is not considered to provide sufficient reimbursement for care \u2014 a newly insured person will not necessarily have more or any different access to health-care services.\n\nNonprofit health centers and charitable clinics provide access to primary and preventive health services in a nondiscriminatory way. For all the many, intense disputes that continue to exist about the ACA, virtually none exists that more of these types of services are needed to improve health and reduce costs.\n\nIf, as intended, broader insurance coverage means that health centers and charitable clinics receive payment for patients they have always cared for even when uninsured, the proven benefits of providing such access and care will be expanded for millions of people. Alternatively, if expanding insurance coverage becomes a balloon-squeezing exercise paid for by reducing reimbursements for care, the intended benefits of expanded access to care may be elusive.\n\nSo, as the ACA unfolds \u2014 differently in each state, with a big bet on insurance products and markets to expand access, improve results and reduce costs \u2014 the status of these facilities, which serve more than 1 in 15 people in the United States today, will be a reasonable proxy to assess how things are going and whether the legislation\u2019s broad purposes of better, more affordable, more accessible health care and better health are being advanced.\n\nDirect Relief will be publishing its annual State of the Healthcare Safety Net report in the coming weeks to highlight this particular, important issue.\n\nCharitable efforts such as those conducted by Direct Relief to help patients obtain medications they need but cannot afford and support locally run nonprofit clinics that serve vulnerable people typically exist for people not served through either commercial activity or government programs. These efforts have been expanding rapidly in the past few years to fill very large needs otherwise unfilled.\n\nWith high hopes that such needs will be lessened, Direct Relief will continue to support people who will likely continue to need help with support to the safety-net facilities that provide it.\n\n\u2014 Thomas Tighe is president and CEO of Direct Relief.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.noozhawk.com/article/thomas_tighe_canaries_in_the_affordable_care_act_coal_mine_20131003", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://www.noozhawk.com/images/uploads/Noozhawk-Square-Tall.jpg", "height": 1200}, "type": "website", "title": "Thomas Tighe: Canaries in the Affordable Care Act Coal Mine"}, "verify-v1": "2OdRnTnazKl17MQhud6CSYZNIXpr4puwbj3YpymvWFI="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf56b\"", "article_summary": "Obvious, if perhaps obscured in the political conversation, is that health insurance itself is neither health care, a guarantee of access to health care nor, fundamentally, good health.\nDirect Relief will be publishing its annual State of the Healthcare Safety Net report in the coming weeks to highlight this particular, important issue.\nNonprofit health centers and charitable clinics provide access to primary and preventive health services in a nondiscriminatory way.\n\u2014 Thomas Tighe is president and CEO of Direct Relief.\nAlternatively, if expanding insurance coverage becomes a balloon-squeezing exercise paid for by reducing reimbursements for care, the intended benefits of expanded access to care may be elusive."}
