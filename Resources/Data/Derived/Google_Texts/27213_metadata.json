When he looked down he discovered fang marks on his foot.\n\nFerguson drove himself to Lake Norman Regional Medical Center where he received anti-venom medication for the bite.\n\nLater, upon receiving the bill, more than $81,000 of which was for the four-vial dose of anti-venom, he decided to do some research on the price of the medicine.\n\nFerguson and his wife looked on the Internet and found retail prices for the medicine ranging from $750 to $12,000 per vial, or $3,000 to $48,000 per four vials.\n\nFerguson\u2019s treatment was covered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina. With the contractual discount through his insurance, the total bill was reduced to $20,227. Of that, he paid around $5,400 to cover the deductible and co-pays.\n\nThe medical care was \u201cbeyond phenomenal,\u201d Ferguson told the Charlotte Observer. \u201cIt was just the sticker shock.\u201d\n\nWhat particularly bothered Ferguson was that the hospital charged so much initially. Even with the insurance discount, the hospital wound up collecting about twice what Medicare would have paid.\n\nLake Norman Regional, a private for-profit hospital, is under scrutiny by others for questionable practices.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer reported that in a 2010 lawsuit, recently unsealed in Mecklenburg County, two emergency room doctors alleged that Lake Norman and Davis Regional Medical Center in Statesville committed fraud by offering kickbacks to doctors who would order unnecessary tests and admit more patients to increase corporate revenues. The federal Department of Justice is also investigating.\n\nHealth Management Associates, which owns the two hospitals, has denied these allegations.\n\nSource: Charlotte Observer", "article_metadata": {"description": "MOORESVILLE, N.C. -- A Mooresville man believes he was overcharged for treatment of a snake bite last year when he was billed $89,227 for an 18-hour hospital stay, according to the Charlotte Observer.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "MOORESVILLE, N.C. \u2014 A Mooresville man believes he was overcharged for treatment of a snake bite last year when he was billed $89,227 for an 18-hour hospital stay, according to the Charlotte O\u2026", "title": "NC snakebite victim charged $89,000 for 18-hour hospital stay", "url": "http://myfox8.com/2014/01/28/nc-snakebite-victim-charged-89000-for-18-hour-hospital-stay/", "image": {"width": 507, "identifier": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/needle.jpg", "height": 285}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/needle.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@myfox8", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@myfox8"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Sports and more from WGHP Fox 8 Television", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576468704", "fb": {"pages": 66055982622}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://myfox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d6825caa4f715bb372290d2344aae986?s=16", "application-name": "myfox8.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news", "published_time": "2014-01-29T04:34:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T04:34:47+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "Yn8rglGvxxL_bChOFSZTPKslhj-7-DDnVf-rpVixhQs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3b7\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 NC snakebite victim charged $89,000 for 18-hour hospital stayMOORESVILLE, N.C. \u2014 A Mooresville man believes he was overcharged for treatment of a snake bite last year when he was billed $89,227 for an 18-hour hospital stay, according to the Charlotte Observer.\nFerguson drove himself to Lake Norman Regional Medical Center where he received anti-venom medication for the bite.\nSource: Charlotte Observer\nLake Norman Regional, a private for-profit hospital, is under scrutiny by others for questionable practices.\n\u201cIt was just the sticker shock.\u201dWhat particularly bothered Ferguson was that the hospital charged so much initially."}
