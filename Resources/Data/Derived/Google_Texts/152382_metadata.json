A vote in the affirmative would usher in rules preventing internet providers from selling data \u201cfast lanes\u201d to customers who are willing and able to pay for the privilege.\n\nAlready, critics are suggesting that the new rules will create a burden akin to (or worse than) the sweeping health care reform law Congress enacted in 2010.\n\n\"Net Neutrality\" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government. \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014\n\nBut that\u2019s a flawed argument.\n\nWhat Obamacare did\n\nThe health care overhaul changed the way that the government spends hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for health care, in an attempt to protect the US budget from the growing cost of health care and to give more Americans access to health insurance. Congress wrote a law requiring all Americans to get medical coverage, and created subsidies\u2014paid for by new taxes\u2014to make the coverage more affordable. It also set up new marketplaces for purchasing the insurance, set rules regarding how insurance companies could treat their clients and how Medicare could pay doctors and hospitals, and expanded Medicaid coverage for poor Americans.\n\nWhat \u201cnet neutrality\u201d will, and won\u2019t, do\n\nSome major differences right off the bat: No new laws, no new taxes, and no new spending.\n\nCongress already passed a law, in 1996, giving the Federal Communications Commission the authority to do what its chairman, Tom Wheeler, expects the agency to do Thursday, which is change a legal framework. Rather than thinking about companies that sell internet service as providing \u201cinformation services,\u201d they will see them as providing \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d\n\nMost people wouldn\u2019t blink an eye at Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon being classified as telecoms (indeed, the latter two arguably are better known for their phone service than anything else). But the distinction makes all the difference in terms of the FCC\u2019s ability to get these companies\u2014and other internet service providers\u2014to treat all the data on their networks equally. When the FCC tried to force internet service providers to do this in 2010, without calling them telecommunications services, the companies sued to block the law and won\u2014because the government can only put those kinds of restrictions on telecommunications services.\n\nWhat really had the companies worried was the prospect of the FCC regulating prices for all of their services. But no one sees that as ideal, and the FCC already has said it will formally renounce its rate-setting powers, along with its ability to level fees, a process called forbearance. While some have argued that this won\u2019t work, Sprint, which has broken ranks with the rest of the US telecom industry to endorse the kind of rules the FCC is proposing, says forbearance worked fine in the mobile phone market, for instance.\n\nMiddle ground\n\nOne big difference between the debate over health care reform and the debate over net neutrality is that a lot of Obamacare\u2019s opponents, conservatives mainly, just plain disagreed with the point of the health care law. They didn\u2019t think the government had any business interfering in the insurance market in the first place. That\u2019s one reason why there has been so little success developing a Republican alternative to Obamacare.\n\nBut when it comes to net neutrality, there\u2019s already a lot of agreement. Public opinion polling shows that net neutrality isn\u2019t a partisan issue, with Republicans and Democrats both supporting it. And the companies involved complied with the three main rules the FCC wants to put in place from 2010 until last year: No blocking lawful content; no slowing data delivery based on content, device or service; and no \u201cpaid prioritization,\u201d or fast lanes that favor some internet traffic over other traffic. This, the FCC says, will protect young companies from barriers to growth and internet users from discrimination.\n\nComcast has even noted in its campaign against the rules that it already is following them as a result of its merger with NBC, though that constraint expires in 2018. Even some Republican lawmakers have had a last-minute conversion, saying they are willing to rewrite telecommunications law to enforce net neutrality, so the FCC won\u2019t re-classify internet service providers.\n\nWhat would Obamacare for the internet look like?\n\nTelecom lobbyists and their allies know the first step toward killing the new rules is making it a partisan issue, and they can do that just by putting the president\u2019s name on it\u2014hence Obamanet. That\u2019s also why members of Congress are launching an investigation into communications between the White House and the FCC. The theory of their case is that the White House inappropriately influenced the independent agency when the president endorsed the new approach, but since the framework chosen by Wheeler has been on the table throughout the process, proving such allegations will be difficult.\n\nFor the sake of a thought experiment, consider what Obamacare for the internet might look like: It would start with the recognition that internet costs are spiraling out of control and costing the public too much. The government might decide to write a law requiring internet service providers cut costs and do more to expand access, but in return, it would require all Americans to pay for internet access, in turn requiring new subsidies and taxes. The government might decide to set up its own public network to compete with the incumbents and drive down prices, or invest in a public-private partnership to provide internet access, as Australia did.\n\nEither way, the new net neutrality rules are nothing like the health care overhaul. All they ask is that the private companies who sell internet services to consumers treat their customers equally. It\u2019s not a policy without costs to those companies or without potential unintended consequences, but it doesn\u2019t need to be a partisan brawl, either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US\u00a0telecom regulators are set to vote Thursday (Feb. 26) to enforce net neutrality, the idea\u2014backed by the White House and by content providers ranging from Netflix to Major League Baseball\u2014that all data should be treated equally by internet service providers.
