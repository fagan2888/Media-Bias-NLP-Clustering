For starters there will be actual bands on a real stage, as opposed to, say, random AC/DC riffs wafting over the Trinity River. And, there will be Port-a-Johns.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s now a thing \u2014 a giant, glorious, \u201cfamily friendly, all inclusive, fun and free to attend\u201d thing, in the words of this morning\u2019s heads-up.\n\nAnd, like the open-carrying gun-toters who inspired this event, the guitarristas aren\u2019t going anywhere. Kooda\u2019s actually assembled a five-man board-turned-\u201dteam spirit squad\u201d \u2014 himself, Majestic Theatre general manager Mike Schwedler, KNON deejay and marketing consultant Reid Robinson, rally co-founder Kyle Reynolds and musician-turned-artist-turned-Don\u2019t Shred On Me Logo-creator Pat Ramseur \u2014 to cement its longevity.\n\nBut the once-and-future Nervebreaker wants to make one thing clear a year after the Open Carry Guitar Rally\u2019s well-received inception: It might have begun as a response to the long-gun-lovers who wear their weapons to Chipotles and Targets, but it\u2019s \u201cnever been the main thing.\u201d\n\nSays Kooda, \u201cWith a group like this, there are always going to be people who are totally anti-gun and those who aren\u2019t but believe the right to bear arms shouldn\u2019t supersede the greater right for all Americans to feel safe, secure and at ease when they are in public. The proper response to seeing weapons displayed openly is alarm. You should be concerned. To desensitize people to that sight is dangerous, foolish and would certainly lead to very bad things happening. With guitars, the worst that may happen is a bad rendition of \u2018Smoke On The Water.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut a bigger event in 2015 means a bigger budget, though anything would be bigger than last year\u2019s let\u2019s-put-on-show march that took on a life of its own. With a stage, bands, food trucks and porta-potties come permits, security, sanitation and equipment rental, and those things don\u2019t come cheap. Hence the just-launched GoFundMe page, which is hoping to raise $15,000 to cover costs. Says Kooda, leftover money \u2014 if there is any \u2014 will go to the Carter Albrecht Music Foundation and others to be determined.\n\n\u201cWith your help, we can host this Dallas event again, make it better, involve more people, make a sensible statement, and raise some money for some good Dallas charities,\u201d says the OCGR statement sent this morning. \u201cAs before, this is an event that belongs to all of us, and we wholeheartedly encourage everyone to open their minds and let those ideas flow.\u201d\n\nJust not this one.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzL29wZW4tY2FycnktZ3VpdGFyLXJhbGx5LXRvLXJldHVybi1mb3ItZW5jb3JlLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLW1heS0zLW9uLWNvbnRpbmVudGFsLWF2ZS1icmlkZ2UuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Last year's Open Carry Guitar Rally along the Continental Avenue Bridge wasn't a one-off jam session after all.
