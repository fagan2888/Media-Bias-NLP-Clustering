Salvation Army

You can bet they’re at the top of Santa’s “nice” list.

A Minnesota couple dropped a $500,000 check in a Salvation Army red kettle Saturday, the largest donation ever made through the program in the U.S., according to a spokeswoman for the organization.

The donation was made at the Cub Foods in Rosemount, Minn., a small town in Dakota County, the spokeswoman said.

“We are simply stunned and honored to have received such a large gift,” said Major Jeff Strickler, the commander of the Twin Cities Salvation Army, the branch that collected the donation. “This is a true blessing and it couldn't come at a better time for The Salvation Army and the people we serve.”

The largest donation to the program before this one was $25,000.

The couple, who asked the Salvation Army not to disclose their identities, told the Twin Cities Salvation Army that they hoped the gift would encourage others to donate this holiday season.

They also wanted to honor one of their fathers, who served in the trenches in World War I and was always grateful to the Salvation Army Donut Lassies who brought soldiers free coffee and doughnuts, according to a statement released by the organization.

The couple had given to the organization before, but never anything approaching the amount they gave on Saturday, the spokeswoman said.
