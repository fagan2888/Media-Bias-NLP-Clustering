Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was back in New Hampshire on Monday for a rally in Atkinson, where he spent a lot of his time focusing on the people covering his campaign.

From the moment he got to the podium, the insults started coming as Trump focused much of his distaste on the media.

"You are going to find out about the media, folks," Trump said. "They are the worst."

The GOP presidential frontrunner complained about recent coverage of a poll in Iowa that didn't put him on top, pointing out that he is winning so many other polls.

"Every week, I go up, up, up, up, and every week, these idiots on television say, 'I think he has peaked now,'" Trump said. "They have been saying this for months."

He also complained that the camera doesn't show the big crowds he attracts.

"They show my face," he said. "I say, 'Take those cameras off my face.' They never scan."

The criticism didn't end there as Trump slammed the other Republican candidates.

"(Ben) Carson is lower energy than (Jeb) Bush," he said. "I don't get it."

Trump took credit for Bush doing poorly in the polls.

"Bush, his campaign is a disaster," Trump said. "It's because I came along. I'm proud of it."

He blasted the way the country is being run and touted his calls to build a stronger military, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and make intelligent trade deals.

But the topic kept going back to the press.

"I really learned two things," Trump said. "How brilliant the public is -- because in theory, with my press, I shouldn't be at 48 percent. It's amazing. And the other thing is how bad the press is. Those are the two things I learned the most. Can't you believe it?"
