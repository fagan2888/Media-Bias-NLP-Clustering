Only 22 percent of 492 global and regional benefits managers for such firms who responded to a recent Towers Watson survey said they have timely and comprehensive access to aggregate spending data.\n\nFor multinationals, the operations and delivery of benefits tend to be extremely decentralized. Each local business typically has a handle on its benefits spending, but data on it is not often recorded in systems \u201cin a way that somebody can just go in and extract it,\u201d says Michael Broomhead, senior international consultant for the consulting firm.\n\nPremium expenses for medical, life and disability insurance, for example, tend \u201cto be rolled through payroll into local P&L as a cash expense along with a whole bunch of other cash expenses\u201d and not often identified as separate line items.\n\nThat means a global benefits manager trying to understand the full scope of a multinational\u2019s benefits-related risks and opportunities must communicate with each local benefits manager. \u201cIf there is a dire need you can find the information, but it\u2019s painful, and the problem is that it\u2019s a snapshot in time, and then it changes,\u201d Broomhead says. Towers Watson\u2019s survey report calls the situation \u201ca key weakness in global governance and oversight, for which global and regional managers need to find a solution.\u201d\n\nCurrently, such managers\u2019 best shot at obtaining aggregate worldwide data is through insurers with which their companies have multinational pooling arrangements, under which benefits programs in multiple countries are combined so as to generate financial savings and better risk control. But that information is generally not available until the end of vendor accounting cycles, meaning companies may get data 12 to 18 months after expenses are incurred. \u201cThe delayed reporting is a significant flaw in the process,\u201d says Broomhead.\n\nFor the most part, big multinational companies have not yet adjusted to a gradual shift from a longtime historical norm, where medical costs outside the United States were not \u201cmaterial,\u201d Broomhead says. Even now, he notes, because of the prevailing socialized-medicine and integrated-care environments in many other countries, companies\u2019 per-employee medical costs there are typically no more than 40 percent, and in many cases as little as 5 or 10 percent, of what they are in the United States.\n\nBut because of various trends playing out in recent years \u2014 medical-cost inflation and population growth outside the United States, as well as the simple fact that many multinationals now employ as many or more people outside their home country as within it \u2014 the global cost of benefits is increasingly problematic. Companies need their systems and accounting procedures to catch up with that reality.\n\n\u201cOur survey tells us what we also hear from our clients broadly, which is that first and foremost companies are concerned about managing cost \u2014 and yet for the most part they do not have any reliable aggregated data on what they\u2019re spending that they can pull together when they need it at headquarters,\u201d Broomhead says.", "article_metadata": {"date": 20140625, "news_keywords": "benefits spending, medical costs, michael broomhead, multinational companies, towers watson", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Highly decentralized benefits programs hamstring big global companies from optimizing spending and risk management, a Towers Watson survey suggests.", "title": "Global Benefits Spending Is a Mystery to Multinationals", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2014/06/Can-You-Get-Timely-Comprehensive-Global-Benefits-Cost-Data-Percent-saying-yes-_chartbuilder.png", "updated_time": "2014-06-25T14:46:52+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2014/06/global-benefits-spending-mystery-multinationals/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Highly decentralized benefits programs hamstring big global companies from optimizing spending and risk management, a Towers Watson survey suggests.", "title": "Global Benefits Spending Is a Mystery to Multinationals", "creator": "@cfo", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Global Benefits Spending Is a Mystery to Multinationals", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Global Benefits Spending Is a Mystery to Multinationals\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2014\\/06\\/global-benefits-spending-mystery-multinationals\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-25 14:18:24\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-25 14:46:52\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":196780,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"benefits spending\",\"medical costs\",\"Michael Broomhead\",\"multinational companies\",\"Towers Watson\"],\"categories\":[\"Global Business\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Risk &amp; Compliance\",\"Risk Management\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/06\\/Can-You-Get-Timely-Comprehensive-Global-Benefits-Cost-Data-Percent-saying-yes-_chartbuilder.png\"}", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Strategy", "tag": "Towers Watson", "published_time": "2014-06-25T14:18:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T14:46:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Highly decentralized benefits programs hamstring big global companies from optimizing spending and risk management, a Towers Watson survey suggests."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e80\"", "article_summary": "That means a global benefits manager trying to understand the full scope of a multinational\u2019s benefits-related risks and opportunities must communicate with each local benefits manager.\nOnly 22 percent of 492 global and regional benefits managers for such firms who responded to a recent Towers Watson survey said they have timely and comprehensive access to aggregate spending data.\nAbly managing the costs of employee benefits on a global scale remains elusive for most big, multinational companies.\nCompanies need their systems and accounting procedures to catch up with that reality.\nFor multinationals, the operations and delivery of benefits tend to be extremely decentralized."}
