They shouldn\u2019t be, said Jason Donville, president of Donville Kent Asset Management, which has about an 8-per-cent weighting in CGI. \u201cI think CGI is a screaming buy right here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a lot of false risk priced into it right now.\u201d\n\nThe Montreal-based IT services company quietly enjoyed a near-uninterrupted, five-year stock run before it became embroiled in the botched launch of the Obamacare website last October. As a key contractor on the error-laden rollout of healthcare.gov, CGI suffered a blow to its reputation and earned a rebuke from famous short-seller Jim Chanos, who took a position against the company.\n\nThe stock has lagged ever since, trading about 15 per cent lower than its November record high of $40.72. But while the PR mess wasn\u2019t pretty, it had little bearing on CGI\u2019s revenues. Since announcing a transformative acquisition in May, 2012, Europe arguably has become the more important market for CGI than the United States.\n\nThe $2.7-billion acquisition of Britain-based Logica PLC landed CGI in a different league, doubling its size and heavily exposing its revenues to the European market.\n\nMany questioned the wisdom of betting on a continent still shaking from the sovereign debt crisis.\n\n\u201cThere are very different views for what the outlook for Europe is,\u201d said Paul Taylor, chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BMO Asset Management, which holds CGI shares. \u201cWe think Europe is where the U.S. was three years ago.\u201d\n\nNow, CGI is making progress on the European front. For the last two quarters, CGI\u2019s ratio of bookings to billings was greater than one, an indication that demand is exceeding supply. \u201cBook-to-bill\u201d is a closely watched metric in the tech sector.\n\n\u201cStrong bookings in Europe bode well and with strong cash flows expected through the rest of the year \u2026 we recommend taking advantage of recent price weakness to accumulate stock,\u201d Raymond James analyst Steven Li said in recent note. Mr. Li reaffirmed his \u201coutperform\u201d rating and $44 share price target.\n\nSell-side analysts skew heavily to the bullish side on CGI, with 16 out of 20 recommending a \u201cbuy\u201d at an average price target of $43.15, representing a 23-per-cent premium over Thursday\u2019s closing price of $35.\n\nBut even those estimates understate CGI\u2019s growth and ignore the company\u2019s propensity to expand by acquisition, Mr. Donville said. \u201cMost analysts are reluctant to put anything into the projections in terms of growth from acquisitions, even though they know there\u2019s a high probability.\u201d\n\nAcquisitions are a requirement for growth in the IT business, where customers tend not to switch providers and where buying a $50-million company might be cheaper than trying to poach $50-million worth of business, he said.\n\nAfter considering potential future acquisitions, Mr. Donville is confident in CGI\u2019s ability to generate a return on equity of at least 15 per cent per year.\n\nAnd investors can buy into that growth on the cheap, he said. CGI stock is currently trading at about 8.9 times estimated 2015 cash flow. \u201cAnd this is an expensive market. There\u2019s a lot of stuff out there trading in the 20s.\u201d\n\nThe discount on the stock is largely explained by CGI\u2019s association with the healthcare.gov debacle, Mr. Taylor said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t view it as a growth story, they view it as a stumbling IT services provider.\u201d\n\nBut that stain will fade, said Brian Acker, president and CEO of Acker Finley, which topped up its position in CGI in January. Canadian investors should turn their attention to what is now the country\u2019s largest tech company, which happens to be trading at a compelling discount, Mr. Acker said.\n\n\u201cThe market will recognize that over time. When good companies have a correction like that, that\u2019s your opportunity.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Although temporarily stained by the botched Obamacare rollout, Canadian tech company keeps growing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Although temporarily stained by the botched Obamacare rollout, Canadian tech company keeps growing", "title": "CGI Group\u2019s \u2018screaming buy\u2019 allure", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/investors-remain-cautious-on-a-cgi-false-risk/article17925125/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/81f/globe-investor/investment-ideas/article17925124.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/obama-care11rb1.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although temporarily stained by the botched Obamacare rollout, Canadian tech company keeps growing", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/17925125", "iphone": "tgam://article/17925125"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2014-04-10 07:16:30 EDT", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "CGI Group Inc.;cgi;acquisition;tech company;Canadian tech company;healthcare.gov;Obamacare;Technology;GIB.A-T;", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "news", "id": 17925125, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "But even those estimates understate CGI\u2019s growth and ignore the company\u2019s propensity to expand by acquisition, Mr. Donville said.\nCGI stock is currently trading at about 8.9 times estimated 2015 cash flow.\nThey shouldn\u2019t be, said Jason Donville, president of Donville Kent Asset Management, which has about an 8-per-cent weighting in CGI.\n\u201cI think CGI is a screaming buy right here,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe think Europe is where the U.S. was three years ago.\u201dNow, CGI is making progress on the European front."}
