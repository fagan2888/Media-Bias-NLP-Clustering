EDITOR: “To live is to change, to be perfect is to have changed often.”

We presently find ourselves at the end of one era and the beginning of another. After 125 years of faithful, selfless and professional service, we must now bid a tearful “adieu” to our beloved Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother.

Who has had a greater impact on the history of Marshfield? In a nutshell, the sisters taught us how to truly bring healing to people. They accomplished this by the grace of God, as it was always their love for the Lord that fueled their ability to treat each person as if it were Jesus Christ himself. The sisters leave us with an amazing legacy: because they were close to God, the sisters treated both body and soul and their patients always knew and appreciated this; as people of principle, the sisters refused procedures that assault our dignity, thus eschewing things like abortion and vasectomies. Finally, the sisters were wholeheartedly committed to serving this community and that meant even the poor always had access to health care.

We now pray for Marshfield Clinic and its employees, that they be worthy successors of so noble a model of health care. In this time of change, we turn our gaze to our unchanging God — may he bless you sisters, one and all!

Rev. Sam Martin,

pastor of Christ the King in Spencer and St. John the Baptist in Marshfield
