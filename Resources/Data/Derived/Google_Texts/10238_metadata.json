But as of right now, not even a few months into the process, it\u2019s impossible to avoid daily news items in which one GOP candidate or another is self-immolating with ludicrous remarks or unforced errors. Frankly, it\u2019d be really fun to observe if it weren\u2019t for a nagging sense of danger. We\u2019ll circle back to that.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Friday contributed a fantastic example of the politically deficient nature of the current batch of hacks and frauds running for president on the GOP side. Speaking about the political hot potato of Iraq, Rubio described how he, as president, would approach continued U.S. involvement there: \u201cIt\u2019s not nation-building. We are assisting them in building their nation.\u201d Yes, assisting in the building of a nation is distinct from nation-building, according to Rubio.\n\nClearly, inside the Rubio campaign (for president!), this is totally acceptable. To everyone else, however, it sounds like the Sphinx character from the 1999 Ben Stiller superhero movie \u201cMystery Men.\u201d As the wise sage of the superhero team, the Sphinx spoke in seemingly profound chunks of wisdom, but he\u2019d merely reverse the first half of each maxim to construct the second half. For example: \u201cHe who questions training only trains himself at asking questions\u201d; \u201cWhen you doubt your powers, you give power to your doubts\u201d; and, \u201cWhen you care what is outside, what is inside cares for you.\u201d Adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not nation-building. We are assisting them in building their nation.\u201d\n\nThe Iraq issue, which has had 12 years to percolate in the minds of all candidates everywhere and on both sides of the aisle, has completely flummoxed the Republicans. They don\u2019t know how the hell to answer questions about the invasion. Actually, I take that back. Remarkably, the generally gaffe-prone Rick Perry, of all people, delivered the most concise and coherent answer of the batch on Friday, saying flatly on MSNBC that knowing what he knows now, he wouldn\u2019t have invaded. But whether it\u2019s Jeb Bush, Rubio or even Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who said recently that the Republicans are responsible for ISIS but then reversed himself on the \u201cHannity\u201d show, the issue is utterly stupefying. Carly Fiorina was asked about Iraq by MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell last week, and instead of answering, Fiorina pivoted to Hillary Clinton, saying that the Democratic front-runner hadn\u2019t been asked nor had she commented on Iraq. Well, Clinton had, in fact, been asked, and she responded with aplomb \u2014 many days earlier. It was kind of a big deal.\n\nWhat else? Regarding Rand Paul, his campaign was a mess right out of the box. He was caught using stock photos instead of actual people who his campaign insisted had provided endorsements. His website store included \u201cRand Paul Flip Flops\u201d for sale. The education issue page on his campaign site misspelled the word \u201ceducation\u201d (it touted Paul\u2019s \u201ceductation\u201d policies). He bristled and barked at the \u201cToday\u201d show\u2019s Savannah Guthrie. And his official campaign announcement video was blocked by YouTube for copyright infringement.\n\nAs for Mike Huckabee, it\u2019s a safe bet that just about everything he says is either a gaffe or a shockingly horrendous anecdote. While talking about rights for transgender citizens, for example, Huckabee joked that he would\u2019ve pretended to be transgender in high school just to infiltrate the girls\u2019 showers. Who knew Huckabee was such a perv?\n\nElsewhere, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, thought it\u2019d be classy to joke about Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 while Biden was burying his son Beau Biden. Said Cruz: \u201cJoe Biden\u2026 You know what the nice thing is? You don\u2019t even need a punch line. I promise you it works. At the next party you\u2019re at, just walk up to someone and say, \u2018Vice President Joe Biden,\u2019 and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lot can happen between now and Election Day -- and with no GOP adult in the room, that's a frightening thought", "author": "Bob Cesca", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A lot can happen between now and Election Day -- and with no GOP adult in the room, that's a frightening thought", "title": "The GOP circus is no laughing matter: One of these clowns could actually win it all", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/08/the_gop_circus_is_no_laughing_matter_one_of_these_clowns_could_actually_win_it_all/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/walker_cruz_paul_bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lot can happen between now and Election Day -- and with no GOP adult in the room, that's a frightening thought", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/walker_cruz_paul_bush.jpg", "title": "The GOP circus is no laughing matter: One of these clowns could actually win it all", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The GOP circus is no laughing matter: One of these clowns could actually win it all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, GOP 2016, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Speaking about the political hot potato of Iraq, Rubio described how he, as president, would approach continued U.S. involvement there: \u201cIt\u2019s not nation-building.\nHis website store included \u201cRand Paul Flip Flops\u201d for sale.\nClearly, inside the Rubio campaign (for president!\nRegarding Rand Paul, his campaign was a mess right out of the box.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, GOP 2016, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Elections News, Politics NewsThere was a time when the well-worn \u201cclown car\u201d description of the Republican presidential primary field wasn\u2019t so on-the-nose."}
