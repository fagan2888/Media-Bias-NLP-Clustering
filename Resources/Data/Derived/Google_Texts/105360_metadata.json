Holder, in which the United States and the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma were also named as defendants, had been filed last July during the height of the legal firestorm in which Matt and Melanie Capobianco of James Island, South Carolina, were seeking custody of a Cherokee child they had named Veronica.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court had ruled in June 2013 that Veronica\u2019s biological father, Dusten Brown, could not sue under ICWA because he did not have \u201ccontinued\u201d custody of the girl. The case made headlines around the world, though the little girl was eventually returned to live with the adoptive couple in South Carolina in September of last year.\n\nRELATED: Cherokee Nation Mourns as Veronica Is Returned to Adoptive Family\n\nMaldonado had initially remained quiet during the legal proceedings, but eventually joined the class action suit which included a dozen other women in filing the litigation in federal court in South Carolina. Their suit sought to declare the \u201cIndian preference\u201d under section 1915 of ICWA \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d because it \u201cviolated their civil rights to choose fit, stable adoptive parents for their birth children,\u201d according to one of their attorneys.\n\nBut on January 27, the plaintiffs in the case quietly filed a voluntary motion for dismissal with the court, putting an end to one of the longest, most expensive and emotional custody cases in U.S. History.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased Ms. Maldonado and the unnamed plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the suit,\u201d said Chrissi Nimmo, assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation. \u201cWe never believed the suit had any merit and we were prepared to actively defend the suit had we ever been served.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the Cherokee Nation and the attorneys for the plaintiffs in Adoptive Couple continue to await the decision on the demand fees totaling over $1 million in Nowata County Court in Oklahoma. Previously, they had publicized their work on behalf of the Capobiancos as \u201cpro bono,\u201d but sought compensation a week after the pre-schooler was returned to South Carolina. Their previous suit for fees in South Carolina totaled some $500,000, but was dropped late last year.\n\nRELATED: Capobiancos Sue Dusten Brown for Nearly Half a Million in Fees\n\nSince that time, the Oglala and Rosebud Sioux Tribes, along with another class action of parents in South Dakota, have sued the state in federal court over multiple violations of the Indian Child Welfare Act.'\n\nRELATED: South Dakota Tribes Charge State With ICWA Violations\n\nSwept Away: South Dakota's Native Children Denied Due Process in Custody Cases\n\nSwept Away, Part 2: Suing South Dakota to Protect Native Children", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indian Country Today Media Network has confirmed that the legal team for Christinna Maldonado, the birth mother of \u201cBaby Veronica\u201d and lead plaintiff, has quietly dr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/07/veronicas-birth-mother-drops-bid-overturn-icwa-south-carolina-154354", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/veronicadad.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Veronica's Birth Mother Drops Bid to Overturn ICWA in South Carolina"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-07T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/07/veronicas-birth-mother-drops-bid-overturn-icwa-south-carolina-154354", "dc": {"title": "Veronica's Birth Mother Drops Bid to Overturn ICWA in South Carolina"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Veronica's Birth Mother Drops Bid to Overturn ICWA in South Carolina"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29a0\"", "article_summary": "Their previous suit for fees in South Carolina totaled some $500,000, but was dropped late last year.\nThe case made headlines around the world, though the little girl was eventually returned to live with the adoptive couple in South Carolina in September of last year.\nPreviously, they had publicized their work on behalf of the Capobiancos as \u201cpro bono,\u201d but sought compensation a week after the pre-schooler was returned to South Carolina.\n\u201cWe are pleased Ms. Maldonado and the unnamed plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the suit,\u201d said Chrissi Nimmo, assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation.\nRELATED: South Dakota Tribes Charge State With ICWA ViolationsSwept Away: South Dakota's Native Children Denied Due Process in Custody CasesSwept Away, Part 2: Suing South Dakota to Protect Native Children"}
