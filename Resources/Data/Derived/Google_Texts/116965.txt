emojis, stickers and emoticons which depict same-sex couples, the rainbow flag, and any symbol that symbolises the lesbian, bay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Apps that have been targeted by the demands include the popular Asian messaging app LINE, Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter. “Such contents are not allowed in Indonesia based on our cultural law and the religious norms and the operators must respect that,” said Ismail Cawidu, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Communication and Information Ministry.

This is all sad and stupid, especially for Indonesians in the Aceh province, which adheres to sharia law. There, you can be caned for having gay sex.

Which of course, just makes them sadder and stupider.
