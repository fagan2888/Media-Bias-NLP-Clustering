An alleged shoe bandit stepped on the wrong toes when he started swiping footwear from outside a Pinellas Park home, police said.

Rusty Wayne Sills, 46, of Largo is being held in the Pinellas County Jail on $10,000 bail on a charge of burglary.

About 4 a.m. Thursday, police went to a home in the 8200 block of 43rd Way North after the residents reported they had detained a burglar. The residents said for several preceding days, a man had been entering their front porch, taking shoes that were left outside and swapping them for other shoes.

The residents said they were so concerned they purchased a surveillance system to monitor the porch and the inside of the house.

Thursday, the residents were monitoring the system when they saw Sills approach the house. The residents confronted him and detained him until police arrived.

Sills told police he buys and sells women’s shoes at a local flea market. The vehicle that Sills used to drive to the residence had approximately 100 pairs of women’s shoes inside.

Sills denied being at the woman’s home before, but officers said they recovered shoes that were stolen from the home.

Police said there have been several similar incidents, and they are investigating whether Sills was involved in them.
