Stoltenberg\u2019s office requested a meeting with Obama well in advance of the visit, but never heard anything from the White House, two sources close to the NATO chief told me.\n\nThe leaders of almost all the other 28 NATO member countries have made time for Stoltenberg since he took over the world's largest military alliance in October. Stoltenberg, twice the prime minister of Norway, met Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Ottawa to discuss the threat of the Islamic State and the crisis in Ukraine, two issues near the top of Obama's agenda.\n\nKurt Volker, who served as the U.S. permanent representative to NATO under both President George W. Bush and Obama, said the president broke a long tradition. \u201cThe Bush administration held a firm line that if the NATO secretary general came to town, he would be seen by the president ... so as not to diminish his stature or authority,\u201d he told me.\n\nAmerica's commitment to defend its NATO allies is its biggest treaty obligation, said Volker, adding that European security is at its most perilous moment since the Cold War. Russia has moved troops and weapons into eastern Ukraine, annexed Crimea, placed nuclear-capable missiles in striking distance of NATO allies, flown strategic-bomber mock runs in the North Atlantic, practiced attack approaches on the UK and Sweden, and this week threatened to aim nuclear missiles at Denmark\u2019s warships.\n\n\u201cIt is hard for me to believe that the president of the United States has not found the time to meet with the current secretary general of NATO given the magnitude of what this implies, and the responsibilities of his office,\u201d Volker said.\n\nBernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to say why Obama didn\u2019t respond to Stoltenberg\u2019s request. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any meetings to announce at this time,\u201d she told me in a statement. Sources told me that Stoltenberg was able to arrange a last-minute meeting with Defense Secretary Ashton Carter.\n\nAccording to White House press releases, Obama didn\u2019t exactly have a packed schedule. On Tuesday, he held important meetings and a press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani at the White House (Ghani will meet with Stoltenberg while they are both in town). But the only event on Obama\u2019s public schedule for Wednesday is a short speech to kick off a meeting related to the Affordable Care Act. On Thursday, he will head to Alabama to give a speech about the economy.\n\nStoltenberg is in town primarily for theNATO Transformation Seminar, a once-a-year strategic brainstorming session that brings together NATO\u2019s leadership with experts and top officials from the host country. The event is organized by the Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, and the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this year\u2019s seminar is to think through how best to update NATO\u2019s strategy given real threats in the east and the south, against the backdrop of a dramatically changing world,\u201d said Damon Wilson, a former NSC senior director for Europe who is now with the Atlantic Council. \u201cThe practical focus is to begin developing the road map to the next NATO summit, which will take place in Warsaw in July 2016, a summit which will presumably be the capstone and last summit for the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nLast year, the seminar was hosted in Paris, and then-NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen got a separate bilateral meeting with President Francois Hollande of France.\n\nLast Friday, at the German Marshall Fund Brussels Forum, Stoltenberg talked about the importance of close coordination inside NATO in order to first confront Russian aggression and then eventually move toward a stable relationship with Moscow.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can have the confidence to engage with Russia,\" he said, \"is to have the confidence and the strength which is provided by strong collective defense, the NATO alliance.\"\n\nPolish President Bronislaw Komorowski told the Brussels Forum that there has been a worrisome lag between NATO\u2019s promises of more defensive equipment for Poland and what has actually arrived, a blow to the alliance's credibility. \u201cIt\u2019s very important and necessary for everyone to have the conviction, including the potential aggressor to have this conviction, that NATO is truly determined to execute contingency plans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House missed a perfect opportunity to reinforce that message this week in snubbing Stoltenberg. It fits into a narrative pushed by Obama critics that he would rather meet with problematic leaders such as Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al- Abadi, who will get an Oval Office meeting next month, than firm allies. The message Russian President Vladimir Putin will take away is that the White House-NATO relationship is rocky, and he will be right.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obama, snub, nato, merkel, germany, ukraine", "pubdate": "2015-03-24T19:58:16", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Barack Obama has yet to meet with the new head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and won't see Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg this week, even though he is in Washington for three days.
