The band, which featured Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, John Kadlecik, Jeff Chimenti, Jeff Pehrson, Sunshine Becker and Joe Russo, confirmed the news today via a post on Furthur.net that reads:\n\nTo our loyal Furthur fans and members of the Furthur community at furthur.net, we\u2019d like to thank you for a terrific ride. We\u2019ll be closing up shop at furthur.net, and heading onward. Thanks for making the Furthur community a great place to hang out, and for coming out to the shows. We\u2019ll all be keeping very busy over the foreseeable future, and it\u2019s time to let Furthur take a bow. We enjoyed the ride more than we can possibly express. You can keep tabs on Phil\u2019s activities atwww.terrapincrossroads.net, Bob\u2019s activities atwww.bobweir.net and all Grateful Dead news atwww.dead.net\n\nFurthur was founded in the fall of 2009, a few months after The Dead wrapped up their last tour. The group performed consistently between then and 2014, when they played their final show on January 23 at the first-and-only Paradise Waits event in Riviera Maya, Mexico (the band was scheduled to perform at this year\u2019s Lockn\u2019 Festival, but the show was cancelled after Weir scrapped all of his touring plans). However, Weir and Lesh teamed up to sing the \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d at Game 3 of the World Series in San Francisco last month, and rumors have been circulating for some time that the pair will reunite with the rest of The Dead in 2015 to mark the Grateful Dead\u2019s 50th anniversary.\n\nYou can check out some photos from Furthur\u2019s final concerts at Paradise Waits here.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "jambands, live music shows, phish, grateful dead, widespread panic, moe., furthur, ratdog, phil lesh, dave matthews band, disco biscuits, umphrey's mcgee, jerry garcia, trey anastasio, yonder mountain string band, improvisation", "description": "Furthur have officially parted ways.
