We\u2019ve confirmed we are in orbit as we expected, so we\u2019re right on the money there,\u201d Guy Beutelschies, Lockheed Martin Space System\u2019s MAVEN program manager said. \u201cAll subsystems are operating as expected and nothing was damaged.\u201d\n\nOnce MAVEN reached Mars on Sunday night, the spacecraft was programmed to fire six main thrusters in order to properly establish orbit. The fully-automated process translated to some anxious moments back on Earth, as everyone stationed at mission control at Lockheed\u2019s Waterton Canyon facility waited 12 minutes for a message from the spacecraft confirming it had successfully entered orbit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling, knowing, well, we\u2019ve done everything we can, and now it\u2019s up to the spacecraft,\u201d Beutelschies said.\n\nNow the real mission work begins.\n\nOver the next six weeks, MAVEN will shrink its current 35-hour planetary orbit down to a 4\u00bd-hour \u201cscience orbit.\u201d During this time, all of MAVEN\u2019s science instruments \u2014 nine total \u2014 will be awakened and tested before the \u201cstart of science\u201d date in early November.\n\nHowever, some of the instruments have begun to send data back to Earth.\n\nNick Schneider, from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, leads the science team for MAVEN\u2019s Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument, studying emissions from Mars\u2019 atmosphere.\n\nThe UV Spectrograph was turned on shortly after MAVEN entered orbit and began sending data back to Earth in the wee hours of Monday morning. Schneider\u2019s \u201cteam of whippersnappers\u201d \u2014 a postdoctoral researcher, a student, a programmer and a controller \u2014 came back to the lab at 2 a.m. to run raw data through a program they created.\n\n\u201cTheir jaws dropped when it worked the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the first people on planet Earth to know what Mars looks like from ultraviolet wavelengths.\u201d\n\nThe team hopes to release an image soon.\n\nBack at Lockheed, a team is monitoring MAVEN around the clock. Once the spacecraft is in the science orbit, that engineering crew of 12 to 15 people will be minding the craft.\n\nMAVEN will then communicate with ground control twice a week, sending data back to Earth for the scientists to analyze.\n\n\u201cWe built in smarts on the spacecraft so it can take care of itself between communications,\u201d Beutelschies said. \u201cBecause the spacecraft is so far away, it\u2019s not like we can use a joystick to control it.\u201d\n\nMAVEN left Earth in November with 425 gallons of fuel, 25 of which were allotted for the trip to Mars. Part of that allotment was budgeted for four trajectory correction maneuvers scheduled to keep MAVEN on course.\n\nHowever, only two corrections were required, so MAVEN used only 5 gallons for the trip.\n\n\u201cBecause it was so well-modeled and the spacecraft was so well-behaved, we actually got to cancel the third and the fourth (correction), which is a testament to all the hard work of both the engineering team on the spacecraft and the navigation team,\u201d Beutelschies said in the post-orbit insertion news conference Sunday night. \u201cWhen you budget for problems, and then the problems don\u2019t occur and your design behaves exactly as you designed it, good things happen.\u201d\n\nThe extra fuel could be used to extend MAVEN\u2019s science mission, which is currently scheduled for one Earth year.\n\n\u201cThe more fuel we have, the more we can give it to Bruce (Jakosky) for getting more science and extending the mission,\u201d Beutelschies said.\n\nJakosky, MAVEN\u2019s principal investigator, is leading the science operations from CU\u2019s LASP.\n\nMAVEN\u2019s mission is to discover what happened to the early atmosphere of Mars. Evidence shows the planet had liquid water flowing over the surface at one point, which could be an indicator of an environment that could support life. Scientists hope to solve the mystery of what happened to the planet\u2019s water and atmosphere.\n\nBack on Earth, the feeling of knowing MAVEN made it to its destination is nothing less than thrilling for Beutelschies.\n\n\u201cLooking up at the night sky, you can see Mars up there, and you can imagine that something you built is up at that little red dot up there,\u201d Beutelschies said. \u201cIt is an amazing feeling.\u201d\n\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or twitter.com/LauraKeeney\n\nAbout MAVEN\n\nNASA launched MAVEN on its 442 million-mile journey last November from Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe mission: Dedicated to studying the upper atmosphere of Mars.\n\nLocal ties: MAVEN\u2019s maker, Lockheed Martin, is operating the mission control center in Littleton. MAVEN\u2019s chief investigator is Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado. MAVEN was sent to space on a rocket built by Centennial-based United Launch Alliance.\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NASA\u2019s Mars MAVEN orbit insertion was \u201cright on the money\u201d", "title": "NASA\u2019s Mars MAVEN orbit insertion was \u201cright on the money\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/22/nasas-mars-maven-orbit-insertion-was-right-on-the-money/", "image": {"width": 429, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922__brucejakoskyp1.jpg", "height": 648}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922__brucejakoskyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T18:43:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:39:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc329\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s humbling, knowing, well, we\u2019ve done everything we can, and now it\u2019s up to the spacecraft,\u201d Beutelschies said.\nThe insertion of NASA\u2019s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, into orbit around the planet went as flawlessly as anyone could have hoped.\nOnce the spacecraft is in the science orbit, that engineering crew of 12 to 15 people will be minding the craft.\nWe\u2019ve confirmed we are in orbit as we expected, so we\u2019re right on the money there,\u201d Guy Beutelschies, Lockheed Martin Space System\u2019s MAVEN program manager said.\nMAVEN\u2019s mission is to discover what happened to the early atmosphere of Mars."}
