Sam Farr (D-Calif.) to The Huffington Post. \u201cThis is great day for common sense because now our federal dollars will be spent more wisely on prosecuting criminals and not sick patients.\u201d\n\nVeterans in Need of Opioids for Pain Management\n\nThe bill directs the Veterans Administration to adopt the highly controversial opioid prescribing guidelines drafted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\u201cTo address mounting concerns about prescription drug abuse and an overdose epidemic among veterans, the bill directs the VA to adopt the opioid prescribing guidelines developed by the Centers of Disease Control, to develop IT systems to track and monitor opioid prescriptions, to ensure all VA medical facilities are equipped with opioid receptor antagonists to treat drug overdoses, and to provide additional training to medical personnel who prescribe controlled substances,\u201d outlined Senators Mark Warner (D-VA) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) in a press release.\n\nWith the growing controversy around CDC\u2019s prescribing guidelines, concerns mount from advocacy groups that Veterans will have increased challenges obtaining the pain medication they need.\n\nRead more about the controversy here.\n\nMedical Device Tax Breaks May Increase Technology Development\n\nThe bill created a two-year suspension of Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, which manufacturers had long argued dampened research and development efforts. The suspension will pump $3.9 billion into the industry over two years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that Congress was able to come together to preserve U.S. jobs and medical innovation by delaying the device tax for two years,\u201d said Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance (MITA) Board Chairman Nelson Mendes, president and CEO of Ziehm Imaging Inc. in a press release. \u201cThe bipartisan cooperation we\u2019ve seen gives us hope that policymakers will continue their work to fully address the device tax for employees, patients and advocates across the country who have been impacted by its harmful effects.\u201d\n\nThe bill also included a permanent R&D tax credit for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The tax credits allow start-up companies and other small businesses to use part of their R&D tax credit to reduce their payroll taxes.\n\nSubscribe to our blog via email", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Pain Report", "description": "When President Obama signed a huge tax and spending law to keep the government running and avoid a year-end budget showdown, there were a few things tucked into the $1.1 trillion law that directly \u2026", "title": "$1.1 Trillion Budget to Impact People in Pain, Medical Marijuana, Veterans and Medical Device Innovation", "url": "http://nationalpainreport.com/1-1-trillion-budget-to-impact-people-in-pain-medical-marijuana-veterans-and-medical-device-innovation-8828830.html", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://nationalpainreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Government-Spending-Budget-e1450928978394.jpg", "height": 248}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T17:09:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-25T17:09:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nationalpainreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Government-Spending-Budget-e1450928978394.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Medical Device Tax Breaks May Increase Technology DevelopmentThe bill created a two-year suspension of Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, which manufacturers had long argued dampened research and development efforts.\nDOJ to Back-Off on Medical Marijuana Criminal ActionThe bill blocks the Department of Justice from taking criminal action against individuals and organizations that are licensed in states that have passed medical marijuana laws.\n\u201cThe federal government will finally respect the decisions made by the majority of states that passed medical marijuana laws,\u201d said Rep.
