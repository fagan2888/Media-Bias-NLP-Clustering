The President said this not once, not twice, but multiple times and it was part of the Obamacare supporter talking points. You say it one time and it could be misspeaking \u2014 but when it is part of your mantra, and your talking points\u2026repeated over and over and over again\u2026\u2026well, the rest of us just are not that stupid. That is not misspeaking. Misspeaking is the slip of a tongue \u2014 not part of your repeated talking points. Even the New York Times in its Editorial calls President Obama\u2019s talking points a pledge \u2014 how can a repeated pledge be something you accidentally said? The point of this blog post is to point out how pathetic the NY Times Editorial Board looks trying to describe this as \u2018misspeaking.\u2019 Does the Board think the American people are that stupid? Misspeaking?\n\nShortly after, an even more furious Van Susteren blasted another tweet, all in capital letters, pointing to another new post on her blog about Edie Littlefield Sundby, a woman suffering Stage IV cancer and about to lose her medical insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD SHOULD READ THIS Op/Ed from WALL STREET JOURNAL http://t.co/lgDdAEqyIa \u2014 Greta Van Susteren (@gretawire) November 4, 2013\n\nEveryone now is clamoring about Affordable Care Act winners and losers. I am one of the losers. My grievance is not political; all my energies are directed to enjoying life and staying alive, and I have no time for politics. For almost seven years I have fought and survived stage-4 gallbladder cancer, with a five-year survival rate of less than 2% after diagnosis. I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky. But this luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective Dec. 31. My choice is to get coverage through the government health exchange and lose access to my cancer doctors, or pay much more for insurance outside the exchange (the quotes average 40% to 50% more) for the privilege of starting over with an unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits.\n\nVan Susteren vowed to help Sundby, and some Twitter reaction followed:\n\nH/T: Twitchy\n\n[poll id=\u201d134\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The New York Times editorial board was the target of Fox News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren wrath Sunday evening as she lambasted the board over its editorial saying the president \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he said Americans could keep their health insurance plans, doctors, etc. if they liked them.
