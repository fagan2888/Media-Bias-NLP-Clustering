Paul LePage stepped into political hot water last week after his office released a statement that characterized Social Security and Medicare benefits for seniors as \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\nLePage\u2019s office was trying to put a positive spin on newly released data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that showed Maine\u2019s personal income grew at the slowest pace in New England during the first quarter of 2014. The governor attributed the growth elsewhere in New England to an increase in \u201ctransfer receipts\u201d from the federal government, which include Social Security payments, Medicare and Medicaid disbursements, and unemployment insurance checks.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what liberals call these payments, it is welfare, pure and simple,\u201d LePage said in the written statement.\n\nLePage this week is trying to cover his tracks with seniors. His re-election campaign has started placing automated, pre-recorded calls in which the governor says he doesn\u2019t believe Social Security is \u201cwelfare\u201d and blames newspapers and political opponents for mischaracterizing his statements, the Portland Press Herald reported.\n\nThe episode proves the rhetorical power of the word \u201cwelfare\u201d to cast a negative light on a wide array of government programs and the people who benefit from them. The governor didn\u2019t want seniors, who turn out to vote in high numbers, to think he was characterizing them as undeserving welfare recipients.\n\nWelfare-weary colonials\n\nLePage has made welfare an overriding focal point of his tenure as governor, and he\u2019s used the term to try to shift public opinion to his side on a variety of issues.\n\nAs his administration fought against the expansion of Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, LePage branded the proposal a \u201cwelfare expansion.\u201d As he criticized efforts in the Legislature to try to maintain funding for revenue sharing with municipalities, he said it was time Maine eliminated \u201cwelfare for communities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, LePage kept a laser focus this past legislative session on proposals aimed at restricting recipients\u2019 use of their public benefits.\n\nIn repeatedly evoking welfare, LePage is appealing to a deep-seated American weariness toward assistance programs for the poor.\n\n\u201cGoing back to colonial times, there was always this concern that assistance [from local towns] would undermine the work ethic\u201d of those receiving it, said Martin Gilens, a professor of politics at Princeton University who has researched public opinions toward welfare. \u201cYou do see that kind of rhetoric and kind of cynicism toward welfare recipients forever, basically, even before there was a United States.\u201d\n\nPublic opinion research over the years has revealed a desire among Americans to help those who are less fortunate. But that altruism doesn\u2019t translate into support for welfare programs themselves, which many Americans view as helping people who don\u2019t actually need the help.\n\nThese views, according to Gilens, author of the 1999 book \u201cWhy Americans Hate Welfare,\u201d are even common among welfare recipients and those who are eligible for benefits.\n\n\u201cI do think that the public has long been cynical toward welfare recipients and unsupportive of welfare spending and, to a substantial degree, largely misinformed about how long people are on welfare generally and the racial composition\u201d of welfare recipients, he said.\n\nIn the political arena, the arguments in favor of welfare cutbacks and reforms are often, on the surface, framed as budgetary matters. But the focus on welfare reforms can be effective because it appeals to a commonly held moral desire not to encourage a certain way of life \u2014 namely, a life of dependency that discourages people from working and encourages poor women to have more children, Sharon Hays said in her 2004 book \u201cFlat Broke With Children.\u201d\n\nCrowning the welfare queen\n\nIn 1975, The New Yorker magazine published an extensive and excruciatingly detailed, 50-page profile of \u201cA Welfare Mother.\u201d\n\nCarmen Santana (whose real name was not used), a native of Puerto Rico living in New York City, had received welfare assistance through Aid to Families with Dependent Children for 14 years. She had nine children from multiple fathers, and one of her daughters living on her own also received welfare.\n\n\u201cShe makes no effort to conceal her thick neck, her big breasts, her big belly, and her enormous thighs,\u201d the profile read. \u201cBecause of her weight, she is unable to take off her fashionable platform shoes unaided. Dancing, she quickly loses breath, but she goes on dancing. She is generous and lazy.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Santana had occasionally worked and concealed that income from the Department of Welfare; she sent long lists of needed clothes and furniture to the welfare office in order to receive funds to cover the purchases; she concealed an arrest record; and she received a welfare check meant for seven people when only five lived in her apartment \u2014 including her boyfriend, who worked, but whose income Santana didn\u2019t report.\n\nThe profile was detailed and nuanced.\n\n\u201cSometimes, when being on welfare seems more arduous than working, Mrs. Santana thinks about getting a job,\u201d the writer said about one of Santana\u2019s encounters with the welfare office.\n\nThe piece appeared just as the issue of welfare fraud was gaining prominence in media accounts, and many magazines and TV news programs featured profiles of welfare mothers. The vast majority of such coverage featured welfare recipients who were not white \u2014 although white people made up the majority of welfare recipients.\n\n\u201c[B]y seeing a black welfare mother in the television news, viewers were more likely to attribute the cause of her poverty to individual failings, rather than to any public policy,\u201d said Frank Gilliam Jr., a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, in a 1999 essay called \u201cThe \u2018Welfare Queen\u2019 Experiment.\u201d\n\nIn 1976, Ronald Reagan capitalized on growing, often racially motivated, public skepticism about welfare programs in his first presidential campaign. He used anecdotes, speaking of public housing complexes with gyms and swimming pools, and he spoke of a woman convicted of welfare fraud whom the Chicago Tribune had dubbed the \u201cwelfare queen.\u201d\n\nDuring the Reagan presidency in the 1980s, welfare budgets and enrollment in assistance programs shrank. And the Republican focus on welfare programs that force recipients to work ultimately prevailed in the battle for public opinion.\n\nWhile Republicans today commonly play to anti-welfare sentiments and characterize many types of public spending as welfare, many Democrats do the same thing.\n\nDemocrat Bill Clinton campaigned for the presidency in 1992 promising to \u201cend welfare as we know it.\u201d Clinton signed the Republican-approved 1996 welfare reform bill that transformed Aid to Families with Dependent Children into Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and instituted work requirements.\n\nAnd today, even when Democrats stand up for the cash assistance programs that fit the traditional definition of welfare, many rail against \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d using the term in a way that implies it\u2019s unworthy and showing the rhetorical power of \u201cwelfare\u201d to move public opinion.\n\nMatthew Stone is BDN opinion page editor.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "Gov.
