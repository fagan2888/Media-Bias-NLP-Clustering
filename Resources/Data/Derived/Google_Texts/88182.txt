As families gather on this Christmas day there are many in Wichita wondering where their next meal might come from.

"I thought it was going to be another day and they ended up blessing me," Dene Leshere said.

Starfish Ministries and Derby Restaurant Hibachi Boy teamed up to give the homeless a hot meal."

'It's rough out here and every little bit of help and every little act of kindness of God's love goes a long way," Starfish Ministries member, Scott Bishop said.

The Hibachi Boy crew cooked up about 500 meals to pass out this afternoon.

"Seeing smiling faces with the good food I'm happy, it's the best Christmas ever," Hibachi Boy co-owner, Lou Kumgool.

"Without these ministries out here I know that I've struggled and had some hard times and they've taken me under their wings," Dene said.

Starfish Ministries wasn't the only group helping out today. The Lord's Diner opened up their doors for a special Christmas meal.

"I'm so passionate about the Lord's Diner. I love to come and serve," volunteer, Carolyn Elmore said.

In addition to the holiday meal at the Lord's Diner tonight an anonymous donor donated $10,000 worth of McDonald's gift cards to give to the homeless for Christmas.
