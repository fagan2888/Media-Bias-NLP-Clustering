Donald Trump unveiled a new attack line against Sen. Ted Cruz Wednesday night, arguing that he indirectly helped Obamacare through his support of Chief Justice John Roberts.

Trump, who made the attack during a rally in Little Rock, Ark., told attendees that Cruz "gave us Obamacare," pointing to the Texas senator's support of Roberts while he served as solicitor general of the Lone Star State.

"Ted Cruz goes out — you talk about liars. He goes out and says 'Donald Trump loves Obamacare. I've been fighting this thing for 4-5 years. And by the way, if it weren't for Ted Cruz, he's the one that got Justice Roberts onto the United States Supreme Court. He pushed him. He approved him, and Justice Roberts approved Obamacare twice when it should have been rejected. His vote got it over the top. Ted Cruz did that. Ted Cruz gave us Obamacare, believe me."

"What I hate is when somebody lies," Trump said. "Every single speech I've made, I talk about repealing and replacing Obamacare. Here's a guy, gets up in Iowa and he said, 'Donald Trump wants Obamacare.' You know, it's a flat out lie ... these guys are bad."

Trump finished off the attack by simply telling the crowd that Roberts was "put there" on the court by Cruz himself.

"It would have been dead if we had a different justice on the United States Supreme Court — put there by him," Trump said.
