That plan, which was broader than his old catastrophic plan, included coverage for a free colonoscopy that revealed a large tumor.\n\nThe cancer was in stage 1 and doctors were able to remove the tumor completely during surgery in May.\n\n\u201cBecause of the ACA, I\u2019m cancer-free,\u201d Kuk said. \u201cHad it not been for ACA, it could\u2019ve continued to grow this year, next year \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have known what was going on.\u201d\n\nKuk wrote Obama just nine days after his surgery to thank the president for his work on the Affordable Care Act. Last week, he got word from the White House that the president wanted to hear more about his story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a feeling to know that you\u2019re going to come to the White House but also then visit with the president,\u201d Kuk said. \u201cNot only just meet him, but have a meeting with him.\u201d\n\nBut a few hours after that meeting, the House again voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2013 something the lawmakers have done more than 50 times, according to the White House. Tuesday\u2019s attempt passed largely along party lines, 239-186, with only three Republicans crossing the aisle to join Democrats opposing the repeal.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why people want to take away health coverage from people who need it,\u201d Kuk said. \u201cIt just makes absolutely no sense to me.\u201d\n\nBut opponents of the law argue that it is both costly and that it forces people to buy into a government program when they may not want to.\n\n\u201cRight now, Americans are being forced to buy a government product or pay a penalty,\u201d said Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., said during debate Tuesday. \u201cThe Constitution mandates freedom \u2013 not the purchase of health insurance or any other product.\u201d\n\nKuk said that if the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed, he would likely lose his coverage or face steep premiums because he now has a pre-existing condition.\n\nBut repeal still faces a tough road \u2013 if it passes in the Senate, Obama will almost definitely veto it.\n\n\u201cIn every respect, this is working not just as intended but better than intended,\u201d Obama said, according to the White House transcript of Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cAnd so the notion that we would play politics with the lives of folks who are out there working hard every single day, trying to make ends meet, trying to look after their families, makes absolutely no sense,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd thats a message that I want to send very directly, today.\u201d\n\nMore than 170,000 Arizonans had signed up for health care through the federal marketplace as of last week, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Health and Human Services. The current open enrollment period ends Feb. 15.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/15/02/03-barack-wide-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When Phoenix resident Don Kuk wrote President Barack Obama to share his Affordable Care Act success story, he thought he might get a form letter back from the White House.
