The group\u2019s live shows are packed with fans of all ages who have purchased 8 million copies of their nine albums and eight DVDs, and made their annual PBS telecasts among the most popular ever viewed.\n\nNow on an 80-city North American tour to celebrate its 10th anniversary, the multiplatinum ensemble will treat Wolf Trap\u2019s Saturday evening audience to breathtaking choreography, imaginative staging, gorgeous gowns and a fusion of contemporary and traditional music.\n\nThe stunning production features four personable women who have become role models for young girls everywhere. The three admired vocalists and the energetic fiddler backed by vivacious Irish dancers and a full band of traditional Celtic instruments will perform favorites from past seasons delivered with high energy, joy and the emotional lift that always accompanies beloved Irish songs.\n\nAll four members of the group grew up in Ireland and began singing and playing several instruments during childhood. Susan McFadden, who made her professional debut in Dublin as Kathy in \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d joined Celtic Woman after starring in the West End productions of \u201cGrease,\u201d \u201cSeven Brides for Seven Brothers\u201d and \u201cLegally Blonde.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing well for girls who perform Irish music that, for a long time, was associated with male groups like the Chieftains and The Clancy Brothers,\u201d Miss McFadden told The Washington Times. \u201cOur fans tell us our music is uplifting, spiritual and even healing at times of trouble. It\u2019s rewarding to know that what we do has that effect.\u201d\n\nMairead (pronounced \u201cmaw-raid\u201d) Nesbitt, the animated fiddler in constant motion on stage, has been with Celtic Woman from the start. Known for playing lead fiddle on Michael Flatley\u2019s \u201cLord of the Dance\u201d and \u201cFeet of Flames\u201d on the soundtrack of \u201cRiverdance\u201d and for Walt Disney\u2019s film \u201cTinker Bell,\u201d Miss Nesbitt accompanies the three vocalists during their solo turns and shared numbers alike.\n\nThe singers have alternated over the past decade and even throughout this season, which finds former members returning for several weeks at a time, to the delight of their devoted fans. Alex Sharpe, a full-time member from 2008-2009, is back to perform at Wolf Trap.\n\nMairead Carlin has sung with Carly Simon, toured the U.K. and Ireland with American singer-songwriter Don McLean and signed with Decca Records for her debut album \u201cSongbook\u201d with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nThe magnificent gowns created by famous Irish designer Synan O\u2019Mahoney blend into the theme of each show, just as the music inspires audience interaction.\n\nMiss McFadden emphasizes the importance of the give and take with fans whenever they join in on favorite songs like \u201cDanny Boy,\u201d \u201cOronoco Flow\u201d and \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have so much fun singing with them,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir participation makes each concert special. We love that they energize and empower us.\u201d\n\nThe goal of this tour, she points out, is to take the show and the music back to their roots. Instead of bombarding the audience with elaborate lighting and special effects, the atmosphere is more peaceful and ethereal.\n\n\u201cWherever we perform in this country, we see little girls dressed up in princess outfits,\u201d Miss McFadden said. \u201cI have nieces aged 12 and 13 who often watch [entertainment that] I feel is not appropriate for their age, so it\u2019s very rewarding to see young girls arriving at our show with their families and eager to hear lovely songs presented in a beautiful setting. Our concerts are parties for our fans.\u201d\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT: Celtic Woman 10th Anniversary World Tour\n\nWHERE: Wolf Trap Filene Center, 1635 Trap Rd., Vienna, Va., 22182\n\nWHEN: Saturday, 8 p.m.\n\nINFO: Tickets $30 to $65 by calling 703/255-1868, 877/965-3872 or visiting www.wolftrap.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ten years after their debut performance in Ireland, Celtic Woman is a worldwide phenomenon.
