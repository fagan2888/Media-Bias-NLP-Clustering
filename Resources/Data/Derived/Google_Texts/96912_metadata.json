Had conservative stalwarts embraced that mission over trying to perfect our efforts, the impact for our police could have been far more significant and less risky than a 30 minute rally amidst a parade of lesbians with signs saying, \u2018F\u2014k the police.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to cancel was soley based on safety concerns of the police officers\u2019 families. After we announced we were having the rally the gay anarchists threatened to spit and instigate violence at the rally,\u201d said Nesbitt. \u201cChildren and elderly family members of police officers were to be at our rally. There was no way we were going to allow children to be in danger. We did the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know Carl and I have never backed away from a fight and we have fought for conservative and moral issues for years. We did not back away from this rally. We pulled a fuse from a bomb. If those crazies spit on those police officers families there would have been a huge fight,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nBut the most disappointing part of the cancellation came when there was a backlash from the twos support base (see comments on this page).\n\n\u201cThere were some Facebook posts, phone calls, and emails from our conservative friends who said we should have never backed down. Some even called us cowards,\u201d said Nesbitt. \u201cIt pissed us off and we dished it back at them. Carl and I stand by what we did and stand by whatever smart aleck remark to conservatives that disagreed with us because they did not know what we knew was coming.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After we announced we were having the rally the gay anarchists threatened to spit and instigate violence at the rally,\u201d said Nesbitt.\nChad NesbitAccording to Chad Nesbit and Carl Mumpower some of their support base was angered when the two decided to cancel their rally when Activists from the LGBTQ community announced that they would counter protest the pro-police rally at the same time the pro-police rally would be held.\n\u201cI had been blessed with my fill of conservative armchair quarterbacks critiquing our actions without any understanding of the circumstance,\u201d said Mumpower about the response from supporters of the pro-police rally.\nIf those crazies spit on those police officers families there would have been a huge fight,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\u201cChildren and elderly family members of police officers were to be at our rally."}
