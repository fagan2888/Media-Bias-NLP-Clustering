Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken are in agreement with Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, but eliminating the favorable tax treatment of private equity and hedge fund managers appears to be one area gaining rare bipartisan support.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s John McKinnon reports that a group of senators including Ms. Warren and Mr. Franken is urging the Treasury Department to crack down on the tax break which allows investment managers to treat the most substantial portion of their income\u2014carried interest\u2014as capital gains.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Blackstone Group Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman, one of the biggest beneficiaries from the current taxation of carried interest, describes Mr. Bush\u2019s proposal to eliminate the deduction on private equity profits as \u201ca radical thing to do\u201d and opposes the move, Fortune reports.\n\nMeanwhile, as the threat to carried interest looms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is moving forward with plans to exit one of its biggest investments. Telis Demos reports that credit-card processor First Data Corp. is planning to raise $3 billion in an IPO set to kick off this week, in what would be the largest U.S. listing of the year.\n\nFirst Eagle Investment Management, an investment adviser backed by Blackstone Group and Corsair Capital, along with its distributor FEF Distributors, will pay $40 million to settle charges that they improperly used mutual fund assets, Yuka Hayashi reports for the Journal. In a public statement, First Eagle said it promptly acted to remedy the issue and immediately offered to return the money paid from the funds\u2019 assets.\n\nTPG Capital is among a group of investors including Walt Disney and Sky PLC putting up $65 million to fund Silicon Valley virtual-reality startup Jaunt, Jack Nicas writes over at Digits.\n\nFortress Investment Group is liquidating part of its hedge-fund arm, the Journal\u2019s Rob Copeland reports.\n\nChris Witkowsky over at PE Hub has the scoop on the launch of a \u201cmini Apollo Global Management\u201d founded by Stan Parker and Jordan Zaken, former senior partners of the investment giant.\n\nWrite to Hillary Canada at hillary.canada@wsj.com\n\nDear Readers-\n\nI joined the private equity team here at Dow Jones & Co. on April 2, 2007, the very day KKR announced its $29 billion offer for First Data.\n\nSo it feels as though there is a certain symmetry that just as KKR prepares to finally exit that investment, I am embarking on my own exit for another post here at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt has been beyond fascinating to watch changes unfold in the industry over the past eight and a half years. When I joined, Dodd and Frank were just congressmen, Blackstone was still a private company and the largest buyout offer in history\u2014which would subsequently turn into the biggest busted deal in history\u2014for Canadian telecommunications operator BCE Inc. was just months from being signed.\n\nFrom partner disputes to the seven-hour flip of a mining parts maker and the alleged biblical roots of carried interest, this beat has been anything but dull. I am so thankful to the folks I have spoken with over the years who took time out of their lives to explain the strange mechanics\u2014like European waterfalls, management fee offsets and claw backs\u2014of this secretive industry. It is my sincere hope that I can still contribute to this blog from time to time, but for now, I am signing off.\n\n-H.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A roundup of the morning's private equity-related news.", "title": "The Morning Leverage: Senators Propose Crackdown on Carried Interest", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/09/22/the-morning-leverage-senators-propose-crackdown-on-carried-interest/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "The Morning Leverage: Senators Propose Crackdown on Carried Interest", "description": "A roundup of the morning's private equity-related news.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Hillary Canada", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "A roundup of the morning's private equity-related news.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-22T15:51:09-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/09/22/the-morning-leverage-senators-propose-crackdown-on-carried-interest/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18986", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A roundup of the morning's private equity-related news.", "title": "The Morning Leverage: Senators Propose Crackdown on Carried Interest", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/09/22/the-morning-leverage-senators-propose-crackdown-on-carried-interest/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18986", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-22T22:05:10-04:00"}, "article_summary": "(LBO Wire is a daily newsletter with comprehensive analysis of all the investments, deals, fundraisings and personnel moves involving private equity firms.\nFortress Investment Group is liquidating part of its hedge-fund arm, the Journal\u2019s Rob Copeland reports.\nMeanwhile, as the threat to carried interest looms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is moving forward with plans to exit one of its biggest investments.\nWrite to Hillary Canada at hillary.canada@wsj.comDear Readers-I joined the private equity team here at Dow Jones & Co. on April 2, 2007, the very day KKR announced its $29 billion offer for First Data.\nFrom partner disputes to the seven-hour flip of a mining parts maker and the alleged biblical roots of carried interest, this beat has been anything but dull."}
