Israeli airstrikes in the northern Gaza Strip killed two Palestinian children on Saturday, according to medical officials.

The two children were siblings — 10-year-old Yassin Abu Khoussa and his six-year-old sister Israa, Reuters reports.

Yassin died after an Israeli plane bombed their home. Israa was seriously wounded in the attack, and later died in the hospital.

Local Palestinian news outlet Ma’an reported the family’s home had been partially destroyed in Israel’s summer 2014 war in Gaza.

The Israeli government says it was targeting training camps for the Palestinian political party Hamas, and that the children’s home was next to one of these camps.

Israel claims its airstrikes were in retaliation after four missiles were launched into open areas in southern Israel, resulting in no casualties. However, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon also admitted that rogue militant groups were responsible for the rockets, not Hamas leadership, even though it was Hamas infrastructure that the Israeli military targeted.

The Israeli military says there have been three more rockets fired into Israel from Gaza since the beginning of the year, which neither injured nor killed anyone.

In its 51-day war in July and August 2014, the Israeli military killed more than 2,250 Palestinians, around two-thirds of whom were civilians, including more than 550 children, according to the U.N. On the other side, 66 Israeli soldiers were killed, along with six civilians. 92 percent of those killed by Palestinian militants were soldiers.

Almost 18 months after the war, reconstruction or repair of the homes of 74 percent of Palestinian families who were displaced had not even begun, according to the U.N., with more than 16,000 families — roughly 90,000 Palestinians — displaced or homeless.
