"It will be peaceful. Our guys will behave themselves." - Richard Preston

A Maryland-based Ku Klux Klan group apparently once again has been granted permission to rally at the Gettysburg National Military Park.

Richard Preston, head of the Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said Saturday that the group will be at the battlefield from noon to 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 9.

Because of the government shutdown, the National Park Service canceled the group's permit to assemble Oct. 5 on the lawn north of Meadeâ€™s Headquarters along Taneytown Road. The group marched in downtown Gettysburg that day instead.

Preston said he filed revised paperwork Friday and his group, which is based in Rosedale in Baltimore County, and was given the Nov. 9 date by the park service.

Attempts to reach representatives with the parks service in Gettysburg on Saturday afternoon were unsuccessful.

"We weren't going to forget about the permit," Preston said. "We're not going to stop telling the American people what is going on in their country."

Preston said he expects about five to 10 members of his group to attend the rally, plus members from as many as three other Klan groups.

"It will be peaceful," Preston said. "Our guys will behave themselves."

Preston said speakers at the rally will talk about the "illegitimacy of the presidency of Barrack Obama," "the unconstitutionality of Obamacare" and illegal immigration.

"We believe Obama is not the legitimate president because of his dual citizenship in another country," Preston said. "Any other president would have been removed from office by now."

Hopes that Obama would be in Gettysburg on Nov. 19 to take part in ceremonies commemorating the 150th anniversary of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address were dashed Wednesday when the administration announced Obama will not attend.
