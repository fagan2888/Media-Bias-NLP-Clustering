Concise, neatly organized and courageous, the movie has also earned the admiration of the community whose story it conveys. The 10-minute piece, which the three made last year as eighth-graders, has been screened locally and shared on individual, tribal and environmental-organization Facebook pages.\n\nThe movie takes the viewer through the cataclysm the nearby Cheyenne River Sioux\u2014and other tribes\u2014suffered in the mid-20th century, when the federal government built giant dams on the Missouri River, creating artificial lakes. The immense bodies of water flooded valuable farming and grazing land and wiped out thriving villages on reservations in Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota. In Cheyenne River\u2019s case, 231-mile Lake Oahe devastated the way of life created after the end of the historic buffalo-centric economy.\n\nVideo of Dammed Indians: The Relocation of the Sioux\n\nTwo of the filmmakers, Sydney Mettler, 15, and Whitley Dupris, 14, are Cheyenne River tribal members; the third collaborator is Ethan Schaffer, 15. Mettler narrates the piece, her sweet, youthful cadences underlining the human cost of the economic and cultural disruption, borne in turn by each generation.\n\nThe project got underway in 2012, when historian Michael L. Lawson visited their school to talk about Dammed Indians Revisited: The Continuing History of the Pick-Sloan Plan and the Missouri River Sioux (South Dakota State Historical Society, 2009), a revision of his highly regarded 1982 book. The historical society organized the tour, and Timber Lake turned out to be the highlight. \u201cThat was the most excited and responsive crowd I had,\u201d recalled Lawson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch a prize-winning film made by eighth graders about the effects of the damming of the Missouri River on the Cheyenne River Sioux.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/14/watch-prize-winning-student-film-dammed-indians-reexamines-history-154017", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/dammed-indians-ethan-schaffer-sydnee-mettler-whitley-dupris.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Watch: Prize-Winning Student Film 'Dammed Indians' Reexamines History"}, "abstract": "Watch a prize-winning film made by eighth graders about the effects of the damming of the Missouri River on the Cheyenne River Sioux.", "dc": {"title": "Watch: Prize-Winning Student Film 'Dammed Indians' Reexamines History"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/14/watch-prize-winning-student-film-dammed-indians-reexamines-history-154017", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Timber Lake School, Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, Cheyenne River Sioux, Missouri River, Documentary Film", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-03-14T16:34-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Watch: Prize-Winning Student Film 'Dammed Indians' Reexamines History"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b1e\"", "article_summary": "Three freshman from Timber Lake School, in South Dakota, have learned that their documentary, Dammed Indians: The Relocation of the Sioux, won a 2013 South Dakota History Day award.\nThe immense bodies of water flooded valuable farming and grazing land and wiped out thriving villages on reservations in Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota.\nVideo of Dammed Indians: The Relocation of the SiouxTwo of the filmmakers, Sydney Mettler, 15, and Whitley Dupris, 14, are Cheyenne River tribal members; the third collaborator is Ethan Schaffer, 15.\nThe historical society organized the tour, and Timber Lake turned out to be the highlight.\nThe movie takes the viewer through the cataclysm the nearby Cheyenne River Sioux\u2014and other tribes\u2014suffered in the mid-20th century, when the federal government built giant dams on the Missouri River, creating artificial lakes."}
