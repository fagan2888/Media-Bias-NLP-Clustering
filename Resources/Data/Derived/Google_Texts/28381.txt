Republican David Young is in his first term representing Iowans in the Third Congressional District, but three Democrats want the chance to knock him out of office.

Iowans decide which one of those three should get that chance on June 7.

Before they get your vote, the candidates answer your questions on this week’s Iowa Forum with Channel 13 Political Director Dave Price.

Jim Mowrer grew up in bone, served in the Iraq War, came back and worked for the Iowa Democratic Party.
