Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said that while profit was not the motive to bail out Detroit and Wall Street, \u201cit is important to note we recovered more than we disbursed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lew, the total profit for American taxpayers on TARP investments stands at $15.35 billion.\n\nThe NYT report added, \u201cLess than $1 billion in taxpayer funds remain scattered in about 35 community banks around the country, but with the sale on Thursday of the government\u2019s last 54.9 million shares of Ally Financial \u2026 the Treasury declared the bailouts done.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, as a matter of politics and public opinion, TARP probably is about as popular as it was when George W. Bush signed the program into law in late 2008 \u2013 which is to say, not popular at all. The word \u201cbailout\u201d has taken on a sinister and menacing meaning in our discourse, to the point that it\u2019s effectively supposed to shut down debate on any idea that earns the label.\n\nBut there\u2019s still room for a credible debate about whether the program worked.\n\nWhen it comes to assessing President Obama\u2019s rescue of the auto industry, there\u2019s little doubt that the effort was a striking success, predictions to the contrary notwithstanding. As we\u2019ve discussed several times, among Republicans in 2009, failure was a foregone conclusion \u2013 government intervention in the marketplace always fails, they said, and Obama big-government solution to the auto industry\u2019s crisis simply couldn\u2019t work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "As of today, the rescue of the American auto industry -- and the American financial sector -- is officially over.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rescue-plan-successfully-runs-its-course", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "As of today, the rescue of the American auto industry -- and the American financial sector -- is officially over.", "title": "A rescue plan successfully runs its course", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rescue-plan-successfully-runs-its-course", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/rtx11rac.jpg?itok=VSnSo3e5", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rescue-plan-successfully-runs-its-course", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/rtx11rac.jpg?itok=Y3XLvYVf", "height": 553}, "title": "A rescue plan successfully runs its course", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As of today, the rescue of the American auto industry -- and the American financial sector -- is officially over."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-19T12:39:38-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "A rescue plan successfully runs its course", "tags": "auto-industry,economy,financial-industry,wall-street,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/19/2014 12:39:38 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rescue-plan-successfully-runs-its-course"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "As of today, the rescue of the American auto industry -- and the American financial sector -- is officially over.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, Wall Street, Auto Industry , Financial Industry"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to assessing President Obama\u2019s rescue of the auto industry, there\u2019s little doubt that the effort was a striking success, predictions to the contrary notwithstanding.\nYes, today\u2019s news means something rather important: the Troubled Asset Relief Program is now officially over , as is the rescue of the American auto industry.\nOrdinarily, the fact that the Treasury Department this morning sold its stake in something called \u201cAlly\u201d would hardly generate headlines, but Ally Financial is probably better known by its former name: General Motors Acceptance Corp (GMAC).\nBut there\u2019s still room for a credible debate about whether the program worked.\nThe Obama administration declared a profitable end to the Wall Street and auto bailouts on Friday, saying a final sale of stock from what was once General Motors\u2019 finance arm had closed a turbulent six-year chapter of the financial crisis."}
