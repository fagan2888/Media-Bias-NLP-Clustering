This week, let's talk about you. What kind of stuff do you like to read on this site, and how do we provide it when Congress takes off a day early to avoid a snow storm? Senior Politics Editor Paige Lavender explains.\n\nListen to this week's \"So, That Happened\" below:\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nSome highlights from this week:\n\n\u201cWe have an audience that loves to read about politics affecting actual human beings, and not just hearing about goings-on from the Hill. Whenever we have 'real-people stories,' we feature those pretty heavily.\u201d -- Paige Lavender\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court took up a challenge to Obamacare. If you like your health insurance, will you get to keep it? We talked to health care reporter Jeff Young about how nine people in robes could become the Affordable Care Act's final death panel.\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts had a chance to kill this thing three years ago. He chose not to, and went to great lengths to do so and made a lot of people very upset. So why do it now in such a weird way over such an arcane dispute?\u201d -- Jeff Young\n\nFinally, you might have heard that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) doesn't know whether President Barack Obama is a Christian, but did you know Walker kicked labor unions right in the collective bargaining unit this week? Labor reporter Dave Jamieson tells us all about it.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing. Walker has called private sector unions his partner in economic development. A lot of people thought he didn\u2019t want this, and the reason is that he\u2019s already famous for breaking unions.\u201d -- Dave Jamieson\n\n* * *\n\n\"So, That Happened\" is available on iTunes.
