Kacey Musgraves brought her candid country charm to the scorching-hot iHeartRadio Fan Village in Las Vegas on Saturday (Sept. 20), where she also doubled as an unlikely opening act for the day's biggest draw, 5 Seconds of Summer. But she's also fresh from wrapping a month's worth of dates on Katy Perry's PRISMatic Tour, as Billboard previewed in a May cover story, and ready to focus on her upcoming second album.

"I had such a blast on the PRISMatic tour, it was insanity," Musgraves told Billboard backstage at iHeartRadio, shortly after wrapping her 20-minute set. "It was so fun and everyone was so welcoming to the crew, Katy and her whole team. It was cool to see country music collide with what Katy does and I think it really worked."

And amid all the traveling and rehearsals throughout the Midwest and Canada, Musgraves was happy to report logging some girl-time. "Katy took us all to a water park at one point, I went roller skating for my birthday, and she just hung out with us. It was a great time."

Musgraves heads back out on the road later this week to play a handful of headline dates in support of her Grammy-winning debut Same Trailer, Different Park, but she's also eager to get back to work on its highly-anticipated follow-up. She's already been road-testing several new songs on tour, including early fan favorite "Biscuits," which features plenty of her now-trademark country wit ("Sow your own oats / Raise your own babies / Mind your own biscuits / And life will be gravy.")

Might "Biscuits" end up on her next project? "I love that song so much. I don’t wanna make any promises to myself before the whole thing takes shape because anything could change. But I do love that song and I do have a few that I’m really excited about. When I have some time to really sit and focus on writing, then I’ll add some more to the basket. And hopefully I’ll have something I really like there."
