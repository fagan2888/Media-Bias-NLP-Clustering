Bob Menendez (D)\n\nPhoto Credit: Menendez.senate.gov\n\n\n\nRemarks Prepared for Delivery:\n\n\u201cFor twenty three years as a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, I have had the privilege of dealing with major foreign policy and national security issues. Many of those have been of a momentous nature. This is one of those moments.\n\n\u201cI come to the issue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, with Iran, as someone who has followed Iran\u2019s nuclear ambition for the better part of two decades. I decide on whether to support or oppose an issue on the basis of whether, it is in my judgment, in the national interest and security of our country to do so.\n\n\u201cIn this case a secondary, but important, question is what it means for our great ally \u2014 the State of Israel \u2014 and our other partners in the Gulf.\n\n\u201cUnlike President Obama\u2019s characterization of those who have raised serious questions about the agreement, or who have opposed it, I did not vote for the war in Iraq, I opposed it, unlike the Vice President and the Secretary of State, who both supported it. My vote against the Iraq war was unpopular at the time, but it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.\n\n\u201cI also don\u2019t come to this question as someone, unlike many of my Republican colleagues, who reflexively oppose everything the President proposes. In fact, I have supported President Obama, according to Congressional Quarterly, 98 percent of the time in 2013 and 2014. On key policies ranging from voting in the Finance Committee and on the Senate Floor for the Affordable Care Act, to Wall Street Reform, to supporting the President\u2019s Supreme Court Nominees and defending the Administration\u2019s actions on the Benghazi tragedy, his Pivot to Asia, shepherding the authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to stop President Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, during the time I was Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to so much more, I have been a reliable supporter of President Obama.\n\n\u201cBut my support is not \u2013 and has not been driven by party loyalty, but rather by principled agreement, not political expediency. When I have disagreed it is also based on principled disagreement.\n\n\u201cThe issue before the Congress in September is whether to vote to approve or disapprove the agreement struck by the President and our P5+1 partners with Iran. This is one of the most serious national security, nuclear nonproliferation, arms control issues of our time. It is not an issue of supporting or opposing the President. This issue is much greater and graver than that.\n\n\u201cFor me, I have come to my decision after countless hours in hearings, classified briefings, and hours-and-hours of serious discussion and thorough analysis. I start my analysis with the question: Why does Iran \u2014 which has the world\u2019s fourth largest proven oil reserves, with 157 billion barrels of crude oil and the world\u2019s second largest proven natural gas reserves with 1,193 trillion cubic feet of natural gas \u2014 need nuclear power for domestic energy?\n\n\u201cWe know that despite the fact that Iran claims their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, they have violated the international will, as expressed by various U.N. Security Council Resolutions, and by deceit, deception and delay advanced their program to the point of being a threshold nuclear state. It is because of these facts, and the fact that the world believes that Iran was weaponizing its nuclear program at the Parchin Military Base \u2014 as well as developing a covert uranium enrichment facility in Fordow, built deep inside of a mountain, raising serious doubts about the peaceful nature of their civilian program, and their sponsorship of state terrorism \u2014 that the world united against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nLori Lowenthal Marcus\n\nAbout the Author: Lori Lowenthal Marcus is the U.S. correspondent for The Jewish Press.
