A standoff in McPherson County ended late Friday night after the suspect shot and killed himself.

Deputies were called around 2 p.m. Friday to the report of a possible suicidal man armed with a revolver at the McPherson State Lake, which is near the Maxwell Wildlife Refuge in the 2500 block of Pueblo Road.

The suspect, 59-year-old Steven W. Core, was eventually located in his pickup at the lake at around 3 p.m. Sheriff Larry Powell said negotiators arrived on scene and attempted to talk with Core for about four hours with “very limited response.”

Maxwell Wildlife Refuge Manager Cliff Peterson told KAKE News Friday evening that the suspect had threatened to commit suicide and instructed officers to keep their distance.

A single shot was fired just after 11 p.m. from inside Core’s pickup, Powell said, and Core was removed by officers. He was flown to a hospital with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and was pronounced dead about half an hour later.

No other injuries were reported.

Agencies involved were the McPherson Sheriff’s Office, McPherson Police Department, Kansas Highway Patrol, McPherson County Emergency Management, Kansas Wildlife and Parks, Canton Police Department, Harvey County Sheriff’s Office, Newton Police Department, McPherson EMS, Canton EMS and Canton Fire Department.

The McPherson Sentinel reports that Core was arrested on October 22 for aggravated indecent liberties with a child and was out on bond.

The alleged victim is a 10-year-old girl who knew the suspect, the Sentinel said.
