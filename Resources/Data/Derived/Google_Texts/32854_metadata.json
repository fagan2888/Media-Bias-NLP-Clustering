Last summer I took my 4-year-old to an optometrist with an air of confidence that I was just being overprotective. Much to my sickening surprise, he could barely see, as it turns out. One of his eyes was giving up, a nonreversible condition if not caught early.\n\nMy son\u2019s eyes lit up when glasses were put on and he could see properly. (Insert mom guilt.) His whole demeanor changed; he would cry, scream and nap a lot until that point. We had taken him to many specialists, and no one had suggested that we get his eyes checked. My son now loves to draw.\n\nI tell lots of people our story and ask them: \u201cDo you know how well your kids can see? Are you sure?\u201d\n\nOur optometrist is in an affluent part of Los Angeles and says he sees lots of high school students who are doing poorly in school because of their eyesight.\n\nLINDSAY KAVET\n\nLos Angeles\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nBasic vision care for children \u2014 as well as for adults \u2014 is often treated as an optional service that is less critical than other medical needs. But as Pamela Gallin points out, poor vision affects every facet of a child\u2019s life through developmental stages and educational outcomes.\n\nEven with the advent of the Affordable Care Act, there are many who do not have vision coverage and cannot afford to pay the average $154 cost of an eye exam and $200 cost for a pair of eyeglasses (according to VSP, a vision care insurance leader).\n\nUntil vision care is accorded the importance of vaccinations and other preventive medical services, nonprofits like mine, New Eyes for the Needy, can fill the gap by providing new prescription eyeglasses to needy children and adults. We constantly seek and embrace partners in the optical industry as well as those in the medical community to help us provide these disadvantaged people the simple yet critical tool of clear vision so that they may lead productive, independent and successful lives.\n\nJEAN GAJANO\n\nExecutive Director\n\nNew Eyes for the Needy\n\nShort Hills, N.J.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150520032115, "twitter": {"description": "Two readers stress the importance of regular eye checkups.", "title": "How Glasses Can Change Children\u2019s Lives", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/opinion/how-glasses-can-change-childrens-lives.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003692968"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/opinion/20glasses/20glasses-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/opinion/how-glasses-can-change-childrens-lives.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003692968", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/opinion/how-glasses-can-change-childrens-lives.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "How Glasses Can Change Children\u2019s Lives", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 20, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Eyes and Eyesight,Children and Childhood,Eyeglasses,Education (K-12)", "news_keywords": "Glasses", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/opinion/20glasses/20glasses-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Two readers stress the importance of regular eye checkups.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/opinion/20glasses/20glasses-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Two readers stress the importance of regular eye checkups.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-05-20", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Education (K-12)", "published": "2015-05-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "l20glasses", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150520032115, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/opinion/how-glasses-can-change-childrens-lives.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/opinion/20glasses/20glasses-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two readers stress the importance of regular eye checkups.", "title": "How Glasses Can Change Children\u2019s Lives"}, "pdate": 20150520, "des": "Education (K-12)", "articleid": 100000003692968, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How Glasses Can Change Children\u2019s Lives", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m a mother of three with access to top pediatricians and a network of neurotic moms, yet I was never advised to get my children\u2019s eyes checked.\nLast summer I took my 4-year-old to an optometrist with an air of confidence that I was just being overprotective.\nMy son\u2019s eyes lit up when glasses were put on and he could see properly.\nLINDSAY KAVETLos AngelesTo the Editor:Basic vision care for children \u2014 as well as for adults \u2014 is often treated as an optional service that is less critical than other medical needs.\nBut as Pamela Gallin points out, poor vision affects every facet of a child\u2019s life through developmental stages and educational outcomes."}
