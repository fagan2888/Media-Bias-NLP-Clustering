We focused on details which caused delays at critical times for customers that needed help.\"\n\n(Reporting by Peter Gosnell; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "australian, bank, boss, says, insurers, definition, heart, attacks, no, longer, best, practice", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\"I am saddened and disappointed by the handling of these cases,\" Ian Narev, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a statement on Saturday.", "title": "Australian Bank Boss Says Insurer Is Wrong On Heart Attacks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/australian-bank-boss-ian-narev-comminsure-heart-attacks-best-practice-381278", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/commonwealth-bank-ceo.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I am saddened and disappointed by the handling of these cases,\" Ian Narev, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a statement on Saturday.", "title": "Australian Bank Boss Says Insurer Is Wrong On Heart Attacks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/australian-bank-boss-ian-narev-comminsure-heart-attacks-best-practice-381278", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/commonwealth-bank-ceo.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/commonwealth-bank-ceo.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-04-09T17:09:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T17:09:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"I am saddened and disappointed by the handling of these cases,\" Ian Narev, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a statement on Saturday."}, "article_summary": "However, experts have condemned the definition, arguing that heart attacks cannot be diagnosed solely on the basis of troponin levels.\nThe CommInsure definition relies on the presence in the bloodstream of a specific protein called troponin, which is released when the heart is damaged.\nNarev's comment came as a joint Fairfax-Four Corners investigation revealed that CommInsure was reviewing its use of the definition of a heart attack and may have been aware since mid-2014 that it was no longer best practice.\nTo be assessed as having had a heart attack, a CommInsure client must show a minimum level of 2 micrograms of troponin per liter of blood.\nWe focused on details which caused delays at critical times for customers that needed help.\""}
