Fellow GOP presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio wasted no time attacking frontrunner Donald Trump online, saying he should've been quicker to condemn and repudiate support from hate groups.

James Muwakkil, president of the Lee County NAACP, said Trump's actions are just the latest message from the candidate to push devisive action, not inclusion.

"We're hearing rhetoric coming from the GOP party that divides, not unites. They're not saying the things that unite us as a country, as a nation.

"Can racism rule again? That's pretty much what that comes down to; can racism rule again? And the answer is no."

Muwakkil isn't sure what impact Trump's statements may have during the primaries, but he believes it could benefit the eventual Democratic nominee in the general election.

He said right now, he thinks voters would much rather hear about the issues affecting many families, like education, job creation and gun control.
