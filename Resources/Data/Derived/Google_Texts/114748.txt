The number of U.S. households with a net worth of $1 million or more reached 9.63 million in 2013.

With the recession getting further and further into our national rear-view mirror, America is setting new economic records all the time.

One of the new marks is the number of millionaires in America: According to a report released last month by the Spectrem Group, the number of U.S. households with a net worth of $1 million or more reached 9.63 million in 2013, an increase of more than 600,000 from 2012. We also set new records highs in the number of households with a net worth of $5 million and above and those with $25 million and above.
