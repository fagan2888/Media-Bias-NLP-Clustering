Thanks to massive internal disarray, Republicans are unable to agree on any kind of immigration reform plan. They can't say that, though, so they're blaming it on the fact that President Obama is a rogue despot who can't be trusted to enforce the law no matter what it is. He'll implement the parts he likes and ignore the rest, just as he's been doing for years with his sun-king presidency. So no immigration reform.

Also thanks to massive internal disarray, Republicans are unable to agree on a plan to raise the debt limit. Plan A was to demand the end of risk corridors in Obamacare (aka the "insurer bailout"), but that went nowhere. Plan B was to repeal the benefit cut for veterans that was enacted last month, which might have gone somewhere since Democrats are probably willing to go along with that in any case. But that didn't make the cut either because it would have made it tough for tea partiers to vote against the bill. Plan C is to "wrap several popular, must-pass items around a provision to extend the federal governmentâ€™s borrowing authority beyond the November midterm elections." But even this plan is looking shaky.

The common thread here is that the Republican Party is unable to get its act together enough to look beyond next week. Both immigration reform and a quiet debt limit increase would benefit the GOP in the long term. But both would also infuriate the yahoo wing of the party in the short term. So far, the yahoo wing is winning.
