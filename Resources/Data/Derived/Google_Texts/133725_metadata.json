Politicians and the media are at their most dangerous when they try to scare us, telling us disaster is on the way unless we follow, and pay for, their latest schemes to \u201cprotect\u201d us.\n\nI\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the future, too, if only because our last 200 years have shown that despite politicians\u2019 attacks on open markets and individual freedom, people keep getting richer and living longer.\n\nWhen Obama talks about the America we are creating together, it would be more honest if he congratulated Americans for all the progress we make (SET ITAL) despite (END ITAL) government fighting us at every turn -- with taxes and regulations and booming debt that lowers the value of each dollar.\n\nOf course, presidents want to be remembered positively, and Obama\u2019s cheerleaders are eager to put a happy spin on things in his final year in office.\n\nMichael Grunwald at Politico decided to help with a piece about Obama\u2019s policy accomplishments, describing America as \u201cthe nation he built.\u201d Obama once told us that if you have a business, \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that,\u201d so I guess now we know who does the building.\n\nGrunwald praises ObamaCare for expanding the number of Americans with health insurance and points out that, at the same time, the administration also sneaked through a government takeover of student loan debt. John Boehner was correct to complain that \u201cthe president will sign not one, but two job-killing government takeovers.\u201d\n\nBut Grunwald says that sticking taxpayers with billions of dollars of student debt was part of the \u201crelentless government activism\u201d needed to give America \u201ca profound course correction\u201d that also changed \u201cthe way we produce and consume energy, the way doctors and hospitals treat us, the academic standards in our schools and the long-term fiscal trajectory of the nation.\u201d\n\nAll that is true, if by changing how we consume energy he means shutting down pipelines while ignoring private industry\u2019s wonderful fracking revolution.\n\nIf by changing the way doctors treat us he means locking still more people into bureaucracies instead of letting a true health market flourish.\n\nIf academic standards mean imposing weird testing regimens and teaching methods like Common Core.\n\nAnd if \u201clong-term fiscal trajectory\u201d means nearly doubling our federal debt, now almost $19 trillion, and doing nothing to slow America\u2019s coming entitlements bankruptcy.\n\nLeftists can credit Obama with policy successes because Obama often outmaneuvered Republicans and got bills he wanted. Unfortunately, the left rarely looks closely at whether those bills really made Americans better off.\n\nGrunwald says Obama\u2019s $800 billion stimulus package crammed in a whole administration\u2019s worth of programs in one go -- but Grunwald adds only in passing that economists don\u2019t agree on whether the stimulus accomplished anything good.\n\nThat\u2019s the whole problem. Politicians unleash programs -- the more complicated the better -- and then take credit later for anything good that happens, blaming the bad things on their political opponents.\n\nIt usually takes years to figure out what the programs\u2019 real impacts were, if we ever do. People still argue -- 80 years later -- about whether the New Deal prolonged or helped end the Great Depression.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if the country is better or worse off because of \u201crelentless government activism.\u201d We libertarians argue that government helps us by keeping the peace and providing a level playing field but that beyond that, most government intervention does harm. That\u2019s why we\u2019re better off if individuals can pick and choose which things work for us.\n\nIn a real marketplace, individuals go to the schools we choose, buy health care we want and pay our own debts.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic about America, too -- but not because we \u201ccome together\u201d and function as a single union. I\u2019m optimistic because in most areas of life, we\u2019re still free to make our own decisions.\n\nJohn Stossel is the host of \"Stossel\" (Thursdays at 9 PM/ET), a weekly program highlighting current consumer issues with a libertarian viewpoint.
