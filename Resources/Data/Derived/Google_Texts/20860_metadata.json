Royals of the Valley Baseball League last summer, will be playing his first summer in the wooden-bat NECBL.\n\nKeene figures to have players from Indiana University, Butler and Northern Illinois for the first time, along with players from the usual feeding schools Virginia, St. John\u2019s, Louisville and Washington State.\n\nThe Bats will have two New Hampshire kids for the first time since the 2012 season. Along with Luopa, Boston College pitcher Carmen Giampetruzzi of Manchester also is expected to spend the summer in Keene.\n\nLuopa is also the first Keene native on the roster since Southern Maine infielder Brett Barrett in 2012.\n\nGiampetruzzi, a 6-foot-3 and 210-pound left-hander, was named to the NHIAA\u2019s All-State first team as a junior and senior at Trinity. He was ranked 91st nationally in the 2014 senior class and entered his BC career as the top-ranked left-hander in New Hampshire.\n\nGiampetruzzi, who graduated 10th in his class, also led the Pioneers to a football title in 2011 and basketball crown in 2013.\n\nThe University of Virginia, which lost in the College Baseball World Series to Vanderbilt last season, will send three pitchers to Keene this summer in sophomores Derek Casey, Tommy Doyle and Bennett Sousa.\n\nAll three will be getting their first look at Cavaliers baseball when the preseasons No. 3 team opens the season at East Carolina on Feb. 13 at 3 p.m.\n\nCasey, a right-handed hurler out of Mechanicsville, Va., was a 22nd-round pick by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, while Doyle, also a righty, was taken in the 35th round by the Nationals.\n\nCasey and Doyle are part of a 13-member freshman class that was picked as the nation\u2019s second-best recruiting class by Baseball America, marking Virginia\u2019s highest ranking in program history. LSU was picked No. 1.\n\nKade McClure, a pitcher from Mentor, Ohio, is also expected to be in Keene this summer. The 6-7 right-hander is headed to Louisville for his freshman season with an 86 mph fastball to accompany a few deceiving off-speed pitches.\n\nLincoln Henzman, of Lexington, Ky., will also come up from Louisville for the summer.\n\nIn the infield, Butler shortstop Garrett Christman of Noblesville, Ind., represents the only other MLB Draft pick on the roster. A 37th-round pick by the Giants, he was named an honorable mention for Perfect Game\u2019s All-American team in 2012 and 2013.\n\nChristman led his high school team to an Indiana Class 4A state title his senior year, hitting .342.\n\nWashington State\u2019s Wesley Leow and Shane Matheny, along with Luopa and Dan Cellucci of Bryant are the only other infielders currently on the roster, although several pitchers also can fill in on the corners.\n\nCellucci, of Sudbury, Mass., was the fourth-leading hitter for a Bryant squad that finished the season at the NCAA Regionals with a 42-16 record a year ago. The junior hit .249 with 12 doubles, two home runs and 36 RBIs. Defensively, Cellucci made just 12 errors on 255 chances, posting a .953 fielding percentage at shortstop.\n\nThe Bats also have multiple players coming from St. John\u2019s for the fifth time since 2010 in pitcher David Moyer and outfielder Anthony Brocato.\n\nOf the five outfielders listed, three are left-handed, with one being Cornell\u2019s Ryan Karl, a 6-2, 215-pound senior who started his college career at Louisville.\n\nKarl, who transferred to Cornell from community college, started all 39 games and posted a team-high .280 batting average. He added nine home runs, 32 RBIs and a .552 slugging percentage. Karl\u2019s father, Brian, played in the Milwaukee Brewers organization.\n\nSt. John\u2019s outfielder Anthony Brocato, a sophomore, ws the New Jersey player of the year out of high school.\n\nAdam Fournier is the lone Franklin Pierce representative and first since Paul Covelle in 2013.\n\nUMass pitcher and first baseman Michael Geannelis was the Atlantic-10 rookie of the year last season, and Hartford pitcher Kyle Gauthier, a senior right-hander, is the brother of 2012 Bats player Tyler Gauthier.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "The Keene Swamp Bats, who lost in the first round of the NECBL playoffs last year on the heels of winning it all the season before, will have an entirely new look for the 2015 season.", "title": "Keene roster features almost all new faces", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/sports/local_sports/keene-roster-features-almost-all-new-faces/article_0f479f71-9bc9-53ae-aa46-6b17cc5bf843.html", "image": {"width": 282, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/49/d49b1d1b-c7bb-5462-97c7-983a6476e838/54a72af637c72.preview-100.jpg?resize=282%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "The Keene Swamp Bats, who lost in the first round of the NECBL playoffs last year on the heels of winning it all the season before, will have an entirely new look for the 2015 season.", "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local_sports,swamp_bats,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local_sports,swamp_bats,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e6e\"", "article_summary": "The roster features one familiar name around Alumni Field in Lucas Luopa, a Keene High graduate and junior infielder at Eckerd College.\nLuopa is also the first Keene native on the roster since Southern Maine infielder Brett Barrett in 2012.\nHe was ranked 91st nationally in the 2014 senior class and entered his BC career as the top-ranked left-hander in New Hampshire.\nAlong with Luopa, Boston College pitcher Carmen Giampetruzzi of Manchester also is expected to spend the summer in Keene.\nKade McClure, a pitcher from Mentor, Ohio, is also expected to be in Keene this summer."}
