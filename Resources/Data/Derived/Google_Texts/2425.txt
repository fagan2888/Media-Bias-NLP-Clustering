Obama and his media supporters are whining that Boehner's invite to Netanyahu is a breach of protocol.

Do you know what is an actual breach of protocol?

Obama unilaterally passing amnesty, unilaterally ending the Cuban embargo and unilaterally making changes to ObamaCare after it had become law.

And let's not forget starting wars and "informing" Congress only days after they were underway.

Correction, those aren't breaches of protocols, they're illegal and unconstitutional.

Obama has begun acting like he embodies Congress in his own phone and pen. His defenders can hardly whine that Congress is taking some initiative on foreign policy. An initiative so mild that it's hardly there.

You can't complain that Congress is intruding into areas within the scope of the White House, when the White House passes its own laws.

That's a double standard from a man who sits on a throne made out of his own double standards.
