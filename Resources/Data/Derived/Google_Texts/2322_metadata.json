Tom Cotton (R-AK), one of the most rabid opponents of the deal, characterized it as a \u201csigning bonus\u201d that Iran\u2019s leaders could use to fund overseas terrorism and other attacks on U.S. interests. Proponents of the deal say that it will allow Iran to begin repairing an economy hobbled by decades of punishing sanctions that began in 1979, when revolutionaries overthrew the U.S.-friendly government of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and took American hostages.\n\nRelated: Tom Cotton Sharpens His Knives for Obama\u2019s Iran Deal\n\nAfter the eventual release of the hostages in 1981, tentative talks began over the disposition of assets in the U.S. that had been frozen by President Carter in 1979. The discussions quickly became complicated, in part because of the difficulty of identifying personal and governmental assets, and tracking down assets of the deposed Shah, which the Iranian government insisted rightly belonged to the Iraqi people.\n\nMany of the assets blocked by Carter in 1979 were unfrozen in 1981 after the signing of the Algiers Accords and the end of the hostage crisis.\n\nTen years after the revolution, though, former undersecretary of state David Newsom wrote, \u201cAny resumption of formal relations between the US and Iran will require a further sorting out of the web of financial claims and counter claims. To suggest that this process can take place quickly neglects history, underestimates the complexity of the present situation, and obstructs an examination of other possible solutions to the hostage issue.\u201d\n\nMore than 25 years after Newsom\u2019s observation, the issue is still a complicated one. The U.S. has actually released billions of dollars to Iran already, such as the nearly $3 billion released last summer as a show of good faith during the negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nRelated: How the Iran Nuclear Deal Will Affect Oil Prices\n\nHowever, according to the Congressional Research Service, there is still a substantial amount of money, real estate and other property being held.\n\nFor instance, the former Iranian embassy in Washington was impounded by the United States and rented out, as were 10 other properties in various locations. The real estate and accumulated rent is estimated to be worth $50 million.\n\nAt the time of the 1979 revolution, Iran\u2019s deposed government had been waiting on the delivery of some $400 million in military equipment, for which it had already paid. The Pentagon later re-sold that equipment and the money was placed in an escrow account.\n\nLater executive actions blocked financial assets owned directly or indirectly by Iran\u2019s central bank, major companies, and various government and military entities.\n\nRelated: Iran Agrees to Limit Nuclear Weapons in Historic Deal\n\nThe agreement announced this morning runs to 159 pages, and 60 of them are dedicated simply to listing the individuals and entities that will have some or all of the financial sanctions against them lifted and their assets unfrozen.\n\nThe $100 billion figure, however, does not apply only to assets frozen in the U.S. Actions by the United Nations related to Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its treatment of protesters after a 2009 uprising resulted in Iranian assets being frozen around the world. (Not all of the sanctions imposed on Iran over human rights abuses will be lifted under the deal.)\n\nWhere Iran will spend its windfall is unclear, but the likelihood of it immediately stocking up on sophisticated weapons and shipping them off to terrorist proxies across the Middle East is limited. An embargo on selling weapons to the Islamic Republic will not be eased for at least five more years.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More than 35 years after President Jimmy Carter first froze Iranian assets in reaction to the taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, unwinding the long trail of blocked money and property is no small task.", "title": "The Long, Confusing History of Iran\u2019s Frozen Assets", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/14/Long-Confusing-History-Iran-s-Frozen-Assets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cnews-us-iran-nuclear-iaea_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/14/Long-Confusing-History-Iran-s-Frozen-Assets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cnews-us-iran-nuclear-iaea_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "More than 35 years after President Jimmy Carter first froze Iranian assets in reaction to the taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, unwinding the long trail of blocked money and property is no small task.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The $100 billion figure, however, does not apply only to assets frozen in the U.S.\nActions by the United Nations related to Iran\u2019s nuclear program and its treatment of protesters after a 2009 uprising resulted in Iranian assets being frozen around the world.\nRelated: How the Iran Nuclear Deal Will Affect Oil PricesHowever, according to the Congressional Research Service, there is still a substantial amount of money, real estate and other property being held.\nLater executive actions blocked financial assets owned directly or indirectly by Iran\u2019s central bank, major companies, and various government and military entities.\nThe U.S. has actually released billions of dollars to Iran already, such as the nearly $3 billion released last summer as a show of good faith during the negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program."}
