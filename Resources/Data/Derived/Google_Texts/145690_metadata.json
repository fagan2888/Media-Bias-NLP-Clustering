Even if such bouts of forgetfulness aren\u2019t serious, a screening test for dementia or its most common cause \u2014 Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 might seem appealing, if only to reassure you that you\u2019re not losing your mind.\n\nYet there are good reasons to think twice about such a test, says Des Spence, a general physician in Glasgow, Scotland, and a columnist for BMJ. For one thing, early dementia is difficult to distinguish from mild cognitive impairment, those minor memory blips that sneak up as we age. About one in five people older than 75 have such blips, and most cases never progress to dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, Spence says.\n\nSome memory lapses that may seem like dementia are actually something else. In a study published last year, Danish researchers revisited the records of nearly 900 patients thought to have dementia and discovered that 41 percent of them had received faulty diagnoses. Alcohol abuse and depression were the most common problems mistaken for dementia, says study author Lise Cronberg Salem, a neurologist at the Danish Dementia Research Center in Copenhagen.\n\nSmall strokes that damage arteries in the brain can cause a type of memory loss known as vascular dementia, and then there\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Right now, an autopsy is the only definitive test for either of these conditions. A recently developed test that uses a PET scan is promising, but \u201cthe results can be misleading,\u201d according to a statement by the Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. \u201cThe scan does not prove that you have Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about memory loss, your first step should be to see a gerontologist or neurologist who specializes in dementia, not seek a brain scan, says Satoshi Minoshima, a professor of radiology at the University of Washington.\n\nAn Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is made based on tests that evaluate such factors as memory, judgment and orientation to time and place, says Beth Kallmyer, vice president of constituent services at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, a nonprofit based in Chicago. \u201cWhen a full evaluation is done by somebody who understands how to do it, you\u2019re talking 90 percent or so degree of accuracy,\u201d Kallmyer says. Such an evaluation goes deeper than the brief memory or recall tests that might be used as a first screen for dementia.\n\nDoctors are required to check Medicare patients for cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visits provided under the Affordable Care Act, and that worries Malaz Boustani, a geriatrician and chief innovation and implementation officer at Indiana University Health. Most of this screening is done with a brief questionnaire or by asking family members to answer questions about their loved one, but there\u2019s no one standard test nor is there guidance about what should come next, he says. \u201cI\u2019m nervous that screening alone, without any comprehensive follow-up program, might cause more harm than benefits,\u201d Boustani says.\n\nEven with the best screening tests, about 20 percent of those who turn up positive for dementia don\u2019t actually have it, and \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of people walking around worried that they might have dementia, when they don\u2019t,\u201d Boustani says. Another 30 percent of people who screen positive for dementia actually have only mild cognitive impairment, which won\u2019t progress or cause them serious problems.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s evidence that dementia is underdiagnosed in people who have it, says Albert Siu, co-vice chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force panel that recently evaluated all the research on cognitive impairment screening.\n\nWhether early diagnosis improves outcomes is another open question. The task force found no evidence that early detection helps patients, their caregivers and doctors make better decisions about health-care and end-of-life decisions, and it concluded that there simply isn\u2019t good evidence to say that clinicians should screen people without symptoms. The task force\u2019s statement is not a recommendation not to screen, he says; rather, it\u2019s an acknowledgment that it\u2019s not clear how the risks and benefits of screening stack up.\n\nBefore we start screening more aggressively for dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s, we should give careful thought to the implications a diagnosis will have on people\u2019s lives, says Michael Gusmano, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center, a research center in Garrison, N.Y. Knowing that your mind is slipping could have consequences for everything from career choices to how you handle your money and whether you can get long-term-care insurance. Gusmano stops short of suggesting that screening shouldn\u2019t be available, but he says it shouldn\u2019t be offered without a full understanding of the profound effects that the results might have.\n\nRight now, doctors have very few treatments for patients with dementia, and the treatments that are available provide, at best, only modest benefits, Spence says. \u201cKnowing early may just mean that you take away people\u2019s sense of well-being earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that you are going to lose your personality and lose who you are \u2014 that\u2019s a terrifying prospect, and we need to be very careful about getting that wrong.\u201d\n\nWorried about memory loss? You should first see a gerontologist or neurologist who specializes in dementia, not seek a brain scan.

But if your worst memory problem is a forgotten name or a word stuck on the tip of your tongue, there\u2019s no compelling reason to seek screening.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, anybody, christie aschwanden, des spense, dementia, alzheimer's disease, tests for alzheimer's disease, pet scan for alzheimer's disease, valu eof dementia tests", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Diagnosis can be slippery and that little bit of information can lead to an array of other problems", "title": "Why you may want to avoid a dementia test", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/why-you-may-want-to-avoid-a-dementia-test/2013/12/13/6377bee6-6071-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/13/Production/Health/Images/iStock_000023595907Medium.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/why-you-may-want-to-avoid-a-dementia-test/2013/12/13/6377bee6-6071-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, anybody, christie aschwanden, des spense, dementia, alzheimer's disease, tests for alzheimer's disease, pet scan for alzheimer's disease, valu eof dementia tests", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "6377bee6-6071-11e3-bf45-61f69f54fc5f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Diagnosis can be slippery and that little bit of information can lead to an array of other problems"}, "article_summary": "Small strokes that damage arteries in the brain can cause a type of memory loss known as vascular dementia, and then there\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nAbout one in five people older than 75 have such blips, and most cases never progress to dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, Spence says.\nEven if such bouts of forgetfulness aren\u2019t serious, a screening test for dementia or its most common cause \u2014 Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 might seem appealing, if only to reassure you that you\u2019re not losing your mind.\nAlcohol abuse and depression were the most common problems mistaken for dementia, says study author Lise Cronberg Salem, a neurologist at the Danish Dementia Research Center in Copenhagen.\nFor one thing, early dementia is difficult to distinguish from mild cognitive impairment, those minor memory blips that sneak up as we age."}
