CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nTwo California high school boys were hospitalized Monday after a routine football game, both with brain injuries. The students, who were on the Union Mine High School junior varsity team, began acting weird and fatigued after the game \u2014 then collapsed shortly after.\n\nOne of the players, Justin Schwartz, was released from the hospital with a grade 3 concussion and a nerve injury in his neck, but Nick Brown remains in critical condition due to a \u201chigh impact blow to the head that caused a subdural brain bleed,\u201d his family said in a statement.\n\nThough some are speculating that Adderall use might have contributed to the accident, the hospitalizations remain a \"mystery,\" according to media outlets. In line with the Adderall narrative, another 17-year-old Union Mine High School student was arrested after being charged with possession and distribution of the drug. Adderall use increases blood pressure and heart rate, but it's not certain whether the drug exacerbated the brain injury.\n\nThat being said, these \u201cmysterious\u201d hospitalizations don\u2019t appear to be that mysterious at all. They\u2019re the result of blunt trauma to the head, which can cause concussions, brain bleeding, and far worse scenarios down the line.\n\nSadly, traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in contact sports like football, hockey, and lacrosse are more common than you might imagine. Many times, subtle brain injuries that occur at a young age are written off as concussions \u2014 but they prove to be far more serious later in life, leading to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disorder in which a former athlete \u2014 typically boxers or football players \u2014 experiences memory loss, impulsivity, aggression, depression, and an increased risk of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nConcussions are often written off as no big deal; in machismo games like football, injured players are seen as a liability rather than a kid who could be increasing his risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, depression, a plummeting IQ, and suicidal thoughts exponentially. In football, coaches are very much like CEOs of a corporation looking to win \u2014 and players are employees, easily replaceable if they slip up. That\u2019s why many concussions or injuries go underreported in the sport, especially among young athletes who want to give their all to get to the top.\n\nThe National Center for Injury Prevention notes that 47 percent of high school football players are diagnosed with a concussion every season \u2014 but the true number of concussions is likely twice that amount. Concussions, especially repeated multiple ones that don\u2019t give the first ones a chance to heal, damage the white matter of the brain over time, ultimately resulting in impaired cognitive function, severe depression, suicidal thoughts, and other issues. Long-term head trauma could lead to CTE and ultimately early death. According to PBS, some 76 of 79 NFL players who had donated their brains after death were found to have CTE.\n\nJourney Bailey, a student who suffered brain bleeding after a traumatic brain injury and nearly died, wrote an article in The Huffington Post to detail his experience and to warn other young people about the dangers of contact sports, particularly football.\n\n\u201cI wanted to write this article for my many friends who are playing football in college right now, and to the younger athletes out there playing high school and youth football,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cThis is the article I wish I could have read back when I was in your shoes; back when I still had a chance to become the person I wanted to be.\u201d\n\nABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "football, brain injuries, tbi", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The hospitalizations of two high school football players reopens old wounds about the dangers of traumatic brain injuries in sports.", "title": "'Mysterious' Brain Injuries Put 2 High School Football Players In The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/high-school-football-players-go-hospital-mysterious-brain-injuries-long-term-effects-350614", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/football.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The hospitalizations of two high school football players reopens old wounds about the dangers of traumatic brain injuries in sports.", "title": "'Mysterious' Brain Injuries Put 2 High School Football Players In The Hospital", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/high-school-football-players-go-hospital-mysterious-brain-injuries-long-term-effects-350614", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/football.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/01/football.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-01T13:25:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-01T13:25:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The hospitalizations of two high school football players reopens old wounds about the dangers of traumatic brain injuries in sports."}, "article_summary": "CC BY-ND 2.0Two California high school boys were hospitalized Monday after a routine football game, both with brain injuries.\nSadly, traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in contact sports like football, hockey, and lacrosse are more common than you might imagine.\nThe students, who were on the Union Mine High School junior varsity team, began acting weird and fatigued after the game \u2014 then collapsed shortly after.\nAdderall use increases blood pressure and heart rate, but it's not certain whether the drug exacerbated the brain injury.\nThey\u2019re the result of blunt trauma to the head, which can cause concussions, brain bleeding, and far worse scenarios down the line."}
