Rick Scott added a fifth Florida county to a public health emergency declaration over the Zika virus on Thursday, and asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for training and other assistance.\n\nBroward joins Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Lee and Santa Rosa counties as where cases of the mosquito-borne illness have been found. All of the cases are travel related.\n\n\"I don't think it's scaring people, it's telling people that your state government is going to be prepared,\u201d Soctt said at the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County.\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to see your government, when there's an issue, to be prepared, and that's what we're doing. We\u2019re getting prepared.\"\n\nThe Zika virus is getting international attention after infecting thousands of people in Central and South America, and particularly because it is suspected of causing birth defects, though that link has not been confirmed. None of the Zika patients in Florida are pregnant women.\n\nScott said he asked the CDC for more training for Florida's hospital workers, and for at least 1,000 Zika antibody test kits for pregnant women and for new mothers who have shown symptoms of the virus after traveling to affected countries.\n\nFlorida Surgeon General Dr. John Armstrong joined Scott in Tampa Thursday and said the tests are especially critical for woman who have traveled overseas, and may wonder if they may have contracted the Zika virus.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is to counsel people that in the interim, it's important that they avoid contact with mosquitoes, to stay indoors.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get the result, and then that sets the path forward for the individual patient.\"\n\n.@FLGovScott says public health emergency expanded to include Broward County @wusf @HealthNewsFL #Zika pic.twitter.com/YLsAK2zTyF \u2014 Lottie Watts (@Lottie_Watts) February 4, 2016\n\nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report.\n\nLottie Watts is a reporter and producer with WUSF in Tampa.
