This is just the core public service we\u2019re talking about. Who knows what it costs Canada Post for media spinners to explain that community mailboxes are better for us than door-to-door delivery?\n\nNow, $263 million might be a reasonable price to pay \u2014 it might even be a bargain \u2014 if the federal government actually provided Canadians with public information in a timely manner.\n\nBut anybody who has actually tried to phone or email someone in the federal government in order to get an answer to a question knows that this is not the case.\n\nThe days when federal government officials would return the telephone calls of Canadians, or even better, answer their phones, are rapidly fading memories.\n\nCanadians are seeing a quarter-billion dollars of their money used against them: not to provide them with information, but rather to delay, conceal and spin the information to enhance the image of the party in power.\n\nExamples of the federal government\u2019s penchant for secrecy have since crossed the border into farce. Consider Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s briefing notes for the 2011 visit to Ottawa of British Prime Minister David Cameron, released finally under the Access to Information Act:\n\n\u201c(REDACTED) will greet (REDACTED) at the airport and you will greet him at Confederation Square to witness a 19-gun salute and to review the honour guard . . . (REDACTED) will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\u201d\n\nIn June, the federal Department of Public Safety responded to an access to information request from Toronto Star reporter Alex Boutilier with a heavily censored version of a media backgrounder that is actually posted, in all its uncensored glory, on the prime minister\u2019s website.\n\nOne federal communications department takes its mandate not to communicate so seriously, it has produced and distributed posters with a telephone hotline number \u2014 reminding public servants whom they must call if a member of the media should ever phone and ask a question.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for federal employees to declare independence \u2013 answer the phone, answer the questions, and save us all a few hundred million in unnecessary spin doctor salaries.\n\nGregory Thomas is Federal Director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently released numbers reveal that 3,325 spin doctors toil for the Harper government at an estimated cost in 2014 of $263 million.", "news_keywords": "access to information, Ottawa, Opinion, Gregory Thomas, communications, Spin Doctors", "og": {"site_name": "thestar.com", "description": "Recently released numbers reveal that 3,325 spin doctors toil for the Harper government at an estimated cost in 2014 of $263 million.", "title": "Ottawa\u2019s spin doctor payroll rivals that of the Commons | Toronto Star", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons.html", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons/harper_and_house.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Recently released numbers reveal that 3,325 spin doctors toil for the Harper government at an estimated cost in 2014 of $263 million.", "title": "Ottawa\u2019s spin doctor payroll rivals that of the Commons | Toronto Star", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons/harper_and_house.jpg", "creator": "Gregory Thomas", "site": "@TorontoStar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons/harper_and_house.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "bt": {"pubDate": 1407101400000, "author": "Gregory Thomas", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons.html", "dateDisplay": "Sun., Aug. 3, 2014", "modDate": 1407101402221, "type": "Story", "id": "da5889e1-a083-40a8-9032-85e3f0d42d1a"}, "parsely-title": "Ottawa\u2019s spin doctor payroll rivals that of the Commons", "parsely-tags": "access to information, Ottawa, Opinion, Gregory Thomas, communications, Spin Doctors", "parsely-author": "Gregory Thomas", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "access to information, Ottawa, Opinion, Gregory Thomas, communications, Spin Doctors", "parsely-section": "Commentary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar", "section": "Commentary", "modified": "2014-08-03", "published": "2014-08-03"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-03T21:30:00.000Z", "genre": "News Analysis", "parsely-image-url": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons/harper_and_house.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/08/03/ottawas_spin_doctor_payroll_rivals_that_of_the_commons.html"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf661\"", "article_summary": "The combined payroll of federal spin doctors rivals the $329-million payroll of the House of Commons, the beating heart of our democracy, the institution we rely upon to keep hundreds of thousands of federal officials accountable.\nThe ranks of communications staff have grown by 163 and costs have risen by $48 million since Stephen Harper's Conservatives took office.\nMaybe it\u2019s time for federal employees to declare independence \u2013 answer the phone, answer the questions, and save us all a few hundred million in unnecessary spin doctor salaries.\nWhen we\u2019re spending nearly as much on spin as we are on the House of Commons, we\u2019re on a very slippery slope indeed.\nAnd the payroll hit for communications staff \u2014 $263 million \u2014 does not include the RCMP, the military, the Canada Revenue Agency, independent tribunals such as the Canadian Human Rights Commission or Crown corporations."}
