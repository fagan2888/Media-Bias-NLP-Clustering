And the oligarchs are plotting their final takeover by using their economic dominance to capture governmental power \u2013 specifically, the governmental power which sets the rules for the very marketplace that provides the oligarchs with such massive wealth.\n\nOnce the American corporate barons own the institutions that are meant to regulate them, it\u2019s game-over for both rational capitalism (including competition) and for democracy.\n\nLast week, at David and Charles Koch\u2019s annual winter meeting near Palm Springs, California, it was announced that the Koch Brothers\u2019 political organization would spend close to $900 million on the 2016 election. If this goal is met, the group of corporate leaders will spend far more than the Republican Party and its congressional campaign committees spent, combined, in the 2012 campaign.\n\nOnce upon a time, it would have been illegal for the Koch Brothers and their fellow oligarchs to buy an election. Of course, that time was before the Citizens United Supreme Court decision.\n\nIn 2010, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, presented the best opportunity for the Roberts Court to use its five vote majority to totally re-write the face of politics in America, rolling us back to the pre-1907 era of the Robber Barons.\n\nAs Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The New Yorker (\u201cNo More Mr. Nice Guy\u201d): \u201cIn every major case since he became the nation\u2019s seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with the prosecution over the defendant, the state over the condemned, the executive branch over the legislative, and the corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff.\n\nEven more than Scalia, who has embodied judicial conservatism during a generation of service on the Supreme Court, Roberts has served the interests, and reflected the values, of the contemporary Republican Party.\u201d\n\nBack then, the modern Republican Party and the oligarchs that dominated it, knew that the only way to recover power was to immediately clear away all impediments to unrestrained corporate participation in electoral politics. If a corporate board likes a politician, they can make sure he or she is elected every time; if the CEO oligarchs become upset with a politician, they can carpet-bomb her district with a few million dollars worth of ads and politically destroy her.\n\nAnd it looks like that\u2019s exactly what the Roberts Court accomplished. The oligarchs succeeded. In the Citizens United case, forces within the Republican Party asked the Supreme Court to go all the way back to the 1980s and re-examine the rationales for Congress to have any power to regulate corporate \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nAs Robert Barnes wrote in The Washington Post on June 30, 2009, \u201cCitizens United\u2019s attorney, former solicitor general Theodore B. Olson, had told the court that it should use the case to overturn the corporate spending ban the court recognized in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, as well as its decision in 2003 to uphold McCain-Feingold as constitutional.\u201d\n\nThe setup for this came in June of 2007, in the case of the Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right To Life, in which the Roberts Court ruled that the FEC couldn\u2019t prevent WRTL from running ads just because they were a corporation.\n\n\u201cA Moroccan cartoonist,\u201d Justice Scalia opened his opinion with his usual dramatic flair, \u201conce defended his criticism of the Moroccan monarch (l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 being a serious crime in Morocco) as follows: \u2018I\u2019m not a revolutionary, I\u2019m just defending freedom of speech. I never said we had to change the king-no, no, no, no! But I said that some things the king is doing, I do not like. Is that a crime?'\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Scalia wrote, \u201cin the United States (making due allowance for the fact that we have elected representatives instead of a king) it is a crime, at least if the speaker is a union or a corporation (including not-for-profit public-interest corporations)\u2026 That is the import of \u00a7203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).\u201d\n\nThe idea of Congress passing laws that limited corporate \u201cfree speech\u201d was clearly horrifying to Scalia. He went after the 1990 Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce case, in which the MCC was limited in their \u201cfree speech\u201d in a political campaign because they were a corporation.\n\n\u201cThis (Austin) was the only pre-McConnell case in which this Court had ever permitted the Government to restrict political speech based on the corporate identity of the speaker,\u201d he complained. \u201cAustin upheld state restrictions on corporate independent expenditures,\u201d and, God forbid, \u201cThe statute had been modeled after the federal statute that BCRA \u00a7203 amended\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Austin case, Scalia concluded his opinion with four others nodding, \u201cwas a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles. In my view, it was wrongly decided.\u201d\n\nScalia also quoted at length from opinions in the Grosjean v. American Press Co case, \u201cholding that corporations are guaranteed the \u2018freedom of speech and of the press, safeguarded by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,'\u201d and from the 1986 Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n of Cal. case: \u201cThe identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining whether speech is protected\u201d; \u201c[c]orporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the \u2018discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas\u2019 that the First Amendment seeks to foster.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line, for Scalia, was that, \u201cThe principle that such advocacy is \u2018at the heart of the First Amendment\u2019s protection\u2019 and is \u2018indispensable to decision making in a democracy\u2019 is \u2018no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\u201d\n\nContinuing to quote from a plurality opinion in Pacific Gas, Scalia \u201crejected the arguments that corporate participation \u2018would exert an undue influence on the outcome of a referendum vote'; that corporations would \u2018drown out other points of view\u2019 and \u2018destroy the confidence of the people in the democratic process\u2026\u201d\n\nHe even quoted an opinion in the Grossjean case, writing that \u201ccorporations are guaranteed the \u2018freedom of speech and of the press\u2026safeguarded by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.'\u201d\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, which says that no \u201cperson\u201d shall be denied \u201cequal protection of the laws,\u201d was promulgated after the Civil War to free the slaves. But corporations have long asserted that because it says \u201cperson\u201d rather than \u201cnatural person\u201d it included giving, in 1868 when the Amendment was ratified into law, full Constitutional rights under the Bill of Rights to corporations. (Corporations are, at law, known as \u201cartificial persons\u201d and humans are \u201cnatural persons\u201d \u2013 both have to have some sort of \u201cpersonhood\u201d in order to pay taxes, sue and be sued, etc.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're still paying the price for Citizens United, and our oligarchs are poised to capture even more political power", "title": "\u201cFascism is rising in America\u201d: The Koch brothers and democracy\u2019s dispiriting demise", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We're still paying the price for Citizens United, and our oligarchs are poised to capture even more political power", "title": "\u201cFascism is rising in America\u201d: The Koch brothers and democracy\u2019s dispiriting demise", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/08/fascism_is_rising_in_america_the_koch_brothers_and_the_painful_demise_of_democracy_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/david_koch4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're still paying the price for Citizens United, and our oligarchs are poised to capture even more political power", "title": "\u201cFascism is rising in America\u201d: The Koch brothers and democracy\u2019s dispiriting demise", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/david_koch4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Thom Hartmann", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, California, Charles Koch, David Koch, Fascism, Koch Brothers, Oligarchy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And it looks like that\u2019s exactly what the Roberts Court accomplished.\nOnce upon a time, it would have been illegal for the Koch Brothers and their fellow oligarchs to buy an election.\nTopics: AlterNet, California, Charles Koch, David Koch, Fascism, Koch Brothers, Oligarchy, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetAs the American Heritage Dictionary noted, fascism is: \u201cA system of government that exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right, typically through the merging of state and business leadership, together with belligerent nationalism.\u201dWell, it it may well on our doorstep.\nOnce the American corporate barons own the institutions that are meant to regulate them, it\u2019s game-over for both rational capitalism (including competition) and for democracy.\nLast week, at David and Charles Koch\u2019s annual winter meeting near Palm Springs, California, it was announced that the Koch Brothers\u2019 political organization would spend close to $900 million on the 2016 election."}
