This Sunday at TLC, the tables will be turned with all three members of The Shield turning their attention to CM Punk in a 3-on-1 handicap match.\n\nDo CM Punk\u2019s chances for survival at the TLC pay-per-view depend on his ability to fight this three-headed monster head-on? Perhaps a divide-and-conquer approach might offer CM Punk a different approach because when they\u2019re on top of their game, The Shield represent one of the most destructive and cohesive tag-team forces in the history of the business. That\u2019s when they\u2019re on the same page, of course.\n\nHeading into their match with CM Punk this Sunday, The Shield haven\u2019t been the most cohesive of units. Remember when Dean Ambrose made mention of being the only member who was still a champion? Roman Reigns had quite a look to offer the de facto leader.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many exasperated glances he\u2019s gotten from Reigns and Seth Rollins lately, the most recent of which was the microphone thunder-stealing that went on during their presentation of the 2013 Slammy for Double Cross of the Year. Maybe Ambrose is getting a bit too big for his britches because while The Shield have always been about the unit, he\u2019s doing a lot to make it all about himself. If CM Punk can find a way to exploit that dynamic at TLC, fans might see one of the hounds get a little dose of justice himself.\n\nWith rumors of his retirement swirling around backstage, pay-per-view could be offer fans one of CM Punk\u2019s last great matches. While CM Punk fans never want to see that happen, he\u2019s been performing while injured lately and his contract is up in 2013. And, of course, there\u2019s always the cryptic manner in which CM Punk likes to operate.\n\nHow do you like CM Punk\u2019s chances this Sunday at TLC? Can CM Punk pull off what has to be considered an upset victory over Ambrose, Rollins and Reigns?", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been more than a year since The Shield made their WWE debut, with the hounds of justice helping CM Punk retain his WWE Title at Survivor Series last", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "It\u2019s been more than a year since The Shield made their WWE debut, with the hounds of justice helping CM Punk retain his WWE Title at Survivor Series last", "title": "Handicapped CM Punk Looks To Show The Shield Some Clobberin\u2019 TLC", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1058643/handicapped-cm-punk-looks-to-show-the-shield-some-clobberin-tlc/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CMPunk_crop_650x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-11T13:23:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-11T13:53:17+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CMPunk_crop_650x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-12-11T13:23:07+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "cm punk,cm punk injury,cm punk news,cm punk retirement,cm punk rumors,cm punk the shield,cm punk tlc,cm punk wwe,sports entertainment,wwe news,wwe rumors,entertainment", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CMPunk_crop_650x440.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It\u2019s been more than a year since The Shield made their WWE debut, with the hounds of justice helping CM Punk retain his WWE Title at Survivor Series last"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29e3\"", "article_summary": "In the early going, the trio helped CM Punk out quite a bit, again interfering against Ryback at January\u2019s Tables Ladders & Chairs match on RAW.\nHeading into their match with CM Punk this Sunday, The Shield haven\u2019t been the most cohesive of units.\nThis Sunday at TLC, the tables will be turned with all three members of The Shield turning their attention to CM Punk in a 3-on-1 handicap match.\nDo CM Punk\u2019s chances for survival at the TLC pay-per-view depend on his ability to fight this three-headed monster head-on?\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s always the cryptic manner in which CM Punk likes to operate."}
