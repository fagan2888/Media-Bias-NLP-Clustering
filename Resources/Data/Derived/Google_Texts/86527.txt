Centene is taking a breather from a solid rebound off its 10-week moving average that started in early February. Although it still has a little way to go, Centene (CNC) is again getting closer to its 10-week line, which could provide another buying opportunity.

Centene, which broke out from a base in September, has pulled back in soft volume, signaling that big investors are not the the ones behind the selling. Centene hasn’t had a down week in above-average trade since the week that ended Sept. 5. Turnover was huge that week, when Centene was added to the S&P MidCap 400 index.

The stock has seen strong accumulation lately. Both its up/down volume ratio and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating are still at high levels.

St. Louis, Mo.-based Centene provides managed health care services. Business for Centene has ramped up thanks to the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, which has also helped other managed-care providers.

The company’s push into a variety of state health care exchanges and states’ turning over Medicaid patients to managed-care firms also helped to increase membership. At the end of 2014, Centene had nearly 4.1 million members, up about 41% from 2013.

Centene reports first-quarter results before the market open on April 28. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 20% to 48 cents a share. Sales are expected at a record $5.12 billion, up 48% from a year ago. That result would extend a long streak of double-digit gains.

The HMO industry group has been a market leader, and on Thursday it got a boost when UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation’s biggest health insurer, posted first-quarter earnings and sales that beat analysts’ expectations. (See story on Page A1.)

Molina Healthcare (MOH), another HMO company in the Stock Spotlight, is testing its 10-week line after a strong run.
