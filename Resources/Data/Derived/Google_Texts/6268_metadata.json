The \u201c28 pages\u201d have been controversial since the report in which they were supposed to appear was issued and seem likely to stay in the news this year as the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks coincides with the end of Obama's term in office. Here's a brief guide to the subject.\n\nWho wrote these 28 pages? They're part of the report issued by the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. The Joint Inquiry was conducted in 2002 by the Senate and House intelligence committees under the leadership of Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham and Republican Florida Rep. Porter Goss. The Joint Inquiry investigation preceded the work of the 9/11 Commission, which released its own report in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t the section about Saudi Arabia been made public? It\u2019s an executive branch decision. President Bush said that the redacted section would reveal \u201csources and methods that would make it harder for us to win the war on terror.\u201d It's also assumed that the information was withheld in part to avoid embarrassing a country with which the U.S. has a longstanding and controversial military, intelligence, and economic alliance. The Philadelphia Inquirer has reported that President Obama told relatives of 9/11 victims in 2009 and 2011 that he would release the files, but that hasn\u2019t happened. The administration said in February of this year that the process of \u201casking the intelligence community to conduct a classification review of this material\u201d is \u201congoing.\u201d Obama, as it happens, will be visiting Saudi Arabia next week.\n\nIf they\u2019re so secret, how do we know anything about what's in the redacted 28 pages? Public figures who\u2019ve seen them (or were involved in their production) have described them in general terms. Members of Congress are allowed to read the pages but not to discuss their details publicly; members of the 9/11 Commission also saw the redacted pages in the course of their own investigation.\n\nWhat do they say, allegedly? 60 Minutes\u2014based on the statements of people who\u2019ve read them\u2014says the pages amount to \u201ca working draft similar to a grand jury or police report that includes provocative evidence\u2014some verified, and some not\u201d about assistance that Saudi nationals with government connections provided to some of the 9/11 hijackers while those hijackers were in the United States. More than one outlet has reported that some of the allegations involve Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi national who\u2019s known to have done favors (a small loan, help renting an apartment) for two of the hijackers after meeting them at a Los Angeles restaurant on the same day that he also met with someone at L.A.\u2019s Saudi consulate. (Al-Bayoumi has claimed that he didn\u2019t know anything about the future hijackers and just happened to have struck up a friendship with them after randomly meeting them at the restaurant.)\n\nWho wants the 28 pages released? Lots of people from both parties. Some\u2014like former Sen. Graham and former Reagan administration Navy secretary John Lehman (a 9/11 Commission member)\u2014say the information in the redacted pages clearly demonstrates that some Saudis supported the hijackers. Republican North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones and Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch are pushing for a House resolution calling for the pages\u2019 release; Lynch told the New Yorker\u2019s Lawrence Wright in 2014 that the information included therein is \u201cstunning.\u201d Jones has said he believes the pages were made classified simply because the Bush administration was embarrassed by its own close ties to the Saudi government. (Jones has been vocal about regretting his vote to authorize the Bush administration\u2019s Iraq war.)\n\nOn the other hand, there are some who say the pages should be released because they don\u2019t implicate the Saudis. That includes the Saudis themselves: Back in 2003, then\u2013Saudi ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan said that \u201cSaudi Arabia has nothing to hide\u201d and the redacted allegations \u201ccould not be substantiated.\u201d Democratic California Rep. Adam Schiff said this year that \u201cthe issues raised in those pages were investigated by the 9/11 Commission and found to be unsubstantiated\u201d and says he would like to see them released to defuse the controversy surrounding their existence. The 9/11 Commission\u2019s director, Philip Zelikow, doesn\u2019t appear to have taken a public stance on the pages\u2019 release, but he told Lawrence Wright that they amount to \u201can agglomeration of preliminary, unvetted reports.\u201d The 9/11 Commission\u2019s official report says it ultimately \u201cfound no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded [al-Qaida].\u201d\n\nOn the other other hand, more than one member of the 9/11 Commission\u2014including former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey, who spoke to 60 Minutes\u2014has said that the \u201cfound no evidence\u201d sentence should not be considered an exoneration of the Saudis. (Note the careful, vague phrasing\u2014\u201cas an institution,\u201d \u201csenior Saudi officials.\u201d) Zelikow, meanwhile, worked for the Bush administration in 2000 and 2001 and from 2005 until 2007; he\u2019s been accused of going soft on the White House during his tenure as the director of the commission.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ben Mathis-Lilley", "description": "Sunday night,\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0ran a segment\u00a0about ongoing efforts to convince the Obama administration to declassify 28 infamous pages in an otherwise publi ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Sunday night,\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0ran a segment\u00a0about ongoing efforts to convince the Obama administration to declassify 28 infamous pages in an otherwise publi ...", "title": "Your Guide to the 28 Classified Pages About Saudi Arabia and 9/11 That Obama Might Release", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report/481242157.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sunday night,\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0ran a segment\u00a0about ongoing efforts to convince the Obama administration to declassify 28 infamous pages in an otherwise publi ...", "creator": "@BenMathisLilley", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report/481242157.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "Your Guide to the 28 Classified Pages About Saudi Arabia and 9/11 That Obama Might Release", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-11T15:37:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Your Guide to the 28 Classified Pages About Saudi Arabia and 9/11 That Obama Might Release", "sailthru.headline": "Your Guide to the 28 Classified Pages About Saudi Arabia and 9/11 That Obama Might Release", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Your Guide to the 28 Classified Pages About Saudi Arabia and 9/11 That Obama Might Release\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report/481242157.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"227160411004\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2016-04-11T15:37:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"briefing\",\n  \"author\": \"Ben Mathis-Lilley\",\n  \"tags\": [\"sept. 11\"]\n}", "fb-share": "Smoking gun or just speculation?", "tw-line": "A guide to the 28 classified pages about Saudi Arabia and 9/11 that Obama might release", "keywords": "president obama, 9/11 report, joint inquiry, 28 pages, redacted, classified, saudi arabia, support for hijackers", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "president obama, 9/11 report, joint inquiry, 28 pages, redacted, classified, saudi arabia, support for hijackers", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "Sunday night,\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0ran a segment\u00a0about ongoing efforts to convince the Obama administration to declassify 28 infamous pages in an otherwise publi ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/04/11/saudi_arabia_and_the_28_classified_pages_of_congress_9_11_report/481242157.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "If they\u2019re so secret, how do we know anything about what's in the redacted 28 pages?\nWho wrote these 28 pages?\nWho wants the 28 pages released?\nMembers of Congress are allowed to read the pages but not to discuss their details publicly; members of the 9/11 Commission also saw the redacted pages in the course of their own investigation.\nThe Joint Inquiry investigation preceded the work of the 9/11 Commission, which released its own report in 2004."}
