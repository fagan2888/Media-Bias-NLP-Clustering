In New York he was able to sign up for Medicaid.\n\nHe was surprised to find out that in Florida there\u2019s a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d where uninsured people who can\u2019t afford health care insurance also don\u2019t qualify for Obamacare. Melo is now in that gap.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t my concern as a student be studying and receiving A\u2019s,\" Melo said, \"rather than what to do or where to go and how much this would cost me as an uninsured adult.\"\n\nMelo joined Mayor Tom\u00e1s Regalado and other healthcare advocates at Miami City Hall Monday morning to express their desires to the legislature, currently in session.\n\nWith Medicaid expansion, the state would choose to accept federal funds for health care. Supporters say that the money could fund hospitals, create more health care jobs and save taxpayers money that would otherwise be used to treat the uninsured.\n\nListen to the story here.\n\nJulio Fuentes is the president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. He believes that a Medicaid expansion is financially sound.\n\n\u201cFrom a business perspective, this is absolutely a no brainer,\" Fuentes said. \"From a moral perspective, it\u2019s imperative.\"\n\nLast week a bill was introduced in the Senate that would be an alternative to Medicaid expansion. The bill would still allow the state to receive the federal funds. But instead of Medicaid, consumers would receive vouchers to purchase private insurance.\n\nAlthough this is a step in the direction of Medicaid expansion, Regalado urged Florida Legislators to take further action.\n\n\u201cThis bill in the Senate does something, but it doesn\u2019t do everything,\u201d said Regalado. \u201cFor Miami it\u2019s important because there are thousands of people here that do not have health coverage and that will be a brunt for the city. These are our residents so we have to take care of them.\u201d\n\nThis is an issue that continues to divide the legislation. The federal funds would fully cover the expansion through 2016.\n\nThose against Medicaid say that the program is flawed and shouldn\u2019t be expanded. They also don\u2019t want the state to be left funding the program once the federal money is reduced.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Harry Melo is a 25-year-old grad student from New York who came to Miami two months ago for school.
