She subsequently received a pill to soothe her nerves.\n\nLeigh's insurer, Blue Shield of California, covered about $200 of the bill, leaving her holding the bag for more than $1,700.\n\nLeigh's experience underlines a problem faced by everyone who interacts with our healthcare system \u2014 the inexplicable cost of even the most modest treatment. Patients face a tough challenge in getting a straight answer to the question, \"Why so much?\"\n\nCaption Consumer Confidential: Protecting Personal Data, IRS Crackdown, Privacy Laws This segment aired on the KTLA 5 Morning News on December 22, 2015 This segment aired on the KTLA 5 Morning News on December 22, 2015 Caption Consumer Confidential: Protecting Personal Data, IRS Crackdown, Privacy Laws This segment aired on the KTLA 5 Morning News on December 22, 2015 This segment aired on the KTLA 5 Morning News on December 22, 2015 Caption Consumer Confidential: Gift Giving at Work, Celebrity Tweets Make Money This segment aired on the KTLA 5 Morning News on December 8, 2015.

She came to as she was being moved by wheelchair into Good Samaritan's emergency department.\n\nIn the ER, Leigh said, her blood pressure was measured \u2014 it was a little high \u2014 and she was given the pill to help her relax. She then waited about 90 minutes on a bed until she felt calm enough to leave.\n\n\"My blood pressure went down and that was it,\" Leigh recalled.\n\nThe nearly $2,000 hospital bill arrived last month. It didn't itemize any charges. It just said, \"Type of service: Emergency.\"\n\n\"I thought, 'You've got to be kidding,'\" Leigh said. \"This is crazy.\"\n\nShe contacted Good Samaritan. A representative of the billing department said the charge was accurate and offered only to work out a payment plan.\n\n\"You'd think they could show at least a little compassion,\" Leigh said.\n\nEven factoring in the costs of the wheelchair ride down the hall, the nurse who took Leigh's blood pressure and whatever expense can be attached to waiting around for an hour and a half, it's hard to see how a hospital would try to turn the screws on someone whose father had just died in the facility.\n\nMoreover, why wouldn't it break down specific charges on the bill? The only reason, it would seem, is that the hospital doesn't want patients knowing the insane prices they're being charged.\n\nGood Samaritan was more forthright with Leigh's insurer, Blue Shield.\n\nThe hospital's insurance claim shows that it charged about $232 for the blood-pressure exam and $19.54 for the pill. The bulk of the bill \u2014 $1,700 \u2014 was for just setting foot in the emergency room.\n\nThe average registered nurse makes $26.66 an hour, according to PayScale.com. It's hard to see how that jibes with charging $232 for a blood-pressure exam that couldn't have taken more than a few minutes.\n\nThe price-comparison website GoodRx says 1 milligram of generic lorazepam costs about 14 cents at Safeway and Target, 18 cents at Kroger Pharmacy and 19 cents at Walgreens.\n\nAt nearly $20 a pill, Good Samaritan imposed a markup of more than 14,000% \u2014 a healthy profit margin by anyone's reckoning.\n\nAs for the ER charge, a hospital obviously has fixed costs for maintaining emergency services. But $1,700 just for a routine blood-pressure test, a pill and the use of a bed for 90 minutes? That seems pretty steep.\n\nKatrina Bada, a Good Samaritan spokeswoman, expressed condolences to Leigh and her family. But she said the nearly $2,000 bill was justified because \"this was not a 10-minute office visit to receive a simple medicine.\"\n\n\"She was admitted for care in our emergency room, where she was evaluated, and then observed over the course of one and one half hours because of her condition,\" Bada said. \"She did receive medication and was discharged only after her condition improved and she was determined to be safe to discharge.\"\n\nShe said Leigh's bill didn't reflect just having her blood pressure taken or receiving a pill, \"but also the staffing, facilities and infrastructure to deliver the items.\"\n\nThe $1,700 ER charge, Bada said, \"is consistent with the charges assessed by other hospitals in our area.\" She said that if patients want itemized bills, they can ask for them.\n\nFlanagan at Consumer Watchdog said hospitals used to hit insured patients with sky-high charges to help subsidize treatment of the uninsured \u2014 a practice known as cost shifting.\n\n\"They don't have that excuse anymore because we now have the Affordable Care Act,\" he said, referring to the federal program that requires most people to have coverage and helps pay the monthly premiums of those requiring financial assistance.\n\n\"Now it's just straight-up profiteering,\" Flanagan said.\n\nIf you encounter a bill that seems to defy gravity, don't be shy about asking questions. Request that the bill be itemized. Also ask for a supervisor who may be in a position to offer a discount.\n\nIf that gets you nowhere, consider contacting a patient advocate. These are professionals who generally understand the ins and outs of medical billing and can help negotiate lower prices.\n\nIt's an unlicensed profession, so confirm services and prices in advance. You might begin your search for help using the directory of the Alliance of Professional Health Advocates, a trade group.\n\nCalifornia, like most states, doesn't regulate hospital prices. But an outrageously sky-high bill could be reported to the state attorney general as a possible unfair business practice.\n\nFinally, one last bit of advice based on Leigh's experience: If you're ever in a hospital, don't get sick.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hospital bill is high enough to raise anyone's blood pressure", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "A single dose of the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam \u2014 the generic version of Ativan \u2014 will run you about 14 cents at Safeway or Target.", "title": "Hospital bill is high enough to raise anyone's blood pressure", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20150605-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5570f8a6/turbine/la-fi-lazarus-20150605", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare costs, hospital bill, Good Samaritan Hospital, Blue Shield of California, Jerry Flanagan, Consumer Watchdog, Katrina Bada", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83707551", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-06-05", "Description": "A single dose of the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam \u2014 the generic version of Ativan \u2014 will run you about 14 cents at Safeway or Target.
