What do we believe? How important is marriage? How important is sexuality? What price are we willing to pay? Are we gonna be those wimps that cave in when a little pressure comes?\u201d\n\nBrown recently authored \u201cOutlasting the Gay Revolution,\u201d in which he laid out eight principles to help Americans with conservative moral values overcome the homosexual agenda. The first principle is, \u201cNever compromise your convictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we look at people in history who compromised?\u201d Brown asked in a WND interview. \u201cHow do we look at people in history that sold out? How do we look at a Judas Iscariot that sold his soul for money? How do we look at people that cave in to popularity? How do we look to a political leader when, the moment pressure comes, they change their views?\n\n\u201cWe have no respect for people like that. It\u2019s time that we are worthy of respect.\u201d\n\nThe American landscape is currently dotted with people of faith who have stuck to their convictions, as Brown advises.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example is Kim Davis. Because of her Christian belief in traditional marriage, the Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk refused to issue any marriage licenses after the Supreme Court declared \u201cgay marriage\u201d a constitutional right in Obergefell v. Hodges. Even after a federal judge ordered her to resume issuing licenses, she went to jail rather than comply with the order. She said she was acting under God\u2019s authority.\n\nDavis was subsequently released from jail and resumed her post. Although her deputies are now issuing marriage licenses to \u201cgay\u201d couples, the licenses no longer bear Davis\u2019 name and signature.\n\nJack Phillips was another Christian who stood by his convictions. When two \u201cgay\u201d men entered Phillips\u2019 Colorado bakery in July 2012 asking for a wedding cake, Phillips refused, saying he didn\u2019t do gay wedding cakes. The \u201cgay\u201d men stormed out and evidently told others about Phillips\u2019 refusal. The baker received a death threat the next day.\n\nEventually, a judge ruled Phillips must make wedding cakes for \u201cgay\u201d couples, but rather than violate his beliefs, the baker decided to stop making wedding cakes altogether. He estimated his decision cost his business $100,000 a year in lost revenue. In August, an appeals court upheld the original ruling against Phillips, which still faces further review.\n\nThe baker told the Daily Signal: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that I\u2019m being obedient to Christ. He\u2019s given me this business and if he were here, he wouldn\u2019t make the cake. If he were my employee, I wouldn\u2019t force him to make the cake and participate in it because it doesn\u2019t honor God. The Bible calls it a sin.\u201d\n\nDavis and Phillips have both received criticism from progressives. Brown urges people like Davis and Phillips to keep their heads up and continue to stand for their beliefs.\n\n\u201cSo what if you\u2019re branded a homophobe and a bigot?\u201d Brown writes in the first chapter of \u201cOutlasting the Gay Revolution.\u201d \u201cJesus was called far worse. So what if your business gets boycotted or your church gets disfellowshipped or your name gets blacklisted? Christians who fought against slavery in America faced far greater opposition than this, and they didn\u2019t cave in and collapse. In fact, gay activists themselves had to overcome far more than this to fight for their cause, and they didn\u2019t back down. How can we?\u201d\n\n\u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d patriarch Phil Robertson certainly didn\u2019t back down in late 2013. In an interview with GQ, he called homosexuality a sin on par with bestiality, sparking massive outrage among the LGBT community and progressives in general.\n\nA&E initially suspended Robertson from \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d but Robertson never apologized, and many fans rushed out to defend him. More than 200,000 signatures were gathered for a petition demanding Robertson be reinstated. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin also defended Robertson.\n\nA little over a week later, A&E lifted the suspension.\n\nBrown says Christians should be willing to stand up for their beliefs even if they lose their livelihoods.\n\n\u201cFine, I lose my job because of what I believe,\u201d he said. \u201cFine, I can\u2019t do my radio show because of what I believe. Fine, my kids get put out of the school. Fine, I go to jail. I am going to do what\u2019s right. Jesus said if you save your life, you lose it; if you lose your life for My sake and the gospel, you find it.\u201d\n\nBrown said people lose a part of their souls when they compromise their convictions.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s where we draw the line in the sand \u2013 with God\u2019s grace, with God\u2019s help, we are not caving in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not compromising. The unspoken mantra of gay activism is, \u2018We will intimidate and we will manipulate until you capitulate.\u2019 We are not going to capitulate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Michael Brown has a message for Christians who fear the homosexual agenda already has a lock on American culture: Don\u2019t lose hope.
