House Speaker John Boehner refers to Ted Cruz as 'that jackass'

Speaker of the House John Boehner called Ted Cruz a “jackass” at a Colorado fundraiser on Wednesday, the Daily Caller reported.

Boehner stated his personal reason for enjoying the Texas senator’s run, saying it prevents Cruz from telling the speaker how to do his job. He likes that the campaign keeps “that jackass” away from Washington D.C.

Cruz will probably appreciate the remark. (He hasn't commented yet). The White House hopeful loves to portray himself as a renegade Republican who doesn’t answer to the establishment. He and Boehner have long maintained a contentious relationship.

Still, some of those in attendance at the fundraiser for Rep. Scott Tipton (R-Ohio) didn’t feel the quip was appropriate. One attendee told the Daily Caller he’s tired of Republicans disparaging each other, though he respected Boehner’s right to say it.

This marks the most high profile case of a politician calling someone a jackass since Barack Obama called out hip-hop star Kanye West after he interrupted Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music awards.
