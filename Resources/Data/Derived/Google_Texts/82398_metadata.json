Once the glitz, glam, glitter and gluttony of the holidays are over, I crave simplicity. I long for austerity and to surround myself with natural neutrals. No frills, no excess. I want food no fancier than plain water and a tuna sandwich, and a home no fussier than a monastery.\n\nSo last week, when a sea tide of photos featuring undyed natural linens in a beautifully simple home flowed into my inbox, it was an oasis for my over-stimulated eyes.\n\nI had forgotten how much I loved linen, but Richard Ostell, a respected fashion and home designer, reminded me. The shots were from his home in Westchester, N.Y. Rough-woven linens graced his tables, windows and bed like a pure sigh of relief. I wanted to crawl through my computer screen and into his home, make a cup of tea, sit by his window and decompress.\n\nInstead, I got him on the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling to talk about our mutual love of linen,\u201d I said, breaking Rule No. 1 in journalism: Be objective. Never show your bias.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of superfluous detail,\u201d he said, in a British accent that oozed refinement. \u201cI\u2019d much rather have something plain. Linen is honest, simple, humble, durable and has an element of having been touched by human hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d I blurt. \u201cAnd, I don\u2019t know about you, but after all the sequins of the holidays, I am so ready for linen. I mean, if I never see another mirrored ball!\u201d Then I smack myself. This reserved taste-leader, the former creative director for Liz Claiborne who now has his own furniture and product-design company, would never have anything so gaudy as sequins in his home, let alone a mirrored ball.\n\nI really want to start the conversation over.\n\nOstell\u2019s work, whether in fashion or furnishings, reflects style that doesn\u2019t scream. His home whispers, \u201cI am here to comfort, not impress.\u201d It\u2019s a mantra more homes should adopt.\n\n\u201cLinen is this great-looking fabric, so why don\u2019t we use it more?\u201d I continue, trying to recover whatever good opinion of me he might have had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m puzzled by that, as well,\u201d he said. \u201cPossibly because its naturally rumpled look gave it a reputation for being too casual. It got pigeonholed, but it can be very sophisticated. I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand what they can do with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the ironing,\u201d I say. \u201cAll that pressing and starching. Who has time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never iron linen,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEver?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt defeats the point of it. The rumpled look is part of its beauty. I love it right when it comes out of the dryer fluffy. I don\u2019t think people should think it looks messy. It should be left as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that rough-and-tumble-look is OK for beds, but what about linen clothes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWear your linen pants right off the line,\u201d Ostell said. (How quaint, a line.) \u201cAnd appreciate the fabric\u2019s natural state. Linen wrinkles. Pressed linen looks worse when it wrinkles. You don\u2019t want your linen to be pristine and pressed and perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d\n\nI let this sink in: I can get a better look with less effort. I hang up, in love with linen even more than before.\n\nBecause life, like linen, is better relaxed.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).

Ostell uses linen for bedding; his duvet cover is a natural linen color, undyed and unbleached, and his linen sheets and pillowcases are white. He uses heavy linen for drapes and upholstery, including slipcovers, and lighter-weight linen for tablecloths and napkins. \u201cYou can overdo it, but most people don\u2019t use linen enough.\u201d\n\nKeep it natural. Though he\u2019s drawn to undyed linen, colored linen is OK if the color is achieved through a natural dye, he said. The only linen color he\u2019s opposed to is black. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fade well.\u201d\n\nAlways at home. Pure natural linen mixes well with wood, metal, other fabrics and all d\u00e9cor styles, said Ostell, from contemporary to rustic. It has a place in every style of home and keeps interiors from looking too cold.\n\nThe class factor. Cotton and linen come from two different plants: cotton and flax. Hundreds of years ago, linen was valued over cotton for its stamina, sheen and feel, but as cotton became cheaper to mass -produce, linen became considered a high-maintenance (when starched and ironed) symbol of class and status. Cotton is still usually less expensive. Cotton-linen costs less than 100 percent linen. But fabric connoisseurs prefer pure linen, which has a more irregular thread.\n\nA test for the best. When choosing, look for Irish or Belgian linen, the two best linens in the world, said Ostell. Linen from China is often not as good \u2014 it wrinkles more easily and is thin.\n\nResist ironing. When you buy linen in the store, it is starched, pressed and finished very highly, he said. \u201cWhen you wash and dry it, it won\u2019t look that way anymore. And that\u2019s good. Leave it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Linen lovers, rejoice: Wrinkled and rumpled is the new elegant", "title": "Linen lovers, rejoice: Wrinkled and rumpled is the new elegant", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/17/linen-lovers-rejoice-wrinkled-and-rumpled-is-the-new-elegant/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__20140118_C2_FE18AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__20140118_C2_FE18AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T02:38:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:38:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde880\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPossibly because its naturally rumpled look gave it a reputation for being too casual.\nLinen wrinkles.\nThough he\u2019s drawn to undyed linen, colored linen is OK if the color is achieved through a natural dye, he said.\nThe rumpled look is part of its beauty.\nI don\u2019t think people should think it looks messy."}
