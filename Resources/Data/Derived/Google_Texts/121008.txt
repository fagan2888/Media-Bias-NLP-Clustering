Houston (CNN) Jeb Bush admitted Monday his views on immigration may not be "mainstream" in the Republican Party. But he praised the "vitality" of a multicultural society as other GOP presidential candidates find themselves in trouble over comments about minorities.

"If we embrace a set of shared values, then it shouldn't matter if you have a 'z' at the end of your name, or your accent might be different, 'cause guess what? There are people in this country, that have accents different from mine and mine's different from theirs. It doesn't matter," Bush said to a roomful of Hispanics.

The former Florida governor, who boasts proudly of the bicultural family that he started with his wife, who's from Mexico, was in his comfort zone when he addressed the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Houston.

Though he was interrupted at the start of his remarks by pro-immigration protestors, Bush won applause from the audience when he re-asserted that he's in favor of earned citizenship for individuals who were brought to the country illegally as children, also known as DREAMers.

"And I'll continue to be consistently for it, irrespective of what the political ramifications of that are," he said, ending a tense moment with protesters who emerged from multiple corners in the ballroom.
