Last Washington mudslide victim's body identified

Authorities have identified the last body found in the Oso, Washington, mudslide as that of Kris Regelbrugge, the 43rd victim. Regelbrugge was in her home with her husband, Navy Cmdr. John Regelbrugge, when it was buried in the March 22 mudslide. John Regelbrugge's body was among the 42 recovered earlier. The active search ended in April, but workers found Kris Regelbrugge's body in an area where some of her family's effects had been uncovered.
