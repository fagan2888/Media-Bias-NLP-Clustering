There are plenty of people who believe the productive activities of mankind have affected the planet\u2019s mean temperature, and there are a number of scientists who either say it hasn\u2019t, that the evidence is still out or, even if it has, that the consequences are negligible. The debate, despite what President Barack Obama, former Vice President Al Gore and others have repeatedly alleged, is far from over.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Energy Policy]\n\nLisa Nelson, the council's CEO, responded to the news in the statement by calling the decision \u201cunfortunate\u201d that \u201cpublic pressure from left-leaning individuals and organizations who intentionally confuse free market policy perspectives for climate change denial\u201d could produce such a result.\n\nIt\u2019s true the group has been in the left\u2019s crosshairs for some time. Indeed, the left has been applying backroom pressure to convince the council's corporate partners they will be subject to boycotts, smear campaigns and other public pressure tactics unless they disassociate themselves from the council. This, of course, is the real dark side of American politics \u2013 all of which is funded by the real \u201cdark money\u201d that threatens to corrupt the political system and infringe on the constitutional safeguards concerning speech, freedom of thought, freedom of association and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\n\nThe point that few people are making about Schmidt\u2019s decision, which is apparently tied to the the council's skeptical attitude toward taxpayer subsidies for renewable energy projects, is that Google is an energy hog.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nIt takes a lot of electricity to power the company\u2019s server farms. It takes even more to keep them cool so the circuits don\u2019t overheat and fry. Climate control is an expensive line item, energy-wise. Google has a vested interest, which Schmidt apparently doesn\u2019t feel the need to mention, in having taxpayers fund research into making wind and solar power cheaper and more efficient. And here\u2019s the important part: able to meet baseload power needs to the same degree that only the current traditional energy triad can manage.\n\nIf this can\u2019t be achieved, while at the same time federal and state governments continue to mandate that the energy mix include increasingly larger proportions of electricity made from so-called renewable sources, then power is going to become very, very expensive.\n\nThe council's position on the issue is not as draconian as Schmidt made it out to be. \u201cALEC believes renewable energy should expand based on consumer demand,\u201d Nelson said in a statement, \u201cnot as a result of a government mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany misunderstand the American Legislative Exchange Council and its legislator-led, free market priorities. ALEC members believe the Federal Government exerts too much control on state and local decision-making. Google\u2019s renewable energy commitment \u2013 as well as those found throughout private industry \u2013 is completely consistent with ALEC policy because the companies in question chose renewables absent a mandate,\u201d she said.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that so many were so readily willing to accept Schmidt's apology for Google's relationship with the group in the first place, a move he called a \u201cmistake\u201d in his interview with NPR. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune described the decision to the Los Angeles Times in this way: \u201cI think maybe the left hand was not aware of what the right hand was doing.\u201d Is Brune saying obliquely that the left has veto power over the activities undertaken by corporate America in promotion of its own interests and bottom line? It seems that maybe he is.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on is that there is a concerted effort underway involving government-funded researchers, the academy, corporate insiders, some politicians, parts of the media and left-wing pressure groups to silence anyone who dares to suggest that global warming may be not actually be happening, at least not in the ways the conventional wisdom currently dictates. It is true that someone may not be telling the truth, but it is at least as likely that it is the proponents of the idea as it is the skeptics. The proponents of global warming orthodoxy want to isolate their opponents, making it easier to pick them off and shut them up, one by one. To them, conservative ideas \u2013 ideas grounded in a belief in the free market \u2013 are not just wrong but in fact dangerous. As such, they believe they are justified in preventing these ideas from being disseminated or exchanged among policymakers. There\u2019s a lot more to this incident and to the whole story than people are telling.\n\n\n\n\n\nClarified on Sept. 24, 2014: Clarification: An earlier version of this blog post described the American Legislative Exchange Council as a lobbying group.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Google Gags Global Warming Debate by Severing Ties With ALEC", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Eric Schmidt's decision to sever ties with ALEC shows the dark side of American politics.", "title": "Google Gags the Global Warming Debate", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/09/23/google-gags-global-warming-debate-by-severing-ties-with-alec", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/64/a7482825d4eb49dc3a10ba0da40cd6/media:f0a4944d971b45d5b4cf6b6e37690926SpainEuropeGoolge.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eric Schmidt's decision to sever ties with ALEC shows the dark side of American politics.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Google Gags Global Warming Debate by Severing Ties With ALEC"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Google,Schmidt, Eric,climate change,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Eric Schmidt's decision to sever ties with ALEC shows the dark side of American politics."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bef\"", "article_summary": "Google\u2019s renewable energy commitment \u2013 as well as those found throughout private industry \u2013 is completely consistent with ALEC policy because the companies in question chose renewables absent a mandate,\u201d she said.\nThe debate, despite what President Barack Obama, former Vice President Al Gore and others have repeatedly alleged, is far from over.\nThe proponents of global warming orthodoxy want to isolate their opponents, making it easier to pick them off and shut them up, one by one.\nClarified on Sept. 24, 2014: Clarification: An earlier version of this blog post described the American Legislative Exchange Council as a lobbying group.\nThe point that few people are making about Schmidt\u2019s decision, which is apparently tied to the the council's skeptical attitude toward taxpayer subsidies for renewable energy projects, is that Google is an energy hog."}
