Reporting on the nation\u2019s 1,447 independent oncology practices, the Community Oncology Alliance, an advocacy group for independent practices, said that since 2008, 544 were purchased by or entered contractual relationships with hospitals, another 313 closed and 395 reported they were in tough financial straits. In western Washington, just one independent oncology group is left.\n\nChristian Downs, executive director of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said that although there are no good data yet, he expected the Affordable Care Act was accelerating the trend. Many people bought inadequate insurance for the expensive cancer care they require. Community doctors have to buy the drugs ahead of time, placing a burden on them when patients cannot pay. The act also requires documentation of efficiencies in medical care which can be expensive for doctors in private practice to provide. And it encourages the consolidation of medical practices.\n\nThe American Hospital Association cites advantages for patients being treated by hospital doctors. \u201cThe hassle factor is reduced,\u201d said Erik Rasmussen, the association\u2019s vice president of legislative affairs. Patients can have scans, like CT and M.R.I., use a pharmacy and get lab tests all in one place instead of going from facility to facility, he said.\n\nAnd, he added, there is a reason hospitals get higher fees for their services \u2014 it compensates them for staying open 24 hours and caring for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\nFor doctors in private practice, providing chemotherapy to uninsured and Medicaid patients is a money loser. As a result, many, including Dr. Ward before he sold his practice, end up sending those patients to nearby hospitals for chemotherapy while keeping them as patients for office visits.\n\nA Quirk in Drug Pricing Insurers pay hospitals and doctors affiliated with hospitals more to adminster chemotherapy drugs than they pay independent doctors. Insurance reimbursment per dose in a hospital or hospital-affiliated office Reimbursment per dose in a private practice Chemotherapy drug (and some cancers it can treat) $5,000 $7,500 5,000 2,500 $0 $0 2,500 Pertuzumab (breast cancer) Rituximab (lymphoma, leukemia) Bevacizumab (several cancers) Cetuximab (head, neck, colorectal) Trastuzumab (breast, stomach) Fulvestrant (breast) Leuprolide Acetate (prostate) Epirubicin (breast) Interferon alfa-2B (lymphoma, others) Mitoxantrone (prostate, leukemia) Doxorubicin (leukemia, others) Goserelin (prostate, breast) Daunorubicin (leukemia) Idarubicin (leukemia) Mitomycin C (stomach, pancreas) INSURANCE REIMBURSMENT PER DOSE IN A: Private practice Hospital $5,000 $5,000 $0 $0 Drug Pertuzumab Rituximab Bevacizumab Cetuximab Trastuzumab Fulvestrant Leuprolide Acetate Epirubicin Interferon alfa-2B Mitoxantrone Doxorubicin) Goserelin Daunorubicin Idarubicin Mitomycin C\n\n\u201cWe hate doing it, I can\u2019t tell you how much we hate doing it,\u201d said Dr. Brooks, the Texas oncologist. \u201cBut I tell them, \u2018It will cost me $200 to give you this medication in my office, so I am going to ask you to go to the hospital as an outpatient for infusions.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Peter Eisenberg, in private practice in Marin County in Northern California, said: \u201cThe disgrace is that we have to treat people differently depending on how much money they\u2019ve got. That we do diminishes me.\u201d\n\nHospitals may be less personal and less efficient, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many private practice oncology offices, he said, \u201cRun on time, they are efficient, you get in, you get out, as opposed to academic medical centers where they may be an hour and a half behind.\u201d\n\nDr. Ward and others in private practice said they tried for years to make a go of it but were finally defeated by what he described as \u201ca series of cuts in oncology reimbursement under the guise of reform to which private practice is most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nLower reimbursements have two effects. One is on overhead. Unlike other doctors, oncologists stock their own drugs, maintaining a sort of mini-pharmacy. If a patient gets too sick to receive a drug or dies, the doctor takes the loss. That used to be acceptable because insurers paid doctors at least twice the wholesale price of drugs. Now doctors are reimbursed for the average cost of the drug plus 4.3 percent, there are more and more drugs to stock, and drugs cost more.\n\n\u201cThe overhead is enormous,\u201d Dr. Schilsky said. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why many oncologists are becoming hospital-based.\u201d\n\nThe second \u2014 and bigger \u2014 effect is less profit from selling drugs to patients. For years, chemotherapy drugs provided a comfortable income. Those days are gone, doctors say.\n\nThe finances are very different in hospitals, with their higher reimbursement rates for administering drugs, discounts for buying large quantities, and a special federal program that about 30 percent of hospitals qualify for. The program, to compensate research hospitals and hospitals serving poor people, lets hospitals buy chemotherapy drugs for all outpatients at about a 50 percent discount.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, Dr. Schilsky notes, cancer patients at hospitals use other services, like radiation therapy, imaging and surgery.\n\n\u201cA cancer patient is going to generate a lot of revenue for a hospital,\u201d Dr. Schilsky said.\n\nHealth care economists say they have little data on how the costs and profits from selling chemotherapy drugs are affecting patient care. Doctors are constantly reminded, though, of how much they can make if they buy more of a company\u2019s drug.\n\nCelgene, for example, in a recent email about its drug Abraxane, told one doctor who had bought 50 vials that he could get a rebate of $647.51 by buying 68 vials. If he bought 175 vials he\u2019d get $1,831.93\n\nThis hidden profit possibility troubles Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk into a doctor\u2019s office you don\u2019t know that in most cancer scenarios there are a range of therapeutic choices,\u201d Dr. Bach said. \u201cUnless the doctor presents options, you assume there aren\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nWhile individual oncologists deny choosing treatments that provide them with the greatest profit, Dr. Kanti Rai, a cancer specialist at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Cancer Center, said it would be foolish to believe financial considerations never influence doctors\u2019 choices of drugs.\n\n\u201cSometimes hidden in such choices \u2014 and many times not so hidden \u2014 are considerations of what also might be financially more profitable,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141123223607, "twitter": {"description": "Oncologists say they are being forced to sell or close their practices because
