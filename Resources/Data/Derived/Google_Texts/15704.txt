A la Trump Tower, Trump International Golf Club and Trump Entertainment Resorts, the U.S. healthcare system could become Donaldcare, a namesake nod to the billionaire real estate tycoon.

Following a speech Tuesday on the decommissioned battleship USS Iowa in California, Trump told Breitbart News that if elected, he plans to scrap Obamacare for his own version of national healthcare, though he did not expound on the details.

“We’re going to have privatization,” he said. “It’s going to end up being absolutely great.

“We’re going to something really spectacular with that [healthcare], with immigration, with the armed forces,” Trump said.

Moments earlier, Trump told veterans that he also has plans to remake the broken healthcare system for those who have sacrificed for their country. That plan also calls to allow for privatization, according to Trump.

“We’re gonna create a whole new system. We’re gonna take the system apart, and if they’re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals,” he assured the cheering crowd, noting that doctors and hospitals who treat vets would be reimbursed by the federal government, according to the National Review.

He promised veterans that under his leadership, they’d receive “the greatest service of any veterans in any country.”

Trump will likely be pressed for details on his healthcare vision during Wednesday night’s GOP debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

As the unlikely frontrunner, the notoriously boastful Trump is expected to be targeted by rivals in the vast pack of presidential hopefuls, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who has seen an uptick in her polling numbers since the first debate in August.
