(AP) - Ty Isaac\u2019s wait is over.\n\nHe gained a career-high 114 yards, including a 76-yard touchdown, to help Michigan beat UNLV 28-7 Saturday.\n\nIsaac had to sit out last year after transferring from USC and was handed the ball just 10 times over the first two games this season with the Wolverines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for a year without playing, doing a lot of practice-squad stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that stuff helps your team, but it feels a lot better when you can put it on the scoreboard and help your team win.\u201d\n\nIsaac took a toss sweep to the left and needed to break only one tackle with a stiff-arm before racing down the sideline for Michigan\u2019s longest run since Denard Robinson went 79 yards on a play against Air Force in 2012.\n\nIsaac\u2019s previous best day on the ground was an 87-yard, two-TD game as a freshman for the Trojans at California in 2013 when he finished the season with 236 yards rushing on 40 carries.\n\nMichigan established its running game in last week\u2019s win against Oregon State with the offensive line opening holes for De\u2019Veon Smith, who had career highs with 127 yards rushing, 23 carries and three scores. Smith, though, looked sluggish against the Rebels, running for just 33 yards on 13 carries.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ever talk about any running back controversy - just so you know - from here on out,\u201d coach Jim Harbaugh bristled. \u201cQuarterback controversy, I\u2019ll address that. Whenever you want to know who the starting quarterback is, I will talk to you about that.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh continued to defend his starting QB, Jake Rudock, who has six turnovers in three games.\n\n\u201cHis job is to win football games,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nThe Wolverines (2-1) have won two straight after opening with a loss at Utah in Harbaugh\u2019s debut as their coach.\n\nRudock was 14 of 22 for 123 yards with a TD and an interception in a lackluster performance that included him missing a wide-open teammate in the end zone and misfiring on at least another couple of throws. He threw a 5-yard pass to Smith after Michigan cornerback Channing Stribling made an interception on the fifth play of the game. The graduate transfer threw his fifth interception on his 78th pass of the season after throwing just five interceptions in 345 attempts last year at Iowa. Rudock has also lost a fumble this year.\n\nMichigan led the Rebels (0-3) by 21 points after Isaac\u2019s run midway through the second quarter then didn\u2019t score again until early in the fourth.\n\nUNLV avoided getting shut out with 9:17 left when Blake Decker threw a perfectly lofted 6-yard pass to Devonte Boyd in the corner of the end zone.\n\nDecker, who was knocked out of last week\u2019s loss with a groin injury, completed half of his 16 passes for 96 yards with a TD and two interceptions. Backup QB Kurt Palandech led the Rebels to the Michigan 14 before getting sacked and throwing an incomplete pass in the end zone on the last two plays of the game.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the fact that we fought into the fourth quarter,\u201d coach Tony Sanchez said. \u201cPeople had to keep playing against us. Disappointed in the results.\u201d\n\nEven though the Rebels, five-TD underdogs, were much more competitive than expected, they were not satisfied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re upset,\u201d tight end Jake Phillips said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to lose the game. We didn\u2019t come here to stay in the game or survive. We came here to win.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ty Isaac's wait is over.", "Author": "LARRY LAGE", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ty Isaac\u2019s wait is over.", "title": "Michigan beats UNLV 28-7; 2nd straight win under Harbaugh", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/19/michigan-beats-unlv-28-7-2nd-straight-win-under-ha/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/51a2966c2d9f782a820f6a706700a644.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/51a2966c2d9f782a820f6a706700a644.jpg", "title": "Michigan beats UNLV 28-7; 2nd straight win under Harbaugh", "description": "Ty Isaac's wait is over.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "He gained a career-high 114 yards, including a 76-yard touchdown, to help Michigan beat UNLV 28-7 Saturday.\nSmith, though, looked sluggish against the Rebels, running for just 33 yards on 13 carries.\nHe threw a 5-yard pass to Smith after Michigan cornerback Channing Stribling made an interception on the fifth play of the game.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ever talk about any running back controversy - just so you know - from here on out,\u201d coach Jim Harbaugh bristled.\nMichigan established its running game in last week\u2019s win against Oregon State with the offensive line opening holes for De\u2019Veon Smith, who had career highs with 127 yards rushing, 23 carries and three scores."}
