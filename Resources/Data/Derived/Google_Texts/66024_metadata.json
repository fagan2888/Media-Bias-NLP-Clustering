It\u2019s evolved from ritualistic animal sacrifice into a celebration of romantic love. If you are cynical, it\u2019s about the commercialization of that love and the pressure and guilt that come with social expectations, whether you\u2019re in a relationship or forging through life as a single person.\n\nWhile those who are paired off might seem to have a lock on the good aspects of this day, singles have much to gain from Valentine\u2019s Day. The two-for-one pizza deals are only the start of it.\n\nSingles can rejoice in the fact that they might not even care about Valentine\u2019s Day. Far from the image of the pathetic, lonely person feeling left out of the gushy exchanges of chocolates and flowers, many singles are perfectly content on their own.\n\nSingle filmmaker Nev Schulman is among them. He has a problem with the day\u2019s romantic reputation.\n\n\u201c[T]here\u2019s nothing less romantic than a day designated for being romantic. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to make a dinner reservation or buy flowers and chocolates for their special someone.\u201d\n\nSchulman recommends buying your mom flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day because \u201cshe is the best woman you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d\n\nSingle blogger Jessica Morris makes a strong plea for those in relationships to stop showing her pity.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me as I go and see a chick flick with my girlfriends, hang out with my married friends, or go about my life as normal. I\u2019m actually OK with being single, because I know that my self-worth isn\u2019t defined by a Valentine\u2019s Day card.\u201d\n\nAn article on Buzzfeed did a clever round-up of the ways singles get the best out of Valentine\u2019s Day. They get to spend the day with their dog or cat. They can plan an early trip to the stores the day after Valentine\u2019s Day to buy the discounted chocolate. They can have solo dance parties, take creative selfies, and spend the night gaming or watching movies.\n\nThose two-for-one food deals? Who says they have to be split between two people? Keeping the carbs to yourself is one of the perks of being single.\n\nThe Wrap gave its television and movie picks for a night in, either solo or with single friends. There\u2019s a Big Bang Theory marathon, monster flicks, cooking shows, and a special on \u201canimals in love,\u201d for those who still want to keep some romance in their Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nThe \u201cGalentine\u2019s Day\u201d is another option provided by Glamour \u2014 hanging out with girlfriends. The magazine also suggests a slightly different take on the movies: a \u201chate-watching party.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvite said girlfriends over to knock back some wine, watch tons of sappy movies, throw popcorn at the TV, and yell that each one is a lie. If Elle Woods did it, you can too.\u201d\n\nJust don\u2019t forget about the discounted chocolates.\n\n[Mila Kunis/Ashton Kutcher: Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Valentine's Day began as a \"bizarre fertility ceremony\" of the Romans.
