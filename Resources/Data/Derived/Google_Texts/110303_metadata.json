Most members of the caucus backed Ryan when he ran for the office of House Speaker in October 2015.\n\nRyan urged conservatives to scale back their political goals, such as replacement of Obamacare with a free-market health-care system. \u201cWe can\u2019t promise that we can repeal ObamaCare when a guy with the last name Obama is president\u2026 All that does is set us up for failure \u2026 and disappointment,\u201d according to the speech.\n\n\u201cWhen voices in the conservative movement demand things that they know we can\u2019t achieve with a Democrat in the White House, all that does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\nEconomics, not social or cultural issues, should be the focus of the GOP in 2016, according to his speech.\n\n\u201cWe have to unite conservatives around a bold, pro-growth agenda that will get America back on track\u2014and then take our agenda to the people\u2026 [President Barack Obama] is going to do all he can to elect another progressive by distracting the American people. So he\u2019s going to try to get us talking about guns or some other hot-button issue and not about his failures on ISIS or the economy or national security,\u201d he said, without citing Donald Trump\u2019s popular call for enforcement of laws against illegal-immigration, and for new restrictions on the immigration of people who embrace Islamic ideas.\n\nRyan\u2019s speech tried to sideline the immigration issue, which has upended U.S. politics since Ryan and his business and progressive allies tried in 2013 and 2014 to pass an immigration bill that would have amnesties millions of illegals and provided companies with an endless flood of cheap foreign labor.\n\nRyan also signaled his support for large-scale immigration by describing himself as a \u201cJack Kemp, Ronald Reagan conservative.\u201d\n\nJack Kemp was a liberal libertarian GOP leader in the 1980s, who favored large-scale immigration into California and other states.\n\nWhen Kemp was active, California was dominated by U.S.-born mainstream voters who elected Republicans. Now, after Kemp helped overcome public opposition to large-scale migration, California\u2019s politics are dominated by minorities, including poor immigrants, ensuring the state is dominated by Democratic politicians. But Ryan\u2019s speech still touted Kemp\u2019s policies.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Jack Kemp and House conservatives put out a plan to cut taxes and restore America to her greatness. It was bold and aspirational. It was so compelling that Ronald Reagan ran on those ideas in 1980. And what happened? Reagan ran the tables. The Republican party won a mandate from the people, and the rest, as they say, is history\u2026 So we need to be inspirational. We need to be inclusive.\n\nRyan has repeatedly promoted greater immigration, and helped increase the use of lower-wage guest-workers. He and his allies argue that extra workers will increase the size of the economy, but critics say the extra labor drives down Americans\u2019 wages even as it boost stock values.\n\nCurrently, four million Americans turn 18 each year, but face job competition from roughly 1 million new immigrants and 700,000 new temporary workers. The 2013 bill would have increased the inflow of refugees, tripled the annual inflow of legal immigrants, and increased the annual inflow of guest-workers, many of who are given white-collar professional jobs sought by American graduates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker Ryan Pushes Conservatives To Back His 'Jack Kemp' Pro-Immigration Economic Agenda", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Speaker Ryan Pushes Conservatives To Back His 'Jack Kemp' Pro-Immigration Economic Agenda", "title": "Speaker Ryan Pushes Conservatives To Back His 'Jack Kemp' Pro-Immigration Economic Agenda - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-507982746.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-03T14:11:11-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/03/2935223/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaker Ryan Pushes Conservatives To Back His 'Jack Kemp' Pro-Immigration Economic Agenda", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/GettyImages-507982746.jpg", "title": "Speaker Ryan Pushes Conservatives To Back His 'Jack Kemp' Pro-Immigration Economic Agenda - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ryan Pushes Conservatives To Line Up Behind His 'Jack Kemp' Pro-Immigration Economic Agenda", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-03T14:07:25-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T14:11:11-07:00", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28db\"", "article_summary": "In the late 1970s, Jack Kemp and House conservatives put out a plan to cut taxes and restore America to her greatness.\nRyan urged conservatives to scale back their political goals, such as replacement of Obamacare with a free-market health-care system.\nMost members of the caucus backed Ryan when he ran for the office of House Speaker in October 2015.\nIt was so compelling that Ronald Reagan ran on those ideas in 1980.\nRyan also signaled his support for large-scale immigration by describing himself as a \u201cJack Kemp, Ronald Reagan conservative.\u201dJack Kemp was a liberal libertarian GOP leader in the 1980s, who favored large-scale immigration into California and other states."}
