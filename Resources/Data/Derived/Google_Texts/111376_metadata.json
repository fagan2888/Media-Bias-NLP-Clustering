Health inequality started with the nation\u2019s birth\n\nTHE HISTORY OF AMERICAN RACIAL HEALTH \u201cDISPARITIES\u201d between whites and blacks begins with some of the former forcing some of the latter onto slave ships. This history is well known: the commodification of black bodies through slave labor bled the health and longevity of these men and women. And even after the abolition of slavery, an amalgam of racist terrorism, social segregation, economic marginalization, and political exclusion carried these health inequalities forward well into the 20th century \u2014 indeed, into the present day.[1]\n\nEarly on, differentials in medical care presumably played little to no role in health inequalities. Health care in the 19th century (and earlier) was distributed unequally, but, with a few exceptions, this hardly mattered: such care was mostly useless and frequently harmful. The picture changed in the 20th century when medicine gained salutary potential; but even with the rise of so-called \u201cscientific\u201d American medicine, racial health inequalities were not abolished. In fact, they were reproduced.\n\nIt\u2019s worth examining this history before returning to the question posed by this article\u2019s title. Consider, for instance, some of the stories compiled by one civil rights group. These stories, of blacks who were denied care in the 1930s through the 1960s, are recounted by the historian Beatrix Hoffman in her indispensible Health Care for Some: Rights and Rationing in the United States Since the 1930s. They include that of a \u201c17 year old Negro girl with a bullet wound in her head\u201d who was turned away by a hospital in Washington in 1932 on account of her race, of a seriously injured man in Texas who \u2014 despite a fracture of his pelvis \u2014 was rejected from an emergency room (his corpse was later found in an alley), and of a woman named Nonnie Clark who \u2014 despite having the majority of her body surface area covered in burns \u2014 could not be accommodated by Duke University Hospital because it had no open segregated beds on that particular day.[2]\n\nEarly in the 20th century, about 40 percent of all hospitals in the Southeast excluded blacks entirely, and segregation was the rule basically everywhere else, including in hospitals in the North.[3] Even when black patients were admitted, it wasn\u2019t always for the right reasons. In his The Care of Strangers: The Rise of America\u2019s Hospital System, Charles Rosenberg notes that, in large hospitals, blacks were sometimes embraced for their usefulness as compliant bodies in medical education: \u201c[T]he negro,\u201d one observer commented at the time, \u201cis more docile and does not object to being used in clinic for teaching purposes and is one of the most prolific sources in the study of medicine.\u201d[4]\n\nAt the same time, the government\u2019s persistent failure to create a public health care system played a foundational role in structuring American health care inequalities, both by class and race. Despite high hopes that the New Deal might realize such a system, Franklin Roosevelt failed to make health reform a priority (among other issues, he wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about the prospects of confronting the rather reactionary doctors\u2019 lobby).[5] At the end of World War II, a major campaign for national health insurance did emerge, backed by both Harry S. Truman and \u2014 critically \u2014 organized labor.[6] \u201cOur new economic bill of rights,\u201d Truman proclaimed to Congress in 1945, \u201cshould mean health security for all, regardless of residence, station, or race \u2013 everywhere in the United States.\u201d[7] Yet this bold vision was soon smothered, the victim of a toxic redbaiting campaign pursued by the American Medical Association (AMA).[8] All that survived of it, at least in the short term, was the Hill-Burton Act, a law that funded a massive campaign of hospital-building throughout the nation. But Hill-Burton was permeated with racism from its birth. While in theory it forbid discrimination by race, the law nonetheless made an allowance for \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities.[9] The implications were clear: explicit medical segregation had received the imprimatur of the law, together with generous public subsidization.\n\nOnly through the combined force of the civil rights movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a number of key legal challenges, and the passage of Medicare in 1965 could the rollback of American apartheid medicine begin, as will be discussed in more detail below. For now, it\u2019s worth noting that the impact of the civil rights movement on black health was not insignificant, as demonstrated in a revealing 2013 study by epidemiologist Nancy Krieger and colleagues. In the early 1960s, these investigators found that black infant death rates were significantly higher in \u201cJim Crow\u201d states (the 21 states, plus the District of Columbia, with racial discrimination on the law books) than in non-Jim Crow states. This is hardly surprising. Yet, during the late 1960s, the death rate of the former group did improve, and by the 1970s the difference had evaporated. This can be touted as evidence that political change can yield real improvements in health over time. But two additional facts complicate this interpretation. First, after 2000, the gap again opened up, albeit to a lesser extent. And, second, regardless of the impact of the Civil Rights movement on disparities among blacks, throughout this period black infant death rates were still twice that of whites.[10]\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of life expectancy, recent years have seen the reduction \u2014 but not the elimination \u2014 of black-white inequalities. As the Centers for Disease Control reported last November, the difference in life expectancy between the two groups fell from 5.9 years (in 1999) to 3.6 years (in 2013). However, even this may not be entirely goods news. A widely covered study published last fall found a unique and disturbing rise in mortality among middle-aged whites (of lower socioeconomic status) between 1999 and 2013, leading the investigators to conclude that falling white-black mortality disparities in this age group \u201cwas largely driven by increased white mortality.\u201d[11]\n\nMoreover, during this same period and on into the present, a series of events have functioned as starkly visible and undeniable examples of ongoing structural health racism. Following the death last year of Freddie Gray while in policy custody, many made note of the enormous chasm in health and mortality between black neighborhoods like his and adjacent wealthier and whiter ones. Other commentators have highlighted \u201cenvironmental racism,\u201d or inequities in exposure to environmental hazards by race, emblematic of embedded structural inequality. Revealing reporting by the Washington Post, for instance, described Gray\u2019s history of childhood lead poisoning, an exposure that is in part racially patterned. More recently, mass poisoning by lead in Flint, Michigan \u2014 the disastrous consequence of dimwitted austerity and structural marginalization \u2014 has provided yet more evidence of the downstream health consequences of political exclusion.\n\nInequalities in criminal justice itself \u2014 specifically mass incarceration and police violence \u2014 are now being explicitly contextualized within a framework of health.[12] In protest of such inequalities (made starkly visible by the killings of men like Eric Garner and the ensuing \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protests), medical students throughout the country have begun to advocate for change \u2014 for instance, with a solidarity \u201cdie-in\u201d action on December 10, 2014, which in turn led to the formation of a new racial health justice organization (\u201cWhite Coats for Black Lives\u201d) on Martin Luther King Day in 2015.[13]\n\nFinally, two new books are tackling head-on the problem of racial health inequality, albeit from very different \u201cexpert\u201d perspectives \u2014 one from within medicine and the other from a legal perspective. Damon Tweedy\u2019s Black Man in a White Coat, released last year, is a thoughtful memoir that explores the nexus of race and medicine through the eyes of a black physician. Law professor Dayna Bowen Matthew\u2019s Just Medicine: A Cure for Racial Inequality in American Health Care, on the other hand, is an integration of legal analysis and social science that culminates in an overarching policy recommendation.\n\nIn what follows, I\u2019ll first examine the issue of racism within the medical profession, turning to Tweedy\u2019s experiences and reflections as described in his book. Next, I\u2019ll focus on Matthew\u2019s book, and examine the problem of explicit and implicit medical discrimination historically and in the present \u2014 and how civil rights law might be used to combat it. From there, I\u2019ll discuss the place of the health system in the perpetuation of inequalities, and the largely neglected role that health care universalism plays in \u201chealth equality.\u201d\n\nLastly \u2014 but most importantly \u2014 I\u2019ll explore how health inequities by race and by class intersect. To phrase the question plainly: Does confronting the problem of racial health inequality mean that we must embrace the cause of economic redistribution, as discussed in the first part of this essay? If so, should this economic redistribution proceed within the context of social democracy (or democratic socialism?), or should it \u2014 must it \u2014 proceed along explicitly racial lines? Is the path to racial health equity paved with \u201creparations\u201d?\n\n2. Black doctors: Discrimination within the profession\n\nThe plotline of Steven Soderbergh\u2019s unnerving and beautifully shot series The Knick tackles racism within the medical profession by making it viscerally visible in another era. Set in a downtown Manhattan hospital at the turn of the 19th century, the black, eminently qualified physician, Algernon Edwards (Andrew Holland), is treated with derision and disdain by many of the hospital\u2019s white staff and administrators. At the same time, the hospital turns away black patients from its outpatient clinic; Edwards surreptitiously begins treating them \u2014 under rather suboptimal operative conditions \u2014 in the hospital\u2019s basement.[14]\n\nBut what about after the time period depicted in this series? Into the mid-20th century, blacks were excluded from many medical schools, and those who graduated faced intense discrimination in the course of practice. For instance, even decades after the events depicted in the Knick, black physicians were unable to provide care for their hospitalized patients in the South. This was because physicians needed to gain entry into county medical societies as a prerequisite to hospital-admitting privileges; and, in the South, these societies entirely or almost entirely denied blacks membership. The AMA virtuously professed that it opposed discrimination, and yet excused itself from doing anything, claiming it was impotent to compel integration. It took decades of political pressure to force change. In 1968, the Medical Committee for Human Rights, a health-oriented civil rights group, took matters into its own hands, invading the AMA\u2019s convention at the extravagant Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Such actions \u2014 in conjunction with the Civil Rights Act and the passage of Medicare \u2014 ultimately contributed to the AMA\u2019s vote later that year to expel county societies that excluded black members, at long last forcing their disgracefully delayed integration.[15]\n\nThis is, of course, not to say that blacks subsequently gained equal footing within the medical profession. Black representation in US medical schools has remained proportionally low over the decades, especially for men. Indeed, a report from the Association of American Medical Colleges last year showed that the number of black male matriculants in medical school is lower now \u2014 in absolute terms \u2014 than it was in the late 1970s. Tweedy, now an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center, was one of these matriculants. In his book, he describes some of the challenges he faced.\n\nIn addition to being one of only \u201ca handful of black students\u201d in his class at Duke Medical School, Tweedy came from a working class family, in stark contrast to the majority of his classmates. On the one hand, Tweedy highlights the importance of affirmative action: \u201cSo there it was: Not only was I admitted to Duke, when in a color-blind world I might not have been, but I had arrived with a full-tuition scholarship in hand.\u201d On the other hand, his first exchange as a first year student with a medical school professor was markedly inauspicious: the professor approached him to ask if he was there to fix the lights. While he was a medical student, patients routinely queried him about his presumed basketball skills. Far worse was his interaction as a resident with a racist patient and his confederate-flag adorned family (\u201cI don\u2019t want no nigger doctor,\u201d the patient told a nurse). Tweedy\u2019s diligence and persistence ultimately, however, won them over. On another occasion, a black patient rejected him, presuming his medical skills to be inferior and seeing the assignment as evidence of racist mistreatment of him as a patient. Given the insecurities that afflict medical students and trainees in general, we can only imagine the additional strain created by such presumptions and prejudices.\n\nTweedy\u2019s book is also very much about the experience of black patients. He bears witness to the second-class care they too frequently experience when, for instance, as a medical student he spends time in a makeshift rural clinic, \u201cnestled within a group of dingy trailers and makeshift houses.\u201d The clinic serves poor black patients who cannot afford prescribed treatments. They are likely to see a different doctor at every visit and receive grossly insufficient preventive care. In another chapter, he describes how one black patient, who quite reasonably declines one of his team\u2019s medical recommendations, is dispatched with a punitive psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nToward the conclusion of his book, Tweedy briefly explores the larger and looming question: what is the cause of racial health inequalities? Early in his medical career, he had assumed \u2014 like many others \u2014 that genetic differences were the primary factor. And indeed, for years, a huge amount of resources have gone into uncovering the genetic sources of health disparities. However, as Jason Silverstein explains in a revealing article in The Atlantic (\u201cGenes Don\u2019t Cause Racial-Health Disparities, Society Does\u201d), this money may have been better spent elsewhere. He describes a 2015 paper that systematically reviewed the collective evidence thus far for the proposition that genetic factors explain racial cardiovascular disparities. It\u2019s worth quoting from the study\u2019s conclusion:\n\nThe results reveal a striking absence of evidence to support the assertion that any important component of observed disparities in these diseases arises from main-effect genetic mechanisms as we currently understand them \u2026 Despite the enormous social investment in genomic studies, this research program has not yet provided valuable population-relevant insights into disparities in the most common cause of morbidity and mortality.[16]\n\nWhy then, Silverstein asks the study\u2019s lead author, do genomics still get so much attention? The author responds with a sentiment I\u2019ve long suspected: if inequalities are built into the very base pairs of our genetic code, what can we really do to alleviate them? More research? In effect, as the investigator tells Silverstein, the fact is that racism and inequities are let off the hook if our genes are the culprits. Tweedy notes that he came to reject this genetic explanation: even if genetic factors play some role with respect to specific diseases, they explain little of the overall differences in health between races.\n\nIn contrast, there are reams of evidence that point to social and economic inequalities as drivers of racial inequalities. In the first part of this essay, I focused on the impact of economic injustices on health: a large body of literature has demonstrated that poverty, for instance, is associated with a panoply of poor health outcomes, and some researchers argue that inequality itself causes worse health for everyone in society (perhaps via increased psychosocial strain as well as other factors).[17] No doubt such socioeconomic factors are a major factor in racial health inequalities, given the tight association between economic status and race.[18] Similarly, differences in health care access associated with race (like being uninsured) are no doubt factors as well.\n\nBut what might be said about the role of racially discriminatory treatment itself? This issue has received increased attention since the 2002 publication of an Institute of Medicine evidence report, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial Disparities in Health Care. Tweedy quotes from the report\u2019s conclusion: \u201cAlthough myriad sources contribute to [health] disparities, some evidence suggests that bias, prejudice, and stereotyping on the part of the healthcare providers may contribute to differences in care.\u201d Or, as he puts it, the \u201cdoctor-patient relationship itself serves as a catalyst for differing outcomes,\u201d which is in part the result of the fact that \u201csome doctors are prone to hold negative views about the ability of black patients to manage their health and therefore might recommend different, and possibly substandard, treatments to them.\u201d\n\nThis issue \u2014 namely, the problem of racially disparate treatment \u2014 is the central focus of Dayna Bowen Matthew\u2019s book. She explores how \u201cimplicit bias,\u201d as she terms it, deforms physician behavior; in her view, it constitutes the most neglected determinant of inferior health among blacks.\n\n3. Jim Crow medicine: Past and present\n\nMatthew is a law professor with appointments at both the University of Colorado Law School and the Colorado School of Public Health. Matthew is also one of the founders of the Colorado Health Equity Project, a multidisciplinary organization that works to \u201cremove legal barriers to equal health access and health outcomes for Colorado\u2019s vulnerable populations,\u201d as its website puts it. Her ambitious book lays out a case for a legal remedy for racial health inequality.\n\nKey to her argument is the historical context of civil rights law, which she sees as a swinging pendulum. Hill-Burton, as we\u2019ve seen, legally enshrined the \u201cseparate-but-equal\u201d standard \u2014 established in the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson \u2014 within the health care system. Legal challenges to this standard were unsuccessful, until Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, the \u201cwatershed case,\u201d as Matthew puts it, initiated its unraveling. As she recounts it, the case was brought by black practitioners and patients against a discriminatory hospital in North Carolina that received Hill-Burton funds. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decided in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring, as quoted by Matthew, that \u201cRacial discrimination by hospitals visits severe consequences upon Negro physicians and their patients.\u201d\n\nShe describes two consequences that flowed from this decision. First, the case helped catalyze subsequent successful health-care related civil rights litigation throughout the country. Second, the decision \u2014 which the Supreme Court importantly declined to reconsider \u2014 helped lead the way to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. According to Matthew, Congress took the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to accept the case as a signal that it saw hospital segregation as unconstitutional (and, indeed, several legislators explicitly cited the Simkins decision during debate over the bill). Much good came from this: \u201cFrom 1963 through the early 1990s,\u201d Matthew writes, \u201cTitle VI proved an effective weapon against the segregation and discrimination that minority patients and physicians had experienced in American health care since the colonial era.\u201d For instance, the Johnson administration required hospitals to comply with Title VI in order to be eligible for Medicare payment. Few could afford not to, and so the age of explicit hospital segregation finally came to a close.\n\nYet Matthew asserts that, to an extent, this more auspicious era ended abruptly in 2001, when a more conservative Supreme Court ruled in Alexander v. Sandoval, in a decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, that Title VI was applicable only in cases of deliberate discrimination; disparate impact was not enough.[19] This new standard precluded a great deal of civil rights litigation because it required that plaintiffs produce tangible evidence that racist health care was intentional, which is made difficult when, as she notes, \u201cfew Americans are careless enough to create an evidentiary record of outright bigotry.\u201d Thus, according to Matthew, with respect to health care discrimination, this decision effectively rendered Title VI \u201ca dead letter.\u201d This decision, she argues, must be undone if progress against racial health inequalities is to proceed. In short, unconscious racism in health care must, according to her, be made illegal through an act of Congress and an expansion of Title VI.\n\nThis may sound Orwellian to some. Is it meaningful, after all, to talk about outlawing sentiments or attitudes that lie deep within the dark depths of our unconscious? Can we root out biases if we are, by definition, unaware of their very existence? Matthew marshals a body of literature from various disciplines to answer in the affirmative. Conscious racism, she argues, is slowly being replaced by the unconscious variety: \u201cBut while overt racism is subject to nearly universal derision, unconscious racism due to implicit bias is hidden, is tolerated, and even excused despite its destructiveness.\u201d She persuasively explores various literatures demonstrating that physicians harbor unconscious negative perceptions of blacks. She cites studies that show that patient race affects which treatments doctors recommend, how much time they spend with patients, \u201cthe level of verbal exchange and shared decision-making in which they engage\u201d with patients, and even the manner of their nonverbal engagement. She concludes that there is a sufficient base of evidence to conclude that these implicit biases contribute to disparities, that there is reason to believe that such biases, even though they are implicit, are remediable, and that health care providers \u2014 both on the individual and institutional level \u2014 can therefore be held legally responsible for the results of their implicit biases.\n\nThe \u201cevidence of malleability\u201d is strong, according to Matthew. In other words, she thinks specific interventions can mitigate implicit biases and, as a result, disparate outcomes. The sorts of interventions she envisions, however, seem of mixed applicability and utility. Nonetheless, overall, she makes a strong case that clinicians make racially biased decisions, whether or not they intend to, and that this issue must be directly addressed. People like me \u2014 that is to say, white physicians who believe they are immune from racially biased thought and action \u2014 have a great deal to gain from reading this book.\n\nThat said, it is also important to examine the larger picture. There is no question that more needs to be done to address physician bias. Yet we also have to keep in mind that, in the pre-Alexander v. Sandoval era (when Title VI was, according to Matthew, more robust), there were still large racial inequalities. Litigation may be a useful tool, but it\u2019s a limited, post-facto modality.\n\nMore broadly, the recommendations of both Tweedy and Matthew ultimately seem inadequate. Neither gives much credence to the notion that further increasing the universalism of the health system might play an important role in reducing inequalities. Moreover, Tweedy says nothing, and Matthew only a little,[20] about the notion of economic redistribution as a tool against racial health inequalities. In fairness, these concerns are not the focus of their books. However, to my mind, they are crucial considerations in the larger discussion of racial health care justice.\n\n4. Health equity and health system universalism\n\nMartin Luther Kings Jr.\u2019s statement on the evils of health inequality is frequently quoted, but not usually in its full form. In his 1966 speech at the annual meeting of the aforementioned Medical Committee for Human Rights, he said, \u201cOf all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results in physical death.\u201d[21] Indeed, studies have shown a statistical association between lack of insurance and mortality. Removing the boundaries between individuals and the health care system is a critical step in the movement toward health care equality.\n\nTweedy, for instance, sees firsthand the harm inflicted on the uninsured when he works at the rural health clinic described earlier. But, even so, like Matthew, he gives insufficient attention in his book to the fact that, even with the reforms of the Affordable Care Act, we will continue to lack universal health care.[22] For instance, under current reforms, 27 million are expected to remain uninsured 10 years from now, according to an approximation of the Congressional Budget Office. We know that Hispanics and blacks are disproportionately represented among the uninsured.[23] Covering these excluded millions seems critical. Moreover, neither author discusses the fact that the US health care system imposes substantial financial burdens at the \u201cpoint of use,\u201d in the form of copayments, deductibles, and co-insurance for medical care, which may deter care for those who need it. Some have legitimately suggested that these forms of cost-sharing disproportionately harm minorities, who have lower median income and net wealth.[24] In other words, the potential harm of, say, a $2,000 medical deductible is dependent on your income and assets: those with fewer resources may lose out on important health care. And finally, though Tweedy refers to the shortcomings of Medicaid, neither he nor Matthew emphasizes that a health care system with a separate tier of access for the poor may be inherently unequal.\n\nBut would \u201ctrue\u201d universal health care do much to combat racial health inequalities, if it were, say, a single-payer system that eliminated out-of-pocket expenses and was equally accessible by all, without tiers or walls?[25] Or would it replicate current biases and inequalities? To some extent, the answer is yes to both questions. But even so, a body of research has suggested that, even if these biases persist, a fully universal system might nonetheless be a powerful tool in reducing racial health care inequalities. That evidence comes from what is arguably a quasi-single-payer system located in the US: the Veterans\u2019 Administration (VA). Notwithstanding recent scandals that are indeed of great concern, the modern-era VA has justifiably earned praise for delivering a high \u2014 indeed, comparatively superior \u2014 quality of health care.[26] There is also evidence that it may indeed effectively reduce, even potentially eliminate, some racial health inequalities.\n\nLast fall, a study published in Circulation, the premier journal of the American Heart Association, received wide coverage in the media for some provocative findings. \u201cThe US Veterans Health Administration (VHA),\u201d as the study notes in its introductory section, \u201cis a healthcare system that does not impose the typical access barriers of the US healthcare system that may disproportionately impede enrollment of blacks.\u201d The investigators therefore hypothesized that racial inequalities in cardiovascular outcomes and mortality found in the general population might be reduced in the VA, a \u201chealthcare system that allows enrollment independent of race or socioeconomic status.\u201d[27] Consistent with previous studies, in their analysis of data from the general (non-VA) population, they found racial inequalities much as they expected to find them: blacks had a much higher mortality (after adjusting for various other factors) as compared to whites (indeed, approximately 40 percent to 50 percent higher).[28]\n\nIn striking contrast, in the VA population, even though the risk of stroke was either higher or similar among blacks as compared to whites depending on which statistical adjustments were used, the risk of coronary heart disease as well as overall death was actually lower among blacks. This is, of course, only a single study, albeit a rather large one with more than three million subjects. An accompanying editorial concedes that a number of factors may be at play. Nonetheless, the fact is that, as described by the investigators, these findings build on an existing literature consisting of multiple studies that together point to a reduction of racial health inequalities within the VA for critically important outcomes like mortality.[29]\n\nNo doubt, there are still discriminatory practices in some or all of these facilities, and we can assume that there are conscious or unconscious biases at work in the minds of some of its clinicians, as there are elsewhere. Indeed, other studies clearly show that, even after the significant reorganization and reform of the VA in the late 1990s, there are still racial disparities in the VA.[30] If we moved to a single-payer system on a national level, such biases would still need to be addressed along the lines Matthew argues. But the point is that a more egalitarian structure of the health care system itself might go even further in reducing them. Indeed, in light of this research, it seems fair to say that health care universalism could be a very powerful tool in combatting ubiquitous racial health inequities. Attaining health care equality, in other words, requires true equality of access. And yet this simple notion is all too often ignored entirely in any discussion of health \u201cdisparities.\u201d\n\n5. The road to health equality: Is it paved with reparations?\n\nThis takes us to the final and most important arena: the issue of economic inequality. The essential point here was made clearly by the scholar Vicente Navarro in a commentary in the Lancet in 1990: \u201c\u2026 even if there were no race differentials in mortality, most blacks would still have higher mortality rates than the median or the mean rate in the US population.\u201d[31] The logic of this seemingly paradoxical statement is simple. There is currently a (growing) gradient in life expectancy by income: the wealthy live longer than the poor. Thus, if incomes differ by race (as they do), then life expectancy will differ by race, even if racism were eradicated in its entirety from the health care system.\n\nThis is an uncomfortable notion, but it\u2019s an important one. The ongoing rise in economic inequality was \u2014 in part \u2014 set into motion by a transatlantic political shift that occurred sometime in the 1970s.[32] The political ground may now be shifting beneath our feet, but we are nonetheless very much still living in that same \u201cneoliberal\u201d era, an era in which economic inequality and health inequality are yoked.\n\nFor some, an overarching concern with economic inequality might be thought consistent with a \u201cclass first\u201d (as its often termed) mentality toward political change, an approach that is currently under great contestation on the left-leaning side of the political spectrum. For instance, Bernie Sanders\u2019s central focus on economic justice has been criticized by the Atlantic\u2019s Ta-Nehisi Coates, who argues that his \u201crising tide lifts all boats\u201d approach is an amplified version of a longstanding inadequate Democratic approach to racial inequality. For Coates, in contrast, the sine qua non of racial justice is reparations. \u201c[T]reating a racist injury solely with class-based remedies,\u201d he writes, \u201cis like treating a gun-shot wound solely with bandages.\u201d But it bears mention that \u2014 in one particular way \u2014 Sanders and Coates are both arguing for the same thing: economic redistribution. For Sanders, this redistribution can be colorblind \u2014 through greater social welfare programs and progressive taxation \u2014 and still benefit minorities; for Coates, it must occur along color lines so as to more directly remunerate the victims of centuries of racist \u201cplunder.\u201d Yet there is, in truth, a great deal of overlap between these views. As The Week\u2019s Ryan Cooper argued in response to Coates, given entrenched economic inequality between races, \u201c[r]ace-neutral redistribution and welfare are by necessity anti-racist.\u201d However, it\u2019s important to recognize at the same time that a redistributive approach that is (at least nominally) neutral with respect to race lacks the symbolism of restitution. I can understand how many might feel that this would therefore fall short of justice.\n\nThen again, a stark theoretical dichotomy between class-based and race-based measures is reflective of neither history nor contemporary reality. The very reason that there are economic inequalities between blacks and whites is, of course, slavery, and the legal and extralegal oppression that followed it. In health, we can disentangle the effects of class and race by using sophisticated statistical tools, but what does it really mean when we say that health disparities are \u2014 or aren\u2019t \u2014 attenuated when \u201cadjusting\u201d for socioeconomic status? Theoretically, we are trying to measure the \u201cpure\u201d effect of race.[33] But that\u2019s an illusory concept, to some extent: the effects of class and race are intimately interwoven.\n\nIn health care, it is at this point clear that we need policies that work to diminish inequalities along the lines of each. A lesson that can be drawn from Tweedy, for instance, is that a health care workforce should reflect the composition of its population. Although he doesn\u2019t make the case quite as strongly in his book, he does so in a New York Times op-ed headlined \u201cThe Case for Black Doctors.\u201d For now, this goal requires affirmative action. Matthew, on the other hand, convincingly demonstrates that racial biases are at work \u2014 sometimes invisibly \u2014 in the minds of physicians, and whatever happens in the realm of economics or on the health system level, those biases will not suddenly wither. They therefore must be addressed, perhaps through the types of legal measures she describes. More broadly, we must aggressively address the host of environmental and public health inequities \u2014 and police violence might be considered in this category \u2014 that disproportionately afflict communities of color.\n\nYet these approaches \u2014 if carried out alone \u2014 would ultimately be inadequate in the struggle against racial inequalities in health. Health system universalism, on the other hand, is a potentially powerful \u2014 albeit insufficient \u2014 step toward racial health care justice. Likewise, economic inequality \u2014 on the rise, bound with race, tightly corresponding to health and death \u2014 must also be addressed. This is where the \u201cliberal\u201d and the \u201cleft\u201d frameworks toward health inequalities diverge. The liberal framework seeks to ameliorate the health impact of poverty or inequality with an array of interventions and programs and palliatives; the left approach, in contrast, goes a step further, and aims to level the inequalities themselves.\n\nAt the moment, the political winds seem to be favoring the latter. For those concerned with combatting the ills of health inequality \u2014 of both race and class \u2014 this should be seen as an auspicious development. Health inequities are not the product of our genes: they are the consequences of our history, and of the politics of health.\n\n\u00a4\n\n[1] One of the two books reviewed in this essay \u2014 Dayna Bowen Matthew\u2019s Just Medicine: A Cure for Racial Inequality in American Health Care \u2014 traces the history of health inequalities back to colonialism and the horrors of slavery.\n\n[2] Beatrix Rebecca Hoffman, Health Care for Some: Rights and Rationing in the United States since 1930 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), 81-85.

There has subsequently been some discussion about the failure to fully adjust for age in this paper, but the overall thrust of the paper\u2019s findings have held up, as discussed here.\n\n[12] For instance, these scholars contextualize deaths at the hands of law enforcement as a public health issue, arguing that such deaths should be made a \u201creportable health condition.\u201d Nancy Krieger et al., \u201cPolice Killings and Police Deaths Are Public Health Data and Can Be Counted,\u201d PLoS Med 12, no. 12 (2015).\n\n[13] The group recently published a paper describing their origins and aims.

This version is from an AP story headlined \u201cKing Berates Medical Care Given Negroes\u201d Oshkosh Daily Northwestern, March 26, 1966, and is available at: http://www.pnhp.org/news/2014/october/dr-martin-luther-king-on-health-care-injustice (accessed January 26, 2016) The other article with a slightly different version of the quote is available at the same page.\n\n[22] Tweedy acknowledges that the Affordable Care Act \u201chas some good features,\u201d like the expansion of insurance coverage and the prohibition on discrimination based on preexisting conditions. \u201cBut whether these and other changes will prove to be fiscally viable over the long term,\u201d he states, \u201cin the face of ever-rising health care costs, remains to be seen.\u201d It\u2019s not quite clear what Tweedy is saying here. Is he calling into question the financial viability of universal health coverage itself? Or is he suggesting that a more robust reform is necessary to cover everybody while also lowering costs? If he means the latter, he does not say it, much less spell it out.\n\n[23] According to this November 2015 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the uninsurance rate for whites is 9 percent, for blacks is 13 percent, and for Hispanics is 21 percent.\n\n[24] \u201c[T]he average family deductibles for bronze and silver plans would bring financial ruin to most African American and Hispanic households.\u201d Dominic F.

It found that the \u201c\u2026 VHA had substantially better quality of care than a national sample.\u201d S. M. Asch et al., \u201cComparison of Quality of Care for Patients in the Veterans Health Administration and Patients in a National Sample,\u201d Annals of Internal Medicine 141, no. 12 (2004).\n\n[27] The study excluded individuals with reduced renal function, given evidence that genetic factors may play a role in black/white disparities in this population.

The observation of better survival in black patients after a hospitalization for CHF is not readily explained by differences in healthcare utilization and needs further evaluation.\u201d However, as the investigators\u2019 note, white patients were overall sicker, which might account for their worse outcomes in a manner that could not be adjusted for by the investigators. Still, considered together, the fact that, in some instances, blacks do better than whites in the VA system is striking. However, it should probably be taken with something of a grain of salt given the fact that they do worse everywhere else. Overall, it might seem fair to conservatively conclude from such studies that, at the least, racial health inequalities \u2014 like mortality \u2014 are substantially attenuated within the VA system as compared to the general population.
