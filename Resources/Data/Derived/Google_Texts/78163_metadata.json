Without the legislature\u2019s involvement.\n\nThe emails Complete Colorado obtained \u201cadd support to the notion that the Colorado Division of Insurance knowingly broke state law when the agency decided to allow some health plans to be sold.\u201d\n\nWhen Obama changed the law to allow the two-year extension, the procedure was for states, like Colorado, with their own exchanges to \u201cdecide for themselves whether they\u2019d pick up this option offered by the president.\u201d\n\nThe report said, \u201cFor Colorado, however, the decision was a bit more tricky because of a law passed in 2013 designed to bring the state into maximum compliance with the ACA \u2026 One of the key provisions of the alignment bill was to ensure that all plans sold in 2014 and beyond were fully compliant with the benefits mandated by the ACA.\u201d\n\nThe report said an email from Vincent Plymell, the insurance division communications director, addressed the problem the same day Obama made his announcement.\n\n\u201cWhat is our position? It would seem similar to the November 2013 proposal, in that we can\u2019t allow [the sale of these health plans] due to the Alignment Bill. Is that correct? \u2013 Vince\u201d\n\nComplete Colorado continued, \u201cA top policy analyst for the DOI, Matt Mortier, responded: \u2018I believe you\u2019re right. We\u2019re hard-coded in Section 70 (Effective date \u2013 applicability) that the alignment bill requirements apply to health-coverage plans (non-grandfathered plans) issued or renewed on or after January 01, 2014.'\u201d\n\nThe report said the agency even drafted a press release that it was \u201cworking\u201d on the extension, and that it \u201cwill require a change in state law\u2026\u201d\n\nIt said the agency would work \u201cwith the legislature and the governor\u2019s office on the necessary legislation.\u201d\n\nBut those plans were scrapped, and the agency simply issued a bulletin making the change.\n\nOfficials cited a clause \u201cthat gives the insurance commissioner the power to set rules regarding the ACA implementation,\u201d Complete Colorado said.\n\n\u201cThe \u2026 question then becomes whether the commissioner\u2019s rule making power allows him/her to exceed [a] \u2018hard coded\u2019 statute that details an outright ban on certain types of health plans. Such \u2018rule making\u2019 clauses are usually intended to allow for adjustments that are within all other limits of the law \u2013 but don\u2019t allow for legal limits to be exceeded, as appears to be the case here.\u201d\n\nThe report also said while the state allow allows changes that are needed to align state law with \u201crequirements imposed by federal law,\u201d the Obama change was not a requirement, it was an option.\n\nComplete Colorado sued for access to the emails, the report said.\n\nIn a debate between Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, and GOP challenge Rep. Bob Beauprez, the issue had been raised at the time.\n\n\u201cYour insurance commissioner said that would violate the law in Colorado. I think she was right. Because it\u2019s a law that you signed that said every plan sold in Colorado had to be ACA-compliant. And then magically, a short while later, somebody reversed opinion within your administration and said, \u2018We\u2019ll ignore the law\u2019 \u2013 that you signed \u2013 and go ahead and allow those plans to be renewed. Why\u2019d you break the law, John, the law that you signed?\u201d Beauprez asked.\n\nThe new emails confirm what had been reported at the time, Complete Colorado said.\n\n\u201cNo document shows when, why or how the main players inside DOI changed their minds. But calendar records show that in between believing a legislative fix was needed and the decision to simply allow the plans to be sold \u2026 Commissioner Salazar met with top members of the Hickenlooper administration at the governor\u2019s offices,\u201d the report said.\n\nWND has reported on the disputes over Obama\u2019s arbitrary changes to Obamacare over the years.\n\nThere\u2019s even been a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of Kawa Orthdontics. It alleges the company was damaged because Obama refused to follow the law as written and impose an employer mandate as Congress ordered.\n\nJudicial Watch said its client lost \u201cthe value of the time and money it spent in 2013 preparing for the mandate to take effect in 2014.\u201d\n\nThat was because Obama changed the deadline written in the law.\n\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided not to address the central question of the case \u2013 \u201cwhether the executive branch could \u2018ignore the clear, congressionally imposed deadline\u2019 of the ACA, also known as Obamacare \u2013 because it concluded that Kawa Ortho did not demonstrate injury sufficient to establish legal standing.\u201d\n\nJudicial Watch said it was appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nFrom the past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is available some critically important advice, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nTom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said, \u201cThose who think Obama\u2019s lawlessness and his refusal to follow his own Obamacare law has no consequences are oblivious to costs of this lawlessness for American businesses, such as our client Kawa Orthodontics.\n\n\u201cThis case is yet another instance in which a responsible and rational business has been injured by a politically motivated, unilateral power grab by the executive branch. In attempting to comply with the law, our client instead suffered significant economic harm, so that President Obama and influential special interests could avoid accountability for the law that was passed despite the clear objections of the American people.\u201d\n\nA petition frames the question for the Supreme Court: Can the president ignore a congressional deadline?\n\nIt states: \u201cUnlike all of the other ACA challenges submitted to the court over the past few years, Kawa Ortho does not challenge the text of the law. Nor does it challenge the enforcement of the \u2019employer mandate\u2019 provisions. \u2026 Instead, Kawa Ortho challenges defendants\u2019 unlawful decision to disregard statutory requirements and unilaterally delay enforcement of the law for at least two years.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s involved in such antics were described by Justice Antonin Scalia as \u201cjiggery-pokery.\u201d\n\nThe Obamacare law was under challenge, but changed by the majority\u2019s redefinition of the words of the English language.\n\n\u201cUnder all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government should lose this case. But normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved,\u201d the dissent said.\n\nScalia wrote: \u201cThe court interprets 36B to award tax credits on both federal and state exchanges. It accepts that the \u2018most natural sense\u2019 of the phrase \u2018exchange established by the state\u2019 is an exchange established by a state \u2026 (Understatement, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!) yet the opinion continues, with no semblance of shame, that \u2018it is also possible that the phrase refers to all exchanges \u2013 both state and federal.\u2019 (Impossible possibility, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!).\n\n\u201cThe court claims that \u2018the context and structure of the act compel it to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Much has been reported about Barack Obama\u2019s arbitrary changes to the Obamacare law, to deadlines, requirements and such, all without the benefit of any actual \u2013 legal \u2013 changes in the law as adopted by Congress.
