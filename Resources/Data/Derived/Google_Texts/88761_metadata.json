No matter where you work, live or play, there\u2019s a vote center around you.\u201d\n\nVoters can text a zip code to 75044 to receive three voting center options, she said.\n\nRegistered voters would have received a red, white and blue-colored brochure with a list of all polling locations, Kennedy said.\n\nResidents can also visit www.votelubbock.org to view a list of vote centers in the county.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll even give them a Google map to go as well with it,\u201d she said.\n\nResidents who plan on voting will have to present one of seven approved forms of photo ID.\n\nAccording to county records, 153,730 voters are registered in Lubbock County.\n\nTexas voters are not required to register their party affiliation, according to Kennedy.\n\n\u201cNot having to register, and everybody being able to go anywhere, if you\u2019re a husband and wife in a split-party household, then you can go together to any location you choose and both your ballots will be there for your parties,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to early voting results collected last week about 15,000 registered voters voted early in Lubbock County. The number is smaller than the 24,125 voters who voted early in 2010 primaries, which also featured a gubernatorial race but no presidential race.\n\nHowever, this year\u2019s number is more than the 2006 primary early voting turnout, when 11,961 voted early.\n\ngabriel.monte@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8707\n\nFollow Gabe on Twitter\n\n@AJ_GabeMonte\n\n(Vote for one unless otherwise noted.)\n\nDemocrats\n\nFederal offices\n\n\u25a0 U.S. Senator\n\nMaxey Marie Scherr\n\nHarry Kim\n\nDavid M.
