Last season, Barrie most often played with Nate Guenin, and Holden usually was with Brad Stuart.\n\nGiven that he\u2019s counted on to contribute offensively and counter the risks of having an undersized D-man on the ice so much, the 5-foot-10, 190-pound Barrie\u2019s goal total so far (1) is underachievement. He had 13 and 12 goals the past two seasons. Yet he and Holden have remained paired through thick and thin, other than when Barrie was serving a three-game NHL suspension for an early-season hit on Anaheim\u2019s Simon Despres.\n\nThe Avalanche\u2019s offseason plan to play Barrie with young Nikita Zadorov, acquired from Buffalo in the Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade, was quickly scuttled, and Zadorov now is with the AHL\u2019s San Antonio Rampage.\n\n\u201cI like the pairing,\u201d Patrick Roy said of Barrie and Holden. \u201cThey\u2019re both capable of breaking out on their own; they\u2019re both mobile. Nick is capable of playing steady defense for us, which is good for Tyson as well, and he\u2019s having some good reads. If Tyson goes on the rush, (Holden) is capable of playing the odd-man rush. I just feel right now it\u2019s a good fit for both of them.\u201d\n\nGoing into the Avalanche\u2019s Saturday home game against Winnipeg, Barrie has that single goal \u2014 at Pittsburgh on Nov. 19 \u2014 and 13 assists, is minus-4 and is averaging 23 minutes.\n\nHolden has no goals and eight assists, is even, and plays 20 minutes a night. He also is capable of more on offense, because he had 10 goals in only 54 games for Colorado two seasons ago. But partnering with the offensive-minded Barrie comes with encouragement to dial back a bit.\n\n\u201cNick\u2019s a real smart guy, and he plays a simple game,\u201d Barrie said. \u201cI think that works well for me because I always know where he\u2019s going to be and he communicates really well. I think he does a pretty good job of being in the right place, of being in a support position for me, because I like to go a little bit. It can get me in trouble, so he\u2019s a good, reliable valve for me.\u201d\n\nHolden said, \u201cI knew what kind of player Tyson was. He uses his partner a lot, and he\u2019s so explosive that you regroup when he\u2019s going to start jumping, so you have an extra option in a neutral-zone breakout. Or in the D-zone, you know he\u2019s going to jump and he gives you another option. It\u2019s funny, but you both talk more and then you can talk less because I know what he might do when he\u2019s going back on the puck.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really had to change my game. My game\u2019s always pretty much been move the puck up to our boards and let them go. \u2026 I know he likes to pop in more than most guys, so you just have to take a double look.\u201d\n\nThey essentially have been Avalanche teammates for three seasons now.\n\n\u201cWe had a friendship before this year, but it definitely grows in little ways when you play together,\u201d Holden said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking more, you\u2019re talking away from hockey a little bit more. You start to make little bets. I bet him who would score first and then he scored in that game in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nHolden smiled and admitted, \u201cI owe him supper.\u201d\n\nFootnote. The Avalanche didn\u2019t practice on Thanksgiving, so Roy wasn\u2019t called upon to expand on or temper his postgame criticism of goalie Semyon Varlamov following the 5-3 loss to Ottawa on Wednesday. \u201cHe needs to be better,\u201d Roy said after the game. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tyson Barrie, Nick Holden solidifying role as Avs\u2019 No. 2 defensive tandem", "title": "Tyson Barrie, Nick Holden solidifying role as Avs\u2019 No. 2 defensive tandem", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/tyson-barrie-nick-holden-solidifying-role-as-avs-no-2-defensive-tandem/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__hkn-barriep1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__hkn-barriep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T21:00:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:33:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1c7\"", "article_summary": "Or in the D-zone, you know he\u2019s going to jump and he gives you another option.\n\u201cNick\u2019s a real smart guy, and he plays a simple game,\u201d Barrie said.\n\u201cI think that works well for me because I always know where he\u2019s going to be and he communicates really well.\nNick is capable of playing steady defense for us, which is good for Tyson as well, and he\u2019s having some good reads.\nHe uses his partner a lot, and he\u2019s so explosive that you regroup when he\u2019s going to start jumping, so you have an extra option in a neutral-zone breakout."}
