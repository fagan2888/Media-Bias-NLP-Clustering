There were certainly no hard feelings afterward.\n\n\u201cBut it was pretty late by the time we were heading home, so we didn\u2019t continue the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cChelsea and I are friends,\u201d added Bates, policy analyst for the Cato Institute\u2019s Project on Criminal Justice. \u201cWe chatted on the way.\n\n\u201cI thought the event pretty much went as expected. She is a very reasonable advocate for gun control. She doesn\u2019t make any argument out of left field. Unfortunately, Chelsea and I aren\u2019t terribly powerful within the field, so I don\u2019t know if it will spur any kind of movement.\u201d\n\nNot that Parsons, who started off the 90-minute or so discussion by citing a number of alarming statistics about the incidence of gun violence while conceding the Second Amendment did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms, was expecting a resolution.\n\n\u201cAdam and I respect at the outset we\u2019re unlikely to change each others\u2019 minds when it comes to our core beliefs,\u201d said Parsons, who was pleased with the number of issues they did agree upon. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to change his mind about background checks, and he\u2019s not going to change mine about defensive gun use.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a conversation not aimed at changing minds, but instead at finding places of agreement, that perspective lends itself toward a more civil conversation. When you agree from the outset to have a conversation on a topic like this in a toned-down way, the conversation can be productive.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s precisely the intent of the Civil Discourse Project event held at Congregation Beth Sholom in Elkins Park, which drew a mostly older audience of 350 to 400 people. They posed a number of questions at the \u201ccombatants,\u201d which were redirected by moderator Chris Satullo.\n\nDuring the course of the evening, topics came up that may have been a revelation to many in the audience.\n\nAmong them were \u201cstraw gun buyers\u201d \u2014 people who buy firearms on behalf of those who can\u2019t pass background checks \u2014 the correlation between gun violence and mental health, the degree of crime related to drugs, and so-called \u201csmart guns,\u201d which require some kind of identification recognition in order to operate, thus preventing accidental shootings.\n\nAnd there probably weren\u2019t many in the building who knew this: According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the average gap between the original purchase of a gun and the time it\u2019s used in committing a crime is 11 years. And that gun is likely to change hands a number of times during that interval.\n\nIn the process of the discussions both sides made concessions. Bates was willing to acknowledge mental health isn\u2019t that great a factor in gun violence, while Parsons said she\u2019d consider Bates\u2019 suggestion that banned anyone convicted of a nonviolent crime from ever owning a gun.\n\n\u201cHe raised a fair point that we should look at some of the underlying causes of impersonal violence,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI agree with that premise. Where we diverge is we also need to address the easy access of firearms.\n\n\u201cWe call that lapse between when a gun is first sold at retail and when it\u2019s used at a crime the \u2018time to crime.\u2019 But where Adam said there was nothing we can do to regulate black market guns, I think there are a number of ways we can strengthen our laws to reduce illegal arms trafficking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of points we were in agreement, but we tend to disagree on what the solution should be.\u201d\n\nBut both welcomed the opportunity to express their views without being interrupted, which enabled them \u2014 if nothing else \u2014 to hear the other side.\n\n\u201cGun rights get people animated,\u201d Bates said. \u201cWhat typically happens at events like this is not so much people yelling at each other, as taking the opposing argument as if it is in bad faith.\n\n\u201cThey question the motive of the other side and then end up not actually listening. It becomes dueling press conferences instead of an actual discussion.\n\n\u201cThis is better for all sides, and the audience [can] engage with other side and have an adult conversation.\u201d\n\nProject coordinator Dina Wolfman Baker was thrilled with the result.\n\n\u201cI actually think this was our best one,\u201d said Wolfman Baker, whose previous civil discourse topics included Obamacare, fracking and political funding. \u201cThey were articulate but respectful. It was great to realize they had a lot of common ground.\u201d\n\nModerator Satullo, the former WHYY vice president for news and civic engagement and longtime Philadelphia Inquirer editorial page editor and columnist, was equally impressed.\n\n\u201cThey engaged more substantively than anyone else we\u2019ve had,\u201d said Satullo, a professional in residence at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Center for Public Policy. \u201cThe last two years the world views of the people were so different you almost couldn\u2019t get them to connect.\n\n\u201cThese guys were very good, and we were able to touch on most of the major topics one way or another. They were very much in the spirit of the Bernard Wolfman event.\u201d\n\nSo much so that Parsons reacted to a point raised by Bates with the perfect response.\n\n\u201cI disagree \u2014 civilly,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Jewish Exponent", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.jewishexponent.com/headlines/2016/05/civil-discourse-lives-up-to-its-name", "image": "http://www.jewishexponent.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og-image/public/article/main_image/unspecified.jpeg?itok=FSmLa-yf", "site_name": "Jewish Exponent", "description": "Following their &amp;ldquo;duel&amp;rdquo; at a Bernard Wolfman Civil Discourse Project event on April 27, gun rights advocate Adam Bates and gun control lobbyist Chelsea Parsons kitbbitzed on the train ride", "title": "Civil Discourse Lives up to its Name"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Jewish Exponent", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.jewishexponent.com/", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "While not exactly the embodiment of \u201cmake love, not war,\u201d the Bernard Wolfman Civil Discourse Project event marked a significantly different stance than most of\u00a0gun rights advocate Adam Bates and gun control lobbyist Chelsea Parsons'\u00a0colleagues employ."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you have a conversation not aimed at changing minds, but instead at finding places of agreement, that perspective lends itself toward a more civil conversation.\n\u201cI actually think this was our best one,\u201d said Wolfman Baker, whose previous civil discourse topics included Obamacare, fracking and political funding.\n\u201cHe raised a fair point that we should look at some of the underlying causes of impersonal violence,\u201d Parsons said.\nFollowing their \u201cduel\u201d at a Bernard Wolfman Civil Discourse Project event on April 27, gun rights advocate Adam Bates and gun control lobbyist Chelsea Parsons kitbbitzed on the train ride back to Washington, D.C.\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d said Parsons, vice president of guns and crime policy at the Center for American Progress."}
