And then it got really bad.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Savita Halappanavar died of septicaemia in Galway after being denied a lifesaving termination while she was miscarrying, international outcry has put pressure on the Irish government to revise its outdated and often dangerous policies toward abortion. In 2013, the country legalized abortion in limited circumstances, including \u201cwhen a mother\u2019s life is at risk due to medical complications or the threat of suicide.\u201d Yet in July, the U.N. Human Rights Committee in Geneva declared that the country\u2019s legislation was still in breach of international human rights and said that putting suicidal pregnant women through medical review was \u201cadditional mental torture.\u201d\n\nNow, even more damningly, comes the case of a young woman who seemed to meet precisely the criteria for obtaining an abortion and was coerced into an early c-section instead. A friend of the woman, who is an immigrant and has not been named, tells the Irish Times that she was raped in her home country and learned that she was pregnant after coming to Ireland earlier this year. Her friend says that she claimed, \u201cI do not want this. I am too young to be a mother. I am not ready.\u201d She also reportedly feared for her safety. He says that \u201cthe woman had been seeking information about abortion from authorities for up to three months\u201d but that she was not given information on how to obtain one. She went to a general practitioner last month who directed her to a hospital, where she was told she was too far along and refused. The Irish Times reports that a \u201cmedical source familiar with the case\u201d confirms the timeline.\n\nWhen she was turned down for an abortion, the woman threatened to go on a hunger strike, and a panel of psychiatrists agreed she was suicidal \u2013 but an obstetrician \u201csaid the baby could be delivered.\u201d The Guardian reports that then \u201clocal health authorities obtained a court order to deliver the baby prematurely \u2013 at about 25 weeks, according to some reports \u2013 to ensure its safety. The infant has been placed in care.\u201d And we all know Ireland\u2019s track record on institutionalized care. The New York Times says the woman consented to the caesarean after proceedings were set in motion to forcibly hydrate her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New legislation was supposed to protect women -- but it didn't work out that way", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New legislation was supposed to protect women -- but it didn't work out that way", "title": "Why did Ireland deny a suicidal woman an abortion?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/why_did_ireland_deny_a_suicidal_woman_an_abortion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/irish_abortion_protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New legislation was supposed to protect women -- but it didn't work out that way", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/irish_abortion_protest.jpg", "title": "Why did Ireland deny a suicidal woman an abortion?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why did Ireland deny a suicidal woman an abortion?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Ireland, Rape, Reproductive Rights, Savita Halappanavar", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9c1\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, Ireland, Rape, Reproductive Rights, Savita Halappanavar, Life NewsIn yet another harrowing example of Ireland\u2019s appalling and systematic abuse of female bodily autonomy, a young woman who claimed to be suicidal after getting pregnant via an alleged rape was recently denied an abortion.\nThe Irish Times reports that a \u201cmedical source familiar with the case\u201d confirms the timeline.\nThe New York Times says the woman consented to the caesarean after proceedings were set in motion to forcibly hydrate her.\nHe says that \u201cthe woman had been seeking information about abortion from authorities for up to three months\u201d but that she was not given information on how to obtain one.\nA friend of the woman, who is an immigrant and has not been named, tells the Irish Times that she was raped in her home country and learned that she was pregnant after coming to Ireland earlier this year."}
