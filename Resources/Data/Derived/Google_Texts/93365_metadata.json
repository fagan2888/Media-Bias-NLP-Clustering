Mary Landrieu (La.) rated President Barack Obama a \u201csix or seven\u201d out of 10 and said Obamacare must remain the law in her first senate debate with Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe embattled three-term senator argued that she deserves reelection because of her long career in Washington, repeatedly mentioning that her time in the Senate has spanned six Louisiana governors and three presidencies.\n\nLandrieu said she was first inspired to run for office \u201cafter college,\u201d more than three decades ago when she graduated from Louisiana State University in 1977, in response to the first question of the evening, while Cassidy and Tea Party candidate Rob Maness both said they decided to enter politics within the last decade.\n\n\u201cAfter Katrina I had led a volunteer group of 300 people and set up a surge hospital within three days to welcome those folks who were fleeing the floodwaters in New Orleans,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI think that formative experience at that time in my life led me to begin to run for public office. I consider it a continuation of the life of service I\u2019ve done as a doctor working in a hospital for the uninsured.\u201d\n\nCassidy used his medical background to stake out his position against Obamacare, and presented a constituent\u2019s insurance policy renewal that he said recently increased from $725 to $1,200 per month.\n\nLandrieu said the solution is more subsidies, and continued to defend her vote for the law.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is not perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt needs to be fixed two ways. A copper plan could help make it a little bit more affordable, raise the subsidy for, you know, raise the\u2014additional subsidies, and then also allow insurance agents to sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there are ways to fix it,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cNot perfect, but we have to keep it and not under any circumstance repeal it.\u201d\n\nOn campaign finance, Landrieu said Citizens United should be overturned and criticized the Koch brothers, even though she has received thousands in donations from Koch Industries.\n\n\u201cThe Koch brothers and Bill Cassidy have literally orchestrated a $25 million bogus campaign run on television,\u201d she said.\n\nLandrieu has received more support from super PACs that Cassidy. Nearly $12 million has been spent by outside groups so far in senate race, including $3.6 million spent against Landrieu and $7.3 million against Cassidy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nLandrieu again claimed she supports pay equity, even though public records indicate she paid women 82 cents on the dollar compared to men last year.\n\nCassidy said he supports pay equity, but does not favor additional legislation because discrimination based on gender is already outlawed. He called the Lily Ledbetter act \u201ctrial attorney bailout bill\u201d that opens the doors for lawsuits.\n\nLandrieu also said increasing revenue sharing for offshore drilling is one of her top priorities and that she is the candidate to secure federal funding, although she has failed to advance three bills out of her own Energy committee.\n\n\u201cI have secured it as a junior member of the energy committee,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m now chair of the Energy committee.\u201d\n\nDuring a lightning round towards the end of the debate Cassidy was the only candidate to voice his support for medicinal marijuana. The candidates were then asked to rate the president on a scale of one to 10.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s a zero,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cObama\u2019s going to go down as one of the worst presidents in American history.\u201d\n\nLandrieu gave Obama, whose approval rating is hovering at 40 percent, a much higher grade of a six to seven, adding, \u201cI think he\u2019s had some really tough issues to deal with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "SHREVEPORT, La.\u2014Democratic incumbent Sen.
