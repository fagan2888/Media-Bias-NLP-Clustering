Lottery officials say no ticket has matched all six Powerball numbers.

That means the record $949.8 million jackpot is expected to soar to $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing.

The odds to win were one in 292.2 million, and the numbers drawn were 32-16-19-57-34 and Powerball number 13.

Officials with the Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs the Powerball game, said they expected about 75 percent of the possible number combinations would have been bought for Saturday night's drawing.

Since Nov. 4, the Powerball jackpot has grown from its $40 million starting point as no one has won the jackpot.

Powerball is played in 44 states as well as the District of Columbia, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
