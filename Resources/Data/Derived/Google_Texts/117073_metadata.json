Seven Democratic senators marked it by asking to delay yet another provision of the law.\n\nPutting companies with 51 to 100 employees in the costlier \u201csmall group\u201d market could be \u201charmful and disruptive,\u201d they said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Silvia Burwell.\n\nPlease give the uninsured another chance to avoid the fine for not having health insurance, three House Democrats asked in a letter to President Barack Obama in February.\n\n\u201cIf Obamacare is so great, why do Democrats repeatedly try to hide its more unpleasant features?\u201d Investors Business Daily asked them.\n\nBefore the law was passed, President Obama assured us:\n\nIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. (Tens of thousands \u2014 chiefly seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage \u2014 have learned they can\u2019t. Only 32 percent of 3,072 physicians surveyed by medical HR firm Jackson Coker say they\u2019ll join the Obamacare network.)\n\nIf you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your plan. (Hundreds of thousands \u2014 most recently in Colorado \u2014 have had their plans canceled. Up to 20 million eventually might, the Congressional Budget Office once estimated.)\n\nPremiums for the average family will be cut by up to $2,500. (Premiums in the non-group marketplace were 24.4 percent higher last year than they would have been absent Obamacare, said the National Bureau of Economic Research.)\n\n\u201cI will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits,\u201d the president said. (Obamacare will raise net federal costs by $1.35 trillion over the next decade, CBO estimated in January.)\n\n\u201cThis law means more choice, more competition,\u201d he said. (The year before Obamacare went into effect, 1,232 carriers offered insurance coverage in the individual market, said the Government Accountability Office. This year, owing in part to market concentration, only 310 do.)\n\nNo wonder the law\u2019s defenders strive frantically to move the goalposts. Obamacare is a success because more people have health insurance, they say. You have to pay a fine if you don\u2019t have insurance, so this \u201caccomplishment\u201d is pretty lame \u2014 especially since so many uninsured pay the fine rather than buy overpriced insurance.\n\nMany of the 11.4 million Obamacare \u201csignups\u201d of which the administration boasts previously had health insurance. Only 6.7 million of the 8 million \u201csignups\u201d claimed for last year actually enrolled.\n\nCBO predicted when Obamacare was passed that this year 26 million more Americans would have health insurance. This month, CBO scaled that estimate back by more than 10 million, though one reason is that 23 states chose not to expand Medicaid.\n\nPremiums will rise about 8.5 percent this year and next, CBO estimates. In the two years before Obamacare was enacted, premiums rose just 0.6 percent and 1.3 percent.\n\nObamacare\u2019s true cost is disguised by subsidies for insurance companies due to expire in 2017, writes Stephen Parente, professor of health finance at the University of Minnesota. When they do, premiums for \u201cBronze\u201d plans will soar as much as 45 percent.\n\nObamacare clobbers employment, say businesses surveyed by Federal Reserve banks in New York and Philadelphia. When the oft-delayed employer mandate finally kicks in, thousands more will lose their jobs.\n\nObamacare has been underwater in 200 consecutive polls, by larger margins since implementation began. As more Americans discover their \u201cinexpensive\u201d policy has an enormous deductible or get a nasty surprise from the IRS, I wouldn\u2019t bet on it becoming more popular.\n\nObamacare will cost some $50,000 for each additional person insured, according to some calculations. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can afford it,\u201d said author Stephen Brill.\n\nIn a year or two, when premiums and fines soar, Obamacare will be in a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d if it isn\u2019t already in one.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why President Obama clings to his \u201csignature achievement.\u201d But why do nearly all other Democrats? Some who voted for Obamacare must have thought it would help their constituents. Now that it\u2019s clear it hurts them and that many of them hate it, why won\u2019t they fix their mistake?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monday was the fifth anniversary of Obamacare.
