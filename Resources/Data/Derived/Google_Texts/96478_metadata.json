What do you do next?\n\nWell, one thing he didn\u2019t do was to head for Disneyland.\n\nOn the day of his reappointment as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and after all the formalities. Beck went to a memorial ceremony at Rampart Station for Officer Kat Talbot, who was killed in an off-duty car crash.\n\nBeck went out for a celebratory dinner with his family and then when off on a pre-scheduled vacation.\n\nBut, the lack of a major post-appointment celebration left many wondering if Beck had missed an opportunity to begin to mend fences with rank-and-file officers \u2014 the ones he considered the backbone of his support \u2014 and who are angry over issues ranging from pay to discipline.\n\nBeck could have begun appearing at roll calls to let the officers know he was aware of their dissatisfaction and say he is willing to work on issues that are upsetting them.\n\nPolice Protective League President Tyler Izen said he has talked with Beck and the chief promised to work with them.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to help him work out these issues,\u201d Izen said. \u201cBut, I think morale is much lower than he appreciates.\u201d\n\nBeck\u2019s aides said he will meet regularly with officers and community leaders after his vacation.\n\nOne last jab at mayor\n\nAs it appears the legal dispute over two Department of Water and Power trusts is near, the head of the union representing the workers was able to get in one last jab against Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\nBrian D\u2019Arcy, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 18 and who has been fighting city efforts to audit the books of the Joint Training and Joint Safety Institutes, decided to work directly with City Council President Herb Wesson \u2014 cutting Garcetti out of the discussions and any credit for resolving the issue.\n\nGarcetti was able to offer a counterpunch, calling a 4 p.m. news conference with Wesson and other officials to claim victory with the proposal.\n\nGarcetti and D\u2019Arcy have been at odds since last year\u2019s mayoral election and Garcetti\u2019s calls for changes in DWP work rules and other reforms.\n\nA new \u2018young gun\u2019\n\nIn the race to succeed Rep. Henry Waxman in the South Bay, Republican Elan Carr received a boost last week when the National Republican Congressional Committee designated him as a \u201cyoung gun.\u201d\n\nWith the designation, Carr will be able to call on GOP leaders to serve as mentors and build up his financial base of support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur job as a committee is to help elect Republicans to office that will serve as a check and balance on the Obama administration,\u201d NRCC Chairman Greg Walden said.\n\n\u201cElan has outlined conservative principles that will grow jobs, stop the harmful effects of Obamacare, and get Washington\u2019s spending under control. Elan has met a series of rigorous goals that will put him in a position to win on Election Day.\u201d\n\nDespite coming in first in the primary election, Carr is considered the underdog to state Sen. Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, because of the number of Democrats registered in the district.\n\nRick Orlov is a Daily News staff writer and columnist. His column, Tipoff, appears on Mondays.
