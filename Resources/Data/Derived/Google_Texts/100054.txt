Authorities are searching for a man wanted in nine bank robberies that have taken place in New Jersey and Pennsylvania since November.

Police in Columbia, Pa., released a still image from a surveillance video of a man they say robbed the Union Community Bank there on April 4, who they believe also robbed seven other banks in Pennsylvania and one in New Jersey. That one, the Fulton Bank in Logan Township, was robbed on Feb. 6. Logan is in Gloucester County, along the Delaware River across from Pennsylvania.

In the still image, the bearded man was wearing glasses, a green baseball-style cap, and a grey hooded sweatshirt over a dark T-shirt.

Columbia Police said in a press release on Friday that a man about 30 to 50 years old, about 5-foot-10, with a medium-to-slim build, entered the Union Community Bank at 2:05 p.m., and handed a teller a note demanding money. The man did not display a weapon, police said.

After being given an undisclosed amount of cash, police said the man walked out of the bank and got into a silver 4-door Chevrolet Silverado or GMC Sierra pickup truck, with a Pennsylvania license plate that had been reported stolen from another vehicle.

The same man is believed to have robbed eight other banks in the two states within a 5-month span.

Police asked that anyone with information on the suspect call (717) 684-7735, est. 7210, and ask for detective Matt Leddy.
