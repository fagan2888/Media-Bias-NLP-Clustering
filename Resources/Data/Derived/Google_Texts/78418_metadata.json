Sean Duffy, R-Wis., requested more information from Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg on the \u201cunacceptable\u201d delay of a Freedom of Information Act request from the government watchdog Americans for Limited Government.\n\nDuffy serves as the chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n\n\u201cThe FOIA request has been pending for more than 500 days, well above the bank\u2019s average response time of 86 days for simple FOIA requests and 185 days for complex requests,\u201d the letter, sent yesterday, stated.\n\nThe Daily Signal reported on the bank\u2019s failure to respond to the request earlier this month.\n\nIn November 2013, Americans for Limited Government President Nathan Mehrens filed a request for information on the bank\u2019s relationship with two consulting firms: McLarty Associates and the Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nMcLarty Associates is run by Thomas McLarty, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. While the firm hasn\u2019t lobbied Congress since 2005, it does maintain strong ties with former and current Ex-Im officials. Several of McLarty Associates also benefited from millions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees from the bank.\n\nThe Albright Stonebridge Group, meanwhile, is headed by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who also served during the Clinton administration.\n\nAlbright\u2019s daughter, Alice Albright, was chief operating officer and executive vice president at Ex-Im from 2009 to 2013. During that same time period, three of the Albright Stonebridge Group\u2019s clients, Siemens AG, First Solar and Dow Chemical Co., benefited from more than $6.3 billion in financing from Ex-Im.\n\n>>> Rubio Takes on Export-Import Bank: \u2018Government Should Not Be Picking Winners and Losers\u2019\n\nAmericans for Limited Government requested records of \u201cmeetings and communications\u201d between McLarty Associates\u2019 employees McLarty, Nelson Cunningham, former Rep. James Kolbe and Stuart Eizenstat, and Ex-Im officials.\n\nCunningham served as a team leader for Ex-Im on President Obama\u2019s transition team and was appointed a member of the bank\u2019s advisory committee in 2011, 2012 and 2013. During the latter two years, he was the committee\u2019s chairman.\n\nKolbe was also a member of Ex-Im\u2019s advisory committee in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe group also requested copies of \u201ccandidate questionnaire forms\u201d completed by Cunningham, Kolbe and Carol Browner.\n\nBrowner, who is affiliated with the Albright Stonebridge Group, was a member of the Obama-Biden transition team\u2019s advisory board and was appointed to Ex-Im\u2019s advisory committee in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well passed the time for [Ex-Im] to deliver this stuff,\u201d Mehrens told The Daily Signal. \u201cThere are legitimate questions on the relationships that were the subject of the FOIA request. The public needs to see this, and they need to see it now, especially as there are heated debates over the legitimacy of the bank and whether it should be reauthorized at all, and whether the relationships are just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Duffy asked Hochberg for unredacted copies of the records requested in Americans for Limited Government\u2019s FOIA by May 11.\n\nEx-Im officials told Mehrens today that documents pertaining to his request had been submitted to the bank\u2019s legal department for review and approval.\n\n\u201cIs this the norm there or do they just play by their own rules, or are these isolated incidents?\u201d Mehrens asked of the potential relationships with the firms. \u201cI think a lot of these records here will hopefully shed some light on these specific relationships.\u201d\n\nEx-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products. The bank\u2019s charter expires June 30, and policymakers are currently debating whether to reauthorize the agency.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee maintains jurisdiction over Ex-Im, and its chairman, Jeb Hensarling, is one of the bank\u2019s most ardent opponents.\n\nLetter to Export-Import Bank on Status of FOIA by The Heritage Foundation", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unfulfilled request for information on the relationship between Ex-Im and a consulting firm has garnered the attention of Financial Services.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An unfulfilled request for information on the relationship between Ex-Im and a consulting firm has garnered the attention of Financial Services.", "title": "House Questions ExIm on Delay of Requests on Clinton-Backed Firm", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150428_ExImFOIA_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-28T13:38:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1EAfTT8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An unfulfilled request for information on the relationship between Ex-Im and a consulting firm has garnered the attention of Financial Services.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150428_ExImFOIA_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "House Questions ExIm on Delay of Requests on Clinton-Backed Firm", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-04-28T13:28:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-28T13:38:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Sean Duffy, Americans for Limited Government, House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Nathan Mehrens, McLarty Associates, Albright Stonebridge Group, Thomas McLarty, Freedom of Information Act, Fred Hochberg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa27\"", "article_summary": "The Albright Stonebridge Group, meanwhile, is headed by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who also served during the Clinton administration.\n\u201cThere are legitimate questions on the relationships that were the subject of the FOIA request.\nBrowner, who is affiliated with the Albright Stonebridge Group, was a member of the Obama-Biden transition team\u2019s advisory board and was appointed to Ex-Im\u2019s advisory committee in 2013.\nThe House Financial Services Committee maintains jurisdiction over Ex-Im, and its chairman, Jeb Hensarling, is one of the bank\u2019s most ardent opponents.\nWhile the firm hasn\u2019t lobbied Congress since 2005, it does maintain strong ties with former and current Ex-Im officials."}
