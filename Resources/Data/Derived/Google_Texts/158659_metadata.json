We just didn\u2019t believe it was real.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to understand their skepticism. No sitting American president had ever starred in a comedy video that had the potential to go viral. And though the current leader of the free world seemed like a good sport, Galifianakis and Aukerman still wondered if he\u2019d put himself in the inane-question line of fire that\u2019s made Between Two Ferns such a droll Internet darling.Obama would end up bounding into the room with a hearty \u201cTwo Ferns!\u201d greeting and would go on to take part in what was a groundbreaking, six-plus-minute sketch that not only cemented his status as a witty, go-for-the-jugular guy but also promoted his signature project, the Affordable Care Act, as its sign-up deadline loomed.It was that risk\u2014and presidential payoff\u2014that earned Funny or Die the top honor, the Originator award, in Adweek's first Watch Awards competition, which celebrates the best work and talent in online video.Galifianakis and Aukerman had doubts long before arriving at the White House. Each step of the way, the pair thought a controlling, image-conscious administration might put the kibosh on their plans. \u201cWhen we sent Obama\u2019s team the sample jokes and outline, we figured it would be dead immediately. Let\u2019s face it: Zach doesn\u2019t treat the people in the Ferns chair with a lot of reverence,\u201d Aukerman points out.Lucky for them, Obama and his advisers considered the Ferns audience\u2014mostly young, Web-savvy consumers\u2014enough of a draw to set presidential protocol aside. They didn\u2019t mind a scenario wherein Galifianakis would ask about a presidential library in Kenya or call the commander in chief a nerd. It helped that Obama is quick on his feet and versed in pop culture, suggesting his own barbs about the critically drubbed Hangover 3 and gushing over Galifianakis\u2019 co-star Bradley Cooper. \u201cHe really seemed to enjoy poking Zach,\u201d Aukerman says. \u201cA lot of that was improv, and Obama came up with some really good lines.\u201dThe president took some ribbing over the disastrously buggy healthcare.gov rollout, with the host asking, \u201cWhy did you get the guy who created the Zune to create the healthcare site?\u201d It was all in service of mobilizing people in the final weeks before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s March 31 deadline\u2014and the video did just that. It amassed 10 million views in its first day, with 70 percent of viewers watching the entire clip. (Total views to date are well over 28 million.) Funny or Die quickly became the top referrer to healthcare.gov.\u00a0The Between Two Ferns project built on an existing relationship between the White House and Funny or Die, which had produced comedy videos with celebrities like Olivia Wilde, Jennifer Hudson and former NFL player Eddie George in support of Obamacare.Landing the president himself came about in part because \u201chis team knew they needed to try something different\u2014not a typical PSA\u2014and topical content is our sweet spot,\u201d says Mike Farah, Between Two Ferns executive producer and president of production at Funny or Die, who had seeded the concept with Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett.Along with driving massive traffic, the video kicked up a right-wing firestorm, with Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly and other conservatives criticizing the president\u2019s appearance. Stephen Colbert\u2019s cheeky recap of the tussle on The Colbert Report became must-see TV. All the attention only drove the numbers higher.\u201cIt couldn\u2019t just be a straight-up ad for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d as Aukerman sees it. \u201cIt had to be a funny video in keeping with the Ferns m.o. That\u2019s what we\u2019re most proud of.\u201dThe Originator AwardProgramming - GoldBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis With President Barack ObamaCompany: Funny or Die", "og": {"url": "http://www.adweek.com/news-gallery/advertising-branding/how-between-two-ferns-landed-obama-158496", "site_name": "AdWeek", "image": {"width": 150, "identifier": "http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/general-thumbnail/fea-programmatic-funnyordie-hed-2014.jpg", "height": 84}, "type": "article", "title": "How Between Two Ferns Landed Obama"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "fb": {"admins": 507972634, "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "keywords": "Advertising & Branding", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Adweek", "section": "Advertising & Branding"}, "viewport": "width=1028"}, "article_summary": "Isaac Awards: Enter NowLast chance to enter Adweek's invention awards is now May 30!"}
