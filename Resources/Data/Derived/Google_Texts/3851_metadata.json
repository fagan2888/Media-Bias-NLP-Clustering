Nearly 90 percent of those have renewed for 2015, according to information released by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOf the total sign-ups so far this year, 278,707 were renewals, and 143,577 were uninsured people who were enrolling for the first time.\n\n\u201cPennsylvania is in the top six states in terms of growth relative to other states,\u201d said Chris Sloan, a manager at Washington-based consulting firm Avalere Health. \u201cIt's doing pretty well.\u201d\n\nAn average of 71,000 Pennsylvanians a month have selected plans for the first time this year on Healthcare.gov, the online exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act. During last year's six-month open enrollment period, the average was about 53,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe thing to watch is the next few months is just because you renewed doesn't mean that you're going to keep paying,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThe numbers are a little inflated right now.\u201d\n\nLast year, about 16 percent of the 8 million people who signed up for coverage by the end of open enrollment were dropped because they didn't pay premiums, the final step in securing health insurance.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania numbers were not available. The region's two largest health insurers, UPMC Health Plan and Highmark Inc., declined to release their enrollment figures.\n\nThirty-one percent of sign-ups in Pennsylvania so far this year are younger than 35, the same percentage as last year. Insurers need young, healthy people to offset the higher cost of covering older adults, who tend to need more medical treatment.\n\nNationwide, 9.5 million people signed up for the first time or renewed their coverage through Healthcare.gov, the website for Pennsylvania and 36 other states, and 13 state-based exchanges, the Obama administration said.\n\nThe total surpasses the administration's estimate that at least 9.1 million would have coverage by the end of open enrollment on Feb. 15. But it's still too early to say if the goal has been met because people may not pay premiums.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said she's \u201cencouraged by the strong interest we've seen so far.\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in estimates released this week that it expects enrollment in the exchanges to average about 12 million people during 2015.\n\nBased on the rate of renewals and sign-ups this year, Sloan said he expects the final number of Americans with coverage through the federal and state exchanges to be closer to the CBO's estimate.\n\n\u201cIt's becoming clear that the way this growth is going, and if we see a bump up at the end, it's going to beat that estimate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed.
