Five Medicare beneficiaries filed a class-action lawsuit against the Obama administration for delaying their Medicare appeals.

The Center for Medicare Advocacy (CMA) said Tuesday it is suing the administration in the U.S. District Court in Connecticut after its clients had to wait longer than the statutory 90-day limit to resolve appeals.

“This lawsuit is necessary because of a broken Medicare appeals system,” said Gill Deford, CMA’s litigation director, in a statement. “We’re suing to fix it for the Plaintiffs and the thousands of beneficiaries in similar circumstances who are struggling to pay health care bills, or going without needed care while stuck in bureaucratic limbo.”

CMA says the Medicare Act requires Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) to issue decisions within 90 days after a request for a hearing. The current average wait time for a decision, however, is 489 days, CMA notes.

The Medicare appeals process has drawn attention on Capitol Hill, although lawmakers have focused on providers.

Lawmakers are concerned the current Medicare fraud appeals process treats healthcare providers as "guilty until proven innocent," and may be driving some of them out of business.

They note Medicare fraud cases have skyrocketed between 2012 and 2013, and could reach a million cases by the end of the fiscal year, with many stalled in the system.

Lawmakers say many of the cases brought before ALJs may be due to simple administrative issues but the delays are threatening reimbursements for healthcare providers and their patients.
