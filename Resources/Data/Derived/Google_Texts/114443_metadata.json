It was put together by an antiabortion organization called Americans United for Life, but it gained fame during a September congressional hearing, when Congressman Jason Chaffetz showed the chart to Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, Cecile Richards.\n\nAt first blush, the chart seems to show a dramatic increase in the number of abortions performed by Planned Parenthood since 2006, alongside a steep decline in cancer screenings. Put together, the result looks like a reversal of priorities, with abortions having become the more common procedure.\n\nBut look closer at the numbers on the chart, and you\u2019ll see that something is off. Even though the \u201cabortions\u201d line has crossed above the \u201ccancer screenings line,\u201d the numbers don\u2019t match. According to the chart \u2014 and Planned Parenthood\u2019s own records \u2014 Planned Parenthood performed 327,000 abortions in 2013 and nearly three times as many cancer screenings.\n\nClearly, something has gone terribly wrong with the y-axis, to let the purple line slip below the red one.\n\nHere\u2019s what the chart should look like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that mathematical order has been restored \u2014 so that higher numbers appear further up the chart \u2014 the picture is quite different. It\u2019s hard even to spot the increase in abortions, and while cancer screenings still seem to be on the decline, they clearly account for a larger part of what Planned Parenthood does.\n\nAs to why cancer screenings have been declining, there\u2019s a very good reason: They don\u2019t work \u2014 not as well as people thought back in 2006. Annual pap smears used to be considered best practice, but more recent guidelines suggest a longer waiting period between tests.\n\nEven now, with the axis straightened out, there\u2019s still a problem with this chart. After all, abortions and cancer screenings are hardly the only things Planned Parenthood does. It also provides contraception, STD testing, and prenatal services, just to name a few.\n\nIf the goal is really to figure out whether Planned Parenthood is devoting more of its resources to abortions, it makes better sense to compare the abortion numbers against the full basket of vital and largely uncontroversial medical services that Planned Parenthood provides. Like this.\n\nAdmittedly, this is not a captivating chart, particularly when compared to the eye-raising one that Chaffetz borrowed from Americans United for Life. But the reason it\u2019s dull is because there isn\u2019t much of a story. There haven\u2019t been any dramatic ups and down, or big reversals, in the priorities or practices at Planned Parenthood.\n\nThat\u2019s not meant to be definitive. If you are antiabortion, that Planned Parenthood continues to provide abortions at all is a horrific, ongoing tragedy.\n\nBut Chaffetz wasn\u2019t making that point. He was trying to expose a surge in abortion activity \u2014 a surge that existed only within his chart. And that\u2019s what makes it the most misleading chart of the year.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1813134095", "eomportal-id": 267556, "description": "A well-designed chart is a powerful tool, able to transform intimidating numbers into an intuitive, instantly comprehensible, even beautiful visual form. \nWhen things go awry, however, charts can be terribly misleading \u2014 even downright manipulative.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "A well-designed chart is a powerful tool, able to transform intimidating numbers into an intuitive, instantly comprehensible, even beautiful visual form. \nWhen things go awry, however, charts can be terribly misleading \u2014 even downright manipulative.", "title": "The most misleading chart of 2015 - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/12/29/the-most-misleading-chart/LVHD6M3GK8TFaHzlEc9tUJ/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/12/29/BostonGlobe.com/Politics/Images/chart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 07:13:27 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "2bd54c90-ae2d-11e5-b6ae-e4dce128fd8d"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementHere\u2019s my pick for the most misleading chart of 2015.\nAnd that\u2019s what makes it the most misleading chart of the year.\nAccording to the chart \u2014 and Planned Parenthood\u2019s own records \u2014 Planned Parenthood performed 327,000 abortions in 2013 and nearly three times as many cancer screenings.\nEven though the \u201cabortions\u201d line has crossed above the \u201ccancer screenings line,\u201d the numbers don\u2019t match.\nThere haven\u2019t been any dramatic ups and down, or big reversals, in the priorities or practices at Planned Parenthood."}
