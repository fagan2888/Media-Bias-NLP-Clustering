And if there is much media attention to the need for repayments, some people could be dissuaded from participating in the exchanges,\u201d they cautioned.\n\nAs tax time approaches, the word of forced repayment could fuel yet another round of public anger directed at Obamacare. This time, however, the anger could originate from Obamacare\u2019s own beneficiaries.\n\nTaxpayers should also be concerned, since estimates show the erroneous subsidy payments could cost the government up to $4.7 billion in 2014 alone.\n\nAnd because the repayments are \u201ccapped,\u201d the federal government will only be able to recover a small portion of the erroneously awarded subsidies.\n\nStill, workers who receive income that\u2019s 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty line could face difficult repayments ranging from $600 to $2,500.\n\nThe California researchers admitted even a $2,500 repayment could be devastating to a couple.\n\n\u201cA repayment requirement of $2,500 could be a financial shock to a family of two earning $50,000 a year,\u201d they stated.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, warned in an interview with TheDC that many Obamacare enrollees will be upset as April 15 approaches.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of dismay when they get to tax filing season,\u201d he told TheDC in an interview.\n\nHoltz-Eakin added it\u2019s unlikely the government will recover or \u201crecapture\u201d all the wrongly-issued subsidies.\n\nThe administration \u201ccould simply say enforcing the recapture of too generous subsidies is too hard and effectively say, \u2018we\u2019re not going to get the money back.\u2019 And the taxpayer loses,\u201d he says.\n\nThe former CBO chief cited the federal government\u2019s poor experience with a simpler, but comparable program called the Earned Income Tax Credit, under which as many as 25 percent of the filings were erroneous.\n\n\u201cThis is a much more complicated system,\u201d he said.\n\nCBO estimates Obamacare subsidies to be $17 billion in 2014. A 25 percent error rate could cost the government $4.7 billion.\n\nTax experts say the problem began when the government originally asked Obamacare applicants who sought government subsidies to use two-year-old income data to establish their eligibility.\n\nObamacare policyholders in 2014 received subsidies based on their 2012 household income. Now they will have to reconcile the subsidies with their real 2014 earnings, which they report this year.\n\nIf they earned more income in 2014 than they originally stated in their 2012 tax returns, they will be ineligible for a portion or all of the subsidies.\n\nThose Obamacare enrollees, consequently, will have to repay the money this year with their 2014 income tax return.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "rpollock", "description": "'There\u2019s going to be a lot of dismay when they get to tax filing season'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Anyone who receives Obamacare subsidies could be in for a rude awakening this tax season.
