Both Pat McCrory, the governor of North Carolina, and Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney General, grew up partly in Greensboro, a site of anti-segregation sit-ins in 1960, and Lynch recalled that history by comparing H.B. 2 to Jim Crow laws. \u201cLet us reflect on the obvious but often neglected lesson that state-sanctioned discrimination never looks good in hindsight,\u201d she said, as she announced that the Department of Justice is suing North Carolina, claiming that H.B. 2 violates federal laws forbidding sex discrimination.\n\nEarlier that day, McCrory\u2019s office had filed its own federal lawsuit, which attempted to protect the state from federal anti-discrimination action against H.B. 2. \u201cNorth Carolina does not treat transgender employees differently,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cAll state employees are required to use the bathroom and changing facilities assigned to persons of their same biological sex, regardless of gender identity, or transgendered status.\u201d Such bland assertions of neutrality have an infamous place in the law. Before the Supreme Court established a right to same-sex marriage, in 2015, North Carolina forbade gay and straight alike to wed members of the same sex. Before the Court invalidated laws against racial intermarriage, in 1967\u2019s Loving v. Virginia, the state forbade both black and white people to marry someone of the other race. All these laws were defended on the grounds that they treated everyone alike. So, for that matter, were the original Jim Crow segregation laws. In 1896, upholding separate-but-equal accommodations, the Supreme Court held that, if \u201cthe enforced separation of the races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority,\u201d this was \u201csolely because the colored race chooses to put that construction on it.\u201d\n\nMcCrory\u2019s suit looks more like political theatre than a serious attempt to preserve H.B. 2. On April 19th, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes North Carolina, adopted the Obama Administration\u2019s interpretation of federal sex-discrimination law to invalidate a local school-board policy that assigned students to bathrooms by \u201cbiological genders.\u201d The court accepted the federal government\u2019s argument that the prohibition on sex discrimination in Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and that \u201cbiological\u201d bathroom assignments are just this sort of discrimination. (The Fourth Circuit reported that, in public hearings on school-bathroom assignments, the plaintiff in the case, a transgender boy, had been called a \u201cfreak\u201d and \u201ccompared to a person who thinks he is a \u2018dog\u2019 and wants to urinate on fire hydrants.\u201d)\n\nThat McCrory would seek out this wrong-side-of-history position reveals a lot about the fractured and desperate state of the Republican Party. The governor took office, in 2013, as the consummate country-club Republican. He had spent fourteen years as the mayor of Charlotte, a banking capital, where he presided over robust growth and\u2014unusual in the South\u2014the construction of a light-rail system. He was a candidate in the \u201cNew South\u201d tradition, a political manner that is also a development strategy. In the sixties, as other parts of the white South dug in against desegregation, North Carolina\u2019s politicians found a different formula: accept the national consensus on civil rights and attract employers with low wages, weak unions, and business-friendly laws. The state\u2019s population more than doubled between 1960 and 2010, as a formerly rural, agricultural state developed national centers of technology and finance. The previous New South governors were Democrats, but many saw McCrory as their natural successor in a state that narrowly supported Barack Obama in 2008 but in 2010 handed control of the legislature to Republicans for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nSince taking office, McCrory has mostly been back on his heels as a Tea Party legislature, installed with decisive support from the activist donor Art Pope (whom Jane Mayer wrote about in 2011), has set the state\u2019s agenda. McCrory has signed laws restricting abortion access, cutting back on early voting and requiring voter identification, slashing unemployment benefits, and repealing the state\u2019s Racial Justice Act, which commuted the death penalty for people sentenced in racially inequitable jurisdictions. North Carolina is one of nineteen states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (and the fourth-largest, after Texas, Florida, and Georgia). The advocacy group Families USA estimates that five hundred and ninety-three thousand North Carolina residents lack health insurance because of the state\u2019s refusal.\n\nThe Tea Party has shared McCrory\u2019s deregulatory, tax-cutting economic agenda, but it has led with culture-war issues. The year McCrory won the governorship, the legislature put forward a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, which passed with sixty per cent of the vote. This blend of tactics has defined most state-level Republican parties during the Obama years, when the Republicans took power in statehouses across the country, and McCrory seems to have made his peace with it. Polls showed him lagging in a tight re\u00eblection race when he called North Carolina\u2019s part-time legislature into emergency session in late March. Both houses passed H.B. 2 on March 23rd, and McCrory signed it that night. The only local anti-discrimination statute that it overrode was one passed a month before in Charlotte, where McCrory had served seven terms as mayor.\n\nNow the New South elements of McCrory\u2019s governing style are falling to pieces. H.B. 2 may have seemed an ordinary measure of culture-war politics when the governor signed it, but the consensus position on L.G.B.T.Q. rights has changed so fast that it may secure his place as the Orval Faubus of public bathrooms. McCrory\u2019s Democratic opponent, Roy Cooper, the state\u2019s attorney general, who has announced that his office will not defend H.B. 2 against legal challenge, has led McCrory in every poll since the law was passed. Since H.B. 2 became law, PayPal and Deutsche Bank have scrapped expansion plans for North Carolina, the N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. have suggested that they may not hold future events in the state, and a caravan of entertainers have cancelled shows, including Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil. New South governors measure themselves by the investments they attract. When the cultural divisiveness of Tea Party politics drives out business and entertainment, it becomes New South kryptonite.\n\nMcCrory\u2019s economic policy may also be vulnerable in the age of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Along with laying to waste transgender rights, H.B. 2 forbids local governments from passing their own minimum wages or other laws protecting workers. This was recently uncontroversial state Republican policy, but Trump won the Republican primary on March 15th, a week before McCrory signed H.B. 2, with a populist campaign that has angered and alienated country-club economic free-marketers\u2014and exposed the thinness of their rank-and file support. After losing heavily evangelical North Carolina to Trump, Ted Cruz seized on the transgender bathroom issue in his last stand, the Indiana primary, where he hammered Trump for saying that people should use whatever bathroom they consider \u201cappropriate.\u201d Trump shrugged, hammered Cruz on trade agreements, and drove him from the race.\n\nTrump\u2019s version of the Republican Party, at least as he has expressed it in the primaries, liquidates both sides of McCrory\u2019s strategy. On the cultural front, it turns away from personal and religious morality to stir up an us-versus-them energy with nationalist xenophobia. Economically, it replaces a blandly relentless laissez-faire program with aggrieved attacks on incompetent \u00e9lites\u2014sometimes in the name of tax cuts, sometimes in support of trade protectionism, universal health care, and rebuilding crumbling infrastructure. Trump\u2019s primary campaign and Barack Obama\u2019s Administration, in very different ways, have left Pat McCrory\u2019s Republicanism with hardly any place to stand.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what will replace it. Roy Cooper seems poised to retake the New South strategy for the Democrats, aligning himself with the national majority on civil rights while flogging H.B. 2 for discouraging investment. In interviews, McCrory seems miffed that so many people care so much. He has blamed \u201cthe political left\u201d for confronting him with \u201can issue no one was talking about,\u201d and has conceded, with a baffled air, \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatic change in society norms in a very, very short period of time.\u201d He has also grabbed at a Trump theme: \u201cThis political correctness is gone amok.\u201d The haplessness is not just his: a politician who followed established scripts, he has joined much of his party in groping for lines now that the script is gone.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "Jedediah Purdy on North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory\u2019s battle against the federal government over House Bill 2 and transgender rights.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "The North Carolina governor\u2019s wrong-side-of-history position on H.B. 2 reveals a lot about the fractured and desperate state of the Republican Party.", "title": "Transgender Rights and the End of the New South", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Purdy-North-CarolinaGovernorPatMcCroryTransgenderRights-1200x630-1462902308.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2016-05-11T12:54:10-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-north-carolina-governor-pat-mccrory-stumbled-on-transgender-rights", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The North Carolina governor\u2019s wrong-side-of-history position on H.B. 2 reveals a lot about the fractured and desperate state of the Republican Party.", "creator": "@newyorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Purdy-North-CarolinaGovernorPatMcCroryTransgenderRights-1200x630-1462902308.jpg", "title": "Transgender Rights and the End of the New South", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3201639\",\"title_alt\":\"Transgender Rights and the End of the New South\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Purdy-North-CarolinaGovernorPatMcCroryTransgenderRights-728x375-1462902300.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "transgender rights", "published_time": "2016-05-10T14:54:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T12:54:10-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3201639, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "bathroom bill, house bill 2, North Carolina, Pat McCrory, transgender rights"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNorth Carolina does not treat transgender employees differently,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nBefore the Supreme Court established a right to same-sex marriage, in 2015, North Carolina forbade gay and straight alike to wed members of the same sex.\n2 became law, PayPal and Deutsche Bank have scrapped expansion plans for North Carolina, the N.B.A.\nRoy Cooper seems poised to retake the New South strategy for the Democrats, aligning himself with the national majority on civil rights while flogging H.B.\nAlong with laying to waste transgender rights, H.B."}
