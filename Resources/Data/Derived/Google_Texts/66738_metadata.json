Lord Acton was referring to popes and kings in this instance, but it is unsurprising that these words still have veracity in the twenty-first century, as men are still men, and fallible by nature.\n\nThe same lure of easy, ill-gotten goods for those in power exists to this very day, and the US Congress is no exception. In yet another bone-headed, selfish move, they recently voted to repeal portions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which required members of that governing body to disclose their financial transactions online \u2014 something which never occurred anyway, with various stoppages before the repeal.\n\nThis is the same legislative body, mind you, which creates laws that govern how the very institutions they regulate may act. So they are more than likely to have information to which the average investor is not privy. It is akin to the sheep dog colluding with the wolves to cull the sheep to their own benefit.\n\nEven President Barack Obama has said \u201cThe idea that everybody plays by the same rules is one of our most cherished American values. It\u2019s the notion that the powerful shouldn\u2019t get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else, and if we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and to our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials \u2014 especially at a time when there is a deficit of trust between this city and the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nHis tired adage of \u201cnational security\u201d makes him no less of a hypocrite as he signed the STOCK Act\u2019s repeal. Seriously, who believes this \u201ccrying wolf\u201d tale any longer?\n\nThis is \u201cpar for the course\u201d when it comes to Congress, the same institution that exempted itself from the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This required rectification with the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, but even that law only applied to past congressional exemptions. One naturally infers that Congress constantly attempts to exclude itself from the very laws it imposes upon the citizenry of the United States, with the hope that some, if not all, of these exemptions will pass unnoticed.\n\nAs noted, the reporting exemptions in the STOCK Act are not unprecedented, nor are they unique. Congress and President Obama have recently colluded to exempt themselves from the very controversial \u201cObamacare\u201d or Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010. Draconian, profit-losing burdens upon the private sector are so much easier to pass when those in Washington, D.C., are exempted from the pain.\n\nIt is unfortunate that individuals such as Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) must even wage a battle to have Congress participate in the very exchanges they created for the peasants . . . I mean, \u201cconstituents\u201d \u2014 but at least the public has a champion against such hypocrisy still. Though, if history is any guide, an appeal will likely take years, if not decades, to congeal into reality.\n\nAll the while, the people suffer the consequences to which Congress has made itself immune. If Congress feels the necessity to exempt itself from a particular piece of legislation, it should never vote to enact the legislation to start with.
