Video: The most awkward moment in “Jeopardy” history?

A leftover to cleanse the palate at the end of a long week. I’m putting the question mark in the headline just to be safe, but c’mon. How many moments more awkward than this can there be in the “Jeopardy” archives? All that’s missing is Darrell Hammond as Sean Connery guffawing and calling Trebek “fancy.” Good for the contestant, though, for daringly refusing to observe the “don’t rhetorically punch the host in the face when he’s trying to make chitchat” code. Refuse to live by society’s rules, bro.

What we really need now is OK Cupid leading a “fire Trebek” movement. We can make this world a better place, you and I, one ruthless purging at a time.
