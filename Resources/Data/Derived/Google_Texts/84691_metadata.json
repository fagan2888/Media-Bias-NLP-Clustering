The measure would have given the state\u2019s insurance commissioner the authority to reject excessive rate hikes in health insurance sold on the individual and small-business markets.\n\nConsumers who had seen their premiums go up by double digits year after year clung to Prop. 45 as the savior.\n\n\u201cI felt like a frog in hot water that got hotter and hotter until it was boiling,\u201d says Josh Libresco, a market researcher who has bought health insurance for his family on the individual market for 20 years.\n\nBut consumer voices like this were overwhelmed in the conversation around Prop. 45 by health insurance companies, including Kaiser and Blue Cross Blue Shield, which raised $43.6 million to defeat the measure. The proponents raised just $2.5 million.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance companies have a tremendous economic stake in the outcome,\u201d says Daniel G. Newman, president and co-founder of MapLight, a nonpartisan research organization that tracks the influence of money on politics. \u201cThere\u2019s also billions of dollars at stake for health care consumers, but consumers don\u2019t have millions collectively to put in favor of a ballot measure.\u201d\n\nThe No side was further bolstered by concerns raised by Covered California, the state agency tasked with implementing the Affordable Care Act in California. Board members and staff discussed various complications that could arise from Prop. 45 and complicate Covered California\u2019s ability to carry out its mission, pitting the agency against the current commissioner, Dave Jones, in an unusual dispute between allies.\n\nThe agency negotiates rates with insurers directly, and feared that a challenge to those rates under Prop. 45 could undo that work, delay final rates beyond federal deadlines or even cause insurers to withdraw plans from the state marketplace.\n\nInsurance companies made Covered California an unlikely bedfellow, weaving its concerns into the industry\u2019s ad campaign and urging people to vote no on Prop. 45 to \u201cprotect the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe influence of that campaign appears to have worked with voters. A poll from the middle of the summer showed 69 percent of likely voters favored Prop. 45 and giving the commissioner more power to control health insurance rates.\n\nBy election night, that support slipped to just about 40 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Initiative would give state\u2019s elected insurance commissioner more power over health insurance plans.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Prop. 45 Defeated by Health Insurance Industry\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/11\\/05\\/prop-45-attacked-by-health-insurance-industry\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-05 00:47:17\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-05 00:50:26\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22342,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Proposition 45\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/11\\/5161_transform.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Initiative would give state\u2019s elected insurance commissioner more power over health insurance plans.", "title": "Prop. 45 Defeated by Health Insurance Industry", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/11/05/prop-45-attacked-by-health-insurance-industry/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/11/5161_transform.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "proposition 45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb78\"", "article_summary": "The measure would have given the state\u2019s insurance commissioner the authority to reject excessive rate hikes in health insurance sold on the individual and small-business markets.\n45 by health insurance companies, including Kaiser and Blue Cross Blue Shield, which raised $43.6 million to defeat the measure.\n45 and giving the commissioner more power to control health insurance rates.\n\u201cHealth insurance companies have a tremendous economic stake in the outcome,\u201d says Daniel G.
