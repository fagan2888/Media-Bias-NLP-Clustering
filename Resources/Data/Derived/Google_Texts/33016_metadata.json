Burwell case will answer whether millions of people will keep their insurance subsidies, but it\u2019s likely that no patient in America can answer the simple question, \u201cIs my doctor good?\u201d Facing a major surgery, wouldn\u2019t you want to know if you are most likely to get better in the care of this doctor or if you should go to a different one? Even people inside healthcare can\u2019t answer that question. Right now, almost no doctor can answer the simple question, \u201cAre you good?\u201d\n\nExceptions exist. Cardiac surgeons, some orthopedists and clinicians who treat people with cystic fibrosis often track and compare their patients\u2019 outcomes. But the lack of doctor data is particularly odd given easy availability of information about services. TravelAdvisor.com lists the best hotel in Myitkina, Burma and anyone with a smartphone can find the best barbeque joint within a mile. But doctors? Life-or-death healthcare? That\u2019s different.\n\nAngie\u2019s List carries reviews of doctors. \u201cOrthopedics \u2013 foot and ankle\u201d is lodged between \u201coriental rugs\u201d and \u201cpainting.\u201d Other sites rank doctors with grades, star ratings and \u201cbest of\u201c lists. But none can answer the simple but very specific question, \u201cIs my doctor good at treating what is wrong with me right now?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a question worth asking. In 2004, 100 percent of the patients who received heart transplants at the two leading American centers survived for at least a year. All six of the patients at the worst center died within a year. Needing a heart transplant, you\u2019d want to know that you weren\u2019t number seven.\n\nDoctors should know if they are good at what they do. Hanging on their walls, their diplomas evidence that they are long-educated and well-credentialed. But training and results are different, even for \u201cspecialists.\u201d An orthopedic surgeon who does great knee replacements isn\u2019t necessarily a good shoulder surgeon. Doctors, like athletes, have limitations. Michael Jordan\u2019s basketball prowess was nowhere to be seen when he faced even minor-league baseball pitchers. Making it to the pros in two sports is rare. Likewise, a doctor will be better at some medical arts and worse at others.\n\nResults beyond life and death matter, too. Functional outcomes \u2013 what patients are able to do as a result of their care \u2013 have lifelong consequences. In Hamburg, Germany, patients who have prostate surgery at the Martini Clinic suffer post-surgical rates of impotence and incontinence one-fifth as often as patients whose surgery was at the average German hospital. Those impressive results reflect two decades of committed effort measuring the results of surgery and continually improving care based on what was learned.\n\nIt\u2019s true that measurement will require new systems and impose new costs. Knowing one\u2019s skill level takes effort and expense. But patients should be able to get outcome data for every condition a doctor treats, and they shouldn\u2019t have to rely only on the Internet\u2019s anecdotes. Physicians and hospitals that already track this information do so efficiently, with data analysts and automated systems that keep the burden off of physicians. They also risk-adjust it in sophisticated ways to ensure its fairness and accuracy.\n\nFacts are friendly. Outcome data allows consumers to find the best services and prompts underperformers to improve. In the US, airlines change processes in response to their on-time arrival and lost baggage records. Faced with evidence of subpar outcomes, some doctors may choose to seek additional training or to concentrate in other areas of medicine where their results are better.\n\nDoctors have an ethical obligation to measure and report their results, but it\u2019s an obligation honored mostly in the breach. The leading physicians\u2019 ethics manual describes the \u201cspecial obligation for the physician to serve the patient\u2019s interest\u201d and to \u201cforthrightly help patients make informed choices among all appropriate care options.\u201d (Italics added.) A patient\u2019s informed choice depends on knowing whether the doctor is good at treating the patient\u2019s specific condition. Beyond the patient, how can a doctor refer a patient to another physician or recommend treating a patient without knowing his or her own skill level as well as that of other physicians.\n\nNo physician can know the outcome every patient will achieve. Yet every physician can track how well their patients do as a result of care and how their patients\u2019 outcomes compare to those achieved by other doctors. In more complex cases, teams of caregivers should track and report their outcomes together. MD Anderson Cancer Center reports its teams\u2019 outcomes in treating head and neck cancer, comparing them to others where there are national baselines and comparing against its own prior results when external comparators don\u2019t exist.\n\nHealthcare exists for patients. They deserve to know what they can expect from their care. U.S. doctors need to step up and answer the simple question, \u201cAre you good?\u201d\n\nWallace is a visiting professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and a Public Voices Fellow.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Outcome data allows consumers to find the best services and prompts underperformers to improve.", "description": "Outcome data allows consumers to find the best services and prompts underperformers to improve.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Outcome data allows consumers to find the best services and prompts underperformers to improve.", "title": "How good is your doctor?", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/245883-how-good-is-your-doctor", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/245883-how-good-is-your-doctor", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-24T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Scott Wallace", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-24T13:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/245883-how-good-is-your-doctor", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Outcome data allows consumers to find the best services and prompts underperformers to improve.", "card": "summary", "title": "How good is your doctor?"}, "dcterms.title": "How good is your doctor?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc66\"", "article_summary": "A patient\u2019s informed choice depends on knowing whether the doctor is good at treating the patient\u2019s specific condition.\nBut none can answer the simple but very specific question, \u201cIs my doctor good at treating what is wrong with me right now?\u201dIt\u2019s a question worth asking.\nCardiac surgeons, some orthopedists and clinicians who treat people with cystic fibrosis often track and compare their patients\u2019 outcomes.\nRight now, almost no doctor can answer the simple question, \u201cAre you good?\u201dExceptions exist.\nBut the lack of doctor data is particularly odd given easy availability of information about services."}
