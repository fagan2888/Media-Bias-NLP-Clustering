Bannon and used immigration as an example of an issue where an Attorney General office must protect its state.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue,\u201d Landry said of immigration. Landry said he believes people around the country are recognizing one of the last stands Americans have in the country to fight back against government overreach and the abuse in this country is the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThey are our last defense,\u201d Landry stressed. \u201cI believe that those elected officials that swear to [uphold] the Constitution, that then it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d to engage in sanctuary city regulations around the country.\n\n\u201cThey are the defender of the state. They are the defenders of the Tenth Amendment,\u201d he said, saying it\u2019s the Attorneys General that have been fighting religious issues and states rights.\n\n\u201cWe sit in the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,\u201d Landry said, adding it\u2019s one of the most conservative courts in the country, which is an advantage for Louisiana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go on the offensive,\u201d Landry said, adding, \u201cplaying defense isn\u2019t getting us places. It\u2019s time we go on offense\u201d and take it to those people who want to restrict religious liberties.\n\nLandry said, \u201cOur country when it was founded, the foundation of it is Judeo Christian principles\u201d and when the people adhere to those principles, \u201cour communities are safer\u201d and the country is more peaceful.\n\nHe explained that when the establishment in Washington pushed him out of Congress, he left as the most conservative member of the 112th class, and was a member that was vocal about the problems former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) was causing.\n\nLandry said that his lost congressional seat was an opportunity to take out a liberal Attorney General in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cMy opponent went to the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court [during the fight against Obamacare]\u2026and then commented on a blog [that] he didn\u2019t think Obamacare went far enough,\u201d suggesting he believes the government should have more control, according to Landry. \u201cThe way he is running the current Attorney General office is fiscally unsound.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it be Obamacare, or whether it would be other regulatory matters that are affecting us in the state of Louisiana \u2013 he hasn\u2019t led, he\u2019s just followed,\u201d Landry said of his opponent, but vowed that if he was elected as the Attorney General, he will lead.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor conservatives out there, here\u2019s what they have to rememeber, the establishment did a great job of kicking me out of D.C.\u201d but the people have an opportunity in Lousiana to help put him in the Attorney General\u2019s seat.\n\nLandry stressed that when people put God into their lives, life gets much much better.\n\n\u201cThere really is only one conservative in this race,\u201d Landry challenged, saying he is running for Attorney General because he wants to take out \u201ca 40 year Democrat who switched to the Republican Party just three years ago\u201d to fool Republicans in the state of Louisiana.\n\nElection day between Landry is less than ten days away, on November 21.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Election day between Landry and his opponent is less than ten days away on November 21st.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Election day between Landry and his opponent is less than ten days away on November 21st.", "title": "Jeff Landry: Attorneys General are America's 'Last Defense' Against Government Overreach, Protect 10th Amendment - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Landry-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-11-13T07:05:54-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/13/jeff-landry-attorney-generals-americas-last-defense-government-overreach-protect-10th-amendment/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Election day between Landry and his opponent is less than ten days away on November 21st.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Landry-AP.jpg", "title": "Jeff Landry: Attorneys General are America's 'Last Defense' Against Government Overreach, Protect 10th Amendment - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "attorney general, Jeff Landry, Louisiana,Big Government, Immigration,Landry", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-13T06:27:26-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T07:05:54-07:00", "tag": "Louisiana", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e61\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey are our last defense,\u201d Landry stressed.\nLandry said that his lost congressional seat was an opportunity to take out a liberal Attorney General in Louisiana.\nThey are the defenders of the Tenth Amendment,\u201d he said, saying it\u2019s the Attorneys General that have been fighting religious issues and states rights.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go on the offensive,\u201d Landry said, adding, \u201cplaying defense isn\u2019t getting us places.\nCircuit Court of Appeals,\u201d Landry said, adding it\u2019s one of the most conservative courts in the country, which is an advantage for Louisiana."}
