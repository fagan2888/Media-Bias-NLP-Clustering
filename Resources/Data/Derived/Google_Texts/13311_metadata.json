It is quite conceivable that we will hit the $600,000 mark if sales activity continues.\u201d\n\nThe new forecasts would mean the median house price in Perth was climbing by about $1200 a week.\n\nThe Barnett Government\u2019s Midyear Financial Projections Statements show the median house price in Perth last year was up $41,000 over 2012. Mr Airey said the \u201cdoom and gloom merchants\u2019\u2019 who were predicting Australia was about to enter a property bubble did not understand WA.\n\nHe said WA continued to be a magnet for overseas buyers, who were keen to live or invest in Australia\u2019s boom state.\n\nGovernment projections show 750 people a week will move to Perth this financial year, more than 60 per cent of them from overseas.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of commentary on whether Australia is about to enter \u2013 or is maybe already in \u2013 a property bubble,\u201d Mr Airey said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is an accurate prediction and is generally made by overseas economists who have little or no on-the-ground experience at the coal face of the property market.\n\n\u201cAustralia has a strong economy and a very strong banking and financing system.\n\n\u201cJust because property \u00adprices rise quickly doesn\u2019t mean we are in a bubble.\n\n\u201cOverseas buyers are rushing here. That\u2019s a big factor that pushes prices up as demand overwhelms supply.\u201d\n\nBut the new forecasts have frightened social groups that fear home ownership in Perth is fast becoming out of reach for average West Australians.\n\nUnitingCare West chief executive Sue Ash said 40 per cent of the community earned less than $50,000 a year.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely obvious that people on those incomes or less can\u2019t afford to buy a house,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t even pay rent, let alone save money for a deposit.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SpagnoloJoe", "article_metadata": {"description": "PERTH&#8217;S median house price is forecast to hit $600,000 by the end of the year, WA&#8217;s peak real estate body predicts.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "PerthNow", "description": "PERTH&#8217;S median house price is forecast to hit $600,000 by the end of the year, WA&#8217;s peak real estate body predicts.", "title": "Real estate experts predict record $600,000 median house price for Perth", "url": "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/real-estate-experts-predict-record-600000-median-house-price-for-perth/story-fnhocxo3-1226828212706", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/212677-82055276-95e9-11e3-831f-628faee552fc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/02/15/1226828/212677-82055276-95e9-11e3-831f-628faee552fc.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@perthnow", "id": "@perthnow"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135447496484311}, "articleid": 1226828212706, "keywords": "real estate body, peak real estate, interest rates, Australian capital cities, price bracket, property bubble, overseas buyers, property market, gloom merchants, home price expectations, Real estate experts, property prices rise, median house prices, strapped State Government, pushes prices, chief executive officer, Government projections, gang busters, boom state, Sue Ash, median house, median house price, real estate, capital cities, ,Perth,Western Australia,Australia, ,,,Australia, State Government, Australian Bureau of Statistic, Estate Institute of WA, David Airey", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Feb 15 20:53:36 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Feb 15 20:53:36 EST 2014", "author": "JOE SPAGNOLO Political Editor"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9eea\"", "article_summary": "PERTH\u2019S median house price is forecast to hit $600,000 by the end of the year, WA\u2019s peak real estate body predicts.\nThe Barnett Government\u2019s Midyear Financial Projections Statements show the median house price in Perth last year was up $41,000 over 2012.\nIt would give Perth the second-highest median house price for an Australian city \u2013 behind Sydney\u2019s $655,000.\nIt is quite conceivable that we will hit the $600,000 mark if sales activity continues.\u201dThe new forecasts would mean the median house price in Perth was climbing by about $1200 a week.\n\u201cPerth had a strong year in 2013 with 9 per cent growth in the median residential price to $545,000,\u2019\u2019 Mr Airey said."}
