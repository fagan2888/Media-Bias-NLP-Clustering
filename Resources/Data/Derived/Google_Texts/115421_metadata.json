She shared her frustration over webcam.\n\n\u201cIt tells me I have an account and here are your plans, and then I look and there are no plans,\u201d Stigall said.\n\nCBS 2 tested out the New York and New Jersey marketplace websites, but hit virtual walls of error messages just registering.\n\nGovernment officials have admitted the site is a work in progress.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop improving HealthCare.gov until its doors are wide open,\u201d a U.S. Health and Human Services representative said in a statement.\n\nLuke Chung\u2019s company has built online databases for nearly 30 years. He called the website design \u201cflawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even ready for beta testing from my book,\u201d Chung said. \u201cI would be ashamed and embarrassed if my organization delivered something like that.\u201d\n\nCBS 2 checked and found government records showed the federal government dished out nearly $400 million in contracts to 55 contractors on the exchange website and data hub \u2014 including the exchange site for New Jersey.\n\nWith that hefty price tag, what\u2019s up with all the problems?\n\nCBS 2 obtained a June 2013 Government Accountability Office report. Citing work still needed to be done at the time and \u201cpushing it close\u201d deadlines- it warned of \u201cpotential for implementation challenges going forward.\u201d\n\nPeople such as Stigall said they are hitting just such challenges.\n\n\u201cIt makes me a little unsettled as to how this is all going to work out,\u201d Stigall said.\n\nA separate contractor put together the New York State Exchange website. CBS 2 was not able to determine the price tag,\n\nOverall, industry experts have admitted HealthCare.gov was no easy undertaking.\n\nA review by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group, found contractors that were awarded bids on the project were actually better-known for things such as military tanks and ammunition.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two weeks after the Affordable Care Act online marketplace opened, many people have reported continued trouble logging onto HealthCare.gov.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/14/expert-obamacare-website-is-not-even-ready-for-beta-testing/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/health2.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/health2.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Two weeks after the Affordable Care Act online marketplace opened, many people have reported continued trouble logging onto HealthCare.gov.", "title": "Expert: Obamacare Website Is 'Not Even Ready For Beta Testing'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/health2.jpg?w=625", "description": "Two weeks after the Affordable Care Act online marketplace opened, many people have reported continued trouble logging onto HealthCare.gov.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Expert: Obamacare Website Is 'Not Even Ready For Beta Testing'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "health, local, news, nj news, ny news, politics, radio.com - news, seen on cbs2, syndicated local, syndication, watch + listen, affordable care act, data hubs, don champion, exchanges, government accountability office, healthcare.gov, luke chung, new jersey, new york, obamacare, shirley stegall, sunlight foundation, website", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, data hubs, don champion, exchanges, government accountability office, healthcare.gov, luke chung, new jersey, new york, obamacare, shirley stegall, sunlight foundation, website"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2401\"", "article_summary": "A separate contractor put together the New York State Exchange website.\n\u201cIt tells me I have an account and here are your plans, and then I look and there are no plans,\u201d Stigall said.\nHe called the website design \u201cflawed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not even ready for beta testing from my book,\u201d Chung said.\nCBS 2 tested out the New York and New Jersey marketplace websites, but hit virtual walls of error messages just registering.\nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 Two weeks after the Affordable Care Act online marketplace opened, many people have reported continued trouble logging onto HealthCare.gov."}
