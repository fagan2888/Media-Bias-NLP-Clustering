Ron Johnson (R-WI)\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) appeared on NewsMax TV on Wednesday morning to complain about the \u201ccoercive\u201d and \u201cvery destructive\u201d consequences of the Affordable Care Act on Wisconsin residents.\n\nResponding to a question about premium increases under the law, Johnson related his own experiences with voters. \u201cI\u2019m driving around Wisconsin, I\u2019m talking to business owners and I\u2019m talking to health care providers and insurance agents as well and they\u2019re seeing that same kind of range [of premium increases for 2015], anywhere from 16 to 60 percent,\u201d he explained. \u201cKind of with an average of around 30 percent here just anecdotally in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s anecdotes appear to be outliers at best and fabrications at worst. Actual rate filings submitted to the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) just last month show that the average premiums in health care plans offered through the law\u2019s federal exchange will increase by an average of just 3 percent in 2015, with two insurers registering decreases for the coming year.\n\nMedica Health Plans of Wisconsin will drop premiums by an average of 17 percent and Molina Healthcare of Wisconsin will decrease its premiums by an average of 11 percent.\n\n\u201cWe priced for the first year really expecting a sicker population to enroll,\u201d Molin senior vice president Lisa Rubino explained in an interview with the Milwaukee Business Journal. \u201cGoing into the second year, we expect the exchange to work better and a healthier population due to penalties increasing.\u201d It will also become more competitive as two new insurance carriers, including UnitedHealthcare \u2014 the carrier with the highest market share among health insurers in Wisconsin \u2014 enter the market.\n\nThe average rate of change is \u201ccalculated by using a weighted average based on a geographic distribution of plans\u201d and doesn\u2019t necessarily represent the actual premium consumers will pay. But since that average is substantially lower than Johnson\u2019s predictions and most enrollees will be shielded from the increase by federal subsidies, the charge seems particularly misleading. Multiple inquires for clarification from Johnson\u2019s office went unanswered.\n\nIn 2014, 139,815 Wisconsin residents enrolled in the federally-run exchange, 91 percent of whom qualified for subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Johnson's anecdotes appear to be outliers at best and fabrications at worst.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Johnson's anecdotes appear to be outliers at best and fabrications at worst.", "title": "Senator Botches Key Obamacare Stat By 900 Percent", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/29/3585892/senator-dramatically-inflates-obamacare-premium-increases/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ron-Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johnson's anecdotes appear to be outliers at best and fabrications at worst.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ron-Johnson-321x214.jpg", "title": "Senator Botches Key Obamacare Stat By 900 Percent", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ron-Johnson.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ron-Johnson.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-29T10:44:15+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc7a\"", "article_summary": "Health Senator Botches Key Obamacare Stat By 900 Percent CREDIT: AP Sen.
