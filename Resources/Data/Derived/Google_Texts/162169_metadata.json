The other America wants no truck with Obamacare, and so must find another way to provide health care for those who can\u2019t afford it.\n\nThat\u2019s what made last week\u2019s report by the Rural Hospital Stabilization Committee so important. This is Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s second major effort at salvaging rural Georgia\u2019s health care safety net. A measure backed by the governor last year, to allow some rural hospitals to devolve into standalone emergency rooms, has proven ineffective.\n\n\u201cGeorgia has virtually no rural hospitals in counties capable of supporting an [emergency room] without outside subsidies,\u201d the study committee noted in its opening paragraphs.\n\nFour rural hospitals have closed in recent months, the report noted. Fifteen are considered \u201cfinancially fragile,\u201d and six are \u201coperating on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nThe report issued by Deal\u2019s committee made no mention of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. That topic is off-limits, given the climate in the state Capitol.\n\nInstead, the hospital rescue committee put its faith in the Internet. With a $3 million pilot program, \u201ctele-medicine\u201d links will be established between four hospital \u201chubs\u201d with emergency rooms and the surviving \u201cspokes\u201d in rural Georgia\u2019s health care system \u2013 including small hospitals, physicians, ambulance attendants, local health departments, and school nurses.\n\nThat\u2019s right, school nurses \u2013 they have become slender but vital threads in rural Georgia\u2019s health care net, although the inventory is rather small. Georgia\u2019s 75 smaller school systems, which serve fewer than 3,000 students, boast a total of 145 school nurses. Twenty-one of those systems only have one. Two don\u2019t report having any.\n\nLincoln County has two, and they have become very important figures in the community, said Wade Johnson, chairman of the Lincoln County Commission. He is a member of the governor\u2019s rural hospital committee.\n\nLocated north of Augusta, on the banks of the Savannah River, Lincoln\u2019s population of 8,000 is too small to support a hospital. \u201cIt takes us a whole year of sales tax to get $600,000,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur hospitals amount to our ambulances. Our doctors are ambulance attendants or EMTs.\u201d\n\nEven that puts a strain on Lincoln County finances. Both county-owned ambulances recently had engine problems that cost $5,000 each. Medicaid reimbursements for the ambulance service fall $20,000 short every three months.\n\nSo tele-medicine, which might weed out unnecessary ambulance rides, is nothing to scoff at, Johnson said.\n\nOn the day the rural hospital report was released, committee co-chairman Terry England, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was on GPB\u2019s \u201cLawmakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of [the report] deals with going in and looking at the health care delivery system in the state now, and making it more efficient,\u201d England said. \u201cThere is a way to make this work.\u201d\n\nBut the report by the Rural Hospitalization Stabilization Committee wasn\u2019t complete, as those who wrote it know very well. The road that they outlined lacks a sustaining financial model.\n\nWho pays for those who can\u2019t \u2013 the problem that the federal ACA has attempted to solve \u2013 remains an unanswered question in Georgia. But perhaps not for long.\n\nOn that same \u201cLawmakers\u201d program was Jack Hill, R-Reidsville, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a fact that local governments will have to participate, in many, many cases, in the saving of their local hospital,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the state can fund and keep afloat hospitals across the state. We have twice as many hospitals as they have in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the America that eschews Obamacare may be headed back to the future. If communities want the economic development boost that a hospital and decent health care can bring, they\u2019ll have to pony up \u2013 as they did decades ago.\n\n\u201cUsed to be, more counties did give a mill or two to the hospital. We\u2019ve gotten away from that. But I think we\u2019ll see more of this,\u201d said Monty Veazey, who sits on the board of the Georgia Rural Health Association, which has advocated an expansion of Medicaid.\n\nFulton and DeKalb counties have long supported Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. Last year, Clayton County gave a $50 million bailout to Southern Regional Medical Center.\n\nBut the practice is spreading to rural Georgia. Also last year, Habersham County agreed to assume bond payments on $37 million in debt owed by a local hospital. Ultimately, it will assume control of the facility. As justification, the northeast Georgia county cited preservation of its mountain tourism industry.\n\nElbert County commissioners voted last year to increase a property tax to sustain Elbert Memorial Hospital in Elberton. In Dodge County, they tell a similar story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a school system. If you lose it, you\u2019re not going to get it back,\u201d Veazey said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/02/28/how-to-save-health-care-in-rural-georgia-without-obamacare/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/010914-rural-communities-hsb07.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Eastman - Shareem Wrease (left), RN, checks her patient McKayla Dupree, 6, as her mother Ashley Rowland (right) comforts McKayla at Dodge County Hospital in Eastman last year.
