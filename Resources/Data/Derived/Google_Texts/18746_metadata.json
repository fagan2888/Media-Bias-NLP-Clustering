Oscar also will face another well-known New Jersey insurance brand this year: UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Oxford, which will compete for customers on the New Jersey exchange after sitting out the 2014 launch of Obamacare in New Jersey.\n\n\n\nSchlosser said Oscar will offer competitively priced plans, innovative technology and consumer-friendly benefits.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will differentiate ourselves from other insurance companies in three ways,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will simplify the complex health insurance process, we will guide you through the health care system and we will make you feel like you have a doctor in the family.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf someone actually does have a doctor in their family, \u201cthat is the person you call when your kid is throwing up at 11 at night and the doctor\u2019s office is closed,\u201d Schlosser said.\n\n\n\nSo Oscar members will be able to call the company 24 hours a day, seven days a week when they need to talk to a doctor.\n\n\n\nMembers will dial a toll-free number, or click a button on the Oscar website or on their mobile device and, within 10 minutes, \u201ca doctor will call you back,\u201d Schlosser said. These unlimited tele-visits are free.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe doctor will call you back and diagnose you over the phone, and e-prescribe medication,\u201d with the prescription to be picked up at your pharmacy.\n\n\n\nOscar health plans will include several free physician visits a year, with prescription plans that include a selection of free generic drugs.\n\n\n\nOscar will use the QualCare network of 24,000 physicians and other clinicians, and 100 health care facilities, including 69 acute-care hospitals. Of the 69 hospitals, 21 are in Oscar\u2019s \u201ctier one\u201d network, meaning members will have lower out-of-pocket costs if they use them. Oscar members have to stay within the company\u2019s New Jersey provider network, but if they have a medical emergency outside the state, they can use an out-of-state hospital emergency room at in-network rates.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the free NJBIZ email news blasts\n\n\n\nSchlosser said Oscar\u2019s online tools will help members find the doctors and hospitals that best suit their needs: \u201cRather than just giving you a list of 24,000 doctors, we can actually curate the list for you, so you can search in smarter ways.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother online tool is the health timeline.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will take your health history and individualize it for you in a timeline where you can see any doctor visits you had and any prescriptions you have and when they run out,\u201d Schlosser said.\n\n\n\nHe said Oscar can be innovative because, as a new company, it is starting out fresh, with new technology.\n\n\n\nOscar\u2019s call center will be \u201cvery happy to have conversations\u201d with consumers who want someone to talk them through their health insurance shopping experience, Schlosser said. But Oscar also is offering a technology platform geared to consumers who \u201creally would love to just research all of their options online and not necessarily have long conversations with call centers.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo get its name out in the market, Oscar will use both traditional advertising, with ads on buses and radio and television, as well as online marketing. And it will use tactics like \u201cstation domination\u201d \u2014 for two weeks, Oscar might take over the Hoboken PATH station: \u201cWe\u2019ll have Oscar people there doing brand building and really get into people\u2019s minds and getting the word out as people commute between work and home.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchlosser said Oscar will sell plans to individuals, but not to employer groups, and that health insurance brokers will be among its sales channels: \u201cThe brokers are very knowledgeable and they have a lot of customers who need good insurance coverage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first year, Oscar will sell polices in nine counties: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Monmouth, Middlesex, Morris, Ocean, Passaic and Union\n\n\n\nHe said that, in New York, Oscar has attracted a fairly representative demographic, with an average age of 39, and has been popular with people who are self-employed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf there is a category of people that I do think we have a particular attraction to, it is the people who care about their health,\u201d Schlosser said. \u201cPeople who think about their health and want to try to get better and find the right health care providers.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore competition will advance the core goal of Obamacare \u2014 reducing the number of uninsured in New Jersey \u2014 according to State Sen. Joseph F. Vitale (D-Woodbridge), who chairs the Senate Health Committee.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will see greater enrollment, of course, because we\u2019ll have more companies in the business, and they\u2019ll be marketing and advertising for enrollees,\u201d Vitale said.\n\n\n\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care quality Institute, said new entrants into the New Jersey exchange \u201cis a strong signal that the marketplace is working.\u201d She said, \u201cOscar\u2019s entrance into New Jersey is a real opportunity to see if a tech company can gain members and brand loyalty through consumer service and app based communication.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nNJBIZ Forty Under 40 honored (slideshow)\n\n$110M bid wins Revel bankruptcy auction for Canadian firm\n\nFive New Jersey residents among America's richest, earning spots on Forbes 400\n\n'Open Payments': Government posts information about $3.5B in gifts from drugmakers to doctors, hospitals", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "New Jerseyans will see a new health insurance company \u2014 Oscar Insurance \u2014 when they go online to HealthCare.gov starting Nov. 15 to shop for a 2015 government-subsidized Obamacare health", "title": "Fifth health insurance option will be available to many N.J. residents when Obamacare open enrollment begins | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20141001/NJBIZ01/141009978/fifth-health-insurance-option-will-be-available-to-many-nj-residents-when-obamacare-open-enrollment-begins", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20141001/NJBIZ01/141009978/AR/0/AR-141009978.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "New Jerseyans will see a new health insurance company \u2014 Oscar Insurance \u2014 when they go online to HealthCare.gov starting Nov. 15 to shop for a 2015 government-subsidized Obamacare health", "title": "Fifth health insurance option will be available to many N.J. residents when Obamacare open enrollment begins | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20141001/NJBIZ01/141009978/AR/0/AR-141009978.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "New Jerseyans will see a new health insurance company \u2014 Oscar Insurance \u2014 when they go online to HealthCare.gov starting Nov. 15 to shop for a 2015 government-subsidized Obamacare health plan under the Affordable Care Act.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fc8\"", "article_summary": "Oscar health plans will include several free physician visits a year, with prescription plans that include a selection of free generic drugs.\nNew Jerseyans will see a new health insurance company \u2014 Oscar Insurance \u2014 when they go online to HealthCare.gov starting Nov. 15 to shop for a 2015 government-subsidized Obamacare health plan under the Affordable Care Act.\nFor its first year in New Jersey, Oscar will offer health coverage in nine northern New Jersey counties, with future plans to expand statewide.\nOscar will use the QualCare network of 24,000 physicians and other clinicians, and 100 health care facilities, including 69 acute-care hospitals.\nOscar\u2019s call center will be \u201cvery happy to have conversations\u201d with consumers who want someone to talk them through their health insurance shopping experience, Schlosser said."}
