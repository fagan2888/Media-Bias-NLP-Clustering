But exactly who is really behind the world\u2019s largest source of information? And does their agenda, if one exists, ever shine through their supposedly \u201cunbiased\u201d wiki pages?\n\nAfter hearing of and experiencing incidents in which undeniable facts were removed from the site because editors at Wikipedia claimed the researchers who uncovered them were \u201cnot reliable\u201d\u2014which is, of course, irrelevant if the facts are demonstrably true\u2014I began to research the prominent website\u2019s leadership. That endeavor revealed that despite the site\u2019s claims of being a neutral source of information, many of those leading Wikipedia have intimate ties to far-left organizations or openly support liberal policies and candidates.\n\nSue Gardner is just one example. She is the former executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation and served in that role from December 2007 to May 2014. Her influence on Wikipedia is substantial and unquestioned. She was even named one of the 100 most powerful women in the world by Forbes in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn addition to serving on Wikimedia\u2019s Board of Trustees, Gardner has held a leadership position with the \u201cnonpartisan\u201d Sunlight Foundation (SF). SF has been funded by numerous left-wing organizations, such as the George Soros-funded Open Society Foundation and the Knight Foundation. SF even received $1 million in 2010 from the left-leaning Rockefeller Family Fund.\n\nAlso connected to SF is Wikipedia founder and Wikimedia Board of Trustees member Jimmy Wales, who serves on the SF Advisory Board. Wales is not only connected to leftist groups through his role at the Sunlight Foundation; he also has close personal ties to multiple left-wing bigshots. Wales even attended one of George Soros\u2019 birthday parties, according to The New York Times.\n\nOther Wikimedia Board of Trustees members have less extravagant ties to leftist causes but still openly admit they support such causes and politicians. Guy Kawasaki, Wikipedia\u2019s \u201cinternet evangelist,\u201d announced his support of Barack Obama on Election Day in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn one of her blog posts, Wikipedia board member Phoebe Ayers lamented that she had \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and reminisced about rifle-carrying \u201crednecks,\u201d to whom she referred as \u201cdrunken yokel[s]\u201d whose proximity she had to endure while growing up in the South. In another post, she applauded Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) for her \u201cstands on the environment \u2026 and women\u2019s issues\u201d and worried someday the \u201cunthinkable\u201d might happen in California: A Republican could get elected.\n\nHaving a particular set of personal beliefs doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there will be content bias, but the evidence suggests Wikipedia has been affected by its leftist leaders and many biased editors.\n\nIn 2012, for example, Northwestern University\u2019s Shane Greenstein and the University of Southern California\u2019s Feng Zhu analyzed more than 70,000 Wikipedia articles published over 10 years related to U.S. politics to determine whether any bias existed in the material. Greenstein and Feng found there was a distinct bias favoring Democrats and their positions. The authors also discovered that articles produced in the early 2000s were \u201cvery slanted\u201d and less so after 2005. As time has gone on and more unbiased users have become involved in Wikipedia\u2019s editing process, articles have become more balanced, Greenstein and Zhu say.\n\nThings may be improving, but Wikipedia\u2019s bias remains obvious. Not only are factual, credible sources being removed in an effort to censor information that reflects badly on political projects such as global warming alarmism, net neutrality, and Obamacare; but the editors have also allowed dishonest, biased sources to mislead people on numerous wiki pages. For instance, climate alarmist William Connolley repeatedly removed factual material from Wikipedia pages in 2010 and earlier because it didn\u2019t support his belief in man-caused catastrophic global warming, even while he was being investigated for poor practices.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIt\u2019s true that Wikipedia is an enormous project, and that its leadership cannot be held responsible for every foolish decision; but from the top down, the evidence shows Wikipedia is decidedly not a neutral source operated by unbiased editors\u2013and all of its readers should keep that in mind whenever visiting the site.\n\nJustin Haskins ([email protected]) is editor at The Heartland Institute and editor-in-chief of the New Revere Daily Press.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Its readers should keep all this in mind whenever visiting the site.", "author": "Justin Haskins", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Its readers should keep all this in mind whenever visiting the site.", "title": "Exposed: Wikipedia\u2019s Leftist Ties And Its Censorship Of The Facts", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_273016391.jpg", "height": 710}, "updated_time": "2015-05-08T17:32:15-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/uncovered-wikipedias-leftist-ties-and-its-censorship-of-the-facts/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Its readers should keep all this in mind whenever visiting the site.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_273016391.jpg", "title": "Uncovered: Wikipedia\u2019s Leftist Ties And Its Censorship Of The Facts", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-07T15:33:02-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Wikipedia", "published_time": "2015-05-07T15:33:02-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T17:32:15-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "sunlight foundation, , george soros, global warming, liberalism, liberals, wikipedia, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Things may be improving, but Wikipedia\u2019s bias remains obvious.\nOther Wikimedia Board of Trustees members have less extravagant ties to leftist causes but still openly admit they support such causes and politicians.\nAlso connected to SF is Wikipedia founder and Wikimedia Board of Trustees member Jimmy Wales, who serves on the SF Advisory Board.\nWales is not only connected to leftist groups through his role at the Sunlight Foundation; he also has close personal ties to multiple left-wing bigshots.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowIn addition to serving on Wikimedia\u2019s Board of Trustees, Gardner has held a leadership position with the \u201cnonpartisan\u201d Sunlight Foundation (SF)."}
