They\u2019re probably watching Lisa Kelly on the History Channel\u2019s \u201cIce Road Truckers.\u201d\n\nSure, the other drivers \u2014 including Alex Debogorski and Hugh \u201cThe Polar Bear\u201d Rowland \u2014 have their fans, but it\u2019s Ms. Kelly who arguably makes the show \u201cappointment TV\u201d for a wide range of viewers.\n\n\u201cYou truck girl,\u201d a man in British Columbia posted recently. \u201cI only watch the show to make sure you are doing well OR should I say doing great at what you like doing.\u201d\n\nTonight\u2019s episode, the second of the eighth season, allows viewers to ride shotgun as drivers negotiate the nastiest roads in Canada to deliver supplies to rural areas.\n\nThe 2014 Emmy Award nominations may have snubbed the show in favor of \u201cThe Amazing Race,\u201d \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d and \u201cProject Runway\u201d for Outstanding Reality Competition Program, but Matt Ginsburg, the show\u2019s co-executive producer, said \u201cIce Road Truckers\u201d is rewarded by its ardent fans.\n\n\u201cWe have a tremendous fan base that has been loyal since Season 1. It is a cross-section of your typical History Channel viewer,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I [recently] saw a letter from a little kid who wants to be an ice road trucker. The magic of the show is that you don\u2019t need to be a fan of truck driving or trucks in general to love the show.\u201d\n\nThink of \u201cIce Road Truckers\u201d as a real-life version of the NBC mockumentary \u201cThe Office.\u201d The difference, of course, is that the stars are professional, full-time truck drivers.\n\nCrews occasionally film the drivers when they are at home, in their boss\u2019 offices and even at medical clinics, giving viewers a sense of the off-road struggles they face. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t some \u2014 perhaps unintentional \u2014 comedic elements to the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like reality shows. But this is a good show about semis and things I like,\u201d a fan with the online handle Animal4055 wrote on a fan board. \u201cIt\u2019s also entertaining when they cuss back and forth at each other on the CB radio. The only time it\u2019s bad is when a truck falls through the ice, and that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nEveryone hopes it never will, but the skills needed to sidestep the possibility is one of the elements that drew the Michigan-born, Alaska-raised Ms. Kelly to the profession. The show, she said, is a great way to keep the work even fresher.\n\n\u201cIt is just fun to do,\u201d Ms. Kelly said from her Alaska home late last week as she prepared to ride her horse in a barrel race competition. \u201cIt kind of switches things up.\n\n\u201cIf my job is to drive a truck all year, this makes it a totally different job, because you\u2019re in [the truck cab] getting to know people. It\u2019s an almost-instant relationship. You can\u2019t kick them out.\u201d\n\nThat can make for some tense moments, such as this year when a producer questioned a trucker during a perilous moment on a Canadian ice road. Viewers will see that scene \u2014 and the driver\u2019s furious reaction \u2014 in a future episode, Mr. Ginsburg said.\n\nThe show also creates an additional vulnerability: When the truckers watch the show, they hear the comments made about them when they\u2019re not present.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know [Mr. Rowland] was trash-talking me so bad the whole season,\u201d said Ms. Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard when people say things about you. If I was acting, playing a role, I could understand it. But I\u2019m playing me.\u201d\n\nThe decision to not script the show keeps it suspenseful, said Mr. Ginsburg.\n\n\u201cThe History audience is very aware of the authenticity, and they have a reverence for expertise and the people who are the best at what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecifically to Lisa, she lives up to and exceeds those standards.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake \u2014 for all her glamour-girl appeal, Ms. Kelly is a road warrior. She has declined to cash in by posing for provocative photos.\n\n\u201cThere are many people in Hollywood and in the public eye that don\u2019t realize they are role models for younger people. I want to be a positive role model for them,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, though, people meet me, and I think they\u2019re disappointed. I screw up. I have bad days.\n\n\u201cAnd people think I\u2019m always [as even-keeled as I am on the show]. They\u2019re surprised that I\u2019m not afraid to speak up, to stand up. I\u2019m a trucker. How do they think I succeeded in this business?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't be surprised if you see a dip in social media at 10 tonight.
