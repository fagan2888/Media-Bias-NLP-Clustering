They point to the healthy number of jobs created \u2014 192,000 \u2014 and the upward revisions of the past two months\u2019 numbers \u2014 37,000 more jobs added than originally reported during the winter.\n\nFebruary's Jobs Numbers\n\nAnd there were other bright spots, notes Wellesley\u2019s economics department chair Kristin Butcher, whom I interview on the NewsHour Friday: temporary jobs were up in March, and they tend to be a \u201cbellwether\u201d of future job growth, as do construction jobs, which are also up.\n\nBut overall, Butcher views March\u2019s numbers as I do: with caution. That\u2019s because, according to the survey of 60,000 households, roughly 170,000 more Americans of working age were added to the population in March, consistent with the number we add just about every month, and also consistent with the Census Bureau\u2019s report that the U.S. population is growing at slightly more than 2 million people a year.\n\nBut that would mean that the number of jobs added \u2014 192,000 \u2014 just kept pace with the number of new people who needed them. And sure enough, that would explain why the total number of people who told interviewers that they hadn\u2019t worked even one hour in the previous week \u2014 the total number of officially \u201cunemployed\u201d in America \u2014 barely budged, and is still well above 10 million.\n\nAs Making Sen$e regulars know, we also keep track of a more inclusive measure of unemployment which we call U-7: the total number of Americans who say they want a full-time job but don\u2019t have one. That number rose in March, for the first time since October, to nearly 24 million. That is a lot of people.\n\nSo what happened to explain the rise? Well, a lot of it seems to be because the number of part-timers who want a full-time job swelled. The BLS news release claims that \u201cThe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 7.4 million in March.\u201d\n\nBut in fact, if the BLS\u2019 Table A-8 is to be trusted, the number of part-timers wanting full-time work number rose from 7.168 million Americans to 7.411 million in just the one month of March. That\u2019s an increase of more than 3 percent. Yes, it could be a statistical \u201cartifact\u201d as they say: a more or less random number. But it also could be a sign of employers running from the Affordable Care Act, or a wobbly underbelly to an otherwise optimistic body of data.\n\nPaul Solman spoke with \u201cLeading Indicators\u201d author Zachary Karabell last month about our obsession with economic statistics like the unemployment rate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economy added a healthy 192,000 jobs in March, but what's worrisome, Paul Solman explains, is the rise in the number of people working part time because they couldn't find a full-time job.", "pubdate": 20140404, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The economy added a healthy 192,000 jobs in March, but what's worrisome, Paul Solman explains, is the rise in the number of people working part time because they couldn't find a full-time job.", "title": "Part-timers are the dark side of the bright jobs numbers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/part-time-help.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/part-timers-are-the-dark-side-of-the-bright-jobs-numbers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The economy added a healthy 192,000 jobs in March, but what's worrisome, Paul Solman explains, is the rise in the number of people working part time because they couldn't find a full-time job.", "title": "Part-timers are the dark side of the bright jobs numbers", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/part-time-help.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "unemployment", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Making-Sene-with-Paul-Solman-121926457817681/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs, Making Sen$e, Solman Scale, unemployment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf96f\"", "article_summary": "Well, a lot of it seems to be because the number of part-timers who want a full-time job swelled.\nThey point to the healthy number of jobs created \u2014 192,000 \u2014 and the upward revisions of the past two months\u2019 numbers \u2014 37,000 more jobs added than originally reported during the winter.\nBut that would mean that the number of jobs added \u2014 192,000 \u2014 just kept pace with the number of new people who needed them.\nWhen it comes to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 \u201cFirst Friday\u201d unemployment numbers, March\u2019s data are a good reminder of our monthly mantra: don\u2019t read too much into any one set of numbers, based on two very different surveys, both themselves based on samples of much larger populations.\nThat said, no matter how humbly provisional I know I should be, I have a less exuberant reaction to the March numbers than some commentators seem to."}
