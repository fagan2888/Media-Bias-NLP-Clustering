There are certain facial expressions that bring out our real emotions.\n\nThese emotions in turn act as a window for what we are actually feeling inside, say the researchers. To cite a few examples to elaborate the statement, people generally widen their eyes when they are afraid and people narrow their eyes when they are angry at someone.\n\nProf. Adam Anderson said the research has let them know that facial expressions are not only restricted to social interactions and communications but are also deeply associated with emotions and get adapted as per the environment.\n\nHe supported his statement by saying that even squinting and widening of eyes express lot of emotions on face. Moreover, both the expressions depict contrasting emotions. An experiment was carried out to confirm the same in which 24 volunteers were taken.\n\nThese participants were undergraduates from the University of Toronto and were studied using University of Toronto. The researchers asked them to show two expressions anger and disgust. During anger, the participants wide opened their eyes and the feeling of disgust made them narrowing their eyes.\n\nLess light passed through the cornea during the latter expression and increased the concentration to allow people focus on object. The researchers concluded that emotions are the key that controls how people will react and what will be their facial expressions.\n\n\"We tend to think of perception as something that happens after an image is received by the brain, but in fact emotions influence vision at the very earliest moments of visual encoding\", said Prof. Anderson. The paper, 'Optical Origins of Opposing Facial Expression Actions', is present in the March 2014 issue of the journal Psychological Science.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca307\"", "article_summary": "Facial expressions can reveal our true emotions, reveals a new study by Cornell University.\nThere are certain facial expressions that bring out our real emotions.\nThe researchers concluded that emotions are the key that controls how people will react and what will be their facial expressions.\nProf. Adam Anderson said the research has let them know that facial expressions are not only restricted to social interactions and communications but are also deeply associated with emotions and get adapted as per the environment.\nThese emotions in turn act as a window for what we are actually feeling inside, say the researchers."}
