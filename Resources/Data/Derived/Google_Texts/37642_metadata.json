General exclusions and limitations that apply to all services also apply to transgender services.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut two insurers is not enough,\u201d One Colorado health policy director Ashley Wheeland said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe believe that transgender Coloradans and their employers deserve the same options in picking any health plan, and we hope we can soon say in the state of Colorado that all of our health plans cover the services that our transgender friends need.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kaiser Permanente now covering transgender services in plans", "title": "Kaiser Permanente now covering transgender services in plans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/24/kaiser-permanente-now-covering-transgender-services-in-plans/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-24T17:59:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T17:59:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc33c\"", "article_summary": "\u201d The availability of coverage for Transgender health services is an evolving area in the health care industry,\u201d Kaiser Permanente stated.\nKaiser Permanente will now cover services for transgender Coloradans in its insurance plans, the company said Tuesday.\nAfter that directive, Kaiser began reviewing its policies on transgender services, the company stated.\n\u201cKaiser Permanente is committed to reducing health disparities and providing culturally competent care to all of our patients,\u201d the HMO said in a statement.\nGeneral exclusions and limitations that apply to all services also apply to transgender services.\u201d\u201cBut two insurers is not enough,\u201d One Colorado health policy director Ashley Wheeland said in a statement."}
