SCOTTSDALE — Jhoulys Chacin continues to make progress with his shoulder injury, and plans to begin playing catch in “2-3 days,” he told The Post on Monday. He hasn’t thrown in nine days, but is pleased with how his shoulder feels following rest and stretching exercises.

“It feels really good. I threw a little medicine ball, a small one, and it felt fine today,” Chacin said. “I am going to be OK. It’s definitely getting better.”

Chacin admitted that the true barometer will be when he throws hard from a distance and, with no setbacks, off the mound. However, he’s noticed an important difference over the past week.

“Before even when I was just home, my biceps felt tight and stiff,” Chacin said. “It feels really loose now (as he swung his arm to illustrate it). It’s a lot better. It’s good. Everything is really good so far.”

Chacin hopes to be ready for opening day, though that’s a longshot given the ground he has to make up. He is roughly three weeks behind the other starters, so it’s more likely that he will be ready in mid-April after he builds up arm strength. The Rockies are taking a conservative approach, as manager Walt Weiss explained, looking at “the big picture, not opening day.”
