This is not a fundamentally traumatized population. We certainly don\u2019t want to identify this community as sick or mentally ill.\u201d\n\nEric and Ann Whalley of Boston, who suffered severe physical injuries in the attacks, say they\u2019ve so far chosen not to take advantage of counseling services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve handled things our own way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been impacted, but not with the sort of PTSD, severe anxiety and panic attacks that others have. We\u2019ve done pretty well on that side of things.\u201d\n\nDr. Kermit Crawford, a psychologist who heads the Resiliency Center, suggests demand for services \u2014 which include group therapy sessions on relaxation and stress management techniques \u2014 may grow over time.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember: These are normal people dealing with an abnormal circumstance,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nBarbara Thorp, the One Fund Center\u2019s program director, also expects enrollment to pick up soon. She said a number of survivors are waiting for the bombing\u2019s second anniversary, this year\u2019s marathon and bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2019s federal death penalty trial to run their course.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Few marathon bomb survivors seek help for \u2018invisible\u2019 wounds", "title": "Few marathon bomb survivors seek help for \u2018invisible\u2019 wounds", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Few marathon bomb survivors seek help for \u2018invisible\u2019 wounds", "title": "Few marathon bomb survivors seek help for \u2018invisible\u2019 wounds", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/few_marathon_bomb_survivors_seek_help_for_invisible_wounds/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/boston-marathon-bombing-invisible-injuries.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Few marathon bomb survivors seek help for \u2018invisible\u2019 wounds", "title": "Few marathon bomb survivors seek help for \u2018invisible\u2019 wounds", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/boston-marathon-bombing-invisible-injuries.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Philip Marcelo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Rebecca Brendel, a psychiatrist who is medical director for the One Fund Center, said she\u2019s not surprised at the muted response so far.\nAlthough the centers have funding for at least two years, organizers fear it may be years before many survivors understand the emotional toll and decide to seek help.\nShe said a number of survivors are waiting for the bombing\u2019s second anniversary, this year\u2019s marathon and bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2019s federal death penalty trial to run their course.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been impacted, but not with the sort of PTSD, severe anxiety and panic attacks that others have.\nWe certainly don\u2019t want to identify this community as sick or mentally ill.\u201dEric and Ann Whalley of Boston, who suffered severe physical injuries in the attacks, say they\u2019ve so far chosen not to take advantage of counseling services."}
