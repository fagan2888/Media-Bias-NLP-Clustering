With the GOP hoping to seize control of the Senate in November\u2019s midterm elections, and the inevitable decline in presidential power that occurs as second term presidents move toward lame-duck status, Obama risks being sidelined and marginalized for the remaining two years of his term.\n\nLast week\u2019s tempest over the Bergdahl exchange seemed to roll all the President\u2019s troubles together into a single storm. The decision to free five Taliban fighters from Guantanamo in exchange for an American soldier with a complicated past energized the President\u2019s opponents, befuddled and angered important Congressional allies, and renewed questions about the political instincts of the President and his closest aides. The White House apparently thought that the release would be a moment of national unity and celebration and arranged for Sgt. Bergdahl\u2019s parents to meet Obama in a highly publicized Rose Garden ceremony that now looks like a huge political blunder.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and bumpy road to this point. Few American presidents came into office viewed with so much optimism and hope. Obama was swept and re-swept into office with a clear expectation that being smart \u2014 or at least not being stupid \u2014 would be enough to mend fences around the globe and at home. Things aren\u2019t so cheery now, and not being George W. Bush may not, it appears, be sufficient.\n\nObama is not, however, prepared to pick up his toys and go home. Stymied in Congress, where a coalition of Republicans and red state Democrats have effectively blocked his major initiatives in both the House and the Senate, the President is determined to use his executive powers to carve out a legacy whether Congress likes it or not. The new EPA regulations to cut CO2 levels from power generators and his decision to sidestep Congress on the release of five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo in exchange for Sergeant Bergdahl show a White House anything but resigned to the prospect of presidential decline.\n\nIn both foreign and domestic affairs, Obama has plenty of executive authority to use. Moreover, the signature accomplishment of his first term, the ACA health care law, is potentially the most significant piece of domestic legislation since the 1960s and was written to give the executive branch the power to redesign much of the American health system as the President\u2019s appointees in the federal bureaucracy set about implementing the law. The Dodd-Frank Act, intended to stabilize Wall Street and prevent another 2008 style financial crisis, gave the executive branch broad authority to re-regulate the financial sector.\n\nWhy, then, does a feisty President with more power than any of his peacetime predecessors, one who is determined to use those powers to the max, look so much a victim of events he can\u2019t control?\n\nIt isn\u2019t for lack of ambition; Obama aspires to be a transformational leader at home and abroad. The ACA attempts to redesign an industry that accounts for 17.2 % of GDP. The EPA\u2019s new regulations cover 66% of the country\u2019s energy production. Overseas, he\u2019s picked goals like getting a global climate treaty, destroying Al-Qaeda, democratizing the Arab world, eliminating nuclear weapons and achieving d\u00e9tente with Iran.\n\nThese are big goals; achieving them would give Obama a significant place in the history books. But there\u2019s a catch; large and complex projects are hard to carry out, and the President seems to consistently underestimate the difficulties in turning compelling visions into practical programs. As a result, he now finds himself haunted by goals and expectations he set for himself, caught in a gap between promise and performance that has proved unexpectedly hard to close.\n\nThe implementation of the ACA was problematic in ways that go far beyond the famously awful website. While a substantial number of people have gotten access to health insurance thanks to the law, the implementation challenges remain epic \u2014 and the public still isn\u2019t fully behind the new system. Many of the law\u2019s provisions have already been suspended, amended, and reinterpreted so many times that it is now probable the President will leave office without being able to roll the whole law out as projected. Even government accountants have given up figuring out what the law means or how it will work: this week, the CBO stated that it was henceforth impossible to score Obamacare.\n\nMeanwhile, the problems at the Veterans Administration \u2014 problems candidate Obama vowed to fix back in 2008 \u2014 erupted last month in a scandal that 79% of Americans blame at least in part on Obama\u2019s management. A shock poll in The Washington Post showed 48% of Americans now think that President George W. Bush was better at \u201cgetting things done\u201d than his replacement-compared with 42% who think the opposite.\n\nMeanwhile, President\u2019s Obama\u2019s repeated calls for gun control legislation and immigration reform have fallen flat.\n\nOverseas, the gap between promise and accomplishment is, if anything, more daunting. Early in his first term Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in a decision that struck even his most ardent admirers as premature; there isn\u2019t much talk today of a repeat visit to Oslo.\n\nNot since the end of the Cold War has an American president faced this much disorder and trouble in the world. The \u201creset\u201d with Russia ended with the attack on Crimea. The Arab Spring has foundered in chaos, dictatorship and war. The President\u2019s declaration that \u201cAssad must go\u201d has proved as hollow as his demand that Syria cease chemical warfare attacks on its citizens. Al-Qaeda and related jihadist groups are active and growing from West Africa through Central Asia; in some ways the terror threat today is greater than ever before. The war in Afghanistan, a war that candidate Obama vowed to win, is sputtering inconclusively toward a less than stellar close. An increasingly feisty China is challenging the United States and its allies, and North Korea grinds grimly ahead with its nuclear program.\n\nOnce again, the President seems to have underestimated how much effort would be required to achieve the goals he set out. He clearly underestimated the difficulties of building a stable and businesslike relationship with Russia and was shocked and surprised at Putin\u2019s attack on Ukraine. He underestimated the difficulty of getting the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a peace agreement, overestimated the strength of the democratic forces in Egypt, and seems not to have fully understood the difficulties in winning the Afghan war until after he committed American troops to a surge. His administration has also seriously underestimated China\u2019s readiness to oppose American policy in the Pacific; the South and East China seas are becoming more dangerous and more militarized by the day.\n\nWith 30 months to go, Obama still may have a chance to regain control of both the domestic and international agendas, but to do that he\u2019s going to have to change his approach. He needs to focus on the nitty-gritty, day-to-day business of governing; six years into his administration, the public is fed up with promises and hungry for concrete accomplishments.\n\nPresident Obama needs to show that he knows how to get things done, or increasingly the world will move on as if he wasn\u2019t there.\n\nMead is the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Policy and the Humanities at Bard College, and edits the American Interest Online.
