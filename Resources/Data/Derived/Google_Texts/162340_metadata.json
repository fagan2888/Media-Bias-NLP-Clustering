Chairman Murphy noted that every single state exchange faces significant budget shortfalls. For example, $733 million was given to establish state exchanges in Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon. All four exchanges failed to become self-sustaining and were forced to transition consumers to the federal marketplace. It is increasingly unclear whether or not the money will be recouped.\n\nCongresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) questioned Slavitt about a recent report from the Government Accountability Office which revealed that some state exchanges\u2019 information technology systems were still functioning improperly. The report found that CMS \u201cdid not always clearly document, define, or communicate its oversight roles and responsibilities to states as called for by best practices for project management.\u201d State administrators say communication with CMS has been poor, which \u201cadversely affected states\u2019 deadlines, increased uncertainty, and required additional work.\u201d\n\nCMS is charged with reviewing states\u2019 funding requests and conducting audits to ensure all money is being spent legally. After January 1, 2015, states were not allowed to spend grant money on operation expenses such as rent, utilities, telecommunications, or software maintenance. Chairman Murphy cited a report from the Office of Inspector General revealing that Washington state may have used its grant money for operational costs, contrary to law.\n\nSlavitt contended all current state marketplaces are sustainable despite these compelling challenges. When asked by Congressman David McKinley (R-WV) whether anyone has lost their job for giving erroneous advice to the state exchanges, Slavitt was unable to provide a single name.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was the second Energy & Commerce oversight hearing to address the tumultuous problems within the state marketplaces in an effort to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely and in accordance with the law.\n\nRead the article on ObamaCare Watch here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Galen Institute", "description": "By Kara Jones ObamaCare Watch, 12/9/15 \u201cWoefully sloppy and willfully ignorant\u201d is how Chairman Tim Murphy (R-PA) described the oversight of the state-run health insurance exchanges at an Energy &a\u2026", "title": "Top CMS Official Questioned on Lack of Oversight of State ObamaCare Exchanges", "url": "http://galen.org/2015/top-cms-official-questioned-on-lack-of-oversight-of-state-obamacare-exchanges/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-09T17:16:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-09T17:26:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0,maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "article_summary": "For example, $733 million was given to establish state exchanges in Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.\nWhen asked by Congressman David McKinley (R-WV) whether anyone has lost their job for giving erroneous advice to the state exchanges, Slavitt was unable to provide a single name.\nBy Kara JonesObamaCare Watch, 12/9/15\u201cWoefully sloppy and willfully ignorant\u201d is how Chairman Tim Murphy (R-PA) described the oversight of the state-run health insurance exchanges at an Energy & Commerce oversight hearing Tuesday.\nCongresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) questioned Slavitt about a recent report from the Government Accountability Office which revealed that some state exchanges\u2019 information technology systems were still functioning improperly.\nSlavitt contended all current state marketplaces are sustainable despite these compelling challenges."}
