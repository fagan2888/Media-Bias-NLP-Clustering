In addition to the impending Danbury location this fall, an urgent care center in New Britain is also planned for this summer.\n\nThe two current Danbury facilities serve walk-in patients throughout the region, including Bethel, Brookfield and Newtown as well Pawling and Brewster across the border in New York.\n\nAccording to the medical group, at all of their centers, patients are treated under the care of local Board Certified Doctors, Physician Assistants and APRNs. All doctors are also USCIS Certified Civil Surgeons, and able to perform full immigration physicals as well. They are able to treat a variety of ailments including viruses and infections, cuts and fractures to ear, eye, and skin issues. The new Danbury facility will have its own on-site laboratory, pharmacy and x-ray equipment enabling doctors to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries as well as dispense medication to patients.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do the same exact thing the ER is going to if you come in with the flu or a broken leg,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cThe difference is we cost about a tenth of the ER and you are in and out within an hour generally speaking.\u201d\n\nMoney is certainly a driving factor in the rise of urgent care centers, said Buccini.\n\n\u201cAs the health care industry consolidates, and you have more and more larger systems, the hospitals need primary care physicians to drive business to its own specialist and its own hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cBy having urgent centers in the community hospitals now have a mechanism to drive business to their system.\u201d\n\nAnd as hospitals continue to focus on advanced and specialized services, urgent care centers are picking up more of the routine treatments which have been burdening emergency rooms, said Kelly.\n\n\u201cFolks are running in and clogging up these emergency department s with cold and flu stuff and minor injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cReally they have no business being in the emergency department. It\u2019s driving a ton of costs into the health care system.\u201d\n\nAlong with urgent care issues, AFC Urgent Care Danbury also provides physicals and vaccinations for school, sports, immigration, DOT and pre-employment in addition to an occupational health program for employers, providing care for Workers\u2019 Compensation cases and employee-related testing, such as drug screening and hearing tests.\n\nThe new health center is expected to create about 20 new jobs for the east side of Danbury.\n\n\u201cWe are local guys investing our own money in a medical center to take care of folks in our community,\u201d said Krippner. \u201cUnlike many private equity investors entering the urgent care space, we are not interested in simply opening and quickly flipping an operation. Rather, we are in it for the long haul \u2014 we want AFC Doctors Express to make a positive contribution to our communities and to the future of Connecticut\u2019s health care landscape.\u201d\n\nPrint", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "afc doctors express urgent care,tom kelly,ron krippner,gene buccini,", "description": "Owners of AFC Doctors Express Urgent Care Danbury have announced the medical group will open a new urgent care medical facility in Danbury this fall.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e51\"", "article_summary": "Owners of AFC Doctors Express Urgent Care Danbury, formerly known as Doctors Express, have announced the medical group will open a new urgent care medical facility in Danbury this fall, their fourth in the state since 2013.\nAccording to the company, there are approximately 50 AFC Doctors Express Urgent Care locations throughout the Northeast, making it the largest chain of urgent care centers in the region.\nIn addition to the impending Danbury location this fall, an urgent care center in New Britain is also planned for this summer.\nIt\u2019s driving a ton of costs into the health care system.\u201dAlong with urgent care issues, AFC Urgent Care Danbury also provides physicals and vaccinations for school, sports, immigration, DOT and pre-employment in addition to an occupational health program for employers, providing care for Workers\u2019 Compensation cases and employee-related testing, such as drug screening and hearing tests.\n\u201cUnlike many private equity investors entering the urgent care space, we are not interested in simply opening and quickly flipping an operation."}
