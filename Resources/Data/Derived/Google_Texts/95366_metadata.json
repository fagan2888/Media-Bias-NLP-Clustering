She incorporated her additional training on behalf of the more than 200 students with autism and multiple disabilities attending CLL. As a result, four CLL student murals are on display in the museum\u2019s Young-at-Art Gallery.\n\n\u201cI love these paintings,\u201d said Saskia Schmidt, Noyes Museum\u2019s director of education.\n\nSchmidt said she was delighted to exhibit the art after receiving slides of the murals and being contacted by Burger.\n\nBurger was thrilled with the opportunity to showcase her student\u2019s art work. Assisted by her husband, she went to the Noyes Museum and spent an afternoon mounting the four murals, each 4 feet wide and 6 feet high.\n\n\u201cThe abilities of our students vary greatly. However, everyone at CLL participated in this project,\u201d Burger said. \u201cFor some, it was a lot to make little marks, while others put in a significant amount of time. But the fact that all of our students participated was great.\u201d\n\nStudents had full decision-making power regarding color choices, and had several items to choose from to paint with, including sponge brushes, paintbrushes of varying sizes, paint rollers and cotton swabs.\n\n\u201cThe students enjoyed the experience and were proud of their work,\u201d CLL Principal Mary Beth Conley said. \u201cIt was a joy to see how pleased they were with what they had accomplished.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Lifelong Learning is one of seven schools operated by the Middlesex Regional Educational Services Commission (MRESC), which offers comprehensive services for students ages 3 to 21 with autism and multiple disabilities, including two schools with on-site clinical support services. Established in 1977, the MRESC is the largest Educational Services Commission in New Jersey, and also coordinates transportation services for nearly 14,000 students throughout the state.\n\nThe exhibit runs through July 28.
