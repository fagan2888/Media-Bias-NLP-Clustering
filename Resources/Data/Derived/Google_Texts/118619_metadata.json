He stood 34 feet away from the pin as a grandstand packed with spectators silently watched him line up his putt.\n\nThe ball ambled over the neatly manicured green on the 18th hole at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. It crossed back and forth over a line from where it began to the hole, rising and falling with the topography of the land, mirroring the green\u2019s gentle slopes and curvatures.\n\nIt fell out of sight when it reached its intended destination, bringing the crowd\u2019s attention back to the 29-year-old standing in front of a Lake Manassas backdrop.\n\nMerritt had become a spectator in his own right after taking what proved to be his final stroke of the tournament and watching the ball roll away from him. When it fell, giving him his fifth birdie on the afternoon and the tournament win, Merritt shrugged.\n\n\u201cTo be quite honest, I wasn\u2019t trying to make it,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cI was trying to lag it, and if I had two feet left I was going to be lagging that one as well. I wanted to make sure I got it in in three. Nonetheless, it had pretty perfect pace.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the ball was three feet from the pin that Merritt realized his putt was headed for the hole and the reality of his impending victory began to hit him.\n\n\u201cIt straightened out just a shade and looked like it was maybe going to miss on the left side and it wiggled just enough right,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThe Golf Gods decided that\u2019s just enough for this week, this one is going in and we\u2019ll go celebrate.\u201d\n\nThe field at this year\u2019s Quicken Loans National may not have been as strong as in years past, but Merritt was still a long shot to bring home the top prize. He had been cut from the last five tournaments he entered, and he sat at No. 180 in the Official World Golf Rankings and No. 123 in the FedExCup standings at the start of the event.\n\n\u201cEver since the summer started, I\u2019ve had two over-par rounds and I\u2019ve missed every cut,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThe problem is that I\u2019ve been shooting even par and 1-under par. That gets you lapped out here.\u201d\n\nMerritt knew that there was something about his game that was slightly off, but he couldn\u2019t quite identify it until this week, when he found that his hands were out of position as he swung the club.\n\n\u201cIt gave me just that little bit more freedom in the backswing, little extra time and to hit a lot of quality golf shots this week,\u201d Merritt said.\n\n\u201cThen we found something Saturday morning with the alignment of the putter. The shoulders needed to squared up a little bit. We found the hole a lot on Saturday, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nMerritt shot 4-under through his first 36 holes, which tied him for 35th. The rest of the field could only watch as he rocketed to the top of the leaderboard on Saturday, shooting a 10-under-par 61 and setting a tournament record in the process.\n\nThe 61 also tied the PGA Tour\u2019s all-time low set by David Frost in 1994, and it wasn\u2019t the first time the 29-year-old hit that mark. He shot the same score during his second round at the RBC Heritage at Harbour Town Links in Hilton Head, South Carolina in April.\n\nMerritt turned pro in 2008 after finishing his collegiate career at Boise State. His first professional win came a year later at the 2009 Mexico Open, but he would have to wait until Sunday for his second.\n\nHe and Kevin Chappell led the field at 14-under to begin the fourth and final round of play, with Rickie Fowler one stroke behind. Chappell shot even par on the front nine to remain in contention, but plummeted down the leaderboard as a 6-over 77 left him tied for 18th. Merritt, meanwhile clung to his post despite Rickie Fowler, who finished second, and David Lingmerth, who was third, threatening to take the lead.\n\nFowler finished his third round one stroke back of the lead. After a slow start on Sunday, he found his rhythm and worked his way back into contention.\n\n\u201cNot the start that I wanted to get off to but nice to kind of turn things around and make some swings coming in,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cHad to at least scare Troy a little bit.\u201d\n\nMerritt knew that even with his relatively poor start, he couldn\u2019t count Fowler out. Merritt avoided a scare Fowler attempted to give him by not allowing him to draw too close. When he sank that final putt, the tournament\u2019s top prize wasn\u2019t all that Merritt won. He also received a bear hug from Fowler, a close friend since joining the PGA Tour as part of the same rookie class.\n\n\u201cReally excited for him. It\u2019s a huge win.\u201d Fowler said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t played in a major yet. That\u2019s changing. See him in Akron.\u201d\n\nFor much of the day, Bill Haas was Merritt\u2019s closest competitor. Haas set a blistering pace on the front nine to pencil in five birdies on a clean scorecard, but it was a pace he couldn\u2019t maintain coming in. Haas shot 1-under on the day and 12-under for the tournament, which tied him for fourth.\n\nTiger Woods delivered a strong performance through the first two rounds of his own tournament thanks to his consistently strong approach. Both days, Woods hit 14 of 18 greens in regulation. Saturday, however, the 39-year-old hit just 10 of 18 greens in regulation and required 29 putts to complete the round at a 3-over 74.\n\nBut Woods closed out Sunday with a 3-under 68 to wrap up one of his better outings in recent months. He left the tournament feeling that he took \u201csome big strides\u201d in his game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting some speed back, which is nice,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI\u2019m starting to pump the ball out there again.\u201d\n\nWoods kicked off his day with a clean scorecard through 10 before a disappointing three-putt birdie on 11 that included a miss just three feet out from the pin. Still, Woods felt that he showed improvement during the course of the tournament.\n\n\u201cMy short game starting to come back to where it used to be,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything is kind of trending in the correct direction now.\u201d\n\nDefending champion Justin Rose closed out his third round three strokes behind Merritt and Chappell. He was in the same position through 54 holes of last year\u2019s tournament, but this time finished at 12-under.\n\nAlso six strokes back of Merritt were Justin Thomas, Danny Lee, Carl Pettersson and Jason Bohn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boosted by a 10-under-par 61 in the third round on Saturday, Merritt held off challenges from Rickie Fowler and Bill Haas to claim his first PGA Tour victory in the Quicken Loans National.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Boosted by a 10-under-par 61 in the third round on Saturday, Merritt held off challenges from Rickie Fowler and Bill Haas to claim his first PGA Tour victory in the Quicken Loans National.", "title": "Troy Merritt wins Quicken Loans National to take home first PGA Tour title", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/2/troy-merritt-wins-quicken-loans-national-first-win/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/02/10578147758dff227d0f6a706700d779.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/02/10578147758dff227d0f6a706700d779.jpg", "description": "Boosted by a 10-under-par 61 in the third round on Saturday, Merritt held off challenges from Rickie Fowler and Bill Haas to claim his first PGA Tour victory in the Quicken Loans National.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Troy Merritt wins Quicken Loans National to take home first PGA Tour t"}, "Author": "Dan Roth", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Troy Merritt"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce304\"", "article_summary": "GAINESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Troy Merritt was the last competitor to finish his round at the Quicken Loans National on Sunday.\nBoth days, Woods hit 14 of 18 greens in regulation.\nWhen it fell, giving him his fifth birdie on the afternoon and the tournament win, Merritt shrugged.\nHe also received a bear hug from Fowler, a close friend since joining the PGA Tour as part of the same rookie class.\n\u201cHad to at least scare Troy a little bit.\u201dMerritt knew that even with his relatively poor start, he couldn\u2019t count Fowler out."}
