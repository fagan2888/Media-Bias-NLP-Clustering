Make no mistake, Lincoln was a polarizing president. His election was the pretext for secession by southern states. He refused to compromise even as the magnitude and duration of the Civil War grew. But Lincoln was polarizing because of his fidelity to the proposition that all men are created equal. That kind of polarization, based on unifying principles, is upside down today.\n\nGallup tells us that the most divisive president in modern history is Barack Obama. The second most divisive? George W. Bush. What are we fighting over that can possibly compare to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s war?\n\nMoney.\n\nProgressives have declared that the great war of our time is between the richest 1percent and everyone else. President Obama calls income inequality the \u201cdefining challenge of our time.\u201d Last March, economist Thomas Piketty published what has become the progressive manifesto in this war, \u201cCapital in the 21st Century,\u201d in which he warns that wealth inequality is becoming so severe that \u201ca revolution will likely occur.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments are echoed by such economists as Robert Reich, Paul Krugman, and Joseph Stiglitz. In a recent speech, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, reiterated the liberals\u2019 core message: \u201cSince 1980, guess how much of the growth in income the 90 percent got? Nothing. None. Zero.\u201d\n\nScholars often talk of the war of ideas, and in an important sense the distribution of income is the war of our times. The left has made class warfare the context for every political debate, whether it\u2019s about the tax code, the federal budget, or regulation of labor and financial markets. Many observers might think this is all well and good. As economists, we tend to agree that money issues are central to just about everything. What\u2019s upside down is that progressives have turned the idea of economic justice into a dishonest quagmire, one that is polarizing solely for political gain. They want to fight over the problem of inequality, not solve the problem of poverty.\n\nLincoln would shake his head at this squabble about inequality in the richest nation in history. \u201cHe never attacked wealth,\u201d explains Rich Lowry in \u201cLincoln Unbound,\u201d his biography of the 16th president. \u201cHe objected to the very notion of class conflict.\u201d Lincoln disliked Democrats\u2019 populism and mocked their message of rich versus poor. In a pivotal anti-slavery speech in New Haven, Conn., delivered a year before he was inaugurated, Lincoln advised, \u201cLeave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy.\u201d\n\nSo how do Republicans get out of this quagmire and elevate the debate? First, they need a strategy based on growth, work and opportunity. Before that, they need to completely reframe the debate over inequality, redistribution and protectionism. But before that, Republicans need to get back to the economics of the first Republican president. A century and a half after his death, the legacy of Abraham Lincoln has been taken prisoner by the other side.\n\nLincoln's Legacy\n\nLincoln\u2019s economic legacy is obscured by the larger historical issues of slavery and the Civil War, but his feelings on these topics were strong and steeped in decades of self-study. Indeed, his animosity toward slavery is rooted in an economic understanding of a person\u2019s right to control his or her own property and labor. Free labor is what Lincoln called it.\n\nNevertheless, Democratic presidents have routinely invoked Lincoln\u2019s name when rolling out their great initiatives. In a 2011 book, professor Jason Jividen of Saint Vincent College documents progressives\u2019 century-long effort to claim Lincoln. President Obama is just the latest in this long line. When FDR wanted to shore up support for his expansion of federal spending, he mentioned Abraham Lincoln at every turn. Former President Herbert Hoover pushed back in a keynote speech in 1939: \u201cWhatever this New Deal system is, it is certain that it did not come from Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson made the boldest claim on Lincoln. In February 1964, Johnson gave a reverent speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial that paved the way for his policy address one month later in which he declared a war on poverty. At a speech that fall in Dayton, Ohio, Johnson said: \u201cA great American president led this Union in a war against slavery 100 years ago. Lincoln abolished slavery in the United States. Today we are starting another war to abolish poverty in the United States among our people.\u201d So far, so good. But by 1965 LBJ was saying \u201cfreedom is not enough.\u201d Contrary to the core Lincoln principle, President Johnson declared, \u201cequal opportunity is essential but not enough, not enough.\u201d\n\nThe historical record of Lincoln\u2019s rise from poverty (which forged his view that more capital enhances work), his exhaustive campaigns against the anti-capitalist Democrats of the 1830s and 1840s, and his commitment to the idea of free labor need to be remembered.\n\nLincoln often said that his \u201cideal of a great man\u201d was Henry Clay (U.S. senator from Kentucky, secretary of state, three times the speaker of the House and frequent candidate for president as the nominee of the Whig Party). Lincoln even gave the eulogy at Clay\u2019s funeral. This history is important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Lincoln had the opportunity to join three political parties in his life: the Whigs (the capital party), the Republicans (the freedom party) and the Democrats (the populist party). He chose the first two, and railed relentlessly against the last until the day he died. Andrew Jackson and the Democrats of that era were staunchly against eastern capitalists, against the idea of national bank, against free labor and against Clay\u2019s \u201cAmerican System\u201d (what we would call pro-growth policies).\n\nClay famously said he would \u201crather be right than president.\u201d He got what he wanted during the elections of 1824, 1832, and a third time in 1844, losing to the party of the anti-bank Jacksonian Democrats each time. The 1832 election, pinnacle of what historians call the \u201cBank War,\u201d was won by Andrew Jackson. He quickly pulled all Treasury funds from the Second Bank of the United States, had its charter revoked, and saw it fail. It was a searing loss for the young Lincoln, who blamed the succeeding years of recession on the anti-capital policies of Jacksonian Democrats.\n\nLincoln\u2019s ghost warns us about today\u2019s progressives whose regular theme is the widening income gap in America. A sample, from Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz: \u201cThe top 1 percent seized more than 65 percent of the gain in total national income [from 2002-2007]. While the top 1 percent was doing fantastically, most Americans were actually growing worse off.\u201d Lincoln might well have countered: Did Jeff Bezos seize hundreds of millions of dollars Americans through his nefarious Amazon.com? Did rich Hollywood actors Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston seize our money and make us worse off with their entertainment? Or did Americans trade for these goods as free people?\n\nFreedom was always Lincoln\u2019s core message, and he believed in the American system of free markets because he saw that they brought real progress. He argued forcefully for new industries and federal investments, and against subsidizing old sectors. The renowned scholar Gabor S. Boritt wrote in his exhaustive economic history that Lincoln held \u201cJacksonian policies so largely responsible for the hard times [in the early 1840s] that he dared to based a full year\u2019s campaigning on the call for national banking.\u201d\n\nTwisting Lincoln and the North\u2019s crusade to end slavery, which Lincoln called \u201cthe cause of the war\u201d in his second inaugural speech, in the name of equality can only be done by confusing what was meant by equality in 1860. Equality meant equal opportunity to work and be secure in your property, not, as progressives wish, a more equal income distribution.\n\nReframing the Inequality Debate\n\nThe quagmire in the war of ideas can be blamed on elements on both political parties. There are ignorant right-wing populists and arrogant left-wing progressives who prefer (and politically profit) from the quagmire. Too many Republicans are reflexively hostile to immigration and too many Democrats are hostile to business and markets in general. Both stances are economically weak, but they persist because they poll well. The bipartisan fringe suspicion of central banking is also unwarranted, and runs counter to Lincoln\u2019s lifelong defense of banking\u2019s central role in promoting development.\n\nPopulism is, of course, nothing new. Lincoln had to accommodate the anti-immigrant Know-Nothing coalition in his day, just as he had to choose his words carefully not to offend farmers who reflexively distrusted eastern bankers. What is new and dangerous in 2015 is political smugness. The progressive left is not self-critical, or even curious, about the failings of its anti-poverty policies.\n\nAmerica\u2019s recent mid-term elections were a referendum on economic performance, not class warfare. The United States has repeatedly run trillion-dollar deficits under President Obama, yet labor force participation rates were decimated instead of stimulated. People feel double-crossed by the unfulfilled promises of the ironically named and incompetently launched Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThere was the widespread surprise over the scale of the Republican sweep, not just in the Senate but also the House, where with 250 seats they have the largest majority since 1929,\u201d says Elizabeth Drew, describing the historic and unexpected shift. Last spring, 10 U.S. Senate races were considered competitive. Actually, the forecast was accurate in only one case. Democratic candidates were swept out in nine of the 10 races, and nearly lost Virginia, too. Cory Gardner won in Colorado by three percentage points. Joni Ernst won in Iowa by nine points. Tom Cotton won in Arkansas by 17 points. Democrats don\u2019t even want to think about Montana. For over 100 years, the Montana Senate seat had been held by a Democrat, but Republican Steve Daines won it in November by almost 20 points.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cIt\u2019s a bad map,\u201d said Obama before votes were cast. Nancy Pelosi denied it was a wave election, calling it an \u201cebb tide\u201d as if the \u201cepic turnout collapse\u201d (David Wasserman\u2019s phrase) was some kind of accident by voters.\n\nAs for voters themselves, they told Gallup pollsters that the economy and unemployment were top concerns, whereas the \u201cgap between rich and poor\u201d was a single-digit issue (as it has been for the many decades Gallup has asked this question). Still another Gallup poll taken after the election found that the Democratic brand is in tatters: \u201cA record-low 36% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of the party.\u201d According to Ron Fournier, a respected journalist at National Journal: \u201cTwo-thirds of voters say the country is seriously on the wrong track, up 12 points since 2012.\u201d Fournier paints a picture of a frustrated public, hungry for fresh ideas that can restore the American Dream.\n\nTen percent of the U.S. economy\u2019s potential GDP and 9 million people from a workforce of 150 million are missing in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But in place of a serious discussion of policy, the left warned of greedy bankers and secular stagnation. Despite raising income taxes on the high income taxpayers, President Obama claimed one more tax hike was the tonic.\n\nTurn the channel and you\u2019ll see economist Joseph Stiglitz citing his book, \u201cThe Price of Inequality,\u201d or maybe the documentary by former Treasury Secretary Robert Reich, \u201cInequality for All.\u201d Go to the movies to escape, but no, it\u2019s a rich-poor dystopia in the future, too. There\u2019s Matt Damon\u2019s \u201cElysium\u201d or Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s \u201cHunger Games.\u201d And maybe that\u2019s the message. We don\u2019t live in those worlds any more than we live in the strange dystopian world described by Thomas Piketty.\n\nThere\u2019s been an awful lot of debunking of \u201cCapital\u201d since \u201cPiketymania\u201d was declared on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek. Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute and Alan J. Auerbach, a professor at UC Berkeley, presented a paper at the 2015 American Economic Association meetings in January that documents pretty serious data problems in \u201cCapital.\u201d\n\nMIT graduate student Matt Rognlie presented an insightful comment on the MarginalRevolution.com blog months ago that led to a formal invitation to present his critique at prestigious Brookings economics conference just weeks ago. Rognlie\u2019s basic point is that capital ain\u2019t what it used to be. The industrial notion of smokestack factories has been largely supplanted by fast-depreciating microchips, software, and brand equity. \u201c[H]ousing\u2014accounts for nearly 100 percent of the long-term increase in the capital/income ratio,\u201d he writes. And one of us wrote an essay showing that the underlying arguments for Piketty\u2019s r>g hypothesis actually suggest not taxing capital at all.\n\nBesides, as George Mason University economics professor Garett Jones has argued, Piketty\u2019s dystopian projections are possible only if wealthy people never, ever consume. The criticisms have basically ended the book\u2019s status as a serious contribution in policy circles. But in the world politics, well, that\u2019s a different matter.\n\nSimply put, wouldn\u2019t America be better off having 50 entrepreneurs like Steve Wozniak and Mark Zuckerberg rather than zero, even if they make Gini coefficients worse? Innovators may exacerbate inequality as a consequence of their success, but are the rest of us really worse off because of them?\n\nThere\u2019s one outstanding line in \u201cCapital\u2019s\u201d 685 pages in this regard. It epitomizes the progressive worldview: powerful, exaggerated, technically defensible, economically nonsensical, right there on page 261: \u201cAnd the poorer half of the population are as poor today as they were in the past, with barely 5 percent of total wealth in 2010, just as in 1910. Basically, all the middle class managed to get its hands on was a few crumbs.\u201d\n\nNotice how he conflates the idea of \u201cpoor\u201d with \u201cunequal.\u201d For Piketty to say the middle class of 2010 is materially no better off than the middle class of 1910 is not just wrong, but brazen. A century of progress amounts to crumbs? And no, it\u2019s not a mistranslation. Piketty says it again and again throughout the book. This is the progressive mantra.\n\nCrumbs equals air conditioning, smart phones, the vaccine for polio, global eradication of smallpox, Lasik surgery, scotch tape, rock music, radio, television, cable television, downloadable digital video, credit cards, the Internet, satellites, cruise control, electronics, antibiotics, and over a billion Facebook friends. These things did not exist in 1910. They cost very little but generate immeasurable consumer welfare.\n\nTwo important patents were granted in 1910 \u2013 one for traffic lights, another for the washing machine. China outlawed slavery in 1910. Women were allowed to vote Washington in 1910, but it would be another decade before Republicans could overcome Democratic resistance to it nationwide. In 1910, the infant mortality rate in the United States was 20 times higher than today. But here is the kicker: per capita GDP was $5,000 in 1910, a fraction of what it is today. Crumbs?\n\nLift Piketty\u2019s hefty \u201cCapital\u201d and you have in your hands the central contradiction of modern progressivism: a disbelief in human progress.\n\nThe Opportunity Agenda\n\nWe believe the way out of the class-war quagmire is to focus on opportunity for poor Americans. First and foremost, Americans want to work. So where are the jobs? Government regulations and red tape enacted by Obama have slowed economic growth and repressed workforce participation. Second, tax rates matter, especially for Americans caught in what social scientists call the \u201cpoverty trap\u201d of well-intentioned welfare programs that actually penalize poor people for making more money. But most importantly, Republicans should shine a light on the real inequality in America, which is not about wealth or income, but education.\n\nThe definitive national assessment of national literacy finds an outrageous gap among Americans, summed up in the USA Today headline: \u201c1 In 7 U.S. Adults Are Unable to Read This Story.\u201d Forget the identity politics used to divide Americans by race, gender, income \u2013 the reality is that one in seven Americans are functionally illiterate. They cannot understand an electricity bill or decipher \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web.\u201d They will never read these words. And the fault for that is almost entirely the state monopoly over primary education.\n\nWhen poor and middle-class parents watch their kids disserved by public schools \u2013 with no choice to liberate their own children from weak teachers, excessive bureaucracy, and outdated courses \u2013 they know the progressive agenda has failed them. Here is the high ground for the politics of growth and an opportunity in the coming campaign. It\u2019s not a matter of big government, rather it is effective government, meaning that the government must operate as well as fund public goods like health, education, transportation, you name it.\n\nTo be sure, the conservative case for fiscal balance is more important than ever. The federal government cannot continue to spend billions of dollars every day that it does not have. But conservatives need to make a bold, new case in the war of ideas about the shape of government that is arguably more important than the fight over its size. The inefficiency of government-run education is the clearest case, and reshaping it is the way to win the war of ideas. For example: argue not to cut education expenditures -- rather, give the funds directly to parents so they can shop for the best education for their children.\n\nWhen government spends money on research, it should fund basic science, not try to manipulate markets by investing directly in well-connected companies. In other words, keep DARPA and drop Solyndra.\n\nThe federal government of 1862 had little funds, but its land was plentiful. Why not give it away, raw, directly to any American who would work for it? That was the Homestead Act. Opportunity in the form of 160 acres in exchange for five years\u2019 work to improve it was Lincoln\u2019s deal, and it led to tremendous economic development of the West.\n\nIn our time, a government focused on opportunity for everyone to succeed will have to completely rethink the way taxes and regulations affect incentives. Too many \u201cprogressive\u201d laws are effectively anti-work. The growth of federal regulations in the past half century correlates with the decline of startup companies and new jobs.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy to win this war of ideas. It might be impossible for progressives to actually believe in progress. But our fight to reshape government was Lincoln\u2019s, too. Wage labor, in his day, was a new kind of economic relationship that was called worse than slavery by southern critics, just as it was being mocked by anti-capitalist Europeans.\n\nLet\u2019s remember: Marx\u2019s \u201cDas Kapital\u201d was published in 1867. Free labor was Lincoln\u2019s mantra: \u201cThe penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land, for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.\u201d This, Lincoln said, is \u201cthe prosperous system, which opens the way for all\u2014gives hope to all, and energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all.\u201d\n\nGlenn Hubbard is the dean of the Columbia Business School and former chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. Tim Kane is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and has twice served as a senior economist on the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress.
