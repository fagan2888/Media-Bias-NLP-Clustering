Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, this season’s NFL most valuable player, created the #ItsAaron video campaign to shine a light on organizations and people who are changing the world.

In the most recent episode, Rodgers makes a stop at Camp Hometown Heroes in Milwaukee, Wis., surprising four kids whose parents are fallen veterans.

The four children all lost their fathers in battle at a young age.

Camp Hometown Heroes, founded in 2013, holds a free week-long overnight summer camp for children and younger siblings of fallen U.S service members.

The goal is to eventually spread the camp into different states all over the country.

One young fan was completely shocked and amazed by Rodgers’ appearance and quickly grabbed a selfie with the famous quarterback.

Please watch and share. These kids and this organization are so deserving. http://t.co/tvF9ASaJ3a #ItsAaron #mke pic.twitter.com/grJEpePyjg — CI Design Inc. MKE (@CIDesignInc) January 28, 2015
