Currently, only 14 women sit in Mali\u2019s 147-member parliament, three women belong to President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita\u2019s Cabinet of 33 ministers, and men claim the vast bulk of civil service positions.\n\nActivists see the quota idea as a way to jump-start the drive for equal rights between the sexes.\n\n\u201cWe no longer want men only to be selected for high-level responsibilities in Mali,\u201d said Djeneba Sy, 50, president of the National Union of Young Women Muslims.\n\nThe push for more representation in government is a remarkable development in Mali, where 90 percent of the population is Muslim, and where the former colonial power France intervened just three years ago to defeat an al Qaeda-linked Islamic insurgency in the north. A truce signed in 2013 has since broken down, and rape and violence against women remain common in the war-torn north despite the continued presence of French forces. The government and rebels are slated to sign another peace accord on May 15.\n\nBefore the French intervention, Islamist and Tuareg rebels established a brief regime in the north that enforced Shariah law, with Malian women confined indoors and forced to wear full-body, face-covering veils. A Human Rights Watch investigation said reports of forced marriage and rape also soared.\n\n\u201cThe jihadists inflicted so much on the women in the north of the country,\u201d Katie Orlinsky, a New York photographer who traveled to the north for a reporting trip in 2013, told The New York Times last year. \u201cIt made just living almost illegal for women.\u201d\n\nEven in areas not controlled by radical groups, women play a secondary role in Malian society, according to conservative Muslim mores. While the country\u2019s constitution states that men and women are technically equal, the law designates that men are the head of families and wives must obey their husbands. Educational opportunities for women are limited. Traditional female genital mutilation practices are widespread throughout the country, according to the United Nations.\n\nLast year, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report ranked Mali 138th out of 142 countries in a global survey of the state of women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cOur culture is the basis of the problem,\u201d said Ms. Sy. \u201cWomen have to obey their husbands. A woman hasn\u2019t the right to raise her voice while talking to her husband. Men don\u2019t even impose themselves on women \u2014 women voluntarily accept to be submissive in our society.\u201d\n\nThe proposed legislation would compel political parties to nominate a quota of women as candidates in elections. Advocates hope the law would apply to local elections in October.\n\nMounting opposition\n\nPowerful Muslim groups are already lining up against the measure, however.\n\nAmong the legislation\u2019s most influential opponents are Sabati 2012, an alliance of young Muslim activists that supported Mr. Keita during his successful election bid in the run-up to 2013 elections. Sabati means \u201csuccess\u201d in Bambara, the predominant language in Mali. In exchange for that campaign help, the group expects the president to fulfill his promise of upholding conservative Islamic values, said Boubacar Bah, the head of Sabati 2012. \u201cHe must respect his commitment, given that this bill is opposed to our tradition,\u201d said Mr. Bah.\n\n\u201cThere are two extremisms in Mali, religious extremism and secular extremism, and we want to combat secular extremism,\u201d added Mr. Bah. \u201cThey must know that we don\u2019t need the secular tradition that is in France.\u201d\n\nDespite Sabati 2012\u2019s opposition, President Keita supports the proposal and has asked lawmakers in his party, Rally for Mali, to support the bill. But while they control the largest bloc in parliament, they don\u2019t have a majority.\n\nAnother religious organization that opposes the legislation, the Mali Islamic High Council, killed a women\u2019s rights bill in 2009. That law would have granted women permission to work without their husband\u2019s permission, for example. But the council organized rallies throughout the country that persuaded then-President Amadou Toumani Toure to add provisions to the final version of the law that undercut women\u2019s rights, including reducing the legal age of marriage from 18 to 16.\n\nMahmoud Dicko, president of Mali Islamic High Council, said there is little support for quotas for women in government in Mali. The Malian government is pursuing the bill at the behest of Western countries and international organizations in return for financial aid, outside pressure that Mr. Dicko thinks his country should resist.\n\n\u201cEven when you are starving, there is food you should refuse,\u201d said Mr. Dicko. \u201cThe authorities mustn\u2019t accept changing laws to obtain aid money.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Sy said Islam doesn\u2019t proscribe women\u2019s participation in government. The problem is political, as men decide everything in the National Assembly. \u201cMost of the parliament members are men, and they don\u2019t want to pass a law giving more public responsibilities to women,\u201d she said.\n\nMama Koite, a leading Malian women\u2019s rights activist, said the proposed law is essential to breaking the cycle of men oppressing women who can\u2019t change Malian laws, because cultural and legal roadblocks prevent them from sitting in parliament. If more women sat in Mali\u2019s parliament, she said, they could slowly but surely bring about other changes in society.\n\n\u201cThe bill on the quota for women will help reduce the discrimination against women and girls in terms of access to opportunities,\u201d said Ms. Koite. \u201cThe legislation isn\u2019t sufficient by itself, but it will advance the efforts of women\u2019s rights defense organizations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unlikely battle in an unlikely place has broken out over a bid to guarantee Mali's women a seat at the political table in this poor, conflict-ridden and heavily Muslim African country.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An unlikely battle in an unlikely place has broken out over a bid to guarantee Mali\u2019s women a seat at the political table in this poor, conflict-ridden and heavily Muslim African country.", "title": "Mali law would reserve one-third of government jobs for women", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/3/mali-law-would-reserve-one-third-of-government-job/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/Mali1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/Mali1.jpg", "description": "An unlikely battle in an unlikely place has broken out over a bid to guarantee Mali's women a seat at the political table in this poor, conflict-ridden and heavily Muslim African country.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mali law would reserve one-third of government jobs for women"}, "Author": "Soumaila T.
