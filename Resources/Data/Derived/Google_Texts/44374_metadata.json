But in the first year, requests for payments dwarfed deposits into the program.\n\nJulia Hutchins, CEO of Colorado HealthOP, responded by promising to fight on behalf of its 80,000 members.\n\n\u201cThe federal government,\u201d she said, \u201chas reneged on its obligations to pay Colorado HealthOP more than $10 million,\u201d jeopardizing its capital reserves.\n\nAt worst, the cooperative could go out of business, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s serious. Our fate is not certain, but we\u2019re certainly at risk.\u201d\n\nThe program payments due under federal law will be spread out over three years. But, given this year\u2019s shortage, \u201cthe accountants have a hard time believing the government will do better next year,\u201d Hutchins said.\n\nKelly Crowe, CEO of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs, said the lower-than-expected payments \u201cappear to be hindering the viability of new entrants to the marketplace.\u201d\n\nBut Crowe said she believes the government \u201cis committed to fully funding the risk-corridor program over its life\u201d and to helping stabilize the cooperatives.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, asked Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to investigate the financial viability of Colorado HealthOP. He cited previous failures of new health co-ops in Nevada, Louisiana, Iowa and Nebraska.\n\n\u201cIn light of this recent announcement,\u201d Gardner said Friday, \u201cI\u2019m calling on Secretary Burwell to answer those questions as quickly as possible and provide Coloradans with the answers they deserve.\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health cooperative says feds reneged on promised payment", "title": "Colorado health cooperative says feds reneged on promised payment", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/02/colorado-health-cooperative-says-feds-reneged-on-promised-payment/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-02T17:59:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T17:59:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd0f\"", "article_summary": "Colorado\u2019s nonprofit health cooperative says its future has been jeopardized by an unexpectedly low payment from a federal program intended to help more people acquire health insurance.\nJulia Hutchins, CEO of Colorado HealthOP, responded by promising to fight on behalf of its 80,000 members.\nEarlier this week, U.S. Sen.
