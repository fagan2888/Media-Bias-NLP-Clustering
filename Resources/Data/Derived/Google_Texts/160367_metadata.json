He resigned amid a controversy over his offshore holdings. (APTN via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The leak of millions of records on offshore accounts claimed its first high-profile political casualty Tuesday as Iceland\u2019s prime minister stepped aside amid outrage over revelations he had used such a shell company to shelter large sums while Iceland\u2019s economy was in crisis.\n\nIcelandic leader Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is the first major figure brought down by the publication of the names of rich and powerful people linked to the leaks, dubbed the Panama Papers.\n\nChina and Russia, meanwhile, took the opposite approach, suppressing the news and rejecting any allegations of impropriety by government officials named in the leak of more than 11 million financial documents from a Panamanian law firm.\n\nOfficials in Ukraine, Argentina and other countries are also facing questions about possibly dubious offshore tax-avoidance schemes.\n\nThe reports are from a global group of news organizations working with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. They have been processing records from the Mossack Fonseca law firm that were first leaked to Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.\n\nThe announcement that Gunnlaugsson was stepping down as leader of Iceland\u2019s coalition government came from his deputy, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, who is also the country\u2019s agriculture minister. It followed the refusal by Iceland\u2019s president to dissolve parliament and call a new election, and after thousands of Icelanders protested outside the parliament building in Reykjavik.\n\nNo replacement has yet been named, and President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson did not immediately confirm that he had accepted the resignation. Late Tuesday, a government statement said Gunnlaugsson had suggested Johannsson take over as prime minister for \u201can unspecified amount of time,\u201d while Gunnlauggson would stay on as leader of his center-right Progressive Party.\n\nGunnlaugson has denied any wrongdoing and said he and his wife have paid all their taxes. He also said his financial holdings didn\u2019t affect his negotiations with Iceland\u2019s creditors during the country\u2019s acute financial crisis.\n\nThe leaked documents allege that Gunnlaugsson and his wife set up a company called Wintris in the British Virgin Islands with the help of the Panamanian law firm. Gunnlaugsson is accused of a conflict of interest for failing to disclose his involvement in the company, which held interests in failed Icelandic banks that his government was responsible for overseeing.\n\nIceland, a volcanic North Atlantic island nation with a population of 330,000, was rocked by a prolonged financial crisis when its main commercial banks collapsed within a week of one another in 2008.\n\nSince then Icelanders have weathered a deep recession and been subjected to tough capital controls \u2014 another reason the prime minister\u2019s offshore holdings rankle many.\n\nChina, on the other hand, dismissed as \u201cgroundless\u201d reports that the Panamanian law firm had arranged offshore companies for relatives of at least eight present or past members of the Communist Party\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of power in China.\n\nAmong those named in the leaked documents was the brother-in-law of President Xi Jinping. State media have ignored the reports and searches of websites and social media for the words \u201cPanama documents\u201d were blocked.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he would not discuss the reports further and declined to say whether the individuals named would be investigated.\n\n\u201cFor these groundless accusations, I have no comment,\u201d Hong told reporters at a regularly scheduled news conference.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s president was accused of abusing his office and of tax evasion by moving his candy business offshore, possibly depriving the country of millions of dollars in taxes.\n\nShell companies aren\u2019t in themselves illegal. People or companies might use them to reduce their tax bill legally, by benefiting from low tax rates in countries like Panama, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. But the practice is frowned upon, particularly when used by politicians, who then face criticism for not contributing to their own countries\u2019 economies.\n\nBecause offshore accounts and companies also hide the names of the ultimate owners of investments, they can be used to illegally evade taxes or launder money.\n\nMossack Fonseca says it obeys all laws relating to company registrations and does not advise people how to evade taxes.\n\nThe firm said in a statement that \u201cour industry is not particularly well understood by the public, and unfortunately this series of articles will only serve to deepen that confusion.\n\n\u201cThe facts are these: While we may have been the victim of a data breach, nothing in this illegally obtained cache of documents suggests we\u2019ve done anything wrong or illegal, and that\u2019s very much in keeping with the global reputation we\u2019ve worked hard to build over the past 40 years of doing business the right way.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Group of 20 \u2014 which includes China \u2014 have agreed on paper to tighten laws relating to shell companies and make sure authorities can find out who the real owners are. Actual legislation at the national level has lagged behind the promises, however.\n\nThe appearance of offshore accounts in political scandals is far from new. Shell companies played a role in the corruption scandal involving the Petrobras oil company in Brazil. The U.S. Justice Department said in an indictment last year that offshore accounts were used to mask the transfer of bribes to officials at FIFA, the global soccer federation.\n\nSueddeutsche Zeitung, working with Germany\u2019s NDR and WDR public television stations, reported Monday that 14 German banks had used Mossack Fonseca\u2019s services to set up 1,200 letterbox companies for clients.\n\nThe report said use of offshore company registrations had spiked after the European Union introduced regulations in 2005 requiring countries to exchange tax information on individual people, but not for companies. Many of the accounts, however, have since been closed.\n\nThe EU has since tightened its rules on offshore companies under its Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which is being phased in as national governments pass local laws to comply by June 26, 2017. The new rules tighten requirements for companies to keep accurate information on their real owners and to make that available to authorities.\n\nWritten by Jill Lawless and David McHugh\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/05/iceland-leader-becomes-first-to-fall-in-offshore-holdings-leak/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Iceland-Offshore-Acco_Bunk-e1461867617359.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Bahamas, brazil, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, china, corruption, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, law firms, money laundering, offshore accounts, Panama, panama papers, prime minister, Russia, shell companies, shelter, tax dodge, tax evasion, tax haven, U.K."}, "description": "The leak of millions of records on offshore accounts claimed its first high-profile political casualty Tuesday as Iceland's prime minister stepped aside amid", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Iceland-Offshore-Acco_Bunk-e1461867617359.jpg"}, "keywords": "iceland,prime minister,offshore accounts,panama papers,bahamas,brazil,british virgin islands,cayman islands,china,corruption,germany,great britain,law firms,money laundering,panama,russia,shell companies,shelter,tax dodge,tax evasion,tax haven,u.k.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Iceland leader becomes first to fall in offshore holdings leakPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/05/iceland-leader-becomes-first-to-fall-in-offshore-holdings-leak/Iceland's Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson leaves after holding a meeting in Parliament in Reykjavik Tuesday.\nThe appearance of offshore accounts in political scandals is far from new.\nThe EU has since tightened its rules on offshore companies under its Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which is being phased in as national governments pass local laws to comply by June 26, 2017.\nBecause offshore accounts and companies also hide the names of the ultimate owners of investments, they can be used to illegally evade taxes or launder money.\nThe U.S. Justice Department said in an indictment last year that offshore accounts were used to mask the transfer of bribes to officials at FIFA, the global soccer federation."}
