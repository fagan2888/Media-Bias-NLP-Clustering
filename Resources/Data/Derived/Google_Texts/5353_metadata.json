We are just so thankful and grateful.\"\n\nOrganizers had planned for a large crowd, but still say they were surprised with the turnout.\n\nNorthstar Church Pastor Roy Mansfield said, \"There were more people who came than we had food for.\"\n\nHe said, \"It was heartbreaking that there were people who were hungry and we didn't have enough food for them.\"\n\nOfficials say there is a huge hunger problem in Bay County.\n\nDr. Paula Kaye Jones with A Hand Up International said, \"It's a choice from month-to-month, do we pay out electricity bill or do we have food? With some of these families it's not even about having Thanksgiving, it's about having food on the table.\"\n\nSome of the distribution centers ran out food even before the doors opened.\n\nMansfield said, \"I was just as blown away by the overwhelming generosity of people. There were a couple people who came up to me and said, 'I think there might be people who need this more than I do.' They just left so those people could be served.\"\n\nOrganizers fed about 6,000 people Saturday.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Northstar Church partnered with an international charity to help feed 5,000 Bay County families in need this Thanksgiving.
