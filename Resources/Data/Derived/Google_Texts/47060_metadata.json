Long-term-care insurance pays for help with daily activities like bathing and dressing, if you can no longer do them yourself.\n\nThe new approach faces a challenge, however. The National Women\u2019s Law Center in January filed administrative complaints against Genworth and three other insurers on the grounds that gender-based premiums for long-term-care insurance violated a provision of the Affordable Care Act that bars sex discrimination in health care.\n\nThe complaints were filed with the Office for Civil Rights at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, or H.H.S., against Genworth, John Hancock, Transamerica and Mutual of Omaha.\n\nThe complaints say that because the insurers offer long-term care policies through Medicaid partnership programs in some states, they receive federal assistance, so under the health law, they cannot discriminate on the basis of sex.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d said Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the women\u2019s law center. \u201cThese discriminatory premiums now in effect should be eliminated.\u201d\n\nLong-term care insurers say they adopted gender-based premiums to reflect the reality that women tend to live longer than men and are more likely to use benefits.\n\nGenworth uses gender-based pricing because it is supported by actuarial data, Tom McInerney, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an email. Women own about 58 percent of policies, he said, but account for nearly 67 percent of all claims. \u201cInsurance companies must be able to charge premiums that appropriately account for the underlying risks being insured,\u201d he said.\n\nTransamerica said it was \u201cconfident the complaint does not have any merit\u201d with respect to its participation in any partnership plans, adding that it intended \u201cto participate in any H.H.S. inquiry to demonstrate that our policies do not violate any provision of the A.C.A.\u201d\n\nMutual of Omaha said it did not comment on pending legal matters. John Hancock did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWomen typically account for about two-thirds of the long-term-care insurance claims paid annually, said Jesse Slome, spokesman for the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, an industry group. Last year, companies paid $7.5 billion in claims.\n\nThe effect is that women will now pay several hundred dollars more a year in long-term-care premiums than a man would for a comparable policy, according to the association\u2019s 2014 report, based on data from insurers. (The new gender-based premiums apply to new policies, not policies that were in place before the change took effect.)\n\nIf you are a single 55-year-old man in good health buying a new policy, you can expect to pay $925 a year, on average, for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits, without any built-in inflation protection. If you are a woman of the same age and health, though, you will pay an average of $1,225 a year for the same policy \u2014 a difference of $300, or more than 30 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe difference in premiums is greater if you buy a policy that builds in inflation protection of 3 percent, compounded annually, for your benefits. (Your pool of benefits under this option would grow to $325,000 at age 80.) The same 55-year-old healthy man would pay $1,765 a year for that policy, but a woman would pay $2,307.\n\nA typical single woman will pay an average of 12 percent more than in 2013, the association found.\n\nThe impact of gender pricing for couples who buy a policy together varies by insurer, Mr. Slome said. Some companies price policies for a couple based on their rates for single men or women, while others offer a blended couples rate. (Genworth said its gender-specific pricing applied only to single policies.) Insurers typically offer a significant couples discount. The average premium for couples for insurance with inflation protection has risen by about 3 percent from last year, the association said.\n\nHere are some other questions to consider about long-term care insurance:\n\n\u25a0 How can I get the lowest premium available?\n\nMr. Slome urges consumers to shop around because premiums for similar coverage can vary significantly among insurers. Rose Clayton, an insurance broker in Orange County, Calif., advises women to keep the extra premium in perspective. When female clients learn of the higher cost for women, she said, they\u2019re not pleased, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a deal-breaker.\u201d For many, it reinforces the need to plan for their old age. \u201cOne only has to visit a nursing home or assisted living\u201d facility to see the impact of women\u2019s longevity, she said.\n\n\u25a0 Do any states prohibit gender-based premiums for long-term-care insurance?\n\nAt least two states, Colorado and Montana, require unisex pricing.\n\n\u25a0 Can I buy a policy with inflation protection of more than 3 percent?\n\nYes, but the premiums for those policies \u2014 which were once standard in the industry \u2014 are more expensive. A few companies offer a middle option that allows you to pay more to retain the option of adding coverage later.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140211182250, "twitter":
