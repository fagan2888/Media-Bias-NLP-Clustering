NOBLESVILLE, Ind. (WISH) — A number of puppies found neglected with the Parvovirus are recovering thanks to community support.

In Katie Trennepohl’s home video, her three foster puppies romp around, playing like puppies so often do.

“They are starting to feel a little bit better, starting to act a little bit more like puppies,” said Trennepohl.

It’s a far cry from when she got them yesterday.

“First one I picked up had her head in the water bowl. She didn’t even have the energy to move her head out of it after she had gotten a drink,” said Trennepohl

It was a case of animal neglect.

Indianapolis Animal Care and Control found a house with 21 puppies, all exposed to the Parvovirus; a highly contagious and often fatal disease.

Rebecca Stevens with the Humane Society for Hamilton County took in 13 of them.

“I would definitely call this a hoarding situation and, as with most hoarders, they go into it with the best of intentions and my understanding is this particular individual was trying to rescue puppies that she was finding on Craigslist,” said Stevens.

Without vaccinations, it only took one puppy to contract the disease before it spread.

In all, four died so far.

But thanks to the Humane Society of Hamilton County and Lucky Dog Rescue, most of the puppies are being given a second chance.

“This morning they were up and wagging their tail. One was actually coming to me seeking attention, wanting to be petted, which is a big step from yesterday when they didn’t even want to pick up their heads,” said Trennepohl. .

The Humane Society for Hamilton County is accepting donations at its website to help with the treatment of the puppies.
