But the logic of their argument implicitly agreed that what is terminated in an abortion is more meaningful than an inflamed appendix.\n\nAs a consequence, the pro-life movement has pushed the country more in its direction. And it also allowed some limitations on the abortion license.\n\nThat has some pro-choicers taking off their masks and coming out as pro-abortion. Case in point: A column in today\u2019s Washington Post by Janet Harris. From, \u201cStop Calling Abortion a Difficult Decision:\u201d\n\nWhen the pro-choice community frames abortion as a difficult decision, it implies that women need help deciding, which opens the door to paternalistic and demeaning \u201cinformed consent\u201d laws. It also stigmatizes abortion and the women who need it\u2026\n\nPro-choice advocates use the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d formulation for a similar reason, so as not to demonize women. It also permits pro-choice candidates to look less dogmatic. But there\u2019s a more pernicious result when pro-choice advocates use such language: It is a tacit acknowledgment that terminating a pregnancy is a moral issue requiring an ethical debate. To say that deciding to have an abortion is a \u201chard choice\u201d implies a debate about whether the fetus should live, thereby endowing it with a status of being. It puts the focus on the fetus rather than the woman. As a result, the question \u201cWhat kind of future would the woman have as a result of an unwanted pregnancy?\u201d gets sacrificed. By implying that terminating a pregnancy is a moral issue, pro-choice advocates forfeit control of the discussion to anti-choice conservatives.\n\nIn other words, the humanity of the dead fetus matters not a whit. That\u2019s known as truth in advertising.\n\nLike this pro-life news article?

Roe permitted limits.\n\nIn contrast\u2013as I have written\u2013a ruling that protects abortion as necessary to protect sexual equality would permit abortion through the ninth month\u2013if not beyond\u2013with the only regulations permitted being those required for basic sanitation.\n\nAfter that, the next step would be to require free abortion, either paid by the state or required as coverage under Obamacare. Pro-abortionists believe that women won\u2019t really be free until they are guaranteed the right to a dead fetus.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
