The event is free and open to the public. MSU photo by Kelly Gorham.\n\nThroughout his career, Montana State University Nursing Professor Peter Buerhaus has seen firsthand how research can transform national conversation on an issue as important \u2013 and complicated \u2013 as health care delivery.\n\nHe witnessed it after publishing a paper in a respected medical journal 15 years ago that first alerted the country to a potentially dire situation \u2013 the retirement of the baby boom generation of nurses at the very same time that the nation\u2019s 75 million plus baby boomers would begin consuming vastly more health care services themselves. He observed how published research influenced the private sector, followed by the U.S. Congress and other bodies, and reshaped the understanding of the nursing profession. He saw how research persuaded a commission that accredits hospitals to create avenues for nurses to provide more input. And he saw how his interdisciplinary approach to studies of the health care workforce was valued when, in 2010, he was appointed chair of the National Health Care Workforce Commission that was established under The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to advise both the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President on national health care workforce policy.\n\nNow, the renowned nursing economist will discuss his career and groundbreaking research at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 19, when he delivers the third lecture in this year\u2019s Provost\u2019s Distinguished Lecturer Series at MSU. The lecture, \u201cAn Unconventional Journey: Studies of the health care workforce and their impact on private and public policy-making,\u201d will be given at the Museum of the Rockies\u2019 Hager Auditorium. It is free and open to the public, and a reception will follow.\n\nDuring the event, Buerhaus plans to discuss his notable published research, his collaborative work with the chairman of a large hospital board, a Johnson & Johnson educational campaign which Buerhaus\u2019 research helped develop, his election into the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Medicine, Buerhaus\u2019 appointment to the National Health Care Workforce Commission and his plans for his career at Montana State.\n\nThroughout the lecture, Buerhaus intends to illustrate how research can invigorate a profession and influence a large industry, with a particular focus on motivating students to consider careers in nursing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we all strive for in research,\u201d Buerhaus said. \u201cTo produce results that have meaning, that provoke change. I have been very fortunate to have been involved in research that has had extraordinary influence and led to change, both within the nursing workforce and on improving the quality of health care.\u201d\n\nBuerhaus\u2019 family introduced him to health care careers: his father was a hospital administrator \u2013 the family moved frequently throughout Buerhaus\u2019 growing up years for his father\u2019s job \u2013 and his older sister enrolled in a nursing program after high school and then encouraged Buerhaus to do the same.\n\nHis father, especially, made a lasting impression about the potential to do good in health care.\n\n\u201cMy father was a very ethical man. At the time in health care, in the 60s and early 70s, there was so much money, but no accountability\u2026. Consequently, there was a lot of fraud and abuse,\u201d Buerhaus said. \u201cMy father stood up to that. I saw him doing the right thing, often to his personal peril. Early in my life I had developed an innate understanding that health care could be better. Later, I came to understand the power of economic incentives that so often determine whether the system changes and improves or stays the same, protecting the status quo.\u201d\n\nThinking that he wanted to work as a nurse anesthetist at the Mayo Clinic, Buerhaus enrolled in a bachelor\u2019s program in nursing at Mankato State University. But after graduating and working as a nurse, Buerhaus instead decided to pursue administrative work. During his second semester in a master\u2019s program in nursing health services administration at the University of Michigan, he enrolled in a course in microeconomics. It was a pivotal moment.\n\n\u201cI began taking a course in health economics, and a light bulb went on,\u201d Buerhaus said. \u201cI realized that eventually the fee for service payment system would collapse and that the system would seek greater value for each dollar spent. If the nursing profession played it right \u2013 focus on providing evidence of its impact on the quality and safety of health care \u2013 nurses could eventually play a much bigger and better role in helping guide the development of a better health care delivery system. Not just to advance (the nursing profession), but to provide better and more meaningful health care for society.\u201d\n\nBuerhaus was convinced that pursuing a doctorate in nursing and economics was the next step, but it wasn\u2019t without struggle. He began to doubt his choice after failing two qualifying exams.\n\n\u201cWhen the (exam) content wasn\u2019t what I had expected and prepared for, I didn\u2019t pass, I felt betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like maybe there was too much against me. Maybe nursing and economics was like oil and water: they just wouldn\u2019t mix. Maybe the nursing profession was too narrow, too bruised. But I persevered. I just moved on.\u201d\n\nHe was also buoyed by a job he loved: assistant to the chief executive officer of the University of Michigan Medical Center\u2019s seven teaching hospitals. He had always liked policy and politics, and the position gave him the opportunity to participate firsthand in the politics of a large health care institution.\n\n\u201cIt was informative. I spent considerable time in Washington working on issues such as hospitals\u2019 payment for capital and graduate medical education payments. These challenges motivated me and kept me determined to get my Ph.D.,\u201d Buerhaus said.\n\nBuerhaus began to see some of the fruits of his hard work. He went on to complete a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation postdoctoral faculty fellowship in health care finance at Johns Hopkins University. He then landed a position as an assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health, where he developed the Harvard Nursing Research Institute and its postdoctoral program in nursing health services research.\n\nAfter eight years at Harvard, Buerhaus went to Vanderbilt University, where he was named the Valere Potter Distinguished Professor of Nursing in Vanderbilt\u2019s School of Nursing. He worked with leaders in the medical school to create an environment of interdisciplinary research. Later he was named director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Health Workforce Studies, a cooperative affiliation between the nursing and medical schools. He worked to develop a new Department of Health Policy, which is housed at the Institute for Medicine and Public Health at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nBuerhaus first came to MSU in 2014 to attend a conference on rural health care in nursing \u2013 a topic with which he had become increasingly interested. He and his wife liked the area and found themselves considering Bozeman as a possible place to eventually retire. Then, during the conference, Buerhaus met a faculty member from the MSU College of Nursing, as well as MSU College of Nursing Dean Helen Melland. Several months later, Buerhaus again visited MSU, this time to consider a career move.\n\n\u201cI met with the dean, the vice president for research and economic development, the president and the provost. These meetings allowed me to obtain a reading of their spirit, their sense of purpose, their leadership. It made me feel comfortable that this was an organization that was changing, moving, heading in the right direction, unafraid,\u201d Buerhaus said. \u201cThe college (was) very close to its mission of educating good nurses who are going to improve the health of Montanans\u2026I found authentic faculty and authentic students with a clear mission.\u201d\n\nBuerhaus joined MSU and the College of Nursing in 2015.\n\nMelland said the university is fortunate to have Buerhaus as a member of its faculty.\n\n\u201cDr. Buerhaus is a nationally acclaimed nurse researcher and health care economist,\u201d Melland said. \u201cHis expertise was recognized when he was elected to the National Academies\u2019 Institute of Medicine and appointed chair of the National Health Care Workforce Commission, a commission that, when funded, will advise Congress on barriers limiting health care workforce production and encouraging innovations that can address the current and future personnel requirements of the U.S. health care system. Dr. Buerhaus will contribute significantly to MSU and to the state of Montana and beyond as he studies the role and impact of nurses in the reformed health care environment, especially in rural America.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Buerhaus\u2019 work is motivated by a desire to help the nursing profession better realize its potential to advance humanity.\n\n\u201cHuman beings have enormous potential to do good in whatever way one defines good, but so often that potential is not realized,\u201d Buerhaus said. \u201cWhen it comes to health, nurses\u2019 potential has often been under-recognized and underutilized, but if given the opportunity, they could have an enormously positive impact on helping improve the health of people and therefore enhancing overall human potential.\n\n\u201cNurses consider the whole person and that whole person\u2019s relationship to their families and their loved ones, to their environment and to their communities, the many roles they play, their capacity to affect others,\u201d Buerhaus continued. \u201cNurses are present at birth, throughout life, and during one\u2019s passing. The opportunity to contribute to one\u2019s health and their potential as a human being throughout their lifetime appeals to me. Nurses can create enormously positive ripple effects.\u201d\n\nContact: Peter Buerhaus, (406) 994-2681 or peter.buerhaus@montana.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "Peter Buerhaus, who joined the MSU faculty in 2015, will discuss his career and research during a lecture set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 19, at the Museum of the Rockies\u2019 Hagar Auditorium.", "og": {"site_name": "Montana State University", "description": "Peter Buerhaus, who joined the MSU faculty in 2015, will discuss his career and research during a lecture set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 19, at the Museum of the Rockies\u2019 Hagar Auditorium.", "title": "Renowned MSU nursing economist to deliver Jan. 19 provost\u2019s lecture", "url": "http://www.montana.edu/news/15908/renowned-msu-nursing-economist-to-deliver-jan-19-provost-s-lecture", "image": "https://www.montana.edu/cpa/cope/image_manager/thumbnail/vd6tz/image4.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "pdate": 20151229, "twitter": {"description": "Peter Buerhaus, who joined the MSU faculty in 2015, will discuss his career and research during a lecture set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 19, at the Museum of the Rockies\u2019 Hagar Auditorium.", "title": "Renowned MSU nursing economist to deliver Jan. 19 provost\u2019s lecture", "image": "https://www.montana.edu/cpa/cope/image_manager/thumbnail/vd6tz/image11.jpg", "creator": "@montanastate", "site": "@montanastate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tom": "News", "byl": "Anne Cantrell, MSU News Service", "thumbnail_width": 75, "dat": "December 29, 2015", "fb": {"admins": 623939514}, "DISPLAYDATE": "December 29, 2015", "lp": "Peter Buerhaus, who joined the MSU faculty in 2015, will discuss his career and research during a lecture set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 19, at the Museum of the Rockies\u2019 Hagar Auditorium.", "cre": "Montana State University", "thumbnail_height": 75, "hdl": "Renowned MSU nursing economist to deliver Jan. 19 provost\u2019s lecture", "thumbnail": "http://www.montana.edu/news/images/articles/thumb/img201002121266023048.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And he saw how his interdisciplinary approach to studies of the health care workforce was valued when, in 2010, he was appointed chair of the National Health Care Workforce Commission that was established under The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to advise both the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President on national health care workforce policy.\nAt the time in health care, in the 60s and early 70s, there was so much money, but no accountability\u2026.\nThe lecture, \u201cAn Unconventional Journey: Studies of the health care workforce and their impact on private and public policy-making,\u201d will be given at the Museum of the Rockies\u2019 Hager Auditorium.\nNow, the renowned nursing economist will discuss his career and groundbreaking research at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 19, when he delivers the third lecture in this year\u2019s Provost\u2019s Distinguished Lecturer Series at MSU.\nPeter Buerhaus, a renowned nursing economist who joined the MSU faculty in 2015, will discuss his career and research Jan. 19 when he delivers the third lecture in MSU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual Provost\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Distinguished Lecturer Series."}
