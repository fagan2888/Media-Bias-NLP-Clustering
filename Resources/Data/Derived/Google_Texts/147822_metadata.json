Some came armed with electrics plugged into battery-powered amps; one man even had wah-wah pedals strapped to the soles of his shoes. Others brought acoustic models, including more than a few ukuleles. Some played by themselves; others, in large circles. Their repertoires varied: Over the course of the night, one could hear everything from Steve Earle\u2019s \u201cCopperhead Road\u201d to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black\u201d to Outkast\u2019s \u201cHey Ya!\u201d to countless electri-fried variations on \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d to, of course, \u201cWill the Circle Be Unbroken?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s not a drum jam,\u201d said Michael David Pyeatt, just as a man with a cart full of bongos rolled up.\n\nA random passerby would have never known this was a protest, but it was: self-proclaimed \u201cinstigator\u201d Barry Kooda\u2019s shot at Open Carry Texas and its offspring filled with gun owners who insist they\u2019re protecting the Second Amendment by strapping on AK-47s and carrying them into restaurants and stores. Just this week Target \u201crespectfully\u201d requested customers leave their firearms at home, joining a long list of retailers and restaurants who\u2019ve had to deal with open-carriers in recent months.\n\nKooda, who served in Korea long before landing in the pages of Rolling Stone as a Nervebreaker opening for the Sex Pistols at the Longhorn Ballroom, seemed a bit overwhelmed by the turnout Friday. Some 1,000 had RSVP\u2019d on the Open Carry Guitar Rally\u2019s Facebook page, but last week Kooda said he figured maybe 100 would show.\n\n\u201cBut every time I turn around, this things grows a little more, and I\u2019m laughing,\u201d he said Friday, as the sun began to set and the crowd continued to swell. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Geez, what is this thing?\u2019 It\u2019s fantastic. And everybody\u2019s here for a different reason.\u201d\n\nAnd he was right: For every person out there wearing a yellow \u201cDon\u2019t Shred on Me\u201d T-shirt, there were dozens who just wanted to hang out with other guitar-slingers. Among their ranks was Donnie Pendleton of Fort Worth, carrying a shiny custom-made aluminum Goulding with ornate fretwork.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about guitars,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t own a gun. I own a bunch of guitars.\u201d\n\nSomeone behind him chimed in: \u201cIt\u2019s about satire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, it is,\u201d Pendleton responded, nodding. \u201cBut, I mean, for me I wanted to be out here with all the other guitar-players. I just hope the bridge doesn\u2019t collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly offended by people dragging semi-automatic weapons into restaurants,\u201d said David Dennard, who, in the 1960s, played in the band The Novas and later released Tripping Daisy\u2019s first record. \u201cThat\u2019s taking it too far. This is a tongue-in-cheek way of pointing out the ridiculousness of that. And it\u2019s about having the arts make a statement. This is kind of the same statement Woody Guthrie was making: \u2018This machine kills fascists.\u2019 I own guns, and I shoot pretty well, but I don\u2019t wave \u2018em around in restaurants and Target. My grandfather never would have done that, and he was one of the world\u2019s biggest gun enthusiasts in the world. This is punk. This is patriotic.\u201d\n\nDennard was one among dozens of familiar faces on the bridge Friday. Mark Grifffin, the once and future MC 900 Ft. Jesus was there; so too Jeff Lyles, who books the Kessler Theater, and Mike Schwedler, who runs the Majestic Theater. Spyche was there; so were Kettle Art Gallery\u2019s Frank Campagna and Angus Wynne, likely the only man on the bridge to have had his photo taken with Jimi Hendrix.\n\n\u201cI thought Barry\u2019s measured response to the absurdity of the open-carry protests was just perfect in every way,\u201d said Schwedler. \u201cIt\u2019s smart, and it\u2019s hilarious. And I hope people are doing it everywhere next year. From the very start it seemed like this was the perfect thing to do.\u201d\n\nAnd it lasted longer than anyone could have imagined. Some folks actually started arriving around 3 p.m., and many stayed until well past sundown. And despite some concerns that the open-carriers might show up with an AK or two, they stayed away. In the end, the most terrifying sighting of the night was Reid Robinson\u2019s Keytar.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re born in Texas, then a bizarre phallic obsession is just part of your DNA,\u201d said Liles, ex of Decadent Dub Team and the man who recorded as Cottonmouth, Texas. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a gun or an oil well or a baseball bat or whatever. The guitar obsessives are the safest people to be around.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA3L2F0LWRhbGxhcy1maXJzdC1vcGVuLWNhcnJ5LWd1aXRhci1yYWxseS1vdmVyLXRoZS10cmluaXR5LXJpdmVyLXBsZW50eS1vZi1qYW1zLWJ1dC1uby1sb2FkZWQtd2VhcG9ucy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "In the end, the first (but, likely, not the last) Open Carry Guitar Rally along the Continental Avenue Bridge resembled the world's longest Guitar Center showroom floor.
