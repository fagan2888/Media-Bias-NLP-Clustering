But they could replace the law\u2019s unpopular mandate that virtually everyone in the country has health insurance, provided the alternative worked reasonably well.\n\nA Democrat in the White House probably would use the waiver to build bridges to Republican governors and state legislators opposed to the law. The \u201cstate innovation\u201d provision, Section 1332 of the nearly 1,000-page law, has gotten little public attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut \u201cyou would be hard pressed to find a state that doesn\u2019t know what Section 1332 is,\u201d said Trish Riley, executive director the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan forum for state policymakers. \u201cIt provides some opportunity for taking the rough edges\u201d off the Affordable Care Act, as the law is known.\n\nFor a Republican president, state waivers could be the fallback option to avoid the political cost of dismantling Obama\u2019s law and disrupting or jeopardizing coverage for millions of newly insured people, not to mention the upheaval for insurers, hospitals and doctors.\n\n\u201cIf you were a Republican on record as opposing or wanting to repeal the ACA, but really felt deep down that you couldn\u2019t accomplish that even as president, then you could say your second preference would be to use this provision to go down a completely different road,\u201d said Stuart Butler, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.\n\nButler, who was with the conservative Heritage Foundation for 35 years, has long been a voice for Republican thinking on health care policy. \u201cThe short answer is, this presents a tremendous opportunity for either party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state waiver was the idea of Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, who has a record of crossing party lines in search of ways to tackle health care costs and coverage.\n\nWaivers would not be a blank check.\n\nIn addition to preserving the health law\u2019s protection for people with health problems, states would have to cover about the same number of residents while providing comprehensive benefits and financial safeguards against ruinous costs. States also could not add to the federal deficit.\n\nStates meeting those tests could take hundreds of millions of dollars in health insurance subsidies provided under Obama\u2019s law and shift them. They could:\n\n\u2014eliminate or change the penalties the federal law imposes on people who remain uninsured, and on larger businesses that don\u2019t offer coverage.\n\n\u2014modify benefits and subsidies. For example, states could figure out different ways to subsidize premiums for their residents. The federal health insurance tax credit has been difficult for the government to administer, and for consumers to understand.\n\n\u2014do away with or change online health insurance markets, also called exchanges.\n\nStates could combine the innovation waiver with Medicaid and children\u2019s health insurance proposals to create a \u201csuper waiver.\u201d That could be of particular interest to states that are experimenting with different approaches under the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nRiley said so far there is interest in the waivers among state officials in Hawaii, New Mexico, Minnesota and Vermont. But the Obama administration has yet to issue regulations that would set the ground rules for granting them.\n\n\u201cThis could be a way for states with very different political perspectives to use the resources provided by the ACA and help the country come to a resolution of this whole question,\u201d said Stan Dorn, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. \u201cWhoever is in the White House in 2017 and beyond is going to have a lot of flexibility without having to change the statute.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is optimistic.\n\nJohn McDonough was a senior Democratic Senate aide who helped steer the health overhaul to passage in 2009-2010, and now teaches at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nIf the next president is a Republican, McDonough said he does not think state waivers would provide enough leeway to satisfy the party\u2019s ideology.\n\n\u201cChances are if they hold the White House and Congress, they are going to be looking for bigger changes than monkeying around with 1332,\u201d McDonough said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nation/World, Nation/World news, New Haven Nation/World news, CT Nation/World news, US Nation/World news, world Nation/World news.", "title": "Next US president could overhaul health care again", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150419/NEWS/150419448", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150419/NEWS/150419448/AR/0/AR-150419448.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "747px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Next US president could overhaul health care again"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "WASHINGTON >> Republican or Democrat, the next president will have the chance to remake the nation\u2019s health care overhaul without fighting Congress.", "title": "Next US president could overhaul health care again", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20150419/NEWS/150419448", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150419/NEWS/150419448/AR/0/AR-150419448.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Nation/World, Nation/World news, New Haven Nation/World news, CT Nation/World news, US Nation/World news, world Nation/World news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "WASHINGTON >> Republican or Democrat, the next president will have the chance to remake the nation\u2019s health care overhaul without fighting Congress."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81da\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON >> Republican or Democrat, the next president will have the chance to remake the nation\u2019s health care overhaul without fighting Congress.\nButler, who was with the conservative Heritage Foundation for 35 years, has long been a voice for Republican thinking on health care policy.\nBut they could replace the law\u2019s unpopular mandate that virtually everyone in the country has health insurance, provided the alternative worked reasonably well.\nThe federal health insurance tax credit has been difficult for the government to administer, and for consumers to understand.\nThe law signed by President Barack Obama includes a waiver that, starting in 2017, would let states take federal dollars now invested in the overhaul and use them to redesign their own health care systems."}
