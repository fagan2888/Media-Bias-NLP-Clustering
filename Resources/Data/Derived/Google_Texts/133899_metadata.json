Voga was thought up by Juliet Murrell, a former film industry art director, who wanted to bring a cardiac workout to yoga. According to the website, it combines \u201cthe expressive moves of a dance class with the breath-synchronised movement of yoga.\u201d\n\nTell me more about voga.\n\n\n\nMaybe 80s beats are exactly what yoga has been missing these past two millennia, but first thoughts are that it seems like yet another yoga gimmick \u2013 like dog yoga (\u201cdoga\u201d), baby yoga and laughter yoga. Having said that, with their unusual contortions and focus on \u201cstriking a pose\u201d, yoga and voguing do have marked similarities.\n\nReading this on mobile?

It is actually really good fun \u2013 especially if you embrace the 80s vibe and wear fluorescent pink leggings, leopard-print leotard and leg warmers, which I may or may not have done. The hour felt like 15 minutes, yet left my arms aching as if I had done serious weight training. Despite feeling sweaty, pale and slightly sick, I was smiling throughout.\n\nWhat are the downsides?\n\n\n\nFans of more traditional types of yoga might object to the lack of deep stretch poses and after such a hard workout, a good stretch would have been helpful. The class also left out everybody\u2019s favourite part of yoga, Savasana \u2013 or the bit where you lie on the floor at the end \u2013 and I could have done with a bit of that too.\n\nPerfect if \u2026\n\n\n\nYou require your exercise to be fun, and are partial to zumba or other dance fitness classes. DJ Alex Gromadzki is responsible for the playlist, which ranges from Diana Ross to Chic, so a love of classic dance tracks is also required.\n\nBest avoided if \u2026\n\nYou are a hipster-hater or a dedicated yogi. If you take your yoga very seriously, voga may enrage you.\n\nWhat more do I need to know?\n\n\n\nVoga can currently only be enjoyed in London, but Murrell plans to bring it to other lucky parts of the UK and the world. At the time of writing she is introducing voga to South America. Classes are an hour long, cost \u00a310 in advance and \u00a312 on the door and are held in various East London studios.\n\nThe words yoga and voguing fuse together in such a satisfying manner that it was probably only a matter of time before voga became a thing. It\u2019s hard to tell how long it will remain \u201ca thing\u201d, but it\u2019s fun, so give it a try it before it goes the way of baby yoga and dog yoga.\n\nThis article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Voga: an energetic cross between yoga and voguing", "title": "Voga: an energetic cross between yoga and voguing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/07/voga-an-energetic-cross-between-yoga-and-voguing/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140307__p_37402e9c-349b-4046-821a-4ca474b224edlsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 383}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140307__p_37402e9c-349b-4046-821a-4ca474b224edlsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-07T09:51:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:03:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Maybe 80s beats are exactly what yoga has been missing these past two millennia, but first thoughts are that it seems like yet another yoga gimmick \u2013 like dog yoga (\u201cdoga\u201d), baby yoga and laughter yoga.\nHaving said that, with their unusual contortions and focus on \u201cstriking a pose\u201d, yoga and voguing do have marked similarities.\nVoga was thought up by Juliet Murrell, a former film industry art director, who wanted to bring a cardiac workout to yoga.\nThe words yoga and voguing fuse together in such a satisfying manner that it was probably only a matter of time before voga became a thing.\nIn case you hadn\u2019t worked it out, voga is a cross between yoga and voguing \u2013 the 1980s New York drag scene dance craze, which was introduced to the mainstream by Madonna."}
