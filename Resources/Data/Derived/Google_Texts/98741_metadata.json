In announcing the alliance in early February, Cox said \"the current system is unsustainable and it costs our employees too much. Even the most successful companies won't be able to afford the rising costs of healthcare in the not-too-distant future.\"\n\nAn American Health Policy Institute study showed that, by 2020, more than 37 percent of private-sector employees may face an average family premium and deductible above 9.5 percent of their income, which the U.S. government defines as the maximum affordable healthcare cost. By 2025, 53 percent of employees may face unaffordable healthcare costs, creating a significant problem for employees and employers alike.\n\nThe alliance is headed by CEO Robert \"Rob\" Andrews, the former U.S. representative from New Jersey who was instrumental in developing the Affordable Care Act, and President Jeffrey C. McGuiness, who is also CEO of the HR Policy Association. The first of the alliance's four primary goals is to pool resources and expertise to gain leverage and greater marketplace efficiencies; the second is to learn from data what best treatments, good outcomes and cost reductions are possible.\n\nThe other two goals are to develop better tools to educate employees about which healthcare choices will result in better outcomes, increased savings and more satisfaction with services; and, finally, to change costly and inefficient pharmaceutical purchasing and contracting systems that don't deliver better healthcare results.\n\nTroy, former deputy secretary of health and human services in the George W. Bush administration, notes that a key part of the strategy will be to capitalize on the \"expertise of very smart benefits managers and human resource executives\" at America's largest companies.\n\nNewsletter Sign-Up: Benefits\n\nHR Technology\n\nTalent Management\n\nHR Leadership\n\nInside HR Tech\n\nHRENow\n\nSpecial Offers\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\"There have been talks about employer coalitions and use of data before,\" says Troy, \"but I don't think anyone has put it together in a coherent three-part strategy [like] we have. And I don't think anyone has put together the level of companies that we have committed to this.\"\n\nWhile evidence-based medicine is a frequent conversation for healthcare providers, especially with Medicare's increased focus on patient outcomes and value, the alliance members can now weigh in on the conversation, based on the aggregate data their employees' healthcare experience is showing.\n\nThe large employers are also keen on learning about the data innovations taking place in healthcare and accessing some of the lessons themselves, with hopes that they can integrate approaches into their own programs.\n\nThe alliance's initial project this year and early next is to collect and analyze the data from members. A pharmaceutical initiative is planned for next year, and the alliance plans to address medical networks in 2018. Also, expect to see expansion of the alliance to include other interested large employers with about 10,000 or more employees.\n\nWhile the alliance itself will not issue any reports, the American Health Policy Institute may develop studies and white papers based on the lessons gleaned from the initiatives, Troy says.\n\nSend questions or comments about this story to hreletters@lrp.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534360003", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.HREOnline.com", "title": "Power in Numbers"}, "description": "By Maura C.
