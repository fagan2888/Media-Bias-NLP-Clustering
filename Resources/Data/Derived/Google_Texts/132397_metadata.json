We find that it's tremendously valuable for all sides.\"\n\nCedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, was an early customer of Health Care DataWorks, and Darren Dworkin, its chief information officer, said he views the acquisition as a sign that the analytics segment, like electronic health record system companies did, is starting to consolidate and mature. \"It's a great, positive sign,\" Dworkin said.\n\nThe dealmaking may not be over for the companies and its system owners, because Health Catalyst is planning to sell its shares to the public.\n\nDan Burton, CEO of Health Catalyst, said before the Health Care DataWorks deal that his company performed work for about 200 hospitals; the purchase of the Columbus, Ohio, company brings 18 more hospitals, within five systems, as customers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six health care systems are involved as investors in and customers of Health Catalyst or the company it just bought, Health Care DataWorks.", "csrf-token": "STrNlpg0y4MCv2RxNqEonmFIrk1vEYeb+V5TTGe6uMc=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Transform4_190x127.jpg?1448315760", "description": "Health Catalyst buys Health Care DataWorks, hinting that analytics field is maturing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Systems Play Big Role in Analytics Development"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Transform4_190x127.jpg?1448315760", "type": "Article", "description": "Health Catalyst buys Health Care DataWorks, hinting that analytics field is maturing.", "title": "Health Systems Play Big Role in Analytics Development"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "Finance, technology, analytics, health, healthcare, patient, data, ehr, Health catalyst, dataworks, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, MemorialCare Medical Center", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Six health care systems are involved as investors in and customers of data analytics company Health Catalyst or the competitor it just bought, Health Care DataWorks.\nAnd just as important, the two systems will become customers of Health Catalyst as well.\nThe dealmaking may not be over for the companies and its system owners, because Health Catalyst is planning to sell its shares to the public.\nFour of them, Allina Health, Minneapolis; Indiana University Health, Indianapolis; Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, Calif.; and Partners Healthcare, Boston, are existing customer investors of Salt Lake City-based Health Catalyst, so not much is changing for them, at least for now.\nDan Burton, CEO of Health Catalyst, said before the Health Care DataWorks deal that his company performed work for about 200 hospitals; the purchase of the Columbus, Ohio, company brings 18 more hospitals, within five systems, as customers."}
