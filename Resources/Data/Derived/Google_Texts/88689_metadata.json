The clinic has served the community for 22 years and, at this time, they feel that their mission is fulfilled.\n\nOasis Free Clinic in Brunswick has been serving the health care needs of its community \u2013 low-income residents of northern Cumberland and Sagadahoc counties \u2013 for more than 22 years, but we do not feel that our mission is yet complete.\n\nDespite the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, we have not seen a decline in patients seeking medical and dental care or prescription assistance, which is provided through our Community Prescription Assistance Program.\n\nThis program serves not only our patients but also patients of other practices, as long as they meet certain income criteria established by the drug companies that supply the medications. The Community Prescription Assistance Program provided nearly $1 million in prescription assistance to our clients in 2014.\n\nWe continue to serve as the primary care provider for about 500 patients, and this number has remained stable for the last three years. Although we were successful in helping a small number of our patients qualify for health insurance through the ACA, most of our patients have no options under the ACA because Maine has chosen not to expand MaineCare eligibility.\n\nThe Biddeford clinic is in proximity to three federally qualified health centers, which provide care for low-income patients. Brunswick has no such resource; the nearest federally qualified health center is in Richmond.\n\nIn addition, the Biddeford Free Clinic is located near the University of New England\u2019s colleges of osteopathic medicine and dentistry. Perhaps clinics associated with these schools have provided alternative sources of care.\n\nOasis Free Clinic was established by several area physicians, led by Dr. Peter McGuire, as a form of outreach to residents of the Tedford homeless shelter in Brunswick. Demand for care rapidly increased, and, in 1995, the clinic was incorporated as an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\n\nThe clinic has grown dramatically over the ensuing two decades. McGuire served the clinic as medical director for more than 20 years, recently retiring from that position; he is now on the board of directors.\n\nTo qualify for care at Oasis Free Clinic, our clients must live in our service area, have no medical insurance and have income that is equal to or less than 175 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nOver the last three years, Oasis has implemented a patient-centered medical home model of primary care, a national standard. Our patients have assigned providers who see them on a regular basis for acute and preventive health care, as well as chronic disease management.\n\nWe have been able to accomplish this thanks to a dedicated group of primary care and specialist providers who donate their time on a regular basis; they provide more than $500,000 of in-kind services per year. Other communities around the country have not been so fortunate, and some have had to limit services or close because of difficulty recruiting volunteer providers.\n\nOasis is able to see new patients and offer follow-up appointments to existing patients on a same-day or next-business-day basis. This has markedly reduced our patients\u2019 reliance on costly emergency room visits for routine care, and improves continuity of care as well.\n\nOasis was fortunate to receive a generous one-time grant from the Next Generation Foundation of Maine, enabling us to locate our medical and dental services under one roof. This will increase service capacity and enhance patient accessibility. Mid Coast Hospital continues to generously provide office space and administrative support.\n\nPart of Oasis\u2019 long-range strategic plan is to expand free dental care, as there will be continuing need for the foreseeable future. Should the need for our medical services decrease, the demand for our dental services will remain.\n\nOasis providers and board members would very much like to be \u201cput out of business\u201d by the implementation of comprehensive health and dental coverage for all citizens. Until this occurs, Oasis will remain an oasis of care for our patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brunswick's Oasis Free Clinic sees no decrease in the number of patients seeking medical and dental care and prescription assistance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Brunswick's Oasis Free Clinic sees no decrease in the number of patients seeking medical and dental care and prescription assistance.", "title": "Maine Voices: Impending closure of Biddeford Free Clinic spotlights ongoing need - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2015-07-15T20:27:35-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/07/16/maine-voices-impending-closure-of-biddeford-free-clinic-spotlights-ongoing-need/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brunswick's Oasis Free Clinic sees no decrease in the number of patients seeking medical and dental care and prescription assistance.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Maine Voices: Impending closure of Biddeford Free Clinic spotlights ongoing need - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Columns", "published_time": "2015-07-16T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-15T20:27:35-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "BRUNSWICK \u2014 I read with great interest the Portland Press Herald article concerning the Biddeford Free Clinic (\u201cState\u2019s first free clinic will close doors in Biddeford this autumn,\u201d Page A1, July 4).\nIn addition, the Biddeford Free Clinic is located near the University of New England\u2019s colleges of osteopathic medicine and dentistry.\nabout the author Richard P.
