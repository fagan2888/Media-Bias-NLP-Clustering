The plans are usually routinely approved.\n\nChurchill Downs Inc. officials announced the planned improvements a month ago, but new details are contained in a recent letter from Churchill Downs officials to the zoning board.\n\nThe track officials said in the letter that the \"intent of the project is to provide Oaks and Derby horse owners with a more exclusive VIP experience that will offer them all-inclusive food and beverage, along with both casual and fixed-seating opportunities within the comfort of their own outdoor suite.\n\n\"This will be an area to 'be seen,' while attending the Oaks or Derby for them and their guests. Each box will be decorated with each of their respective silks.\"\n\nThe plans call for 20 owner suites, called Winner's Circle Suites, each approximately 10 feet wide by 35 feet deep.\n\nEach owner will have up to 18 seats free \u2014 triple what this year's owners had \u2014 in that area and also the ability to buy additional boxes.\n\nThe so-called \"super boxes\" will have self-serve drink dispensers, in-venue wagering machines and televisions, the letter said. And guests will have access to expanded hospitality areas and private restrooms located in the Jockey Club behind the suites, it said.\n\nThe improvements will displace about 120 box holders and, in all, seating will be reduced by about 1,500, track officials said.\n\nA grassy area to be called the Courtyard will go in front of the suites, with about 600 chairs added and sold for the Derby and Oaks. The Courtyard is envisioned as a parklike area the rest of the year.\n\nIn connection with the project, the Downs plans a new audio booth and a new superintendent's office, with some additional box seating at the mezzanine level.\n\nConstruction is to begin in December, with the project scheduled to be completed by the spring meet that opens in late April. The project was designed by Populous of Kansas City.\n\nNearly $180 million has been spent since 2001 on improvements at the track, including luxury suites, the 300-seat finish line Mansion, a new clubhouse, lights and, most recently, the new Grandstand Terrace and giant video board.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Churchill Downs announced a $4.2 million project to add suites for Kentucky Derby and Oaks owners.
