Tim Neville, R-Littleton, was right when he said, \u201cThe key to business is location, location, location.\u201d\n\nPueblo County has about 160,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Denver metro area has about 2.8 million. Pueblo is 112 miles from Denver. It is simply not a sustainable location for the event.\n\nIt would be one thing if Pueblo itself had demonstrated an impressive level of commitment to keeping the fair, but that is not the case, either. The city cut funding, decreasing its financial support to $125,000 from $315,000 in 2006. The county contributes $175,000. But county voters in 2013 rejected a sales tax that would have in part gone to support the fair.\n\nBy contrast, the state kicked in $2 million last year from various sources to assist the fair.\n\nOver the past decade, the fair\u2019s losses have only seemed to worsen, according to an audit released earlier this year that examined recent fiscal years.\n\nOperating revenue was down from the previous year as well, a decrease attributed to a drop in gate admissions, private sponsorships and exhibitor fees.\n\nYear after year, auditors have told the same story. The fair is not generating enough money and the state is asked again and again to keep it afloat.\n\nThe attendance for the 11-day fair has increased slightly in recent years, to 498,720 in 2014 from 474,914 in 2012. But it is not enough.\n\nA move would be sad, but it\u2019s the only way to set the fair permanently on its feet.\n\nThe history of the event in Pueblo is well known. In 1869, seven years before Colorado became a state, 2,000 people gathered at a horse exhibition in Pueblo \u2014 an event that would later become the Colorado State Fair. The fair has been operating in the city ever since with only one cancellation \u2014 in 1917, during World War I, when horse stables became a training facility for the Army National Guard.\n\nMany structures on the fairgrounds are listed with the State Historical Fund.\n\nHistory, though, cannot generate necessary funds to keep the fair in Pueblo.\n\nThe audit report recommended the fair continue to seek more state funds to ensure continued operations. But this is simply not an acceptable long-term solution for this Colorado institution.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sadly, state fair will need to leave Pueblo to be viable", "title": "Sadly, state fair will need to leave Pueblo to be viable", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/24/sadly-state-fair-will-need-to-leave-pueblo-to-be-viable/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150724__20150726_Z00_OP26E_FAIRp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150724__20150726_Z00_OP26E_FAIRp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-24T13:44:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T03:06:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 1869, seven years before Colorado became a state, 2,000 people gathered at a horse exhibition in Pueblo \u2014 an event that would later become the Colorado State Fair.\nThe audit report recommended the fair continue to seek more state funds to ensure continued operations.\nSen.
