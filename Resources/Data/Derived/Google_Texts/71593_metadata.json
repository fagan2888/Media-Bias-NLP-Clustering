She could post a photo online of a blank sheet of paper and that would be controversial.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, she created a new controversy when she posted on Facebook a series of photos of her youngest child, Trig, standing on the back of what is apparently his trained service dog, a Labrador Retriever. The child was standing on the dog to reach the kitchen sink and help his mother with the dishes.\n\nThe left immediately went bat guano crazy. Liberals immediately trolled Mrs. Palin\u2019s Facebook page. It did not take long for the professional left to get into the act as well.\n\nThe laughing stock of far left-wing animal groups, PETA, denounced Mrs. Palin. They called her \u201chard hearted\u201d and \u201cbrazenly callous.\u201d\n\nOf course, this is coming from a group that calls for the complete \u201cliberation\u201d of animals. That means no meat. No animal by-products like leather. That means no other products like milk, honey or eggs. That means no pets and that even means no service dogs. This is coming from a group that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has labeled as a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d\n\nJust out of curiosity, is PETA \u201cbrazenly callous\u201d when it raises millions of dollars yet slaughters thousands of animals put into its custody by the public?\n\nBut as groups like PETA scream there are a few things worth remembering. First, it is a 6-year-old child. Second, Trig has Down Syndrome. Third, the dog is a service dog. It is trained to help bear weight for the person it helps. Finally, it is a dog. If the child\u2019s weight had caused the dog pain, the dog would have moved.\n\nPETA is a radical left-wing group that has supported radical eco-terrorists. For PETA, that means if it didn\u2019t have double standards it would have no standards at all.\n\nIn July, Ellen DeGeneres posted a photo of a child standing on the back of a Labrador Retriever to reach a sink. But if a liberal does something, it\u2019s OK. If a conservative does something, it is bad and if Sarah Palin does it, it is outrageous.\n\nWhat is really outrageous is the double standards of PETA. PETA loves to demonize or terrorize children. PETA loves to bypass parents and contact some children as young as 6 years old. It gives children comic books showing graphic images of animals being slaughtered and sends messages to children with wonderful titles like \u201cYour Mommy kills animals.\u201d\n\nDogs are wonderful companions. They also are great working helpers for humans. They help the disabled. They work to protect law enforcement and soldiers. They can even help protect against disease.\n\nThe radicals complaining about Sarah Palin are the same radicals who do not believe that real Americans should have the joy of a pet dog or cat. They do not believe we should have nutritious food or the animal by-products that help us in everyday life.\n\nReal Americans love animals. Real Americans have no use for the eco-terrorist supporting radicals of PETA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin manages to create controversy no matter what she does.
