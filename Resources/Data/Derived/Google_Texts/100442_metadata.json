Yet it may not be likely for other states to adopt the same program, according to an article from Kaiser Health News.\n\nThe system targets people who are just above the Medicaid cutoff as well as low-income legal immigrants who are not eligible for Medicaid because they haven't been in the country for five years. People who are eligible for the program cannot go to the marketplace to get subsidized coverage, the article notes.\n\nThe article explains that while on New York's Essential Plan, someone with an income of $23,540 would pay a monthly premium of $20 for a plan with no deductible and $15 copayments for primary care doctor visits. The least expensive standard silver-level marketplace plan in New York County for someone with an annual income of $24,000, even with a $237 premium tax credit, has a monthly premium is $131 with a $1,500 deductible and $30 copayments for primary care doctor visits.\n\nThe Basic Health Program, however, may not be good fit elsewhere in the country. People with incomes that are less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line make up as much as two-thirds of marketplace enrollment in some states, and a smaller marketplace might be less attractive to insurers and result in fewer, more expensive offerings on the exchanges, KHN says.\n\n\"If you pull those people out, you've decreased the size of the marketplace significantly, and that has the potential to change way the insurers look at it,\" Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Institute, tells KHN.\n\nRecently, House Republicans have also taken issue with the Basic Health Program, claiming that funding for the program was never approved by Congress.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here is the KHN article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHouse Republicans press HHS about Affordable Care Act funding\n\nLawmakers subpoena IRS, Treasury over ACA payments\n\nCMS' Andy Slavitt defends oversight of state exchanges", "article_metadata": {"description": "In New York and Minnesota, a combined 475,000 low-income individuals have signed up for health plans that are even more affordable than subsidized marketplace coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Basic Health Program.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "In New York and Minnesota, a combined 475,000 low-income individuals have signed up for health plans that are even more affordable than subsidized marketplace coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Basic Health Program.", "title": "ACA's Basic Health Program gains traction in some states", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/acas-basic-health-program-gains-traction-some-states/2016-02-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Basic Health Program,BHP,Deductibles,Health Insurance Exchanges,insurance marketplaces,Operations & Business Management,out-of-pocket costs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Recently, House Republicans have also taken issue with the Basic Health Program, claiming that funding for the program was never approved by Congress.\nThe Basic Health Program, however, may not be good fit elsewhere in the country.\nIn New York and Minnesota, a combined 475,000 low-income individuals have signed up for health plans that are even more affordable than subsidized marketplace coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Basic Health Program.\nYet it may not be likely for other states to adopt the same program, according to an article from Kaiser Health News.\nTo learn more:- here is the KHN articleRelated Articles:House Republicans press HHS about Affordable Care Act fundingLawmakers subpoena IRS, Treasury over ACA paymentsCMS' Andy Slavitt defends oversight of state exchanges"}
