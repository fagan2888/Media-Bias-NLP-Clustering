Instead, the dog found the body, and their second pointer joined the first at the corpse.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was an elk \u2026 the first thing I noticed was the human skull,\u201d Spetalieri said Sunday. \u201cWe had to pull the dogs off it.\u201d\n\nJackson County Sheriff Gary Cure said about a month ago, an abandoned vehicle was found near the area where the hunters located the body. Cure said he looked for the vehicle\u2019s owner but couldn\u2019t find him.\n\n\u201cWe been looking for him. There was an abandoned vehicle up there and it was something strange. We just couldn\u2019t find him until the hunter came across him. We didn\u2019t know if he was missing or he had just dumped his vehicle,\u201d Cure said.\n\nThe body was bloated, and Spetalieri noticed a wound in the chest, he said.\n\nFoul play isn\u2019t suspected, Cure said.\n\nSpetalieri and his son spent Saturday night at their camp site, about 400 yards from where they found the body. \u201cIt was really creepy for us last night because we had to stay at the camp site,\u201d he said Sunday.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hunters find human body in Jackson County", "title": "Hunters find human body in Jackson County", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/06/hunters-find-human-body-in-jackson-county/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T16:24:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-06T16:24:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f54\"", "article_summary": "We didn\u2019t know if he was missing or he had just dumped his vehicle,\u201d Cure said.\nA man and his son found a body a few hundred yards from where they were camping during a weekend grouse hunt in Jackson County.\nThe body was bloated, and Spetalieri noticed a wound in the chest, he said.\nSpetalieri and his son spent Saturday night at their camp site, about 400 yards from where they found the body.\nMichael Spetalieri, and his 14-year-old son on Saturday found the body of a man just off Village Bell Road, about a dozen miles north of Walden."}
