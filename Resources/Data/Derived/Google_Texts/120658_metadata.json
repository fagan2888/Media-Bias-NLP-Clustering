First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African American community, we have a lot of work to do. So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African American and Latino.\n\nFor those of us interested in how the left prioritizes its various radicalisms, Sanders\u2019s answer is illuminating. The spectacle of a socialist candidate opposing reparations as \u201cdivisive\u201d (there are few political labels more divisive in the minds of Americans than socialist) is only rivaled by the implausibility of Sanders posing as a pragmatist. Sanders says the chance of getting reparations through Congress is \u201cnil,\u201d a correct observation which could just as well apply to much of the Vermont senator\u2019s own platform. The chances of a President Sanders coaxing a Republican Congress to pass a $1 trillion jobs and infrastructure bill are also nil. Considering Sanders\u2019s proposal for single-payer health care, Paul Krugman asks, \u201cIs there any realistic prospect that a drastic overhaul could be enacted any time soon\u2014say, in the next eight years? No.\u201d\n\nSanders is a lot of things, many of them good. But he is not the candidate of moderation and unification, so much as the candidate of partisanship and radicalism. There is neither insult nor accolade in this. John Brown was radical and divisive. So was Eric Robert Rudolph. Our current sprawling megapolis of prisons was a bipartisan achievement. Obamacare was not. Sometimes the moral course lies within the politically possible, and sometimes the moral course lies outside of the politically possible. One of the great functions of radical candidates is to war against equivocators and opportunists who conflate these two things. Radicals expand the political imagination and, hopefully, prevent incrementalism from becoming a virtue.\n\nUnfortunately, Sanders\u2019s radicalism has failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy. What he proposes in lieu of reparations\u2014job creation, investment in cities, and free higher education\u2014is well within the Overton window, and his platform on race echoes Democratic orthodoxy. The calls for community policing, body cameras, and a voting-rights bill with pre-clearance restored\u2014 all are things that Hillary Clinton agrees with. And those positions with which she might not agree address black people not so much as a class specifically injured by white supremacy, but rather, as a group which magically suffers from disproportionate poverty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Vermont senator\u2019s political imagination is active against plutocracy, but why is it so limited against white supremacy?", "author": "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The Vermont senator\u2019s political imagination is active against plutocracy, but why is it so limited against white supremacy?", "title": "Why Is Bernie Sanders Against Reparations?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/RTX21XXH/facebook.jpg?1453232620", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/bernie-sanders-reparations/424602/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3acd\"", "article_summary": "Last week Bernie Sanders was asked whether he was in favor of \u201creparations for slavery.\u201d It is worth considering Sanders\u2019s response in full:No, I don\u2019t think so.\nSanders says the chance of getting reparations through Congress is \u201cnil,\u201d a correct observation which could just as well apply to much of the Vermont senator\u2019s own platform.\nThe chances of a President Sanders coaxing a Republican Congress to pass a $1 trillion jobs and infrastructure bill are also nil.\nThe spectacle of a socialist candidate opposing reparations as \u201cdivisive\u201d (there are few political labels more divisive in the minds of Americans than socialist) is only rivaled by the implausibility of Sanders posing as a pragmatist.\nThe calls for community policing, body cameras, and a voting-rights bill with pre-clearance restored\u2014 all are things that Hillary Clinton agrees with."}
