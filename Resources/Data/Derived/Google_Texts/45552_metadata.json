However, that debate has morphed into more of an inter-agency squabble between Foggy Bottom and the intelligence community about the liberal use of the designation when it comes to classified material.\n\nMake no mistake, even though no \u201cGotcha!\u201d email has been discovered, the drip, drip, drip of news about her email arrangement has negatively impacted Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThe issue nearly weighed on her last summer, allowing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), her rival for the nomination, to rise in the polls. It\u2019s also stuck in the psyche of some voters, as evidenced by a recent Gallup national survey that found \u201cdishonest\u201d was the word that came to mind most when people were asked about Clinton.\n\nAnd while the emails may all be out, the server itself is in Justice Department custody, where officials are trying to see if they can recover any of its data, even though Clinton claims the device has been \u201cwiped clean.\u201d\n\nRelated: How the FBI Could Derail Hillary Clinton\u2019s Presidential Run\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge ruled this week that Clinton and her top aides should be questioned under oath about her email arrangement, signaling the start of an entirely new legal headache for the now White House contender and her campaign team.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, will pick up again in a few wekks in mid-March when the group files its preliminary plan for the questioning. State has until Apr. 5 to respond, and then Judicial Watch gets 10 days to file a reply.\n\nThe legal maneuvering means that Clinton aides could be deposed during the dog days of summer and potentially well into the general election. Another months-long round of questions about her emails could drag her entire campaign down as it did last year and give Sanders another shot at the nomination or hobble her in a contest against the GOP nominee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.", "title": "As One Clinton Email Nightmare Nears an End, Another Begins", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/26/One-Clinton-Email-Nightmare-Nears-End-Another-Begins", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10232015_Hillary_Benghazi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/26/One-Clinton-Email-Nightmare-Nears-End-Another-Begins", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10232015_Hillary_Benghazi.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Make no mistake, even though no \u201cGotcha!\u201d email has been discovered, the drip, drip, drip of news about her email arrangement has negatively impacted Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\nThe most controversial aspect of the releases has been over the State Department designating some of the emails as top secret.\nThe legal maneuvering means that Clinton aides could be deposed during the dog days of summer and potentially well into the general election.\nBut they won\u2019t be celebrating in Clintonland tonight because another lawsuit could keep the issue alive well into the fall.\nRelated: Voters Say Clinton Is Dishonest and Trump Is Stupid - Why Are They Leading the Race?"}
