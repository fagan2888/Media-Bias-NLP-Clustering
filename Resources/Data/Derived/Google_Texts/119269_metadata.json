I\u2019m also currently wrapping up work on a book, which means I\u2019m reading edits late into the evening.\u201d\n\nWhat Elise does: \u201cI write about health-care issues for our paper and talk on television about politics. Lately, my work has focused almost exclusively on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u2014what a rich topic. You can find me most days seeking out lawmakers on Capitol Hill or contributing to our policy blog, Healthwatch.\u201d\n\nAmie\u2019s work style: \u201cThere\u2019s really no such thing as dressing down at the White House, but I do try to add a little whimsical touch to each outfit or wear a piece or an accessory that really stands out. I grew up in Miami and lived in New York, so my wardrobe is less \u2018traditional DC\u2019 and more reflective of my roots. When I\u2019m working on the book, my wardrobe runs the gamut from Kate Spade or Trina Turk dresses (for interviews) to comfy Lululemon hoodies and capris (for writing time at home).\u201d\n\nElise\u2019s work style: \u201cAggressively understated. I embrace the idea of a uniform, and mine is defined by classic, masculine-inspired pieces in black, navy, and white. If there\u2019s anything I try to get right, it is cut.\u201d\n\nOut in the Field\n\nAmie: \u201cRespect for the institution aside, you never know whom you\n\nmight run into at the big house, even the President himself (which,\n\nbelieve it or not, has happened once or twice.) I usually wear dresses\n\nlike this one paired with bold heels and a statement necklace because\n\nit\u2019s classic yet modern.\u201d What she\u2019s wearing: Susana Monaco dress from Cusp, collar necklace from Anthropologie, and peep-toe wedges by DGM.\n\nElise: \u201cCovering Capitol Hill has a physical dimension I never expected. You\u2019re often jogging after lawmakers or coming in and out of drafty buildings. This outfit is warm and comfortable, and lends itself to movement. The leather bag goes back six years with me and is falling apart from loving use.\u201d What she\u2019s wearing: AllSaints cashmere sweater dress, men\u2019s Missoni scarf, Nordstrom tights, Pied Juste wedges, Kate Spade stud earrings, heirloom necklace, and vintage leather tote.\n\nTV Appearance\n\nElise: \u201cThis Rag & Bone blouse\n\nis my favorite piece of all. The detailing is exquisite, and it works\n\nwell for television since it runs down from the shoulder to the wrist.\n\nThe rest of the outfit assumes I\u2019m going to a late dinner or event after\n\na nighttime hit. The Saint Laurent clutch was a recent gift, and I\n\ncan\u2019t stop carrying it.\u201d What she\u2019s wearing: Rag and Bone silk blouse, J.Crew cropped pants,\n\nCole Haan peep-toe pumps, vintage stud earrings, vintage chain link\n\nnecklace, and Saint Laurent clutch.\n\nAmie: \u201cMy appearances on the\n\ntube have made me embrace bold colors and jewel tones, something my\n\ncloset had been missing for years. And while viewers only see a fraction\n\nof what I\u2019m wearing, it\u2019s nice to get properly dressed for the\n\noccasion.\u201d What she\u2019s wearing: Kate Spade dress, Kate Spade suede ankle\n\nboots, Kendra Scott earrings, and bracelet stack by Aqua from\n\nBloomingdales.\n\nCasual Friday\n\nElise: \u201cI live in versions of\n\nthis outfit. The proportions work well for me, and the whole thing is\n\ncomfortable without being too casual. I love the way a good blazer can\n\nmake even the most basic outfit feel finished. This one has very serious\n\nbald eagles on the buttons.\u201d What she\u2019s wearing: Vintage\n\nStanley Blacker wool blazer, Maeve navy button-down with \u201cE\u201d initial,\n\nMadewell jeans, Ralph Lauren slingbacks, vintage snake clutch, and\n\nheirloom necklace.\n\nAmie: \u201cOn the days I\u2019m not at the White\n\nHouse and I\u2019m working in the newsroom, I like to be a little bolder with\n\nmy wardrobe. I\u2019ve always loved jeans, but lately I\u2019m all about printed\n\npants. I usually pair them with a jacket and an accessory that pops as\n\nwell as a fun pair of shoes, like these oxfords. They\u2019re functional and a\n\nfun alternative to standard flats\u2014not to mention cute with dresses and\n\nskirts! Bonus: This kind of outfit plays well in the evening if I\u2019m\n\nmeeting friends after work.\u201d What she\u2019s wearing: Soft Joie\n\nsnakeskin-print pants, Joie tank top, Tabitha marigold swing jacket from\n\nAnthropologie, Johnston & Murphy oxfords, tie beaded necklace from\n\nCusp, silver shark tooth necklace by Heist, and watch by Baume &\n\nMercier.\n\nThe Details\n\nAll photographs by Andrew Propp. Makeup by Johny Saade and hair by Clementine Croissant, both courtesy of Isabelle\u2019s Okyo Salon.\n\nThink\n\nyou or someone you know deserves a chance in the What I Wear to Work\n\nspotlight?
