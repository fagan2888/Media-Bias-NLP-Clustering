Because no one is tracking how many 2014 enrollees were insured in 2012, it's impossible to say for certain what the city's new uninsured rate is, but the state does know that roughly 93 percent of Medicaid enrollees were uninsured at the time of their enrollment and 63 percent of those who purchased private insurance were uninsured when they enrolled.\n\nThat suggests a drop of nearly 60 percent, from 1.2 million New Yorkers to somewhere around 487,000.\n\nCapital took state data released last month and broke down enrollees by zip code. The accompanying chart allows you to see how many enrollees there were in Medicaid, private health insurance plans (Q.H.P.) and Children's Health Plus for each zip code in the city. (An asterisk means less than 50 people enrolled.)\n\nCapital also compared the data to a 2012 map from the city's Human Resources Administration, which broke down the uninsured rate by neighborhood. As you can see from looking at the two maps at the bottom of the article, the highest uptick of Medicaid enrollees (in the first map) was in neighborhoods that had the highest uninsured rate before the A.C.A. took effect (the second map), meaning the impact was felt in areas that needed it most.\n\nIn fact, just 10 zip codes in the city accounted for 118,000 Medicaid enrollees. That alone lowered the uninsured rate by roughly 10 percent. The top 20 zip codes accounted for about 36 percent of the city's Medicaid surge.\n\nIn 2012, about 25 percent of Sunset Park West in Brooklyn lacked health insurance, according to the city's Human Resources Administration. The 11220 zip code, which overlaps with that neighborhood, saw 16,303 people sign up for Medicaid and another 1,667 enroll in a private health insurance plan. Flushing also had an uninsured rate above 25 percent and the 11355 zip code enrolled 13,434 in Medicaid and 2,203 signed up for a private plan. Corona's 11368 enrolled 12,480 people in Medicaid and 1,625 people in a private plan.\n\nMuch of this can be explained by the enormous investment the state and federal governments made to insure people across New York and the country. Community based organizations and immigrant advocacy groups spent months embedded in these neighborhoods explaining insurance options, and much of that activity was underwritten by the new law.\n\n\u201cThese neighborhoods have had unprecedented levels of outreach and resources,\u201d said Amy Shefrin, program officer at the New York State Health Foundation. \u201cAll these organizations are seeking out the uninsured in ways they never had before.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act and a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states the option of expanding their Medicaid programs, opening them up to a greater number of people. New York accepted this offer but its program was already so expansive the new law was not supposed to have much of an impact.\n\nIn 2011, the United Hospital Fund estimated the change in the number of Medicaid eligible individuals in the entire state would only be about 100,000. \u201cAny increase in the take-up rate that A.C.A. inspires among already eligible individuals may ultimately be a much more significant issue in New York,\u201d predicted a 2012 Independent Budget Report.\n\nThis is where the woodwork effect, also known as the welcome mat effect, appears to have played an enormous role. Because the state was advertising it's exchange, New York State of Health, and because so much press attention focused on enrollment, thousands of previously eligible New Yorkers enrolled.\n\n\u201cNew York was ahead of the curve in making it easier to enroll but the ACA was the game changer,\u201d Shefrin said. \u201cIt laid out a welcome mat for Medicaid. \u2026 There's a culture of coverage now.\u201d\n\nCity's Uninsured\n\ndata visualization by Brendan Cheney", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/10/8554538/mapping-obamacare-new-york-city-zip-code", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20sunset%20park.png", "type": "article", "title": "Mapping Obamacare by New York City zip code"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Analysis by Capital shows uninsured rate has dropped to historic lows while Medicaid enrollment in immigrant neighborhoods surged"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThese neighborhoods have had unprecedented levels of outreach and resources,\u201d said Amy Shefrin, program officer at the New York State Health Foundation.\nThe accompanying chart allows you to see how many enrollees there were in Medicaid, private health insurance plans (Q.H.P.)\nIn 2012, the last year for which city data is available, there were 1.2 million uninsured adults in New York City.\nIn fact, just 10 zip codes in the city accounted for 118,000 Medicaid enrollees.\nIn 2012, about 25 percent of Sunset Park West in Brooklyn lacked health insurance, according to the city's Human Resources Administration."}
