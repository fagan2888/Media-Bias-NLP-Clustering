According to Allegheny County Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams, the bags of heroin reportedly involved in what\u2019s being called a \u201cmajor public health crisis\u201d are stamped with the logo \u201cTheraflu\u201d and reportedly contain traces of Fentanyl, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nHealth officials in Pittsburgh have issued a warning that involves any heroin baggies marked with the word \u201cTheraflu\u201d written in red ink after 17 people overdosed following its use.

Williams told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette fentanyl is between 10 and 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nPrevention Point Pittsburgh \u2014 an advocacy group looking to help addicts with beating their addiction \u2014 launched the Overdose Prevention Project in 2002 following a devastating amount of overdose deaths in Allegheny County. Overdose deaths in recent years have continued to rise, especially in Allegheny County, which experts say represents a majority of the national average. Over 6,000 individuals including 4,700 inmates in the County Jail were enrolled in the ODP as of 2008.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2004 deaths tied to drug overdoses increased by 62 percent across the country and 97 percent in Allegheny County. Allegheny\u2019s 252 overdose deaths in 2006 were more than both its traffic accidents and homicide deaths combined.
