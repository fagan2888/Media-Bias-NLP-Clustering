Control of the West Virginia state House of Delegates flipped from Democrats to Republicans. And Arkansas elected Republican supermajorities to both houses of its legislature along with a Republican governor, a situation that could imperil the Medicaid expansion that helped more than 200,000 of its poorest residents get health insurance.\n\nThat places that benefited most from the law still supported politicians who oppose it should not be a surprise. Republicans were the favorites in many of these races, and polling has shown that health reform had faded as a decisive issue for many voters. Counties that showed the biggest gains in insurance coverage were more likely to be strongly Republican-leaning than Democratic based on their 2012 presidential votes, according to an Upshot analysis of data from Enroll America and Civis Analytics. That pattern appears to have held.\n\nMy colleague Abby Goodnough reported from Kentucky in September and found people who were pleased by their new coverage under the law remained unhappy with the Democrats who passed it.\n\n\u201cBorn and raised Republican,\u201d Robin Evans, an eBay warehouse packer who was grateful for new Medicaid coverage, said of herself. \u201cI ain\u2019t planning on changing now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141105060006, "twitter": {"description": "People who were pleased with their new health care coverage remained unhappy with the Democrats who passed it.", "title": "States Benefiting Most From Obama\u2019s Health Law Elected Republicans", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/upshot/states-benefiting-most-from-obamas-health-law-elected-republicans.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003217317"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "sangerkatz", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/upshot/states-benefiting-most-from-obamas-health-law-elected-republicans.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003217317", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/upshot/states-benefiting-most-from-obamas-health-law-elected-republicans.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 5, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Democratic Party", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Midterm Elections (2014),Republican Party,Democratic Party", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "People who were pleased with their new health care coverage remained unhappy with the Democrats who passed it.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "People who were pleased with their new health care coverage remained unhappy with the Democrats who passed it.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Democratic Party", "published": "2014-11-05", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "slug": "06up-aca", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150824162635, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/upshot/states-benefiting-most-from-obamas-health-law-elected-republicans.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "People who were pleased with their new health care coverage remained unhappy with the Democrats who passed it.", "title": "States Benefiting Most From Obama\u2019s Health Law Elected Republicans"}, "pdate": 20141105, "des": "Midterm Elections (2014)", "articleid": 100000003217317, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "States Benefiting Most From Obama\u2019s Health Law Elected Republicans", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBorn and raised Republican,\u201d Robin Evans, an eBay warehouse packer who was grateful for new Medicaid coverage, said of herself.\nControl of the West Virginia state House of Delegates flipped from Democrats to Republicans.\nArkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia \u2014 states that saw substantial drops in the proportion of their residents without insurance \u2014 all elected Republican Senate candidates who oppose the Affordable Care Act.\nThat places that benefited most from the law still supported politicians who oppose it should not be a surprise.\nIn places where the uninsured rate plummeted this year, Republicans still scored big electoral victories."}
