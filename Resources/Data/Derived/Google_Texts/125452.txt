Implementation of the Affordable Care Act provisions is in full swing, and the use of high deductible health plans (HDHPs) is on the rise—a trend that will only continue as the so-called “Cadillac tax” on expensive employer-sponsored health insurance comes into play.

As the workforce ages, however, more clients who are approaching retirement age may see their health coverage change to include HDHPs. While some might view this change as a negative development, in reality, this evolving system can open the door to powerful planning strategies—and combining HDHPs with health savings accounts (HSAs) can allow clients to take advantage of a tax advantaged savings technique to maximize the value of those high deductible plans.
