At that point in time, the results suggested that as many as 20% of cancer deaths could be attributed to obesity.\n\nDeveloped by ASCO's Energy Balance Working Group, the policy statement emphasizes the growing cancer threat posed by obesity, which is predicted to overtake tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer. Almost three-fourths of Americans meet criteria for overweight or obesity, which underscores the health threat and its potential to \"undo decades of prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of cancer,\" Hudis said.\n\nThe policy statement establishes a road map for addressing the four priorities laid out in the introduction to the document:\n\nWork with ASCO membership and other health organizations to develop weight management guidelines for cancer survivors, tools to help clinicians initiate conversations about weight loss with patients, patient-directed tools, and resources on weight management\n\nClose gaps in health insurance coverage (public and private) that restrict access to weight management services\n\nPartner with other organizations to promote increased public awareness about the role of a healthy lifestyle in cancer prevention\n\nAdvance national policies that encourage support for healthy lifestyles in the community and workplace\n\nAdvocate for policies that will improve access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for obesity\n\nWith regard to closing gaps in health insurance coverage, ASCO calls for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to add obesity to the list of conditions eligible for the proposed Complex Chronic Care Management Services payments, and for the Department of Health and Human Services to develop clear definitions of access to obesity treatment services in state healthcare exchange plans that have emerged from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs an example of resources for clinicians and patients, ASCO pointed to its guide, released earlier this year, to help oncology providers engage patients in conversations about the effects of obesity on cancer risk, as well as a companion guide for patients.\n\nThe policy statement calls for development of a clearly defined, coordinated, and robust research agenda involving unresolved issues in the association between obesity and cancer. Studies are needed to determine whether weight loss can reduce the risk of developing or dying of cancer, whether obesity should be treated differently in cancer survivors than in the general population, and when and how to initiate weight management interventions for cancer patients.\n\n\"Research has clearly established that there is a critical relationships between cancer and obesity, but more work is needed to determine whether weight loss, increased physical activity, and improved dietary quality can lower cancer rates and improve outcomes,\" Jennifer Ligibel, MD, chair of ASCO's cancer survivorship and cancer prevention committees, said in a statement.\n\n\"No single organization or medical specialty can address obesity alone, and we will collaborate with other groups to find evidence-based solutions for our patients,\" added Ligibel, one of the co-authors of the position statement.\n\nASCO has organized an obesity research summit that will occur later this year. Obesity researchers from multiple disciplines will meet to identify specific research priorities and strategies.\n\nThe complete policy statement is available online.\n\nHudis and Ligabel disclosed no relevant relationships with industry.
