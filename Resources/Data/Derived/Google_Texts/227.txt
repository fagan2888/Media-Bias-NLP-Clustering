A GOLD-medal winning world champion Paralympian, a war hero and a former world junior squash champion are the latest high-flyers to lose their ­Australian honours in disgrace.

As Governor-General Quentin Bryce prepares to ­announce more medals to mark Australia Day, the ­Sunday ­Herald Sun can reveal the latest awardees to join the list of 42 political leaders, entrepreneurs, sports stars, ­entertainers, fake war heroes and religious leaders deemed unfit to retain their honours.

Geelong athlete Daniel Bell handed back his gong in June, 10 months after pleading guilty to stalking and burglary ­charges in the Geelong Magistrates' Court.

Bell was awarded an Order of Australia medal for services to sport after winning swimming gold in the 4x100m medley relay at the Athens 2004 ­Paralympic Games.

His citation reads: "He brought great credit to himself, the Australian team and the nation."

Bell, who has Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and "obsessive behaviours", was placed on an 18-month community corrections order and rehabilitation programs to ­prevent reoffending.

His defence lawyer said Bell was "hearing voices and … was no longer in control of himself" at the time of his offending after an adverse reaction to a generic drug.

In November, the Governor-General also cancelled the Commendation for Distinguished Service made to former Major Robin Paul Turner. No reason was given.

The award is for the ­distinguished performance of duties in warlike operations and recognises command and leadership in military action.

The Governor-General's office refused to say why Turner's award was removed, saying that "due to security restrictions", details of some awards to Australian Defence Force personnel are not ­released to the public.

When asked if Turner was one of the so-called "Jedi council", an unidentified ­Defence spokesperson said: "On 14 November 2013, the Australian Army announced that it had terminated the ­service of six members in ­relation to the allegations of unacceptable behaviour.''

The award revocation was dated a day before the Jedi council ­announcement and ­released a day after.

The so-called "knights of the Jedi council" are alleged to have filmed and shared offensive emails, including sex acts.

The Sunday Herald Sun was unable to contact Turner.

Former junior world squash champion and head of Squash NSW Carin Clonda, 40, was stripped of her 2010 Order of Australia medal in September.

Ms Clonda confirmed the decision was linked to a scathing NSW Supreme Court judgment against her in 2012.

Justice Michael Pembroke found Ms Clonda had acted with "guile and deception" in changing a lease arrangement she had to hire facilities from NSW Squash headquarters in Sydney's northwest in 2008.

But Ms Clonda said she was the victim of a personal vendetta by NSW Squash.
