But there will be a group of individuals that will be cautiously partaking in the festivities or not participating at all \u2013 and they\u2019re veterans.\n\nIn a bit of irony, the day in celebration of America\u2019s freedom can bring back visions of wars long past for veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nClinical Psychologist Dr. Wendy Katz, of the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, treats many Veterans with PTSD who dread the Fourth. \u201cThe flash of light, firecrackers, can sound to them like mortar attacks,\u201d Katz said via va.gov. \u201cI worked with one veteran who took cover with his young son at this kind of celebration. It\u2019s very complicated for them since it\u2019s supposed to be the birthday of freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to most Veterans with PTSD. It\u2019s something they try to avoid,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Fine, Director of the PTSD program at VANYHHS via va.gov. Dr. Fine said the reaction \u201ccan range from a startle to a full-blown anxiety attack and flashback of combat.\u201d That\u2019s why, he explained, many veterans keep noise-canceling headphones on hand. Over the years, \u201csome Veterans have acclimatized and have learned how to successfully minimize their reaction to fireworks, TV and sudden noises.\u201d\n\nEven if veterans are being treated for PTSD through a variety of means, whether it be the VA, Indian Health Service or a more traditional route that does not require medication, the day can generate nightmares.\n\nRELATED: Healing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder With Native Medicine\n\nAs va.gov points out too, oftentimes veterans who have a reaction are left feeling embarrassed by their reactions in front of family and friends.\n\nThe va.gov site however states that having family and friends around you can help ease the anxiety. A support system that understands what a veteran is going through, or could go through, with PTSD makes having a plan for such episodes possible and can limit any further anxiety or attack.\n\nAccording to the National Center for PTSD, some veterans tend to avoid the holiday\u2019s festivities all together, opting to stay home and away from anything that could trigger flashbacks.\n\nSo, as many get ready to watch fireworks, or let them off, be aware of your surroundings as there may just be a veteran suffering from PTSD trying not to relive his past on his country\u2019s birthday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "July 4th, a celebration of America\u2019s freedom with cookouts and fireworks can bring flashbacks of war for veterans with PTSD.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/04/irony-fireworks-and-freedom-while-living-ptsd-july-4th-155664", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/veterans_with_ptsd_and_july_4th_-_courtesy_national_cneter_for_ptsd.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The Irony of Fireworks and Freedom While Living With PTSD on July 4th"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "The Irony of Fireworks and Freedom While Living With PTSD on July 4th"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/04/irony-fireworks-and-freedom-while-living-ptsd-july-4th-155664", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-04T12:44-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "July 4th, Independence Day, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Military Veterans, Fireworks, PTSD, Native American Military Veterans, Native Veterans, Native American Veterans", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "The Irony of Fireworks and Freedom While Living With PTSD on July 4th"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde949\"", "article_summary": "In a bit of irony, the day in celebration of America\u2019s freedom can bring back visions of wars long past for veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nIt\u2019s very complicated for them since it\u2019s supposed to be the birthday of freedom.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to most Veterans with PTSD.\nClinical Psychologist Dr. Wendy Katz, of the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, treats many Veterans with PTSD who dread the Fourth.\nIt\u2019s something they try to avoid,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Fine, Director of the PTSD program at VANYHHS via va.gov.\nAccording to the National Center for PTSD, some veterans tend to avoid the holiday\u2019s festivities all together, opting to stay home and away from anything that could trigger flashbacks."}
