After terror attacks in Canada yesterday and earlier this week left two soldiers dead, federal law enforcement agencies are beefing up security in Washington D.C. and around the country.

Security at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery, which is similar to the National War Memorial patrolled by the Canadian soldier killed yesterday, has been increased as a precaution. According to a memo obtained by Fox News, the FBI has asked field offices across the country to stay alert and vigilant. Officials are also paying close attention to ISIS chatter about Canada and the United States.

Late last night Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave a statement to the country and the world, saying they will not be intimidated by terror.

"We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated," Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed in a nationally televised address hours after a masked gunman killed a soldier standing guard at Ottawa's war memorial shortly before 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The suspect then stormed Parliament in a dramatic attack that was stopped cold when he was shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms.
