The value of those accounts could accumulate over time and be transferred to others as if they were checking accounts.\n\nUnder his plan, Carson says people would be free to return to private plans they used before the Affordable Care Act, even if those plans did not meet the \u201cminimal essential coverage\u201d requirements put in place by the federal government. Pre-Obamacare plans often were less expensive, but did not meet basic expectations of insurance.\n\n\n\nAlso under Carson\u2019s plan, the age that seniors would become eligible for Medicare would jump from 65 to 70. Seniors in the program would receive fixed contributions to their own choice of private health plan, rather than a government one.\n\nMedicaid, meanwhile, would be shifted to the states, although Carson would block state officials from using federal money to administer the program. Instead, Medicaid dollars would have to be used to pay for coverage or go to people\u2019s private health savings accounts. The plan does not stipulate how states would pay to administrate the program.\n\nFour pages of Carson\u2019s ten-page plan are full color photos of himself, including two from when he worked as a neurosurgeon. In one of the images, he looks intently at brain scans, and in the other, he is wearing full scrubs performing a surgery.\n\nOn its surface, Carson\u2019s plan repeats many of the conservative criticisms of Obama and his signature domestic achievement. But other than promising to dismantle Obamacare, Carson\u2019s proposal lacks specificity. It\u2019s unclear how, exactly, he would improve the delivery of health care, how his plan would keep costs down, or how those who cannot afford quality insurance would pay for medical treatment.\n\n\u201cBy expanding HEAs and high-deductible insurance coverage, my plan returns money and decision-making where it belongs \u2014 into the hands of American patients and their doctors,\u201d the conclusion of the plan reads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson released his health care reform plan Wednesday, which promises to allow people to return to their pre-Affordable Care Act plans and strips Medicaid from the federal government.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The plan contains few policy specifics", "title": "Ben Carson Releases Health Care Reform Plan", "url": "http://time.com/4143205/ben-carson-health-care-plan/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/ben-carson-portrait.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/ben-carson-portrait.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The plan contains few policy specifics", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ben Carson Releases Health Care Reform Plan"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016 election, dr. benjamin s. carson, health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ben carson, ben carson doctor, ben carson health care, ben carson obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Also under Carson\u2019s plan, the age that seniors would become eligible for Medicare would jump from 65 to 70.\nSeniors in the program would receive fixed contributions to their own choice of private health plan, rather than a government one.\nThe plan hinges on repealing Obamacare and creating individual health care accounts for each citizen at birth.\nOn its surface, Carson\u2019s plan repeats many of the conservative criticisms of Obama and his signature domestic achievement.\nInstead, Medicaid dollars would have to be used to pay for coverage or go to people\u2019s private health savings accounts."}
