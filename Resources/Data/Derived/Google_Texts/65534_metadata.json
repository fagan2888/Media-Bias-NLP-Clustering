Yanukovych fled to Russia in February after protests erupted over his efforts to establish closer economic ties with Moscow.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s employment means he will be working as a director and top lawyer for a Ukrainian energy company during the period when his father and others in the Obama administration attempt to influence the policies of Ukraine\u2019s new government, especially on energy issues.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that Hunter Biden, his father or Burisma are crossing any legal or ethical lines, although ethics experts appear divided over the implications of Hunter Biden\u2019s new job.\n\nAmerican conflict-of-interest laws and federal ethics rules essentially do not regulate the business activities of adult relatives of those who work in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe primary problem here is the fact that Hunter Biden has set up a financial arrangement with someone who might have business pending before this administration,\u201d said Craig Holman, an ethics expert with Public Citizen, a Washington-based government reform organization.\n\nJoe Biden led the U.S. delegation at Saturday\u2019s inauguration of Ukraine\u2019s new president, Petro Poroshenko. The two spoke for a few minutes at a reception after the ceremony\n\nUkraine is an important natural-gas and petroleum-liquids transit country. Two major pipeline systems carry Russian gas through Ukraine to Western Europe.\n\nBurisma is headed by Nikolai Zlochevskyi, who held senior posts over natural resources, environment and defense in Ukraine. The company has aggressively bought up Ukrainian oil and natural gas leases and companies.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s new company says it aims to reduce Ukraine\u2019s dependence on Russian gas and oil, a goal that parallels U.S. efforts to aid Ukraine\u2019s energy industry.\n\nAs a Burisma director and the company\u2019s top lawyer, the younger Biden has yet to take any public actions on behalf of the company.\n\nBut the timing of his hiring is politically awkward for the administration\u2019s efforts to shore up Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western government, and poses potential complications from Burisma\u2019s growing energy interests and the background of Hunter Biden\u2019s new boss, Zlochevskyi.\n\nAt least two oil and natural gas fields leased by subsidiaries of Burisma are in Ukrainian territories where pro-Russian sentiments remain strong, according to government and media releases, independent energy maps and Burisma\u2019s website.\n\nOne is in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea; the other is in the eastern Ukrainian Kharkiv region. Instability there could force the younger Biden\u2019s new company to coordinate with pro-Russian separatists whom the U.S. considers illegitimate.\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment on Hunter Biden\u2019s association with Burisma and the company\u2019s holdings in Crimea and east Ukraine.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s spokeswoman, Kendra Barkoff, previously said that Biden\u2019s son is a private citizen and a lawyer, and that Joe Biden \u201cdoes not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company.\u201d\n\nPresidents and vice presidents have long been vexed by relatives rewarded for family ties.\n\nPolitical loan troubles shadowed Vice President Richard Nixon\u2019s brother, Donald, during the 1960 election, and President Jimmy Carter\u2019s brother, Billy, who accepted a $220,000 stipend in 1981 from Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nIn recent years, several Bush and Clinton relatives were caught in a string of murky financial and political dealings.\n\nBut \u201cunless there\u2019s solid evidence that Hunter Biden got his job to influence American foreign policy, there\u2019s no clear line that\u2019s been crossed,\u201d said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nA former Washington lobbyist, the vice president\u2019s son is effectively exempt from most rules that would require him to describe publicly the legal work he does on behalf of Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden will not lobby for the company, said Lawrence Pacheco, an official with FTI Consulting, a Washington government affairs company recently hired by Burisma.\n\nPacheco did not say whether Biden might oversee or advise on any future Burisma lobbying strategy in the U.S. Pacheco said the company \u201cdoes not take positions on political matters.\u201d\n\nBut Biden\u2019s company may have to deal with Ukranian enclaves that the U.S. does not recognize diplomatically or are threatened by instability.\n\nOne Burisma subsidiary, KrymTopEnergoServis, operates natural gas fields and has headquarters in the Crimea, which seceded from Ukraine this year and now aligns with Russia.\n\nA second subsidiary, Esco-Pivnich, produces oil and natural gas just west of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, which was the site of several protests and borders on separatist-controlled provinces. The company\u2019s website confirms that Burisma operates oil and natural gas sites in Crimea and east Ukraine, as well as elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhile he\u2019s just at the beginning of his involvement with this company, Ukraine is volatile right now and there are all sorts of problems that might crop up down the line,\u201d said Bill Allison, the editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group.\n\nPacheco said the company\u2019s western and eastern operations have been unaffected by Ukraine\u2019s unrest but that its Crimea subsidiary is not operating currently. He did not explain further, but confirmed KrymTopEnergoServis is based and leases gas deposits in Crimea.\n\nHunter Biden, Zlochevskyi and other company officials would not comment publicly, Pacheco said.\n\nHunter Biden is a managing director with Rosemont Seneca Partners, a private equity firm, and worked as a Washington lobbyist for seven years until his father was elected vice president. He lobbied primarily for colleges, hospitals and tech firms.\n\nPacheco said Biden\u2019s son came to Burisma\u2019s attention after he was introduced by Devon Archer, another new Burisma board member, to Alan Apter, Burisma\u2019s board chairman. Archer works with Hunter Biden at Rosemont and was a top fundraiser for now-Secretary of State John Kerry when Kerry ran for president in 2004. Zlochevskyi approved Biden\u2019s hiring, Pacheco said.\n\nZlochevskyi, 48, worked as minister of natural resources and environment under Yanukovych and most recently was deputy secretary of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defense council, which advised Yanukovych on defense matters.\n\nZlochevskyi also served in the Ukrainian parliament from 2007 to 2011 as a member of the Party of Regions, the political party affiliated with Yanukovych and traditionally aligned with pro-Russian interests.\n\nZlochevskyi\u2019s name is missing from Burisma\u2019s web site, but financial documents in Cyprus as well as U.S. Securities and Exchange records show that he owns the bulk of Burisma\u2019s shares. Zlochevskyi\u2019s Cyprus-based Brociti Investments Limited controls Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden joined Burisma in April, the same month his father visited Kiev to show support for the new interim government.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, and Laura Mills in Kiev contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden's weekend trip to support Ukraine's fragile democracy comes soon after his youngest son was hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Moscow.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s weekend trip to support Ukraine\u2019s fragile democracy comes soon after his youngest son was hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Moscow.", "title": "Ukrainian energy firm hires Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, as lawyer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/7/ukrainian-energy-firm-hires-biden-son-as-lawyer/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/07/333dd662427a6416560f6a706700d7e9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/07/333dd662427a6416560f6a706700d7e9.jpg", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden's weekend trip to support Ukraine's fragile democracy comes soon after his youngest son was hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Moscow.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ukrainian energy firm hires Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, as la"}, "Author": "Stephen Braun", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, Joe Biden, Burisma Holdings Limited, Ukraine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd391e\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s no indication that Hunter Biden, his father or Burisma are crossing any legal or ethical lines, although ethics experts appear divided over the implications of Hunter Biden\u2019s new job.\nHunter Biden joined Burisma in April, the same month his father visited Kiev to show support for the new interim government.\nWhite House officials declined to comment on Hunter Biden\u2019s association with Burisma and the company\u2019s holdings in Crimea and east Ukraine.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s weekend trip to support Ukraine\u2019s fragile democracy comes soon after his youngest son was hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Moscow.\nHunter Biden, Zlochevskyi and other company officials would not comment publicly, Pacheco said."}
