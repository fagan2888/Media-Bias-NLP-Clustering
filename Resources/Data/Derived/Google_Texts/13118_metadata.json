Not surprisingly, some states are doing better than others when it comes to healthy living.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 15 Unhealthiest States\n\nNow in its 26th year, the report highlights the challenges facing the public health of the nation. The good news is that smoking continues to decline, immunization rates are going up and there\u2019s been a decrease in preventable hospitalizations. On the other hand, there\u2019s been a worrisome growth in the rates of drug deaths, diabetes, children in poverty and obesity.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, Hawaii ranks as the nation\u2019s healthiest state. Louisiana falls into last place, replacing Mississippi, which is now second to last in the rankings.\n\nObesity stands out among the many challenges facing the U.S. Nearly one third of all U.S. adults are obese, with a body mass index of 30 or higher. Obesity contributes to 200,000 deaths a year and leads to heart disease, stroke, cancer, liver disease, kidney disease and dementia, among other preventable conditions. About 21 percent of overall health spending, or $190.2 billion, is spent on obesity-related health issues every year.\n\nThe data used in the report comes from the Department of Commerce, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association and other reputable sources. Analysts looked at a wide variety of variables, including obesity, smoking, diabetes, hospitalizations and physical inactivity.\n\nClick here to see the 15 unhealthiest states in America.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United Health Foundation just released its annual", "title": "Do You Live in the Unhealthiest State in America?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/17/Do-You-Live-Unhealthiest-State-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07182012_flight_obese_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/17/Do-You-Live-Unhealthiest-State-America", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/07182012_flight_obese_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The United Health Foundation just released its annual", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Click here to see the 15 unhealthiest states in America.\nAbout 21 percent of overall health spending, or $190.2 billion, is spent on obesity-related health issues every year.\nSLIDESHOW: The 15 Unhealthiest StatesNow in its 26th year, the report highlights the challenges facing the public health of the nation.\nObesity contributes to 200,000 deaths a year and leads to heart disease, stroke, cancer, liver disease, kidney disease and dementia, among other preventable conditions.\nThe good news is that smoking continues to decline, immunization rates are going up and there\u2019s been a decrease in preventable hospitalizations."}
