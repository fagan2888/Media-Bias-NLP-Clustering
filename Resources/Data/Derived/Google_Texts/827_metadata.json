Even Carly Fiorina said that she would not talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but she would encircle his country with missiles and troops.\n\nKasich, on the other hand, gave calm, reasoned answers to foreign policy questions. While he said that he was not totally pleased with the current treaty with Iran, he admitted that it represented a multinational approach to world problems, a fact that was too wonderful to ignore.\n\nWhen discussing the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, the other candidates tried to out do each other\u2019s disdain for poor and low-income people without offering alternative health care plans. Again Kasich pointed out the logic that preventive health care for all helps all state budgets down the road.\n\nIf the Republican Party wants to be taken seriously, it has to support serious, moderate, compromising politicians.\n\nThis is the only way to get legislation passed in Congress and the only way to gain respect for the presidency on the world stage.\n\n\u2014 Jan Goldberg, Riverside", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "John Kasich seems like presidential material", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Thank you for your Wednesday editorial, \u201c John Kasich, the anti-Trump .\u201d", "title": "John Kasich seems like presidential material", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/letters/ct-john-kasich-seems-like-presidential-material-20151001-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dab70/turbine/ct-john-kasich-seems-like-presidential-material-20151001", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "john kasich, donald trump, ohio governor, republican presidential debate, 2016 elections", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84574948", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-10-01", "Description": "If the Republican Party wants to be taken seriously, it has to support serious, moderate, compromising politicians like Gov.
