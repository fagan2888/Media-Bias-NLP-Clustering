But because of this project, we\u2019ll all be able to share in affordable energy.\u201d\n\nColorado was the first state to give people the option of moving past the individual panels and receiving solar energy via shared electric systems. Now, a Denver-based company, SunShare, is partnering with Xcel Energy to bring the technology to Denver.\n\nSunShare is building community solar gardens in Adams, Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson counties to go along with two that have been online in Colorado Springs for the past two years.\n\nOn Thursday, Hancock, City Council president Chris Herndon and other officials were at the school to celebrate an agreement in which the families of each of the 125 charter school students will receive six-tenths of a kilowatt of free solar energy in their homes.\n\nAccording to SunShare CEO David Amster-Olszewski, that will mean about a 20 percent reduction in those families\u2019 monthly home energy bill.\n\n\u201cThat will have a big impact \u2014 it means they\u2019ll be able to put healthier foods on the table or buy more sports equipment for their kids\u2019 health,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, this was illegal. \u2026 That\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with Academy 360 \u2014 solar energy is the future, and these kids and this school \u2026 are the future, too.\u201d\n\nColorado passed the Community Solar Act, allowing the solar/electrical partnerships, four years ago. Now, 16 other states have passed or are in the process of passing similar legislation. Denver\u2019s first solar garden, near Denver International Airport, is expected to go online early next year; when that happens, Amster-Olszewski said, he\u2019ll be spending a lot more time with the Academy 360 students.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring all the students and their families out to it, and they\u2019ll be able to place their own panels on the grid,\u201d he said. \u201cToday is really cool, but that will be the cherry on top.\u201d\n\nAnthony Cotton: 303-954-1292, acotton@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ anthonycottondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Here comes the sun: Montbello school the recipient of solar energy", "title": "Here comes the sun: Montbello school the recipient of solar energy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/28/here-comes-the-sun-montbello-school-the-recipient-of-solar-energy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140828__20140829_A4_CD28SOLARp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140828__20140829_A4_CD28SOLARp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-28T16:58:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:03:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Chatting with students Thursday at Academy 360 in Denver\u2019s Montbello neighborhood, Mayor Michael Hancock made a little confession: He shared in their wonderment regarding solar energy.\n\u2026 That\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with Academy 360 \u2014 solar energy is the future, and these kids and this school \u2026 are the future, too.\u201dColorado passed the Community Solar Act, allowing the solar/electrical partnerships, four years ago.\n\u201cWhen I was your age, I used to see these magical solar panels on houses, and I wondered what they did,\u201d Hancock said.\nDenver\u2019s first solar garden, near Denver International Airport, is expected to go online early next year; when that happens, Amster-Olszewski said, he\u2019ll be spending a lot more time with the Academy 360 students.\nAccording to SunShare CEO David Amster-Olszewski, that will mean about a 20 percent reduction in those families\u2019 monthly home energy bill."}
