After speaking with University Health Services representatives as well as student leaders involved in the decision making process, we are appalled at the lack of due diligence by those in positions of authority.\n\nThroughout the decision-making process, few families who rely on this coverage were informed or included in any conversation regarding the proposed changes. In addition, we were given only a four-month window to find alternative health insurance. Furthermore, we believe that UHS either failed to investigate or purposefully downplayed the effects of this change in policy on student families.\n\nAs affected individuals who have extensively researched all of our insurance options, we can say with confidence that the alternative policies suggested to us do not offer coverage comparable with the existing SHIP plan. It has been noted that SHIP dependent medical expenses are greater than the money earned from their premiums. This implies that dependents enrolled in SHIP have more complex medical issues and require better coverage than is offered by alternative plans. Although the Affordable Care Act prevents insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, we believe that the proposed changes result in dropping a vulnerable population from the plan based on their higher-than-average health needs.\n\nIn addition, we would like to address the \u201ctransition assistance fund\u201d recently proposed by UHS to provide compensation to families forced to enroll in more costly insurance elsewhere. This plan is little more than a stop-gap measure in reaction to public pressure on UHS and does nothing to create a long-term solution for the health-care needs of student families. It will be offered for only one year and will be available only to families already enrolled in SHIP, disqualifying other eligible student dependents in need of health coverage. The very fact that this fund has been created clearly demonstrates that UHS concedes that alternative affordable medical care does not exist for all student families.\n\nAs constituents of ASUC and the Graduate Assembly, we are deeply disappointed by the lack of advocacy shown by student government during the decision-making process that led to the elimination of SHIP dependent insurance. These bodies\u2019 failure to advocate on behalf of the health and well being of student families is egregious. From what we have heard from members of the ASUC and the GA, we understand that UHS failed to disclose all the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the consequences of discontinuing dependent health coverage. But we also strongly feel that student leaders need to independently verify information and secure input from those effected prior to making significant decisions. We look forward to building alliances with individual members in these groups who, upon further reflection, share our concerns about how this decision was made.\n\nWe will continue to fight for the reinstatement of dependent health insurance for our children, spouses and partners, and we ask the campus community for support. UHS might perceive dependent coverage as just another row of numbers in its budget, but to those of us who are affected, it is a critical matter of access to essential care and treatment. In the face of this overtly hostile policy, future students with families may choose to attend institutions with more family-friendly policies instead of UC Berkeley. Any campus that claims to embrace diversity should not discriminate against students who contribute to a diverse academic environment. Furthermore, a public institution of higher education should not solve its budgetary problems by shifting costs onto struggling public health and Affordable Care Act subsidy programs.\n\nWe invite representatives of UHS, the ASUC and the GA to clarify their position and address our concerns. We believe it is possible to reverse the UHS decision and have dependent health insurance reinstated. To this end, we have started an online petition to support student families. We will not settle for less, and we hope that you will join us in this struggle.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichal Olszewski and Caitrin Olszewski on behalf of student families of the Berkeley Health Care Coalition\n\nContact the opinion desk at [email protected] or follow us on Twitter @dailycalopinion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Californian", "description": "As a group of affected students and family members, we are writing to you to express our grave concerns regarding the decision to drop dependent health coverage from the UC Berkeley Student Health Insurance Plan.
