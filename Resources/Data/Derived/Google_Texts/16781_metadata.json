Nobody was talking about disrupting grocery stores and laundromats.\n\nBut with no fanfare, and no public debate, two of America\u2019s most divisive topics \u2014 Obamacare and the sharing economy \u2014 have become deeply linked. HealthCare.gov is the de facto HR site for booming app companies like Uber. Some of the legislation\u2019s architects told BuzzFeed News they see it as a foundation of the new sharing economy in which decent lives depend on a functioning individual market for health care. And executives at sharing-economy startups see Obamacare as a central plank of their ability to build huge but also sustainable businesses on the labor of people who aren\u2019t their employees.\n\nAnd whether you view the handshake between Obamacare and the sharing economy as a much needed transformation to a modern economy, as a stealth taxpayer subsidy to Silicon Valley, or as a the latest corporate scam, its outlines are emerging more clearly every day.\n\n\u201cObamacare is really coming at the best time, and is making it a lot better for the workers,\u201d said Brooke Moreland, a spokeswoman for the taxi hailing company Gett.\n\n\u201cThe growth of the collaborative economy has made Obamacare probably a stronger option,\u201d said Aaron Hall, founder of San Francisco-based boat rental company Boatbound. \u201cIt\u2019s a great add-on to the life they\u2019re now empowered to have.\u201d\n\nWhether Obamacare\u2019s tilt toward the sharing economy is a feature, a bug, or a happy accident, the companies driving this trend have noticed. TaskRabbit, for example, created a portal in partnership with FreelancerHealthcare.com that makes it easy for their contractors to navigate affordable health insurance and even offers special discounts and rates. Lyft, on the other hand, has partnered with Freelancers Union \u2014 which now works exclusively with Empire BlueCross BlueShield \u2014 to help their drivers either access Empire\u2019s health care plans or navigate state health care sites. Indeed, for some other sharing economy firms, HealthCare.gov is standing in as the health care HR site.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re legally prevented from providing our contracted cleaning professionals with health care so instead we provide them resources to help them access their own health care,\u201d a spokesperson for Homejoy, which connects people to home cleaners, said. \u201cHomejoy supports the Affordable Care Act and, for that matter, any law that helps people have a great quality of life and be able to work on their own terms.\u201d\n\nObamacare, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen \u2014 whose firm has invested in Lyft and Homejoy (as well as BuzzFeed) \u2014 tweeted Tuesday, is \u201cperhaps the single biggest key enabler for the sharing/gig/1099 economy.\u201d\n\nIt came at the right time, certainly, for Victor M., who splits his time between driving for UberTaxi in Chicago and tweeting complaints about Uber\u2019s treatment of drivers. When Victor (who declined to give his last name) began driving last year, he wasn\u2019t making enough to afford private health insurance. This year, Uber\u2019s policies pushed his earnings down a bit \u2014 to $1,500 a month, he said. But now, for the first time in his 20 years as a cabbie, Victor has health insurance, free Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, of which is he an enthusiastic fan: \u201cIt\u2019s provided much needed coverage for the working poor,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News.\n\nThere aren\u2019t reliable public figures on how many Americans have worked as independent contractors through the years, though by some definitions, the figure is extremely high: A recent study commissioned by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk (and which includes both independent contractors and more traditional \u201cfreelancers\u201d) put the present number at 53 million, or 34% of America\u2019s workforce.\n\nThose workers aren\u2019t entitled to the health care that most Americans get through their jobs. People trying to buy health care on their own have long faced either bad options \u2014 catastrophic coverage that won\u2019t pay for a doctor\u2019s visit \u2014 or unaffordable ones. Both parties have for years proposed an array of solutions \u2014 tax-funded single-payer on the left, inexpensive if threadbare private plans on the right. And while Obamacare\u2019s 2010 passage was aimed at solving an existing crisis, it arrived just as a new group of workers was entering that pool: workers for companies like Uber, Lyft, Gett, Homejoy, and Etsy, among others, which rely heavily if not entirely on independent contractors and freelancers.\n\nFreeing Americans to freelance was an original goal of Obamacare, but one that sounded like hippie self-actualization, and a hard political sell. (Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pitch that it would allow Americans to become working artists fell flat.) The technical term for the ill it meant to combat was \u201cjob-lock\u201d \u2014 the way employer-funded health care could discourage people from starting out on their own, chasing their dreams, or simply doing what they love.\n\nFreeing up workers \u201cis one of the major motivations for health care reform, if not the biggest,\u201d Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who helped design the Affordable Care Act and its direct predecessor, Romneycare in Massachusetts, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThis may be the biggest effect of the ACA and no one talks about it. We really have a hard time getting a conversation on it.\u201d\n\nAnd though there hasn\u2019t been research on the relationship between the Affordable Care Act and the rise of the sharing economy, top economists don\u2019t think a link is far-fetched.\n\n\u201cThere may be something to the idea that passing the ACA has facilitated an increase in share economy entrepreneurs,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, a former top economic adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cWhen people start as entrepreneurs, they often begin as a sidelight or doing it part-time (because it\u2019s risky and the risk of failure is highest at the beginning). Share-economy services like Uber have made that much easier to do. And one of the biggest impediments to entrepreneurship has been the fear that you couldn\u2019t get health insurance if you did. The ACA has, potentially, lessened that a great deal.\u201d\n\nThis is a difficult proposition for many of the progressives who support the Affordable Care Act, but who view the sharing economy \u2014 with its frank anti-unionism and ethos of individual over community \u2014 with deep suspicion.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of concerns about whether Uber is creating good jobs. But you don\u2019t want access to health insurance to be reason that anybody doesn\u2019t start their own business if they have an idea that they want to pursue,\u201d said Heather Boushey, chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, an independent economic think tank supported by the Center for American Progress. \u201cBy definition, that\u2019s not good for the kind of economy we want.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, sharing-economy companies have hired a former top Obama campaign official, Natalie Foster, as spokeswoman for the trade association, Peers.org, that makes their case.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act begins a new examination of the government\u2019s relationship with workers that\u2019s key to the growth of the sharing economy, said Natalie Foster, a former top official on the Obama re-election campaign and past executive director of Peers.org, the trade association for the sharing economy.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is an important first step toward tapping into the flexibility and freedom of new forms of self-employment income, while also accessing important things like health insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is no comprehensive data on sharing-economy workers who use the Affordable Care Act, though drivers and other workers reached on company message boards and social media said it was common. And in their circles \u2014 as in other Americans\u2019 \u2014 frustrations with the health care system haven\u2019t been overcome by its new affordibility.\n\nOne Uber driver, a 47-year-old woman based in Los Angeles who makes an average of $1,000 a month driving for Uber and has a part-time job on the side, in fact complained about the difficulty of getting a doctor\u2019s appointment under Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid welfare program \u2014 and said she thought a flood of sharing-economy workers might be making that worse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than having nothing, I guess,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m better off because I\u2019m not able to use it, all these bazillion people are covered under this terrific new act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater flood of workers who are reliant upon this,\u201d she said.\n\n(Disclosure: Andreessen Horowitz is an investor in BuzzFeed.
