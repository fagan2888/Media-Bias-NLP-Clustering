Times, 2-col. lead, \u201cMissouri Shooting Victim Was Hit at Least 6 Times [twice in the head]: Ex-New York Medical Examiner Releases Details of Autopsy He Conducted,\u201d by Frances Robles and Julie Bosman in Ferguson: \u201c[A] preliminary private autopsy performed on Sunday found [that one] of the bullets entered the top of [Michael] Brown\u2019s skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M.

FERGUSON \u2014 Chinese and Russian officials are warning of a potential humanitarian crisis in the restive American province of Missouri, where ancient communal tensions have boiled over into full-blown violence. \u2026 The crisis began a week ago in Ferguson, a remote Missouri village that has been a hotbed of sectarian tension.\n\n\u201cState security forces shot and killed an unarmed man, which regional analysts say has angered the local population by surfacing deep-seated sectarian grievances. Regime security forces cracked down brutally on largely peaceful protests, worsening the crisis. \u2026 A lawless expanse of dogwood trees and beer breweries, Missouri is located in a central United States region that Americans refer to, curiously, as the \u2018MidWest\u2019 though it is nearer to the country's east.\u201d http://bit.ly/1AqtLuY (h/t MarginalRevolution.com)\n\nTWEETS DU JOUR - Andrew Kaczynski @BuzzFeedAndrew: \u201cMissouri to change slogan from \u2018the show me state\u2019 to \u2018the show me your hands state.\u2019\u201d \u2026 \u200f@AlecMacGillis \u201cStunning stat, apropos #Ferguson: in 1900, St Louis was the 4th biggest city in the country.

Post\u2019s Emily Smith and Stephanie Smith: \u201cOusted \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 anchor David Gregory was paid $4 million to leave NBC and signed a contract not to speak out against the network, sources told Page Six. \u2026 A source said Gregory\u2019s contract extended into next year, so NBC had to pay him for the rest of the term, plus an extra fee to ensure his silence.

On several occasions, raucous cheers went up from the crowd, and a hint of jazzy tones could be heard in the distance.\u201d\n\nSPOTTED last night, dining on the porch at Le Diplomate: Vice President Biden (in blue blazer) and Dr. Jill Biden, just back from the Hamptons.\n\nSPOTTED, in London: Harvard IOP alum David Muir (fall 2011 fellow) and Sophie Fry (Class of 2013), at Christina Bellantoni and Patrick Khoo's engagement party at the London Cocktail Club on Saturday night in Oxford Circus.

Obama was initially expected to focus only on slowing deportations of potentially millions of undocumented immigrants and altering federal enforcement policies. Now top aides are talking with leaders in big companies like Cisco, Intel and Accenture, hoping to add more changes that would get them on board.\n\n\u201cRepresentatives for high-tech, agriculture and construction interests have put forward a range of fixes, from recapturing unused green cards to tweaking existing work authorization programs. The outreach is an effort to broaden the political support for Obama\u2019s decision to go it alone on immigration \u2014 another sign that suggests the White House fears a backlash in November, particularly among independent voters in battleground Senate races where Republicans are seizing on the issue.\u201d http://politi.co/1o4FJSv\n\n2014 -- 50-50 SENATE? \u2013 \u201cJoe Biden, Senate tiebreaker?\u201d by Edward-Isaac Dovere: \u201c[W]ere the Senate to be divided straight down the middle, it would make Biden the ultimate tie-breaker \u2014 a dream come true for a guy who spent 36 years in the institution and a potential opportunity for a V.P. who hasn\u2019t ruled out running for president. \u2018He\u2019d like two years of being the deciding vote, back in the cloakroom, in the Senate gym,\u2019 said former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), Biden\u2019s longtime chief of staff and still a close friend. \u2026\n\n\u201cTo hit a tie, Democrats would need a net loss of five seats, and most of them have already written off the seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. That leaves two, and between the races they\u2019re facing in Iowa, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina, Democrats say losing two seems a pretty safe bet. They\u2019re not counting on pickups in either Kentucky or Georgia, where their prospects are best. \u2018When you look at the map, it\u2019s totally feasible,\u2019 said a national Democratic strategist. \u2026\n\n\u201cMany, Reid included, remain unhappy with deals [Biden] reached with McConnell on the Bush tax cuts and others, and he was cut out of talks surrounding last year\u2019s government shutdown. \u2026 There have been only 244 vice presidential tie-breakers in the entire history of the Senate. The last time the Senate was 50-50, after the 2000 elections, Dick Cheney only cast eight, including the one to give Republicans the majority.\u201d http://politi.co/1v77jUM\n\nVIDEO DU JOUR \u2013 \u201cTom Steyer\u2019s ads test the boundaries of the \u2018bizarre,\u2019\u201d by Darren Goode: \u201cSteyer is trying to sway national climate policy and the midterm elections with an ad campaign that is raising eyebrows among independent fact-checkers, some television stations, his political opponents and even a few allies \u2014 using an approach that strikes observers as anywhere from groundbreaking to downright bizarre. \u2026 [Chris] Lehane, who wrote much of the ads\u2019 scripts, said they are born from creative sessions after Steyer\u2019s team has identified its target audience and message.\u201d http://politi.co/1t9zgMc\n\nCOVERING 2016 \u2013 \u201cRonayne hired by AP as NH state politics reporter\u201d \u2013 AP/Concord: \u201cKathleen Ronayne \u2026 has been hired by [AP] as a reporter in the New Hampshire statehouse. Ronayne comes to the AP after two years at the Concord Monitor \u2026 Ronayne, 24, is originally from upstate New York and now lives in Concord. She is a graduate of Syracuse University.\u201d http://bit.ly/1uLWvOs\n\nCHRISTIE CHRONICLES --\u201cGov. Christie busts a move at Hamptons party,\u201d by N.Y. Post\u2019s Emily Smith: \u201cGyrating governor Chris Christie wowed a power crowd with his energetic dance with Jamie Foxx at the starry Apollo in the Hamptons benefit Saturday night. The New Jersey gov \u2026 strutted onstage with Foxx in front of an audience that included Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Sir Paul McCartney, Jack Nicholson, Anjelica Huston and Robert DeNiro.\n\n\u201cAfter [various] performances \u2026 at Ronald Perelman\u2019s East Hampton estate, Oscar winner Foxx called out to Christie in the audience, \u2018I know you\u2019ve got a dance in you, Chris Christie.\u2019 Christie, there as a guest of Bon Jovi, raced to the stage for some rambunctious gyrating. Not to be upstaged, Sen. John McCain then joined Foxx and performed the robot dance before Paul McCartney and Spike Lee showed off more muted moves.\u201d Video, pics http://pge.sx/1AquTyN\n\nTECHWATCH -- \u201cFacebook Testing 'Satire' Tags for Sites Like The Onion,\u201d by Mashable\u2019s Chelsea Stark: \u201cFacebook is testing out a feature that marks fake news stories from sites such as The Onion with \u2018satire\u2019 in its News Feed, a feature requested by some users \u2026 \u2018We are running a small test which shows the text \u2018[Satire]\u2019 in front of links to satirical articles in the related articles unit in News Feed. This is because we received feedback that people wanted a clearer way to distinguish satirical articles from others in these units,\u2019 a Facebook representative told Mashable.\u201d http://on.mash.to/1v6GWOX\n\nMEDIAWATCH \u2013 \u201cBrian Williams taking on new competition,\u201d by AP Television Writer David Bauder: \u201c[N]early 10 years after Williams succeeded [Tom] Brokaw as NBC \u2018Nightly News\u2019 anchor[,] Williams, 55, faces new competition from both ABC and CBS as they look to end NBC's 256-week streak \u2026 David Muir takes over after Labor Day as anchor of the second-place \u2018World News\u2019 at ABC. Steve Capus, former NBC news president and longtime Williams producer, is in charge behind the scenes as Scott Pelley's executive producer at the \u2018CBS Evening News.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018When I started my competition was Dan (Rather) and Peter (Jennings),\u2019Williams said. \u2018That makes me feel old. That gets me on the treadmill every night after work. I am proud of what we've built here.\u2019 So far this year, \u2018Nightly News\u2019 has averaged 8.9 million viewers and widened its lead over ABC (8 million) and CBS (6.8 million). ABC has gained lately in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic \u2026 ABC occasionally wins in that category and, in July, was up 5 percent over last year while NBC was down 4 percent \u2026\n\n\u201c[S]ome at NBC express incredulity over some news decisions made over at ABC -- such as a recent day when NBC led its newscast with the shooting death of an American two-star general in Afghanistan while \"World News\" opened with a collision between double-decker buses in New York's Times Square. These decisions bear watching, though, since ABC overtook NBC in the morning partly because of a breezier approach that caught NBC flat-footed.\u201d http://apne.ws/1pEiq78\n\n--\u201cBrian Williams shares in daughter's acting success\u201d \u2013 AP: \u201cThe \u2026 anchor and proud father said he emailed family members to see if they approved of him reporting on his daughter [26-year-old \u2018Girls\u2019 actress Allison Williams] being cast in the lead role of \u2018Peter Pan.\u2019 NBC is airing a new version of the musical live on Dec. 4.\u201d http://bit.ly/1rM0QfE\n\n--Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Hirschberg joins Reuters -- Global Enterprise Editor Mike Williams emails the staff: \u201cPeter Hirschberg has joined Reuters as Asia Investigative Editor, based in Hong Kong. \u2026 Peter joins us from Bloomberg, where he spent nearly six years as a reporter and editor.
