LibertarianChristians.com (LCC), sponsored in part by Students for Liberty, hosted the event at St. Edward\u2019s University in Austin, Texas.\n\nAccording to Norman Horn, lead organizer and founder of LCC, people came from all over the country, along with at least one visitor from abroad: \u201cFor a year-one conference, this is pretty good, especially running on a shoestring budget and basically counting on word of mouth and the ability of just a single website to spread its ideas. This is how we did it.\u201d\n\nThe conference hosted a wide range of speakers who reflected the diversity that exists across the libertarian spectrum. That included Michael Maharrey, national communications director for the Tenth Amendment Center; David Theroux, founder and president of the Independent Institute; Jay Hall, a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP); Texas State Representative David Simpson (R-Longview); and Alexander McCobin of Students for Liberty, among others.\n\nWhat Are Libertarian Christians?\n\nMany see libertarian political philosophy as a rejection of all forms of authority over the individual. LCC, both through its website and its first live gathering of like-minded people, has sought to demonstrate how the ideas of liberty and the Christian faith go hand in hand.\n\nAccording to a statement on the group\u2019s website, \u201cChristian libertarians believe that libertarianism is the only political philosophy that is truly consistent, that makes any rational or moral sense at all, and that agrees with what we understand in the Bible and Christian history.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with the PanAm Post, Norman Horn elaborated that the group\u2019s fundamental message is that \u201cstatism is against the Kingdom of God, and is not in the natural order of things as God has planned.\u201d On the question of whether libertarianism and Christianity are truly compatible, Horn added, \u201cIt\u2019s been Christians for hundreds of years who have been some of the staunchest proponents of individual liberty and the restriction of governmental power.\u201d\n\nA large part of what the CFL conference attempted to accomplish, he explained, was to show libertarians that \u201cChristianity can be, is, and has always been a great supporter of individual liberty and an opponent of state power.\u201d\n\nThe Religion of Statism\n\nAmong the presenters, Jason Rink of the Foundation for a Free Society hosted a provocative talk titled \u201cAmerican Idol: How the State Attempts to Replace God.\u201d Rink is a self-described born-again Christian who became interested in libertarianism following Ron Paul\u2019s campaign for president in 2007. He said that while in his spiritual life he remains a disciple of Jesus, politically he has become a \u201cdisciple of Paul.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the issues that we have when trying to enter this discussion is understanding that many people are unaware of the kind of allegiance and the way that they look to the state as a replacement for God \u2026 [Government] seeks to embody and replace some of the characteristics of God and take them on for themselves,\u201d Rink explained.\n\nRink specified that the state has taken on the role of provider and healer, through its many welfare and health-care programs. As such, most of the public view it as \u201comnipotent, omnipresent, good, just, and holy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter how absurd laws may be, they are to be obeyed at all costs,\u201d Rink decried. Too many people mistakenly view the state as \u201ceternal,\u201d and the notion that the state \u201chas always existed and will always exist [makes] the idea that we can move towards a voluntary or stateless society inconceivable.\u2026 It\u2019s as if they believe that John 1:1 says, \u2018In the beginning was the State, and the State was with God, and the State was God.'\u201d\n\nRink also made the case that in the United States, in particular, the government has taken on \u201call the trappings\u201d of a modern, organized religion. He pointed to the sacred symbols and texts that have taken the form of flags and constitutions, former presidents looked upon as saints, congressional buildings as temples, government schools as \u201cchurches,\u201d and the pledge of allegiance as a common prayer.\n\nJackson Trigg, who traveled from Albuquerque, New Mexico, agreed with Rink\u2019s assessment. He believes the church itself is partly to blame for this phenomenon, as it feeds into the \u201creligion of statism.\u201d As a Canadian originally, he was disturbed to find how much the Christian church in the United States is wrapped up in nationalism.\n\n\u201cIf you go to church on a Fourth of July service,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know they\u2019re going to talk about America and try and tie it back to God somehow.\u201d\n\nTrigg recounted the times he visited Christian youth camps and was troubled by the requirement to raise the US flag every morning and pledge allegiance. \u201cWhat does America have to do with Christianity?\u201d he questioned.\n\nThe event\u2019s organizer, Norman Horn, who holds both a PhD in Chemical Engineering and a Master of Arts in Theological Studies, said that the question Christians should be asking themselves is, \u201cWhat does God have to say about power? What does God have to say about violence and the use of force against other people?\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cEveryone is judged by the same moral standard. If that is the case, then why do we give the state a free pass to do violent actions, those things that we say explicitly we are not permitted to do?\u201d\n\nMixing Politics and Faith\n\nAs for the challenges in reconciling one\u2019s political, social, and spiritual life, Trigg said this has been a journey several years in the making. \u201c[For] the last two years of my life, I\u2019ve been trying to look at all the different places where on the face it looks like your perspectives in life clash, but then realizing that they are and can be harmonized in your mind.\u201d He added that he has learned that his libertarian political views and his Christian faith not only work together but also \u201cin a sense, flow from each other.\u201d\n\nTrigg mentioned that while the cognitive dissonance between the political and the spiritual has met harmony in his own mind, the social component involved has itself been a challenge to overcome. \u201cTo the Christians, you\u2019re this outsider, and to libertarians, you\u2019re this religious geek\u2026 but you have something to give to both.\u201d\n\nHorn relayed similar thoughts when he discussed the intermingling of these two seemingly disparate, yet connected worlds: \u201cI do feel, in many respects, that Christian libertarians are certainly an underrepresented voice, and I think in many cases they\u2019re just too nervous to speak out \u2026 I felt that if I were to \u2018out myself\u2019 as a libertarian, that could come with social repercussions.\u201d\n\nHorn also recounted the time when he told his traditionally conservative parents that he was moving away from their conventional view of faith and politics: \u201cYou trained me to be this way.\u2026 I am taking the values that you have taught me \u2026 to their logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nAs to the question of which philosophy may be leading the other for Christian libertarians, Horn firmly states, \u201cWe are Christians first.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Christian who accepts that Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace and that he gave us a new and better way of life to follow, then where does violence and force fit into that? We begin to see that these things are incompatible with our beliefs.\u2026 This understanding of the use of force in society leads us to [libertarianism],\u201d Horn continued.\n\nThe founder of LibertarianChristians.com concluded that he does not think it is proper to suggest \u201cJesus was a libertarian\u201d or \u201cGod was a libertarian.\u201d He does, however, believe it is proper to say \u201clibertarianism is the most consistent expression of Christian political thought that we have.\u201d\n\nThe Future for CFL\n\nRegarding LCC and the potential for a second annual Christians for Liberty Conference, Horn remains hopeful that their numbers will grow. He says it is their intention to develop more of an organization over the course of the next few years and further connect with people from across the United States. \u201cOur goal is to work within our [established] churches\u2026 [and] give a more consistent expression of what they already believe in the political realm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know there are a lot of Christian libertarians out there,\u201d Horn said. \u201cIf we have some structures that allow us to network more easily through the internet, through social media, we will be able to have a greater multiplicative impact upon our communities and upon our churches.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first ever Christians for Liberty Conference took place on Saturday, with over 100 attendees, united by their Christian faith and libertarianism.", "generator": "Give v1.4.5", "og": {"site_name": "PanAm Post", "description": "The first ever Christians for Liberty Conference took place on Saturday, with over 100 attendees, united by their Christian faith and libertarianism.", "title": "Libertarian Christians Converge, Challenge Statism as Faux Religion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/cfl-jason-rink-religion-statism.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-04T15:29:41-04:00", "url": "https://panampost.com/guillermo-jimenez/2014/08/04/libertarian-christians-converge-challenge-statism-as-faux-religion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The first ever Christians for Liberty Conference took place on Saturday, with over 100 attendees, united by their Christian faith and libertarianism.", "creator": "@tracesofreality", "image": "http://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/cfl-jason-rink-religion-statism.jpg", "title": "Libertarian Christians Converge, Challenge Statism as Faux Religion", "site": "@PanAmPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002447837660, "app_id": 272171646459645, "pages": 197511413705974}, "google-site-verification": "ypzV0RhKyEDAxsbXG0ThtpSGZ18ECcSk-fWHTlztAQQ", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/PanAmPost", "section": "Ideology", "tag": "Texas", "published_time": "2014-08-04T06:00:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T15:29:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Many see libertarian political philosophy as a rejection of all forms of authority over the individual.\nWhat Are Libertarian Christians?\nWhat does God have to say about violence and the use of force against other people?\u201dHe went on to say, \u201cEveryone is judged by the same moral standard.\nThis is how we did it.\u201dThe conference hosted a wide range of speakers who reflected the diversity that exists across the libertarian spectrum.\nEspa\u00f1olThe first ever Christians for Liberty (CFL) Conference took place on Saturday, and it brought together over 100 varied individuals: men and women, young and old, united in their Christian faith and libertarian political philosophy."}
