How does one rate the success or failure of a nation’s health care delivery system?

During the last few weeks, we have read that UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer, will no longer offer policies on the government-sponsored website because it has lost money on its new enrollees. In counties in Alaska and Alabama, many Americans will have a choice of only a single insurance vendor; the others have withdrawn from this market because they were losing money.

Now, Highmark must sue the government to obtain payment for its heavy losses (“Highmark Sues Government for Reimbursement,” May 18). We regularly hear about a lot of hand-wringing about the failure of Obamacare because insurance companies are losing money.

What sort of a country is it that would design a health care system where the gauge of effectiveness is not whether its citizens enjoy good health, but whether a stable of private insurance companies is turning a profit?
