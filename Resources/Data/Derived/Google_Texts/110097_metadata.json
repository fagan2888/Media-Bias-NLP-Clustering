His base salary increases from $1.35 million to $1.5 million. McElwain\u2019s buyout increases to $7.5 million.\n\nThe Rams were 4-8 under McElwain in 2012, then 8-6 last season, winning the New Mexico Bowl with a major comeback against Washington State. McElwain previously was the offensive coordinator at Alabama for four seasons, winding up in Tuscaloosa after stays as an assistant at Fresno State, Michigan State, Louisville, Montana State and Eastern Washington \u2014 with a one-season stint with the NFL\u2019s Oakland Raiders thrown in there.\n\nAfter the Rams\u2019 Monday morning practice, McElwain said: \u201cFirst and foremost, Colorado State University\u2019s a great place.\u201d He praised the leadership of president Tony Frank and the school\u2019s board of governors. \u201cFor (wife) Karen and I, this is home,\u201d he added.\n\nMcElwain also cited the other coaches whose new deals were announced. \u201cThis is a great place,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vision hasn\u2019t changed. This is a place to call home.\u201d\n\nAsked about the $7.5 million buyout, McElwain said with tongue in cheek: \u201cThe way I look at that, maybe the only chance we have is maybe Bill Gates hiring me.\u201d\n\nHe turned serious and said, \u201cIt\u2019s flattering and it\u2019s really positive that we can get the support of this campus and this town and up and down the front range.\u201d\n\nHe paused, then smiled and asked: \u201cIs that how much it is?\u201d\n\nLast week, the NCAA board of directors approved virtual autonomy for the five \u201cpower\u201d leagues, which could lead to widening gulfs between those leagues and those outside that realm \u2014 including CSU\u2019s Mountain West Conference.\n\nDid any of that give McElwain pause before making his commitment?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWhat I mean by that is, guys, I really think that within this next five years, there\u2019s going to be some different things happening. I feel really good about the direction we\u2019re headed at Colorado State, our vision moving forward. We\u2019ll play \u2019em and we\u2019ll figure out a way to go. I can\u2019t tell you how excited my wife and I are to know we\u2019re home.\u201d\n\nInterim athletic director John Morris said in the statement announcing McElwain\u2019s new deal: \u201cJim McElwain has breathed new life into our football program. \u201cLast season\u2019s exhilarating come-from-behind victory in the New Mexico Bowl illustrated all of the positive attributes McElwain and his staff have infused in their student-athletes\u2014the perseverance to never give up and the unique bond to support one another on every play. That was a moment that all Rams fans are extremely proud of, and it provided a glimpse of where this program is headed.\u201d\n\nIn women\u2019s basketball, Williams\u2019 extension takes him through 2018-19, but the final five seasons are a series of one-year options that can be triggered by either CSU or Williams. His base salary will be $215,000, and the deal also includes several bonus clauses, beginning with $25,000 for a Mountain West Conference championship.\n\nIn volleyball, Hilbert\u2019s new agreement, also with a series of one-year extensions that kick in annually after the second year, takes him through the 2018 season, pays him $200,000 annually and his deal for the first time includes a buyout clause \u2014 set at $1 million. Previously, Hilbert was coaching under a three-year deal that rolled over annually, leaving him with three years remaining. He made $154,000 in 2013.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tfrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jim McElwain, other coaches sign extensions with Colorado State University", "title": "Jim McElwain, other coaches sign extensions with Colorado State University", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/11/jim-mcelwain-other-coaches-sign-extensions-with-colorado-state-university/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140811_101842_jim-mcelwain-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140811_101842_jim-mcelwain-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T10:24:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:57:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e37\"", "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Colorado State on Monday confirmed that football coach Jim McElwain, women\u2019s basketball coach Ryun Williams and volleyball coach Tom Hilbert all had agreed to new deals with the university.\nThe Rams were 4-8 under McElwain in 2012, then 8-6 last season, winning the New Mexico Bowl with a major comeback against Washington State.\nI feel really good about the direction we\u2019re headed at Colorado State, our vision moving forward.\nAfter the Rams\u2019 Monday morning practice, McElwain said: \u201cFirst and foremost, Colorado State University\u2019s a great place.\u201d He praised the leadership of president Tony Frank and the school\u2019s board of governors.\nHis base salary increases from $1.35 million to $1.5 million."}
