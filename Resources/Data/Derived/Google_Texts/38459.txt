Norway's central bank Thursday struck a surprisingly hawkish tone in a monetary policy statement, opting to leave interest rates unchanged despite a slowing economy.

The central bank, known as Norges Bank, said its main rate would remain at 0.75% but that it might be lowered next year if a bleak outlook for the oil dependent country persists.

Financial stability appeared to lie behind the bank's reluctance to make policy more expansionary.

"A lower key policy rate may increase the risk of a more rapid rise in real-estate prices and debt," the bank said in a statement.

The Norwegian krone strengthened sharply against the euro, which fell to 9.47 kroner from 9.59 kroner.

Five of nine analysts in a survey by The Wall Street Journal forecast today's decision correctly while four expected a lower rate to be announced.
