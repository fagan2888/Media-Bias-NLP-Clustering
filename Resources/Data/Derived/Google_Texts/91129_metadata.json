Suicide Squad will start filming in April 2015, and in order to prepare for his portrayal, Jared Leto will need to chop off a good portion of his hair at some point before the cameras start rolling.\n\nThe short length and quirky, rambunctious style of hair would certainly fit with the look of the Joker. And then once you add either yellow or green hair dye to it, he will really start to look the part.\n\nSuicide Squad is one of the most eagerly-anticipated movies of 2016. It is currently due to be released on August 5, 2016.\n\nAlongside Jared Leto as the Joker, Will Smith will appear as Deadshot, Margot Robbie will portray Harley Quinn, Tom Hardy will feature as Rick Flag, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, while Carla Delevingne, Oprah Winfrey, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer will also star.\n\nThere have also been rumors that Jesse Eisenberg, who will portray Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, will also appear in the film.\n\nDavid Ayer, who has previously directed End of Watch, Fury, and Sabotage, will direct Suicide Squad, which will be preceded by Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice and then followed by Wonder Woman and Justice League Part One as well as half a dozen other comic-book adaptations.\n\n[Image via Style Blazer]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jared Leto might have inadvertently revealed what the Joker's hair will look like in Suicide Squad with his festive Instagram post.
