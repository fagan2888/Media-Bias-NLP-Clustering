Pete Sessions claimed on the House floor today that Obamacare coverage costs federal taxpayers $5 million for each newly covered American.\n\nHe was off by a lot \u2014 nearly $5 million, in fact.\n\n\u201cIf you just do simple multiplication, 12 million into $108 billion, we\u2019re talking literally every single recipient would be costing this government more than $5 million per person for their insurance,\u201d said Sessions, chairman of the House Rules Committee.\n\nThe actual math is this: $108 billion divided by 12 million equals $9,000.\n\nSessions\u2019 comments came during a debate on the Republican budget plan for 2016. Aides declined to explain or comment on the inflated cost estimate.\n\nAt a Rules hearing Monday night on the GOP budget plan, House Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., cited a $104 billion cost for Obamacare coverage. In his floor remarks, Sessions cited Price as the source of his figure, and said he was awaiting precise cost estimates from the Budget Committee.\n\nThe White House says about 16.4 million previously uninsured people have obtained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the law\u2019s coverage provisions will cost the federal government $1.5 trillion between 2015 and 2024. That\u2019s about $150 billion per year \u2013 which comes to 9,146 each for 16.4 million people.\n\nDemocrats quickly challenged Sessions\u2019 math.\n\n\u201cBy what possible means do you think that we\u2019re paying $5 million for everybody\u2019s health care, each person\u2019s health care on the Affordable Care Act?\u201d Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee, said on the House floor shortly after Sessions spoke. \u201cNobody ever paid $5 million for anybody\u2019s health care in a single year. It\u2019s the most atrocious thing I think I\u2019ve heard on this floor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy9wZXRlLXNlc3Npb25zLW9mZi1ieS1uZWFybHktNW1wZXJzb24tb24tY2xhaW0tdGhhdC1vYmFtYWNhcmUtY29zdHMtNW1wZXJzb24uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Aubree Abril", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Dallas Rep.
