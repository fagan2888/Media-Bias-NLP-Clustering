He advocates not for or against marijuana, but for marijuana policy reforms he feels will help society as a whole. Moffat strongly believes medical marijuana should be included in healthcare plans.\n\n\u201cI feel that medical marijuana is an appropriate treatment for a lot of people that have bad responses to traditional prescription drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel in the long run, and in the short term as well, it\u2019s going to save on healthcare costs enormously.\u201d\n\nMoffat believes medical marijuana is a cost-effective substitution for prescription opiates that are more addicting and have more detrimental withdrawal effects in addicted patients than medical marijuana.\n\nThe problem, Moffat says, is the cost of marijuana compared to the cost of insurance-covered opiates.\n\n\u201cThe 30 day supply of Vicodin costs them $5 because insurance covers it, but if they wanted to get an ounce of medical marijuana that\u2019s going to cost them $400-$500,\u201d Moffat said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes a lot of sense that we\u2019re letting what is really an appropriate treatment for a lot of folks be underutilized.\u201d\n\nIssues with Smoking as Medicine\n\nExperts against adding medical marijuana to Obamacare argue that smoking is not an acceptable means of medicating an individual.\n\n\u201cI think the chances of getting a smoked joint covered by Obamacare is zip,\u201d said Kevin Sabet, Ph.D. and co-founder of project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana). \u201cJoints cannot be dosed, and smoking is not an accepted medication delivery system.\u201d\n\nThe Prescription Debate\n\nFor prescription drugs, a doctor writes out a prescription and the patient presents it to the pharmacy in exchange for the medicine. Medical marijuana patients have a recommendation card that is presented to caregivers or dispensaries. Sabet says the processes are not similar enough to warrant insurance coverage for medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cThe process for getting a medical recommendation is very different from an actual prescription,\u201d Sabet says. \u201cIn the latter, a bona fide physician must write a prescription which gets entered into a database. That prescription must be used at an actual pharmacy and dispensed by a pharmacist. A medical card is received upon a \u2018recommendation\u2019 which, depending on the state, does not have to be issued by the patient's actual physician. Also the recommendation is then used at marijuana stores-- most of which are not run by medical personnel.\u201d\n\nSimpson believes the processes are similar enough that a coverage plan could and should be worked out.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion they\u2019re certainly close enough, and I don\u2019t see how you can deny it insurance coverage,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cIt does carry with it some unique challenges but I don\u2019t think the response to that challenge is to throw up your hands and say \u2018well we won\u2019t have it covered then.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoffat believes that with alternative methods available for administering marijuana, namely vaporization and edible/oral products, a compromise of sorts would be feasible. He feels that the \u201clegal limbo\u201d surrounding marijuana (it is federally prohibited but legal in some states) prevents the insurance companies from offering coverage for medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cI understand the insurance companies\u2019 hesitation in taking this on, but I think there is an argument that certainly needs to be made that maybe doctors feel like this is an appropriate treatment, and it is very similar to getting a prescription. From a patients perspective it might as well be a prescription,\u201d Moffat said.\n\n\n\nFuture Insurance Ramifications\n\nSabet is willing to consider the medical benefits marijuana provides, but says insurance should never cover smoking and other unapproved medical practices.\n\n\u201cMedicines derived from marijuana and delivered in non-smoked forms may indeed at some point be covered by insurance exchanges, and no one has a problem with that,\u201d said Sabet. \u201cThe bottom line is that only approved medicines - derived from marijuana or not - should be covered by insurance.\u201d\n\nSimpson disagrees, arguing that if medical marijuana is the best option available it needs to be covered.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit of a litmus test,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cI think if society is sincere and accepting that this does offer significant medical benefits above and beyond what\u2019s even available through industrial pharmaceuticals for some conditions, then I don\u2019t see how you can deny it insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nAccording to Simpson, a secondary benefit of insurance coverage is that doctors would be more inclined to advise patients on whether or not to use marijuana medicinally.\n\n\u201cI think if it\u2019s being covered by insurance then Doctors would be inclined to take it very seriously as something that is a medical option, but that they shouldn\u2019t recommend more lightly than they would prescribe another drug,\u201d said Simpson.\n\n\n\nRelated Slideshow: The Highest Marijuana Prices in New England by State\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?
