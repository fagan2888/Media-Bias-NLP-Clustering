Andrew Cuomo is planning to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes, according to a new report from the New York Times.\n\nCuomo is expected to announce the executive action this week, granting some 20 hospitals the ability to prescribe the drug to patients suffering from \u201ccancer, glaucoma or other diseases that meet standards to be set by the New York State Department of Health.\u201d\n\nThe move by Cuomo represents not only the latest victory for marijuana reform advocates, but a landmark in New York drug law history. Once the home of the highly punitive \u201cRockefeller Drug Laws\u201d enacted by former governor Nelson D. Rockefeller, New York already reduced some of the harshest mandatory minimum drug sentencing requirements with 2004\u2019s Drug Law Reform Act, and this upcoming action by Cuomo may indicate a new approach to drug policy in the Empire State.\n\nActivists and officials alike are heralding the announcement coming out of Albany. Democratic Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, chair of the Assembly Health Committee, told the New York Post, \u201cI\u2019m grateful that the governor recognizes the medical benefits of marijuana for tens of thousands of sick patients in New York.\u201d Gabriel Saegh, the New York State director of the Drug Policy Institute, told the New York Daily News, \u201cThis is a great development. (Cuomo\u2019s) last word on this was, \u2018No, no, no. I\u2019m thinking about it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nGottfried \u2013 the leading sponsor of the legislation \u2013 explained that the executive action is based on an abandoned 1980 state law that legalized medical marijuana. \u201cThere is support for medical marijuana in every part of the state. The bill passed the state Assembly four times with bipartisan support,\u201d Gottfried said.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll conducted last November found that 82% of respondents support legalization of medical marijuana. Following the governor\u2019s actions, New York would become the 22nd state to legalize medical marijuana.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Cuomo is expected to announce the executive action this week, granting some 20 hospitals the ability to prescribe the drug to patients.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/ny-set-allow-medical-marijuana", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Cuomo is expected to announce the executive action this week, granting some 20 hospitals the ability to prescribe the drug to patients.", "title": "NY set to allow medical marijuana", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/ny-set-allow-medical-marijuana", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/ap748876616446.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "NY set to allow medical marijuana", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/ny-set-allow-medical-marijuana", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap748876616446.jpg?itok=QZV-Rj2P", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Cuomo is expected to announce the executive action this week, granting some 20 hospitals the ability to prescribe the drug to patients."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-05T13:45:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Cuomo is expected to announce the executive action this week, granting some 20 hospitals the ability to prescribe the drug to patients.", "nv": {"author": "maxlockie", "title": "NY set to allow medical marijuana", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/ny-set-allow-medical-marijuana", "published": 1, "date": "01/05/2014 13:45:00 EST", "tags": "drug-policy,health,health-care,new-york,the-cycle"}, "news_keywords": "Health, Drug Policy, Health Care, New York"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb49\"", "article_summary": "A Quinnipiac University poll conducted last November found that 82% of respondents support legalization of medical marijuana.\nFollowing the governor\u2019s actions, New York would become the 22nd state to legalize medical marijuana.\nI\u2019m thinking about it.\u2019\u201dGottfried \u2013 the leading sponsor of the legislation \u2013 explained that the executive action is based on an abandoned 1980 state law that legalized medical marijuana.\n\u201cThere is support for medical marijuana in every part of the state.\nAndrew Cuomo is planning to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes, according to a new report from the New York Times."}
