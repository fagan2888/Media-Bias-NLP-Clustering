They\u2019re dumping their losers on us,\u201d conservative pundit Ann Coulter said at the National Conservative Student Conference this weekend about the influx of immigrants to the United States. \u201cOur country isn\u2019t a battered women\u2019s shelter.\u201d\n\nMs. Coulter discussed her views on U.S. immigration policy to the college-age audience as outlined in her most recent New York Times best-selling book, \u201cAdios, America: The Left\u2019s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole.\u201d\n\nMs. Coulter made the argument that the U.S. should call for a complete moratorium on immigration until the government is able to \u201csort the books\u201d on the illegals already in the country. Then, she said, only immigrants who \u201cmake our lives better\u201d should enter the country legally.\n\n\u201cDo you think there\u2019s any other country in the world that\u2019s so stupid to not take the best immigrants it can get? This immigration is a government policy like any other, and it ought to be used to make our lives better, to help the lives of those already living here,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the issue of minimum wages, the author and television pundit pointed to the case of Australia, whose minimum hourly wage is $16.88. Ms. Coulter said Canberra is selective as to who can legally become Australian. On the other hand, the world is \u201cdumping low-wage workers on the [U.S.]\u201d\n\nFurthermore, she said, immigrants tend to vote Democratic rather than Republican at a ratio of 8-to-2.\n\n\u201cAmericans are going to be outvoted by the foreigners that Democrats have been bringing in to block-vote for them, with their collaboration with the media,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c[Liberals] are aborting their babies and going gay. They don\u2019t stand a chance against this demographic tsunami without importing foreigners to vote in these elections.\n\n\u201cThis is why there is nothing more important than stopping our current immigration policy. At that point, everything else will work itself out.\u201d\n\nAs for Ms. Coulter\u2019s outspoken support of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, she said she will remain a \u201cgo Trump, go\u201d supporter \u201cas long as he\u2019s good on immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can be for anything on any other issue,\u201d she said. \u201cJust please get the country back to America. If we lose Americans deciding elections, we lose everything.\u201d\n\nMs. Coulter is also cheering for Hillary Rodham Clinton because she is \u201cfantastic for [the Republican Party]\u201d since she \u201chas no political skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Democrats are secretly hoping to dump Hillary,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Biden is a much stronger candidate for them.\u201d\n\nOf the former first lady and secretary of state, Ms. Coulter said Mrs. Clinton \u201cbasically had appointed positions because she was married to the horny hick.\u201d\n\nMs. Coulter also spoke kindly of her frenemy, liberal talk show host Bill Maher. She was his most frequent guest on the ABC series \u201cPolitically Incorrect,\u201d the second highest rated late-night show of its day. Mr. Maher was fired from the network in 2002 after declaring on his show that the 9/11 hijackers were, despite the horrendous nature of their actions, not cowardly.\n\nAlthough a convivial relationship between the two seems unlikely, Ms. Coulter said Mr. Maher has \u201cbeen very good to [me], both professionally and personally.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher has hosted \u201cReal Time\u201d on HBO since 2003. Ms. Coulter sometimes makes appearances, for which Mr. Maher exhorts his audiences: \u201cDo not boo.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ms. Coulter and Mr. Maher agree on little, and vocally combat when she appears on his show, the conservative pundit proudly related how Mr. Maher told her: \u201cI made you, babe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hates his audience even more than I do, so we can bond over that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loves when I attack his audience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The rest of the world is laughing at us.
