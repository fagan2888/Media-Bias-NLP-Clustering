A particular target are the larger disproportionate share [DSH] hospitals that buy about 80% of the drugs through the program,\u201d according to Barrett, who noted that this ruling does not affect DSH hospitals. \u201cIt's a win for the highly profitable drug industry and a big loss for rural hospitals and their patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled against the Department of Health and Human Services by saying that pharma companies do not have to offer rural and cancer hospitals that serve low-income populations 340B discounts on orphan drugs.", "Description": "Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled against the Department of Health and Human Services by saying that pharma companies do not have to offer rural and cancer hospitals that serve low-income populations 340B discounts on orphan drugs.", "og": {"url": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/managed-healthcare-executive/news/judge-rules-orphan-drugs-not-subject-340b-discounts", "site_name": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "description": "Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) saying that pharma companies do not have to offer rural and cancer hospitals that serve low-income populations", "title": "Judge rules: Orphan drugs not subject to 340B discounts"}, "DC.identifier": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/node/412565", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2015-10-16", "last-modified": "Sat, 17 October 2015 00:11:23 GMT", "DC.creator": "Tracey Walker", "DC.source": "Managed Healthcare Executive E-News", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "340 B, 340B, Health & Human Services, Health and Human Services, MHE Articles, orphan drug designation, orphan drugs, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Politics and Policy", "emsContentType": "Judge rules: Orphan drugs not subject to 340B discounts", "DC.title": "Judge rules: Orphan drugs not subject to 340B discounts"}, "article_summary": "That language excludes 340B pricing for orphan drugs purchased by rural and cancer hospitals.\nJudge Rudolph Contreras ruled against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) saying that pharma companies do not have to offer rural and cancer hospitals that serve low-income populations 340B discounts on orphan drugs, Reuters reported.\nLast October, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), sued HHS to block the agency\u2019s interpretation of an orphan drug exclusion found in the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\u201cIt's a win for the highly profitable drug industry and a big loss for rural hospitals and their patients.\u201d\nAccording to 340B Health, many of these drugs can cost patients up to $300,000 per year or more, and without access to 340B discounts, these hospitals will struggle to meet the needs of their vulnerable patients."}
