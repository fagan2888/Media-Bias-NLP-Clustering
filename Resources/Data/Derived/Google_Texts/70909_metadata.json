Matt Huffman, R-Lima, on Wednesday called the size of the national debt a \u201cterrible, horrific\u201d problem that could only be solved by the states demanding a balanced-budget amendment and forcing the federal government to live within its means.\n\nIn August, Gov. John Kasich called for a convention to add a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, saying the \u201cnation\u2019s future stability requires it and the American people deserve it.\u201d\n\nHuffman is the primary sponsor of House Joint Resolution 7, an application to Congress, under the provisions of Article V of the Constitution of the United States, calling for a convention of the states limited to proposing a balanced-budget amendment.\n\nArticle V details two ways in which the Constitution can be amended. One is for two-thirds of Congress to pass a proposed amendment and then three-fourths of the states adopt it. The other is for two-thirds of state legislatures to pass resolutions calling for a convention to propose an amendment. If successful, Congress is compelled to set a convention. If an amendment is approved during a convention, it is sent to the states, where three-fourths of the states would have to approve before the amendment can be added to the Constitution.\n\nHuffman said it is an arduous process that ensures only amendments with broad-based support are approved, noting that only 27 amendments have been made to the document since it became effective March 4, 1789.\n\nHuffman introduced a similar measure six years ago, but did not receive broad support.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that the main opposition to this came from what some would label as far-right groups who were afraid that a convention would result in numerous amendments that might erode the existing Constitution and Bill of Rights,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut this is not a process where something incredibly bad or a non-mainsteam idea can surface because of all the steps you have to go through.\u201d\n\nHuffman said it would be unfair to claim the current administration or Congress is solely to blame for the budget problems. He said the problem is inherent in the way government at the federal level is set up.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own needs and wants,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody always thinks we need to spend more money on something else. That\u2019s not going to change and the problem has gotten a lot worse since the 1960s when we started taking money out of the pension fund and spending it on other operations. In the mid-1980s it got to be a crisis and now people realize just how desperate the problem is.\u201d\n\nHuffman said the process of limiting spending by the federal government needs to be done dispassionately.\n\n\u201cThe state legislatures need to put their hand on the shoulder of their friend the national government and say \u2018you\u2019ve got a problem and I need to solve your problem for you,\u2019 because they can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.\n\nEchoing Kasich\u2019s claim that states routinely balance their budgets, Huffman said it was easier for the federal government to spend more than they have \u201cbecause they can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re going to continue unless we do something about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThat sentiment was shared by Rep. Jim Buchy, R-Greenville, who said the Founding Fathers didn\u2019t envision \u201ca government that would spend us into oblivion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe debt we have racked up is unsustainable,\u201d Buchy said. \u201cIt is incumbent upon us \u2026 to bind them to the constitution by having a balanced budget amendment.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Duffey, R-Worthington, said that a convention may not even be necessary, noting that the 17th Amendment calling for the direct election of senators was opposed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt was only after 31 states passed motions for reform that Congress acted and sent back to the states the 17th Amendment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he hoped the same thing would happen with this call for a balanced budget amendment.\n\nMark Guyer, co-founder of the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, said 17 states already have called for the convention. Michigan and Wisconsin are expected to take up the issue after Ohio.\n\n\u201cA balanced-budget amendment is the strongest possible legal mandate,\u201d Guyer said. \u201cNothing else will work.\u201d\n\nThe General Assembly will have to vote on the measure before it can be forwarded to Congress.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Saying the national debt is the most critical social and economic issue of our time, Ohio legislators Wednesday called for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.", "title": "Ohio lawmakers join call for constitutional convention, balanced-budget amendment - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Matt-Huffman.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/104359/ohio-lawmakers-join-call-for-constitutional-convention-balanced-budget-amendment/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Balanced budget amendment,Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force,Constitutional amendment,Constitutional Convention,Gov.
