Left-handed veteran Oliver Perez and right-hander Shawn Kelley agreed to terms with the club, the team announced.\n\nPerez, 34, signed a two-year contract. He was a starter who has found new life as a reliever. His resurrection began in 2012 with the Seattle Mariners. After posting a 6.80 ERA with the New York Mets in 2010, Perez was out of baseball. He made the Mariners\u2019 roster in 2012 after a strong spring training performance when he showed an increase in velocity. He finished with a 2.12 ERA that season and has been a power matchup against left-handed batters since. Lefties hit .185 versus Perez last season.\n\nThough his last three seasons have shown him to fade late in the year. From 2013-15, his ERA in August is 5.79. In September, it\u2019s 6.10. The Nationals could use Perez almost exclusively against left-handed batters, freeing Felipe Rivero for a setup role in the seventh or eighth inning.\n\nLast season was the best of Kelley\u2019s career. With the San Diego Padres, Kelley put together a 2.45 ERA along with a 1.09 WHIP. Keeping with his career numbers, Kelley struck out more than a batter per inning, finishing 2015 with 11.05 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\nDuring his final 45 appearances of the 2015 season, Kelley went 2-0 with a 1.05 ERA. Right-handed batters hit .215 against Kelley last season. From May 30 through the end of the year, Kelley did not allow an extra-base hit to a right-handed batter, a stretch that spanned the final 98 right-handed hitters he faced. He signed a three-year deal.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Nationals also signed right-handed Yusmeiro Petit. A former starter, Petit can be used as a long man out of the bullpen. Petit had a 3.67 ERA for the San Francisco Giants last season.\n\nWith the addition of Kelley, the Nationals currently have 39 players on their 40-man roster", "article_metadata": {"description": "The signings of Perez, a left-hander, and Kelley, a righty, continues the overhaul of the Nationals' bullpen, which failed them often last season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The signings of Perez, a left-hander, and Kelley, a righty, continues the overhaul of the Nationals\u2019 bullpen, which failed them often last season.", "title": "Shawn Kelley, Oliver Perez sign with Washington Nationals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/11/shawn-kelley-oliver-perez-sign-washington-national/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/11/Nationals-Moves_Baseball.JPEG-04286.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/11/Nationals-Moves_Baseball.JPEG-04286.jpg", "description": "The signings of Perez, a left-hander, and Kelley, a righty, continues the overhaul of the Nationals' bullpen, which failed them often last season.", "card": "summary", "title": "Shawn Kelley, Oliver Perez sign with Washington Nationals"}, "Author": "Todd Dybas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Environment, Shawn Kelley"}, "article_summary": "Left-handed veteran Oliver Perez and right-hander Shawn Kelley agreed to terms with the club, the team announced.\nDuring his final 45 appearances of the 2015 season, Kelley went 2-0 with a 1.05 ERA.\nEarlier in the week, the Nationals also signed right-handed Yusmeiro Petit.\nWith the addition of Kelley, the Nationals currently have 39 players on their 40-man roster\nThe Nationals could use Perez almost exclusively against left-handed batters, freeing Felipe Rivero for a setup role in the seventh or eighth inning."}
