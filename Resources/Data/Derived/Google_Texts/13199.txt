Two people were killed and one was critically injured in a shooting Saturday evening in Enid. Now, News 9 is learning more about what may have led to the shooting.

Police arrested 59-year-old Vincent Perosi with two complaints of murder and one complaint of attempted murder. He is accused of killing his ex-wife, Pamela, and her friend, 53-year-old Buddy Webber.

Perosi is also accused of shooting 53-year-old Karen Priest. She was taken to OU Medical Center in critical condition.

According to court records, Vincent and Pamela Perosi divorced last year, and Pamela Perosi was to take possession of the couple’s home on East Park on January 1.

Hours before the murders, Dalrymble said he tried to help Vincent Perosi move out, but he resisted.

“It’s like he was drunk. But he wasn’t,” Dalrymble said. “He’s been up five days and four nights trying to get moved out because he put it off too long.”

Darlmble said he left to run some errands.

Police said Perosi's ex and her friends showed up to take possession of the house and that's when Perosi snapped, allegedly shooting all three.

Darlmble said his brother got there seconds after the shooting.

“My brother said, ‘Vince, what did you do?’ He said, ‘I shot her,'” Dalrymble said.

Dalrymble said Vincent Perosi told him he would shoot his wife just a few hours earlier, but Dalrymble didn’t believe him.

“Because you couldn’t believe a word he said,” Dalrymble said. “He had issues.”
