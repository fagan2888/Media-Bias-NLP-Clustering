But then, she thinks, \u201cDamn. Why\u2019d I do that? Because it\u2019s not good for me \u2013\u201d (Here, her deep cough adds emphasis.) \u201cIt\u2019s bad for my health\u2026Aw, I\u2019ll give it up when I finish the pack.\u201d\n\nSuzuki, the hospital\u2019s director of addiction psychiatry, does not lecture her about the risks of smoking. He does not suggest nicotine patches or pills or any other aids for quitting. He just mostly listens, and thoughtfully echoes what she says, and draws her out \u2014 when, for example, she mentions that she once quit for five years.\n\n\u201cSomething happened, and you made a decision to stop,\u201d he probes.\n\nHer sons begged her, West recalls. One said, \u201cMommy, please stop smoking, please stop smoking.\u201d\n\n\u201cPleading with you\u2026\u201d Suzuki reflects.\n\n\u201cHe had tears in his eyes. And he\u2019s my baby, that\u2019s my baby boy.\u201d She reassured her son that she would be around for a long time, she remembers, and he answered, \u201cYou keep smoking, no, you won\u2019t!\u201d\n\nSuzuki interprets: \u201cThey love their mama so much, they don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d\n\nThe conversation, lasting just a few minutes, may sound like a simple chat. But Suzuki is expertly following principles that have been hammered out over decades and studied in copious research. He listens \u2014 actively, empathetically \u2014 more than he talks. His comments and questions remind West of her reasons to quit, and bolster her confidence that she can do it. They tap into her values and goals \u2014 her love for her family, her desire to live.\n\nBy the end, West says she wants badly to stop smoking, and she urgently asks Suzuki to write her a prescription for nicotine patches.\n\nShe has just experienced the subtle power of a method that\u2019s increasingly popular in medicine: It\u2019s called motivational interviewing, often referred to just by its initials, MI.\n\n\u201cThe big shift in the practice of MI for most practitioners is that you go from telling patients why they should change or how they could change to drawing out from the patient their own ideas about why change would be beneficial to them and about how they might be able to do it,\u201d says Dr. Allan Zuckoff of The University of Pittsburgh, a national leader in the field and author of a new self-guided book, \u201cFinding Your Way to Change: How the Power of Motivational Interviewing Can Reveal What You Want and Help You Get There.\u201d\n\nMotivational interviewing goes back decades in the field of addiction counseling, Zuckoff says, but in medicine, it\u2019s been really taking off in the last few years.\n\nHundreds of studies have been published on using it in health care, from diabetes control to reducing the risk of heart disease. It\u2019s being tried for patients with incontinence, psoriasis, hepatitis C, Parkinson\u2019s \u2014 virtually any disease in which the patient\u2019s behavior \u2014 taking medication, choosing food \u2014 affects the outcome. And of course, it can be used for the lifestyle issues that are the biggest driver of American chronic illness: overeating, smoking and drinking and drugs, lack of exercise.\n\nMotivational interviewing changes the dynamic, the whole style of doctor-patient communication, Suzuki says. Doctors are used to giving something to the patient, \u201cwhether it\u2019s advice or skills or recommendations, a prescription, a diagnosis, a treatment plan, a referral.\u201d But none of those, he says, will help with the key to changing behavior: a person\u2019s internal motivation.\n\nWhen motivational interviewing first clicked for him, \u201cI felt so much more helpful,\u201d Suzuki recalls. \u201cWe weren\u2019t butting heads. The analogy that people often use is that instead of wrestling, it\u2019s like dancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe analogy that people often use is that instead of wrestling, it\u2019s like dancing.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Joji Suzuki,\n\non motivational interviewing\n\nPatients with unhealthy behaviors often feel either judged or controlled, Zuckoff says. \u201cThe person talking to them is either trying to get them to do something they don\u2019t feel ready to do, or conveying a critical or negative judgment of them for the way they\u2019re behaving. And in motivational interviewing, we do the exact opposite. We emphasize the patient\u2019s autonomy and the patient\u2019s right and privilege to make their own decisions.\u201d\n\nAnd the technique can work fast. It has even be used in emergency rooms, Zuckoff says, \u201cliterally where the physician is stitching up the patient and at the same time having a five-minute conversation about seat belt use or about alcohol use. It is that flexible and adaptable.\u201d\n\nStill, many doctors don\u2019t have an extra second to spare with patients, right?\n\nZuckoff says doctors who don\u2019t feel like they have time for motivational interviewing might want to consider how much time they\u2019re spending having the same conversation with a patient over and over again. Like a doctor who tells a patient at every checkup: \u201cSo Mrs. Jones, you\u2019re 30 pounds overweight and here\u2019s what you should do.\u201d\n\nChances are, Zuckoff says, Mrs. Jones will be doing what he calls \u201cthe bobblehead effect,\u201d nodding and smiling but with no real intention to change. And of course, the next time the doctor sees Mrs. Jones, her weight is not going to be any different and the same conversation will roll again. That sort of failure, he says, can leave doctors feeling frustrated and ineffective.\n\nSeveral factors are converging to make motivational interviewing more popular in medicine, Zuckoff says:\n\n\u2022 Rising recognition that chronic illness is a far greater problem for Americans than acute illness, and that lifestyle and behavior factors drive much of it.\n\n\u2022 Health reform is moving medicine away from \u201cfee for service\u201d and holding doctors more accountable for patient outcomes, which often hinge on behavior outside the doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u2022 Mounting research shows that the patient-doctor relationship is extremely important for whether the patient follows recommendations.\n\nAlso, motivational interviewing \u2014 much like a better-known psychological method, cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 has built an \u201cevidence base\u201d of studies that just keeps growing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a strong reliance on the science of it,\u201d Suzuki says, \u201cand it\u2019s not just derived from some theory, it\u2019s really based on testing whether it works.\u201d\n\nFor years, Suzuki was the only motivational interviewing trainer at Partners HealthCare, Boston\u2019s biggest hospital system. He\u2019s spoken to thousands of people about it in the last several years. But the demand for the training is so relentless lately, he says \u2014 from the HIV clinic to the obstetrics clinic to psychiatry and beyond \u2014 that it now takes four or five experienced trainers to meet it.\n\nSo did motivational interviewing work for Thrasher West?\n\nWell, she liked Suzuki\u2019s interview, she says \u2014 because nobody likes being told what to do: \u201cThis was different, because he was listening to me and he was hearing what I had to say. I might go home and not smoke.\u201d\n\nThat was on Friday. But the next Tuesday, she said she\u2019d just smoked her first cigarette since getting home from the hospital, driven by the pain and stress of kidney dialysis.\n\nEven after a good interview, Suzuki knows better than to expect instant miracles.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to walk off into the sunset, a nonsmoker, and she\u2019s never going to smoke again, I have no expectations about that. But it\u2019s a clear demonstration that we can have a big influence on patient motivation in these very brief encounters,\u201d he says. \u201cNumber one is, just as she said, we take the time to listen.\u201d\n\nReaders?
