But Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has taken it a step further, saying this weekend that \u201cit's very possible\u201d he would take military action on his first day in office.\n\nThe dispute came amid one of the first significant foreign policy disputes between Walker and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, two leading contenders for the nomination. Walker is trying to present himself as the more aggressive alternative in a field of Republican candidates who, with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul, have promised a more assertive foreign policy than Obama. Bush, while not trying to cede ground in criticizing Obama, questioned Walker's maturity.\n\nWalker has been attacking Obama's Iran negotiations for months, amping up his criticism as a deal was reached last week. His critique of the deal is usually a big applause line in his stump speech.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we need to terminate the bad deal with Iran on day one, put in place crippling economic sanctions, and convince our allies to do the same,\u201d he said in announcing his candidacy last Monday.\n\nBush mocked that approach in a town hall meeting on Friday, during a response to a voter's question about the deal, according to the Weekly Standard.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I won't do is just say, as a candidate, 'I'm going to tear up the agreement on the first day,'\u201d said Bush, who was also highly critical of Obama and the deal in his comments. \u201cThat sounds great, but maybe you ought to check in with your allies first. Maybe you ought to appoint a secretary of state, maybe secretary of defense. You might want to have your team in place before you take an act like that.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Walker was asked by reporters about Bush's statement, and responded that the next president may not have the luxury of time.\n\n\u201cIt's very possible -- God forbid -- but it's very possible that the next president could be called to take aggressive actions, including military action, on the first day in office,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd I don't want a president who is not prepared to act on day one. So, as far as me, as far as my position, I'm going to be prepared to be president on day one.\u201d\n\nThe dispute echoes, to some degree, the clash between Obama and Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Obama said he would meet with leaders from outlaw nations such as Cuba, Iran, and North Korea without preconditions. Clinton called that naive. \u201cI don't want to be used for propaganda purposes,\u201d she said during a 2007 debate.\n\nSuch debates can have serious policy implications. Fast forward to 2015: Obama has brokered a nuclear deal with Iran and, today, he officially restored diplomatic ties with Cuba.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "John McCain responds to Donald Trump: Apologize to veterans", "Description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about Muslims Dec. 7 Presidential rivals denounce Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "More from Trail Guide Dec. 10 Donald Trump backs out of his Israel trip Dec. 9 Some U.S. mayors want Donald Trump to stay out of their cities Dec. 8 Hillary Clinton looks to tie GOP candidates to Trump's rhetoric about Muslims Dec. 7 Presidential rivals denounce Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims...", "title": "John McCain responds to Donald Trump: Apologize to veterans", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-07202015-htmlstory.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ad7a7e/turbine/la-na-trailguide-07202015", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-20", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Most of the GOP 2016 field has said they would probably tear up President Obama's Iran deal if elected.\nFast forward to 2015: Obama has brokered a nuclear deal with Iran and, today, he officially restored diplomatic ties with Cuba.\nWalker has been attacking Obama's Iran negotiations for months, amping up his criticism as a deal was reached last week.\nThe dispute came amid one of the first significant foreign policy disputes between Walker and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, two leading contenders for the nomination.\nObama said he would meet with leaders from outlaw nations such as Cuba, Iran, and North Korea without preconditions."}
