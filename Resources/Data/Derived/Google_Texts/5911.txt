About 100 active duty and retired Naval personal and their families gathered along-side the USS Cod to remember those who have died. But according to 70-year-old Navy vet Edward Blind, the holiday has lost some of its meaning. “Unfortunately, Memorial Day is, for 98 percent of the people, a party day a picnic day, a good time day. And it’s a day when you’re supposed to be remembering those veterans who paid the price for your ability to have a barbecue today. Because if it was not for the WWII veterans, you would be eating schnitzel right now.” Asked about the long, sometimes deadly waits for care and alleged cover-ups at some U.S. Veterans Administration hospitals, Blind says this area’s veterans are lucky. He says Cleveland’s VA system is among the nation’s best, and he hasn’t heard of any problems here. No Cleveland VA hospital has been accused of any wrongdoing.
