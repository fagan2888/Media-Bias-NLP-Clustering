Start lucid dreaming through phrase repetition and \u201creality checks\u201d to become consciously aware in your dreams and control the direction in which they go.\n\nSince the release of the blockbuster movie Inception, people have become more intrigued by the ability to manipulate their dream worlds to dream about something in particular, solve a problem, or end a recurring nightmare. Scientists have recently discovered lucid dreaming \u2014 being consciously aware within your dream \u2014 can be induced by the application of electric currents to the dreamer\u2019s brain. However, to gain control of our dreams, we don\u2019t need drugs, psychological profiles, or electric scalp stimulation, we can begin to access our conscious state while dreaming in a few simple steps explained in the \u201cHow To Lucid Dream\u201d video by Daniella Urdinlaiz for Digg.\n\nAlthough dream problem-solving does not have to be lucid, meaning you don\u2019t have to be aware you\u2019re in a dream to come to a potential solution, it can still be self-taught using some of the same methods.\n\n1.\n\nBe sure to repeat the phrase \u201cI will realize what I\u2019m dreaming\u201d or some similar mantra to focus your mind on getting lucid.\n\n2.\n\nFall asleep thinking about something in particular, your problem, or the nightmare that you want to end. You can do this by having a mental image and/or a mantra you repeat to yourself before bed. If it\u2019s a more hands-on problem, Digg recommends trying to put the actual tools you need next to your bedside table.\n\n3.\n\nPerform \u201creality checks\u201d and ask yourself \u201cam I dreaming?\u201d When you\u2019re awake, get into the habit of reading text, using a doorknob or light switch to help condition yourself for these reality checks when you\u2019re dreaming. It\u2019s best to do these reality checks every time something seems out of the ordinary. In lucid dreams, these things often don\u2019t behave the way you would expect them to.\n\n4.\n\nBefore you completely get out of bed in the morning, spend a moment figuring out what you were dreaming about before you woke up. Distractions can chase away your dream-induced epiphanies.\n\nPerhaps lucid dreaming can help us solve some of our most deep seeded issues and reveal more about ourselves than we know.\n\nTo view the complete video of \"How To Lucid Dream,\" click here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how to lucid dream, lucid dreaming, conscious, subconscious, reality checks, dream problem-solving, sleep", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Got a problem you want to solve?
