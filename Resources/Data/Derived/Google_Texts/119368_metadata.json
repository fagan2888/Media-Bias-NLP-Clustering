Our elected leaders should stop considering a lengthy delay that will certainly prevent passage of a long-term bill this year and vote to keep the highway program going through the summer while they craft a serious piece of long-term legislation.\u201d\n\nThe transportation funding debate has loomed large in Washington as the deadline draws closer without the introduction of legislation to prevent an interruption in the infrastructure spending.\n\nThe expiring measure is itself an extension of a 2012 transportation bill that was supposed to last until September 2014. That measure was a $109 billion bill that was supposed to cover two years' worth of transportation projects, but it was extended for eight months by lawmakers last summer.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have expressed a desire to pass a new transportation funding bill now that the bill is coming due again, but consensus on how to pay for it has been elusive.\n\nThe traditional source of transportation funding has been revenue from the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and has struggled to keep pace with construction costs as U.S. cars have become more fuel efficient.\n\nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in about $34 billion annually at its current rate. Lawmakers have turned to other areas of the federal budget in recent years to close the gap, but transportation advocates have complained the resulting temporary patches are preventing states from undertaking badly needed large construction projects.\n\nThe trucking industry and other transportation advocates have pushed Congress to increase the tax for the first time in two decades to pay for a long-term infrastructure funding extension, but lawmakers have been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more at the pump.\n\nATA First Vice Chairman Pat Thomas said the trucking industry is \u201cvery concerned about our ability to pass a highway bill that leads us into the 21st Century.\n\n\u201cWe need Congress to pass a short-term patch and then immediately take into consideration a long-term highway bill,\u201d said Thomas, who is also a vice president at UPS. \u201cA five- or six-year bill that will provide the additional capacity that we need in this economy. We can\u2019t afford any further delay.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Transportation has said that its Highway Trust Fund will have to stop making payments to state governments for construction projects that are already underway if Congress does not come to an agreement on an extension in the next couple of weeks.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The American Trucking Association said it will accept a short-term road funding bill.", "description": "The American Trucking Association said it will accept a short-term road funding bill.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The American Trucking Association said it will accept a short-term road funding bill.", "title": "Trucking industry presses for highway funding fix", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241753-trucking-industry-presses-for-highway-funding-fix", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/truck_013114thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-12T13:05:29-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-12T13:05-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241753-trucking-industry-presses-for-highway-funding-fix", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-12T13:05-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Gas Tax, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization,Bill Graves,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-12T13:05:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T13:05:29-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241753-trucking-industry-presses-for-highway-funding-fix", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The American Trucking Association said it will accept a short-term road funding bill.", "card": "summary", "title": "Trucking industry presses for highway funding fix"}, "dcterms.title": "Trucking industry presses for highway funding fix"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce998\"", "article_summary": "The traditional source of transportation funding has been revenue from the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax.\nThe expiring measure is itself an extension of a 2012 transportation bill that was supposed to last until September 2014.\nATA First Vice Chairman Pat Thomas said the trucking industry is \u201cvery concerned about our ability to pass a highway bill that leads us into the 21st Century.\nThe American Trucking Association said Tuesday that it is willing to accept a short-term transportation funding bill to prevent an interruption in the federal government\u2019s infrastructure spending.\n\u201cWe need Congress to pass a short-term patch and then immediately take into consideration a long-term highway bill,\u201d said Thomas, who is also a vice president at UPS."}
