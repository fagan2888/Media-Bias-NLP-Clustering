They\u2019d much prefer to elect a Hillary Clinton who has made specific, concrete campaign pledges to them \u2014 especially since political science research shows that, contrary to popular belief, politicians tend to keep their promises.\n\n\n\nBut without a competitive Democratic primary, how can liberals push Clinton in their direction? For now, there\u2019s no clear roadmap, but liberal activists have five general ideas.\n\n1. Pray that Elizabeth Warren runs.\n\nLiberal outfits such as Progressive Democrats of America have launched small-scale grassroots campaigns urging Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (Ready for Bernie) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (Draft O\u2019Malley) to join the race. But the big money is on Massachusetts Senator and liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren. MoveOn.org gave $1 million to launch \u201cRun Warren Run,\u201d and Howard Dean\u2019s old shop, Democracy for America, dumped an additional $250,000 into the effort. The Boston Globe ran a special package last week declaring that \u201cDemocrats need Elizabeth Warren\u201d in 2016.\n\nWhile Sanders and O\u2019Malley seem likely to follow through with a run, neither has the clout at this point to mount a serious challenge. Both are polling in the double digits behind Clinton. That makes drafting Warren, despite the fact that she has said repeatedly that she is not running, priority No. 1. \u201cWe want to get Elizabeth Warren into the race. She is someone progressives innately trust,\u201d said Neil Sroka of Democrats for America. When he was pressed for a contingency plan, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re extremely focused on trying to get her in, building the infrastructure she would need to run, and extending the amount of time she has to change her mind.\u201d Wesley Clark, another one-time progressive fave, didn\u2019t enter the 2004 race until September 2003, Sroka added, hopefully. (Of course, he didn\u2019t win.)\n\n2. If that fails, keep Warren\u2019s ideas in the news.\n\nIf Warren isn\u2019t going to be a candidate, liberals hope she can at least be a player behind the scenes. That way, they might indirectly influence Clinton as she seeks a full-throated endorsement from Warren. To that end, liberals are doing everything possible to ensure that the public conversation\u2014in newspapers\u2019 op-ed pages, and at every political forum, debate, and town hall meeting\u2014centers on Warren\u2019s brand of economic populism. \u201cWe view an election as a multi-billion dollar conversation with voters,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThe more that conversation is about progressive issues, the better.\u201d\n\nMaking that happen will involve enlisting progressive leaders both in the all-important early caucus and primary states and nationally. On Tuesday, the PCCC launched a new campaign, Ready for Boldness, along with a signed letter from 200 leaders from Iowa and New Hampshire designed to urge presidential candidates to \u201ccampaign on big, bold, economic populist ideas.\u201d Signers included Iowa\u2019s longtime Sen. Tom Harkin, union presidents and state legislators. \u201cWe want to show [Clinton] that it she embraces big bold progressive ideas, she won\u2019t be alone,\u201d Green said.\n\n3) Stay on message.\n\nCreating a united front around a handful of broadly popular progressive policies will be as important as ensuring that the message isn\u2019t diluted by squabbles over fault line issues, like free trade and education reform, progressive leaders say. The PCCC\u2019s letter Tuesday, for example, centered on helping students graduate college debt-free, expanding Social Security benefits, reforming Wall Street, enacting campaign finance reform, creating clean-energy jobs and boosting worker pay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real attempt by the beginning of next year to establish a clear platform that gets embraced by everyone,\u201d said Robert Borosage, executive director of the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, which will host a big-tent progressive conference, Populism 2015, at the end of April along with National People\u2019s Action, USAction and Alliance for a Just Society.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to avoid the populist bait and switch where they campaign like a populist but govern center-right,\u201d said Maya Rockeymoore, the president and CEO of the progressive Center for Global Policy Solutions. Progressives have to get candidates to make public commitments to enact specific agenda items, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say all the right things.\u201d\n\n4) Use Congress as a sounding board.\n\nThe PCCC and other organizations have been working with progressives in the House and Senate to propose bills on solid liberal issues, like expanding social security, reining in Wall Street financial firms and creating clean energy jobs. But timing is everything. While such bills aren\u2019t likely to pass the Republican-dominated Congress any time soon, they can still make their way into nightly news broadcasts and shape the national conversation that way. \u201cWe\u2019re organizing in Congress to propose bills that could become presidential issues\u201d on the campaign trail, Green said.\n\n5) Play the long game.\n\nNational People\u2019s Action Campaign, among others, plan to focus on recruiting and supporting progressive candidates in municipal, county and state-level elections. The idea is not only to put progressive policies in place on the local level, but also to help shape the national political landscape from the bottom up, explained George Goehl of the National People\u2019s Action Campaign.\n\n\u201cIf you could get thousands of people down ballot running on a similar platform and create a bottom-up swell\u2014that would be something that both parties would have to react to,\u201d he said. Such a groundswell could shape the Democratic Party in the same way that the Tea Party has shaped the Republican Party. \u201cThey could help energize people across the board and create a clear line in the sand: Are you a progressive populist in this moment in time, or are you not?\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Goehl said he also supports the other prongs of the progressives\u2019 national plan\u2014\u201dGetting Elizabeth Warren into the race would be great,\u201d he said\u2014he advised his fellow populists to hedge their bets.\n\n\u201cHail Mary\u2019s happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut only every so often. There has to be a plan.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Democracy.com.
