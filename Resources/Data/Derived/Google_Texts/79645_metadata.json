WalletHub's analysis, released just ahead of tax day, looked at states' tax rates, infrastructure quality, education systems, health outcome, public safety, economy and pollution. Mississippi ranked 47th among the states, ahead of the neighboring states of Arkansas, Louisiana and Alabama.\n\nMississippi scored lowest in the economy category at No. 50. The state's 7 percent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is one of the nation's highest, better only than Nevada and the District of Columbia, data the Bureau of Labor Statistics released in late March show. Mississippi also finished in the bottom 10 percent of states for the quality of health and education.\n\nProgressives have long argued that policies such as fully funding the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, which the Legislature has done just twice since 1997, and using the Affordable Care Act to expand the federal-state Medicaid program would put Mississippi in a better position in terms of health and education.\n\nThose arguments have fallen on deaf ears with the Republican-led executive and legislative branches of Mississippi government, who say the state cannot afford either MAEP or Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.\n\nPartisan differences on tax priorities emerged as a lightning rod late in the 2015 legislative session, when House Democrats killed a Republican plan for $550 million in state income tax relief.\n\n\"I think this draws a bright line of distinction between those of us who want to provide tax relief for people and those of us who don't,\" House Speaker Philip Gunn told reporters late in the session.\n\nThe WalletHub study's findings, however, challenge the thinking that conservative tax policies are a boon to taxpayers. On average, the analysis found that blue states\u2014states where a majority of voters supported President Barack Obama's reelection in 2012\u2014ranked slightly higher for taxpayer ROI than red states, where Mitt Romney won.\n\nHere's how Mississippi's taxpayer ROI rankings breaks down, according to the WalletHub study:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2015/apr/14/report-mississippi-among-worst-bang-tax-bucks/", "type": "article", "title": "Report: Mississippi Among Worst Bang for Tax Bucks"}, "google-site-verification": "IWXFYfZIttPjrHp6PHTaRrN9WFAh-rc2CZiQeV0pHiU", "description": "A new report out today from financial-information website WalletHub shows that Mississippi taxpayers, the nation's poorest, don't get very much for what they do spend on taxes.", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde52c\"", "article_summary": "WalletHub's analysis, released just ahead of tax day, looked at states' tax rates, infrastructure quality, education systems, health outcome, public safety, economy and pollution.\nYet, a new report out today from financial-information website WalletHub shows that Mississippi taxpayers, the nation's poorest, don't get very much for what they do spend on taxes.\nMississippi ranked 47th among the states, ahead of the neighboring states of Arkansas, Louisiana and Alabama.\nMississippi also finished in the bottom 10 percent of states for the quality of health and education.\nThe WalletHub study's findings, however, challenge the thinking that conservative tax policies are a boon to taxpayers."}
