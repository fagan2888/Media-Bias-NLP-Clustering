You have one, and want the other. Those who live in new homes covet the character and charm of old ones. Those living in old homes long for the modern amenities new ones offer.\n\nHaving lived in houses ranging in age from \u201cso new the glue\u2019s not dry\u201d to \u201colder than the light bulb,\u201d I get the paradox.\n\nI want soul and all-new appliances with a homeowner\u2019s warranty. I want mature landscape and a big gourmet kitchen with a hot-spot island. I want the patina that comes with history \u2014 and surround-sound. I want a claw-foot bathtub, with jets. I want deep wooden window sills with handsome panes and uber-tight energy efficiency. I want a great front porch \u2014 and an attached garage.\n\nAs usual, I want it all. Apparently, so do a lot of Americans, and today\u2019s home builders are on to us.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal article reported on the trend of residential designers offering up a \u201cnew\u201d old house: \u201ca sanely proportioned residence that\u2019s historically accurate on the outside, but conceived for the needs of modern Americans on the inside.\u201d\n\nThink Snow White\u2019s cottage with walk-in closets. Huzzah!\n\n\u201cSeveral residential architects today, and even some production home builders, are building good-looking new houses that look old,\u201d said Amy Albert, editor of Custom Home magazine.\n\nOne of those firms is Saussy Burbank of North Carolina. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to capture the look of older homes, and put that on a modern floor plan,\u201d said partner Jim Burbank.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like beauty with benefits,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said. Then I make him get specific, which, when you talk to these abstract-designer types, can be like trying to park a cloud.\n\n\u201cOld houses feel good,\u201d said Burbank. \u201cEven the wear feels good. If the floor sways a little, or is warped some from time, that adds to the character.\u201d But they don\u2019t work for today\u2019s way of living because they have small rooms. Today\u2019s lifestyles call for an open floor plan.\n\nOld houses also have \u201cfew, small and strangely located bathrooms,\u201d he said, \u201ctiny closed-off kitchens, small or no closets, poor insulation, drafty windows, poor light, plus they break down, so they need more upkeep,\u201d said Burbank, who lives in an old home in Charlotte, N.C.\n\n\u201cNew homes are about flow and connectivity,\u201d said Albert. \u201cThey have super islands in the kitchen, where Mom cooks and supervises homework while checking e-mail.\u201d They also generally have better light, bigger kitchens and baths, lots of storage, and better energy efficiency.\n\nWhere new homes drop the ball is by skimping on craftsmanship and by not having the gracious scale found in older homes, said Burbank.\n\nLike I said, curly or straight.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press). Contact her through marnijameson.com.\n\nHow to love it, old or new\n\nBecause not everyone is in a position to buy or build a new old house, Amy Albert and Jim Burbank offered these ideas for homeowners to get the best of both eras in the home they have.\n\nMAKE A NEW HOUSE FEEL OLD\n\nBeef up the outside elevation. New homes often lack character, because builders cut costs by not adding touches like brick or stone, real wood siding or trim, shutters, or pediments over the front door. And the back of the house, where residents often spend a lot of time is where builders really skimp, said Albert.\n\nShop salvage yards. \u201cArchitectural-salvage items with their worn patina can confer time on a new space in a charming way,\u201d said Albert, who finds everything from funky medicine cabinets to old ceiling medallions there. Consider replacing your front door with an old salvaged door. If you come across an old-fashioned Dutch door, use it to replace a standard interior door.\n\nAdd a porch. If the basic shape of the house permits, add a deep, well-detailed porch, with period light fixtures, said Burbank.\n\nBuild it in. Window seats, bookcases, a dedicated place by the door to hang coats and stash boots, and other thoughtful built-ins can add old-fashioned warmth, as can moldings around doors, windows, and ceilings.\n\nMAKE AN OLD HOME FEEL NEW\n\nUpdate the flow. If a home\u2019s floor plan is chopped up by lots of rooms, consider knocking down a wall to open up the space and improve sightlines, particularly in the kitchen, dining and family areas. Let other design features, such as a change in flooring or ceiling treatments, define separate spaces and add liveliness to bland areas, said Albert.\n\nTighten the envelope. Make an old home more energy-efficient by adding double-pane windows and beefing up insulation.\n\nAdd light. Older homes are often dark, partly because their windows tend to be small. Lighten them up by adding larger windows and installing better built-in lighting, said Burbank. Clerestory windows are a good way to introduce light while maintaining privacy.\n\nExpand the bath. If possible, upgrade and relocate bathrooms so they are en suite and have more spa features than those in Lincoln\u2019s day.\n\nDESIGN MATTERS\n\nWhether adding years to your home or subtracting them, consult a designer first, said Burbank. \u201cDon\u2019t just have an idea and hire a contractor. You\u2019ll save in the long run.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Old houses, new houses: How to get character and convenience", "title": "Old houses, new houses: How to get character and convenience", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/07/old-houses-new-houses-how-to-get-character-and-convenience/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_045103_Fe08Marni.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140208_045103_Fe08Marni.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T04:52:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:16:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd254b\"", "article_summary": "Those living in old homes long for the modern amenities new ones offer.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to capture the look of older homes, and put that on a modern floor plan,\u201d said partner Jim Burbank.\nWhere new homes drop the ball is by skimping on craftsmanship and by not having the gracious scale found in older homes, said Burbank.\n\u201cOld houses feel good,\u201d said Burbank.\nThose who live in new homes covet the character and charm of old ones."}
