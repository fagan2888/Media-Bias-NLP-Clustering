A last-minute decision to extend its tender offer for Allergan Inc. took a toll on shares of both it and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Monday, as the two missed out on a broad market rally and were down more than 1% each.

Canadian-based Valeant’s /quotes/zigman/122461/delayed /quotes/nls/vrx VRX U.S. shares dipped $1.76 to $110.50 in recent action. Allergan /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed /quotes/nls/agn AGN , meanwhile, was off $2.06 to $156.20.

Valeant filed notice after the close Friday that it intends to extend its tender offer until Dec. 31. The offer had been due to expire at 5 p.m. on Friday.

Valeant has called for a special meeting of Allergan shareholders but it is taking longer than expected, as Allergan requires those who support such a gathering to disclose trading positions. Supporters of the deal are hoping to call the meeting in coming days that could enable them to oust board members and go forward with a merger.

A $53 billion offer for Botox-maker Allergan is on the table from Valeant. Allergan says the proposed price is too low and the company is concerned Valeant would gut its research operations. Allergan recently cut back on research and laid off roughly 13% of its staff in order to help thwart the takeover.

Allergan also has managed to bring regulators into the picture, as the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing whether Valeant and Allergan’s activist investor, William Ackman, profited from insider information as Valeant launched its bid. Ackman and his Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.7% of Allergan and says the allegations are baseless.
