In the second quarter last year, GlobeImmune\u2019s interest and stock expenses contributed to a net loss of $5.7 million and the company brought in $1.7 million in revenue.\n\nIn regulatory filings associated with the earnings report, GlobeImmune officials said the company now has six full-time employees \u2014 down from 22 at the start of the year \u2014 and is eyeing a sale of some or all of its assets. GlobeImmune on Thursday announced that it engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to explore means of improving shareholder value, but did not elaborate on potential outcomes.\n\nThe moves are part of a broader restructuring meant to preserve cash, officials have said. GlobeImmune closed the most-recent quarter, which ended on June 30, with just over $12.3 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nIn June, GlobeImmune officials said the company\u2019s experimental hepatitis B drug was shown to not reduce infection in patients after 24 weeks of clinical study. The news rocked GlobeImmune\u2019s stock, which lost 50 percent of its value, and triggered the cutting of a majority of GlobeImmune\u2019s workforce.\n\nEarlier this week, GlobeImmune said partner Celgene Corp. exercised its option to license medullary thyroid cancer treatment GI-6207. GlobeImmune will receive a $1.9 million upfront payment as part of the agreement, which could garner milestone payments of up to $120 million, officials disclosed.\n\nGlobeImmune specializes in the development of Tarmogens, which are whole, heat-inactivated yeast that contain a protein to target T cells. GlobeImmune has development and license agreements with biopharma giants Gilead Sciences Inc., which has exclusive licenses for drug candidates to treat chronic hepatitis B, and Celegene Corp., which collaborates and can option certain cancer drug candidates.\n\n\u201cThree of our Tarmogen product candidates are being developed under strategic collaborations with leading biotechnology companies, Gilead Sciences and Celgene Corporation, for infectious disease and multiple cancer indications,\u201d Dr. Timothy C. Rodell, GlobeImmune\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe also recently engaged Cantor Fitzgerald as our exclusive advisor to help us explore strategic alternatives. The goal of this strategy is to allow retention of the upside of our partnerships while exploring additional mechanisms to create stockholder value.\u201d\n\nAlicia Wallace: 303-954-1939, awallace@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aliciawallace", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "With half-dozen employees, GlobeImmune weighs sale", "title": "With half-dozen employees, GlobeImmune weighs sale", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/14/with-half-dozen-employees-globeimmune-weighs-sale/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T09:04:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T09:04:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc19b\"", "article_summary": "In June, GlobeImmune officials said the company\u2019s experimental hepatitis B drug was shown to not reduce infection in patients after 24 weeks of clinical study.\nTwo months after GlobeImmune Inc.\u2019s hepatitis B drug failed a mid-stage study, the Louisville-based drug developer is running at a skeleton crew six people in size and is exploring a potential sale.\nThe moves are part of a broader restructuring meant to preserve cash, officials have said.\nIn regulatory filings associated with the earnings report, GlobeImmune officials said the company now has six full-time employees \u2014 down from 22 at the start of the year \u2014 and is eyeing a sale of some or all of its assets.\nGlobeImmune will receive a $1.9 million upfront payment as part of the agreement, which could garner milestone payments of up to $120 million, officials disclosed."}
