Legislatures, many stocked with new Republican majorities, have passed laws that, if upheld, would drastically reduce access to abortion for millions of women.\n\nSince 2011, 230 abortion restrictions have become law, more than in the entire previous decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.\n\nEight states have enacted laws requiring women to get ultrasounds before receiving abortions. Five prohibit insurance companies from covering abortion for government employees. Nine have passed laws restricting state money from going to any group that provides abortion services.\n\nThis month, nearly two-thirds of the abortion clinics in Texas were forced to close their doors when the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state could enforce a recent law requiring them to be built to the same stringent standards as hospitals.\n\nState by state\n\nCharmaine Yoest, president of the antiabortion group Americans United for Life, calls it a \"tidal wave of legislation,\" spurred by the number of antiabortion legislators elected at the state level in 2010.\n\n\"States are called laboratories of democracy,\" Yoest said. \"There wasn't much opportunity on the federal level, so pro-life Americans said, 'We are going to make a statement with the government that's nearest and closest to us.'\"\n\nIn Louisiana, that effort is on full display.\n\nA conservative juggernaut has sprung to life here along the Gulf of Mexico, where Bayou State politics work hand-in-hand with Christian churches, where some conservative pastors condemn abortion as a sin and tell parishioners that voting for a Democrat is too.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bobby Jindal has been so consistent in his opposition to abortion that the state is celebrated as the most \"pro-life\" in the country by Americans United for Life. The antiabortion lobby's annual scorecards are closely watched by legislators here.\n\n\"Abortion until recently was not a front-burner issue in Louisiana,\" said JP Morrell, a Democratic state senator. \"Religious groups have made it a front-burner issue. The grass-roots movement here is as organized and effective as anything you've ever seen.\"\n\nThe law that is having the most effect on access to abortion in Louisiana requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The legislation was sponsored by a Democratic state legislator, evidence of the complicated politics of abortion here. Ten other states have passed similar measures, although some have been blocked by courts.\n\nAbortion foes say the admitting privileges law would protect women's health. Abortion providers say it would shut down clinics and undermine Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nLouisiana's five abortion clinics have sued to overturn the law. From Sept. 1 forward, any physician without privileges would have had to stop performing abortions, resulting in the closure of some, if not all, of the clinics.\n\nAlthough a federal judge granted a temporary reprieve from the law, as of last week it was unclear whether the doctors who do not yet have privileges will be able to continue practicing until the case is resolved.\n\n\"Based on my experience, many hospitals in Louisiana are reluctant to provide admitting privileges to physicians who perform abortions because of personal objections to abortion held by members of their medical staff,\" Sylvia Cochran, administrator of clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge that provide abortions, said in a court declaration. Many hospitals, she added, also worry about protesters.\n\nSix physicians perform abortions in Louisiana's clinics. Hospitals so far have not granted four of them admitting privileges. Of the two physicians who have such privileges, Cochran fears that one could lose them. The other said in court documents that, if he became the sole legal abortion provider in the state, he would stop performing the procedure because he would fear for his safety.\n\nLouisiana has more than 30 organizations that identify themselves as \"crisis pregnancy centers.\" These facilities provide referrals for free medical care, counsel women against having abortions and are often affiliated with national antiabortion groups. Texas has more than 100. Such centers in Louisiana are often right next to abortion providers. They are listed on the state Department of Health & Hospitals website as an alternative for pregnant women.\n\nOne bright summer day, Bill Shanks stood outside an abortion clinic that Cochran oversees \u2014 the Women's Healthcare Center in New Orleans. He wore a cheery smile as fellow protesters waved giant posters of dismembered fetuses.\n\n\"This is like a victory celebration,\" said Shanks, who was picketing as a member of the fundamentalist Christian group Operation Save America. \"Last time we came here, there were 10 free-standing abortion clinics. One by one, they've crumbled.\"\n\nSupport for abortion rights remains strong across most of the country, according to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press. Last year, as the 40th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade approached, 63% said they would not like to see the court overturn the decision. Only 29% said they wanted it overturned. Over the years, the numbers have remained fairly steady.\n\nWhat has changed, according to the poll, is a divide \u2014 both geographic and political \u2014 that abortion foes have mined with increasing success.\n\nIn New England, 75% of the people Pew polled said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up 5% from two decades ago. But in the eight-state South Central region, which includes Louisiana and Texas, the survey showed that only 40% said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, down 5% over the same period.\n\nFor legislators in the South in particular, the issue of abortion carries serious political consequences.\n\nAt a July 24 town hall meeting in Opelousas, La., organized by opponents of abortion, the audience sat quietly picking through free jambalaya. Benjamin Clapper, executive director of the Louisiana Right to Life Federation, delivered an update on antiabortion bills passed by the state's legislators in the recent session.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "For abortion foes, a national strategy built at the state level", "date": "2014-10-11", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The numbers have changed little over the decades: A majority of Americans support abortion.", "title": "For abortion foes, a national strategy built at the state level", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-abortion-overview-20141012-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-543be51f/turbine/la-na-abortion-overview-20141012", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Abortion, Roe vs. Wade, pro-life, antiabortion, Republican, clinics, ultrasounds, Louisiana, Texas", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81648712", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Abortion, Roe vs. Wade, pro-life, antiabortion, Republican, clinics, ultrasounds, Louisiana, Texas", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The antiabortion movement has recorded major successes in the last four years, seeking to legislate abortion away state by state."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff6f\"", "article_summary": "But across the country, the antiabortion movement has recorded major success in the last four years, part of a well-funded national strategy to legislate abortion out of existence state by state.\n\"Last time we came here, there were 10 free-standing abortion clinics.\nAbortion foes say the admitting privileges law would protect women's health.\nNine have passed laws restricting state money from going to any group that provides abortion services.\nLouisiana's five abortion clinics have sued to overturn the law."}
