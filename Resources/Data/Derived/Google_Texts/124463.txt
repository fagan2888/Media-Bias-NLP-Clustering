President Barack Obama said Thursday that the best moment of his time at the White House came in March 2010, after the passage of his signature health-care bill.

In an #Askpotus Twitter question-and-answer session, Mr. Obama was asked, “What is your greatest memory while being president?” He responded that it was the night the Affordable Care Act passed Congress in March 2010, and he joined a toast with the “staff who’d made it happen, knowing we’d helped millions.”

Mr. Obama has cited the shootings in Newtown, Mass., as the worst moment of his presidency.

In a separate town hall Q&A Wednesday, Mr. Obama was asked, since he is term-limited, “is there any way that we as a group can talk the first lady into running?” Mr. Obama responded that he saw a run by Michelle Obama as extremely unlikely. “There are three things that are certain in life. Death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president.”

In May 2014, faced with a similar question, Mr. Obama said: “The one thing I can promise you is Michelle will not run for office.”
