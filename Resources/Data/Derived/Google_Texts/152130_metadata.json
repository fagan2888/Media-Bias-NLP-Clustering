Thus, rural America has been relatively untouched by this major accountable care program.\n\nIn an effort to change this, on Oct. 15 the Innovation Center of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced the launch of the ACO Investment Model. This new initiative will provide up to $114 million in upfront investments, to up to 75 MSSP ACOs. That works out to an average of about $1.5 million per ACO, though the investment amounts will vary based on an ACO\u2019s number of preliminarily prospectively assigned beneficiaries.\n\nTwo groups will be eligible to participate in the model: new MSSP ACOs joining in 2016, and ACOs that joined the Shared Savings Program in 2012, 2013 and 2014. As with the Advance Payment Model announced in October 2011, the ACO Investment Model aims to help ACOs succeed in the Shared Savings Program by providing upfront capital to cover startup and ongoing infrastructure costs. CMS also intends to use the ACO Investment Model to encourage MSSP ACOs to move to higher levels of financial risk. In both cases, the ultimate objectives are to improve care for beneficiaries and generate Medicare savings.\n\n[See also: ACOs get down to brass tacks.]\n\nPer the ACO Innovation Model, ACOs that will start participating in the MSSP on Jan. 1, 2016 will receive three types of payments:\n\nAn upfront, standard payment;\n\nAn upfront payment that will vary based on an ACO\u2019s number of preliminarily prospectively assigned beneficiaries;\n\nA monthly payment that will vary based on an ACO\u2019s number of preliminarily prospectively assigned beneficiaries.\n\nUnder the ACO Innovation Model, ACOs that began participating in the MSSP on April 1, 2012; July 1, 2012; Jan. 1, 2013; or Jan. 1, 2014, will receive two types of payments:\n\nAn upfront payment that will vary based on an ACO\u2019s number of preliminarily prospectively assigned beneficiaries;\n\nA monthly payment that will vary based on an ACO\u2019s number of preliminarily prospectively assigned beneficiaries.\n\nCMS has specified a number of eligibility criteria for participation in the ACO Investment Model, the most salient of which include:\n\nThe ACO has been accepted into and participates in the Shared Savings Program;\n\nThe ACO has a preliminary prospective beneficiary assignment of 10,000 or fewer beneficiaries;\n\nThe ACO does not include a hospital\u2014unless the hospital is a critical access hospital (CAH) or inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) hospital with 100 or fewer beds;\n\nThe ACO is not owned or operated by a health plan;\n\nThe ACO is not a participant in the Advance Payment Model.\n\nFor MSSP ACOs that started in the program in 2012 or 2013, the application period will run from Oct. 15 to Dec. 1 of 2014. For MSSP ACOs started in 2014 or will start in 2016, the application period will be in the summer of 2015.\n\nWhether the financial incentives provided by the ACO Investment Model are sufficient to encourage formation of rural ACOs and/or to motivate existing ACOs to take on greater financial risk\u2014such as moving from a one-sided, upside-only model to a two-sided model with downside risk\u2014constitute the big, unanswered questions about this initiative.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/new-cms-aco-model-promote-accountable-care-rural-areas", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/investment.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "This week CMS launched an ACO Investment Model, which will provide up to $114 million in upfront investments, to up to 75 Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs.
