The Westminster Kennel Club’s annual dog show is “the Olympics for dogs,” says Anna Van Lenten, one of the curators of the Half King Photography Series.

Photographer Landon Nordeman has spent years documenting the world of dog shows, with a focus on the Westminster Kennel Club show, capturing images that are as much about the people who attend the events as the dogs.

On Mar. 12, The Half King in New York, N.Y., will showcase a selection of Mr. Nordeman’s dog show photos in an exhibit called “Canine Kingdom.”

Mr. Nordeman is an award-winning photographer who regularly contributes to The New Yorker and Saveur. His work is has been exhibited at The Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York and The Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, and is in the collections of The Museum of Fine Arts Houston and The Columbus Museum of Art.

The Half King Photography Series, curated by Anna Van Lenten and James Price, a photo assignments editor at Getty Reportage, holds bi-monthly exhibits, which include displaying the photographer’s prints, projecting a slideshow of the artist’s work, and curating a discussion.

The Half King is located at 505 West 23rd Street in New York, N.Y. “Canine Kingdom” runs from Mar. 12 through May 11. All photographs by Landon Nordeman.
