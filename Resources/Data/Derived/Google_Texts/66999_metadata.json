Just cheers and applause.\n\nHowever serious the Ukraine-related tensions between the U.S. and Russia are in the backdrop of these Winter Paralympics, they weren\u2019t evident in the Shayba Arena on Saturday.\n\nNot even after Russia was denied the ice sledge hockey gold in the final by the Americans, who sent no official delegation to Sochi in a protest against Moscow\u2019s takeover of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula.\n\n\u201cWhen they announced us as the gold medal I was really surprised that the crowd cheered,\u201d American forward Josh Sweeney, a former U.S. Marine, said.\n\nIt was Sweeney\u2019s goal in the second period that retained the Paralympic title for the U.S., ensuring it was \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d playing later in the near-7,000 capacity arena as the team embraced on the ice.\n\nNikko Landeros and Tyler Carron, the best friends and former wrestling teammates at Berthoud High School in Colorado, didn\u2019t figure in the boxscore \u2014 they\u2019re defensemen and the final was 1-0 \u2014 but they collected gold with Team USA. They lost their legs in a highly publicized auto accident seven years ago while they were students at Berthoud.\n\n\u201cWe all came together and trusted each other, and that\u2019s what got it done at the end,\u201d defenseman Taylor Chase said.\n\n\u201cSweeney played out of his mind. He has done that the whole tournament and worked so hard that it spreads throughout the whole team.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. match-winning moment came in the 25th minute after Sweeney intercepted a mistake by defenseman Alexei Lysov. The former U.S. Marine swept forward before raising the puck past goaltender Vladimir Kamantcev.\n\n\u201cI got it from that defender and I was a little surprised to be able to have a breakaway in the gold medal match,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cI just got fortunate.\u201d\n\nIt briefly silenced the home crowd\u2019s chants just days after they were celebrating a preliminary round victory over the U.S.\n\n\u201cToday was our chance and it is unknown when we\u2019ll be in the Paralympics final again and whether we\u2019ll get there at all,\u201d said Russian player Vadim Selyukin, who took up the sport after being injured in an explosion in Tajikistan while in the Russian army.\n\nAn explosion also put Sweeney on a path to the Paralympics. It\u2019s less than five years since he lost his legs and left arm after stepping on an improvised explosive device while on patrol in Afghanistan.\n\nNow Sweeney, an able-bodied hockey player in high school, has a sporting medal to join the military honor awarded for his courage and bravery.\n\n\u201cPurple Hearts are normally awarded after being injured in the line of duty after a lot of work, so it\u2019s a little upsetting,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to get injured to win a gold medal.\u201d\n\nSweeney\u2019s team succeeded where the U.S. men fell short in the Sochi Olympics last month. The men didn\u2019t make the podium, although the women\u2019s team was second.\n\nSaturday\u2019s final gave disability sport its biggest platform yet in the U.S., with NBC making a late change to its schedules to show its first live action from the Paralympics.\n\n\u201cI never thought that would happen,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cI never knew about Paralympics growing up, and hopefully what this will do is get more kids and more adults into sled hockey so we can grow this sport to be a household sport.\u201d\n\nThe TV exposure enabled Sweeney to show his fellow Marines there was life after being injured in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome they can see me doing something amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was injured they all took it really hard, so it\u2019s nice for them to see my life isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\nFar from it.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "USA beats Russia in Sochi for Paralympics hockey gold", "title": "USA beats Russia in Sochi for Paralympics hockey gold", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/16/usa-beats-russia-in-sochi-for-paralympics-hockey-gold/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140316__paralympics-hockey-gold-USAp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140316__paralympics-hockey-gold-USAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-16T13:07:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:02:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SOCHI, Russia \u2014 Lining up on the Sochi ice to receive their gold medals, the American ice sledge hockey team anticipated abuse from the Russian crowd.\nNot even after Russia was denied the ice sledge hockey gold in the final by the Americans, who sent no official delegation to Sochi in a protest against Moscow\u2019s takeover of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to get injured to win a gold medal.\u201dSweeney\u2019s team succeeded where the U.S. men fell short in the Sochi Olympics last month.\nHowever serious the Ukraine-related tensions between the U.S. and Russia are in the backdrop of these Winter Paralympics, they weren\u2019t evident in the Shayba Arena on Saturday.\nNow Sweeney, an able-bodied hockey player in high school, has a sporting medal to join the military honor awarded for his courage and bravery."}
