A Michigan woman is recovering after contracting bubonic plague while visiting southern Colorado for a music festival late last month, health officials say.

The woman, from Marquette County, Mich., represents the first ever case of plague in the Midwest state.

Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said the woman has been treated.

Chaffee County Public Health said Tuesday the woman contracted the plague while attending the Gentlemen of the Road music festival Aug. 21 in Salida.

Andrea Carlstrom, director of the health department, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes the woman contracted the plague while hiking the Methodist Mountain Trail System.

Carlstrom said a dog also contracted plague in that area in early July, passing the illness to its owner. Both have been treated and are recovering, she said.
