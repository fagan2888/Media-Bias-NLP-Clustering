Rapid City, SD

Members of the Sturgis wrestling team were easy to spot at the South Dakota state tournament. They went bleach blond for Brandon.



The 11 wrestlers who qualified for state all dyed their hair blond as a tribute to Brandon Delzer, a 14-year-old Sturgis Brown High School wrestler who was killed in a one-vehicle accident last November.



Sturgis wrestler Zane Joens says that the blond-haired Delzer "meant everything" to the team and it was an appropriate gesture for one of the hardest workers on both the wrestling and cross country squads.



The dye jobs were also done professionally, thanks to a Sturgis salon that gave the team a favorable discount.
