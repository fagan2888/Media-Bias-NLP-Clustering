Dez or Demaryius.\n\nThe Broncos needed to choose.\n\nThe 2010 NFL draft was approaching, and the Broncos wanted to rebuild their receiving core. Dez Bryant was a troubled but ultratalented prospect from Oklahoma State. Demaryius Thomas had a broken foot and when last seen healthy was a fly route runner from the option offense of Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Broncos visited first with Bryant at Dove Valley, then Thomas a couple of days before the draft in Atlanta.\n\nIt was Brandon Marshall who broke the tie.\n\nMarshall was coming off three consecutive 100-catch seasons but was also a headache. The Broncos had just traded away Marshall because he wanted out and they were tired of him, anyway. But the team could hardly tell its fans Marshall had to go because he was trouble, only to draft the problem child that was Bryant.\n\nAnd so with their No. 22 overall pick, the Broncos took a chance on the kid with the broken foot. Bryant dropped to No. 24, where he was taken by the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nDemaryius and the Broncos will play Dallas and Dez on Sunday at the opulent, sports palace known as AT&T Stadium.\n\n\u201cOh, man, I\u2019m blessed to be here,\u201d Thomas said Friday at his locker. \u201cBlessed. Great organization. This is a great place.\u201d\n\nThomas\u2019 background also raised eyebrows. His mom and his grandma had been imprisoned on drug charges since he was young. But his was a story of overcoming adversity, thanks in large part to the aunt and uncle who raised him.\n\nAt Georgia Tech, Thomas basically ran two routes \u2014 the \u201cgo\u201d and the \u201chitch.\u201d Maybe, he would mix in the hitch-and-go. He didn\u2019t catch many, but when he did, they went for big yards.\n\nThen-Broncos coach Josh McDaniels and general manager Brian Xanders were with Thomas in his agent Todd France\u2019s conference room. McDaniels would draw up a play on a whiteboard. Explain it. Zebra 11 was one running back, one tailback. Thomas would be in the \u201cZ\u201d receiver position.\n\nErase it. Draw up another play. Cadet 11 might have Thomas in the slot. Erase it.\n\nAfter four or five plays, Thomas was sent up to the board. He was told a play McDaniels had diagrammed, and he\u2019d have to draw it up with the correct formation and personnel sets.\n\nHe aced it.\n\n\u201cI remember McDaniels telling me that,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think it helped me, because everybody was worried I didn\u2019t know many routes coming out of college. That showed that I can catch on to stuff fast.\u201d\n\nDez is the best receiver on America\u2019s Team. Demaryius is the most lethal weapon for arguably the NFL\u2019s best team.\n\nIn the third round of that draft, the Broncos took another receiver with a broken foot, Eric Decker. They went into the draft trying to decide between Dez and Demaryius.\n\nThey came out with Demaryius and Deck.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis\n\nTHREE UP\n\n1. Browns: Return of WR Josh Gordon coincided with offensive surge. Averaged 8.0 points in two losses, 28.3 in next three wins.\n\n2. Titans: QB Jake Locker was playing steady, but their defense had been carrying them anyhow. Ryan Fitzpatrick is a capable backup.\n\n3. Colts: Have gone 2-0 by margins of 20, 34 points since acquiring RB Trent Richardson. A deal that worked for both sides.\n\nTHREE DOWN\n\n1. Falcons: Reminds me of the San Diego Chargers from 2004-10 \u2014 lots of star power but not tough enough up front on either side.\n\n2. Texans: Matt Schaub\u2019s pick-six skid has got to end.\n\n3. Eagles: After getting blown out by the Broncos, Philly media detected some quit in Chip Kelly\u2019s men.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: Broncos 2010 draft dilemma: Demaryius Thomas or Dez Bryant?", "title": "Klis: Broncos 2010 draft dilemma: Demaryius Thomas or Dez Bryant?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/05/klis-broncos-2010-draft-dilemma-demaryius-thomas-or-dez-bryant/", "image": {"width": 610, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130923_092750_denver-broncos-v-oakland-raiders-1.jpg", "height": 509}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130923_092750_denver-broncos-v-oakland-raiders-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-05T17:40:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:34:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e7c\"", "article_summary": "Demaryius Thomas had a broken foot and when last seen healthy was a fly route runner from the option offense of Georgia Tech.\nDemaryius and the Broncos will play Dallas and Dez on Sunday at the opulent, sports palace known as AT&T Stadium.\nHe was told a play McDaniels had diagrammed, and he\u2019d have to draw it up with the correct formation and personnel sets.\nThe Broncos visited first with Bryant at Dove Valley, then Thomas a couple of days before the draft in Atlanta.\nDemaryius or Dez."}
