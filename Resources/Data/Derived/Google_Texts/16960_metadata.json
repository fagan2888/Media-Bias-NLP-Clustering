The state would be barred, as well, from entering the homes of citizens to conduct ObamaCare-mandated inspections without the homeowners/renters prior approval.\n\n\u201cThe federal government does not have constitutional authority to commandeer state and local governments to enforce or implement these federal healthcare mandates,\u201d Beavers said, as quoted by the Tenth Amendment Center. \u201cIt\u2019s time that Tennessee says no to assisting them in the implementation of this disastrous program. This legislation takes a very strong stand to resist this federal overreach of power.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Pody echoed his colleague\u2019s sentiment, telling the Tenth Amendment Center, \u201cThis action, especially in conjunction with similar steps being taken in other states, has the effect of nullifying ObamaCare,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the feds cannot even build an appropriate website or keep their promises to consumers, they will be extremely hard-pressed to implement the other provisions for this program within our boundaries.\u201d\n\nAnother co-sponsor, state Representative Terri Lynn Weaver (R-Lancaster), told local media that the bill would create \"a firewall\" around Tennessee, shielding the state from the devastation of ObamaCare.\n\nThe Tennessee bills rely \u2014 as do similar measures that will soon be considered in South Carolina, Georgia, West Virginia, and Missouri \u2014 on the anti-commandeering doctrine that has long been a key principle of federalism.\n\nPut simply, anti-commandeering prohibits the federal government from forcing states to participate in any federal program that does not concern \u201cinternational and interstate matters.\u201d\n\nWhile this expression of federalism (\u201cdual sovereignty,\u201d as it was named by Justice Antonin Scalia) was first set forth in the case of New York v. United States (1992), most recently it was reaffirmed by the high court in the case of Mack and Printz v. United States (1997).\n\nSheriff Richard Mack was one of the named plaintiffs in this landmark case, and on the website of his organization the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, he recounts the basic facts of the case:\n\nThe Mack/Printz case was the case that set Sheriff Mack on a path of nationwide renown as he and Sheriff Printz sued the Clinton administration over unconstitutional gun control measures, were eventually joined by other sheriffs for a total of seven, went all the way to the supreme court and won.\n\nThere is much more \u201cammo\u201d in this historic and liberty-saving Supreme Court ruling. We have been trying to get state and local officials from all over the country to read and study this most amazing ruling for almost two decades. Please get a copy of it today and pass it around to your legislators, county commissioners, city councils, state reps, even governors!\n\nThe Mack/Printz ruling makes it clear that the states do not have to accept orders from the feds!\n\nRight now, legislators in the handful of states mentioned above are relying, at least in part, on the decision handed down in the Mack/Printz case. Some leaders in the liberty movement believe these are but the first few sparks that will ignite a larger fire of state resistance to federal overreach.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment Center\u2019s National Communications Director Mike Maherry said, \"Our sources tell us to expect at least ten states moving in this direction in the coming months. But that will only come true if people start calling their state representatives and senators right now. State lawmakers need to know they should introduce bills to ban the state from participating in any ObamaCare programs.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, though, there is no reason to limit lawmakers to one method of fighting the federal menace. One of the most potent weapons \u2014 and one of the most constitutionally sound \u2014 is nullification.\n\nThe states, through the exercise of the Tenth Amendment and their authority to rule as sovereign entities, may stop ObamaCare at the state borders by enacting state statutes nullifying the healthcare law and criminalizing state participation in administering or executing the unconstitutional provisions thereof.\n\nNullification is the \u201crightful remedy\u201d and is a much more constitutionally sound method of checking federal usurpation. It is quicker and less complicated than an attempt to have the law repealed by Congress or overturned by a future federal bench more respectful of the Constitution.\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s ratification of ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate can be seen as a mandate of another sort. Americans should now turn their attention to removing from office every congressman who voted in favor of the \u201claw\u201d and electing those candidates for state legislature who will commit themselves to boldly asserting the sovereignty of the states and forcing the raging bull of the federal government back within the small and well-defined corral built by our Founding Fathers.\n\nAs the multitude of unconstitutional mandates contained within the ObamaCare behemoth are now breathing down the necks of Americans, thankfully, there are a few state legislators proposing bills to protect citizens from being subjected to the healthcare law.\n\nThis is more than praiseworthy, however. As this reporter wrote recently:\n\nIt would seem that resisting federal trampling of the Constitution is not only a right of state lawmakers, it is a constitutional obligation.\n\nArticle VI, Clause 3 reads:\n\nThe Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\n\nThis clause puts all state legislators under a legally binding obligation (assuming they\u2019ve taken their oath of office) to \u201csupport the Constitution.\u201d There is no better way, it would seem, for these elected state representatives of the people to show support for the Constitution than by demanding that the officers of the federal government adhere to constitutional limits on their power.\n\nPerhaps a greater number of these state legislators, attorneys general, and judges would be more inclined to perform their Article VI duty if the people that put them in office would sue them and hold them legally accountable for any failures to carry this burden.\n\nImagine, furthermore, the uproar in state assemblies across the country if every day the legislators were in session, process servers showed up at their offices armed with lawsuits charging them with dereliction of their constitutional duty!\n\nAccording to reports out of Nashville, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam \u2014 not known as fan of nullification \u2014 has not \"had a chance to review its impact and how it would work.\u201d\n\nPerhaps citizens of Tennessee should volunteer to send Governor Haslam a copy of the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Maybe then he would understand how such a bill would work.\n\nJoe A.
