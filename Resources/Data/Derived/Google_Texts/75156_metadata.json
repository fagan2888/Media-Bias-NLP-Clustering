He pointed to Old Testament dietary laws being changed in the New Testament as one example of God renewing his covenant with his people.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get to heaven by observing do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and rules,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get to heaven by a personal relationship with God through his Son.\u201d\n\nMr. Reed has written a new book, \u201cAwakening,\u201d which argues that many of America\u2019s problems are caused by a lack of faith.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have faith to be a good person,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is that in the overwhelming number of cases it is something that leads to social behaviors that are more committed to other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do those things without believing in magic,\u201d Mr. Maher retorted.\n\nMr. Reed pointed to the increasing debt and rising number of children born out of wedlock as problems facing the nation.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that there are some things we have to get back in order,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can do it by electing another politician I don\u2019t think you can do it by passing another law. I think you need a moral and a cultural and a spiritual renewal.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher commented that he did admire Mr. Reed\u2019s courage in being willing to come debate the Bible with an atheist on TV.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Well-known atheist Bill Maher clashed with the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Ralph Reed, on his show Friday while discussing whether the Bible is the literal word of God.", "Author": "Phillip Swarts", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Well-known atheist Bill Maher clashed with the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Ralph Reed, on his show Friday while discussing whether the Bible is the literal word of God.", "title": "Bill Maher: Christian faith in God is the \u2018purposeful suspension of critical thinking\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/7/bill-maher-christian-faith-god-purposeful-suspensi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/29/bill-maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/29/bill-maher.jpg", "title": "Bill Maher: Christian faith in God is the \u2018purposeful suspension", "description": "Well-known atheist Bill Maher clashed with the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Ralph Reed, on his show Friday while discussing whether the Bible is the literal word of God.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Entertainment Culture, Ralph Reed, Bill Maher"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5fa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t think you can do it by electing another politician I don\u2019t think you can do it by passing another law.\nMr. Reed pointed to the increasing debt and rising number of children born out of wedlock as problems facing the nation.\n\u201cFaith: the purposeful suspension of critical thinking,\u201d The HBO Real Time host said, giving his definition of the word.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get to heaven by observing do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and rules,\u201d Mr. Reed said.\nHe grilled Mr. Reed on several passages he said showed harmful behavior if followed to the letter, including passages about women having pre-marital sex needing to be stoned."}
