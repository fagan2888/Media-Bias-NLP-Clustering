New Jersey state senators backing a bill to legalize assisted suicide in the state have delayed the bill as they plan to wage an “educational campaign” to convince their colleagues.

Hours after a state Senate committee approved the assisted suicide bill for consideration by the full Senate, supporter and Senate President Stephen Sweeney said there would be no vote on Thursday, which is the last day of the 2014 session for the state Senate.

Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, told LifeSiteNews that disability advocates, her organization, and religious leaders -- as well as "individuals who were battling illness and disease but who were adamantly opposed to the bill" -- testified against the bill on Monday.

"Witnesses in opposition overwhelmingly outnumbered witnesses in favor," said Tasy. "The bill was released from committee by a vote of 5-3, [but] was released from committee without recommendation. [This] means that members voted to release but reserve their right to change their vote when it comes before the full Senate.”

Tasy said that the bill would force taxpayers to fund assisted suicide "through Medicaid and, most likely, the state health exchange via Obamacare." She encouraged opponents of the bill to contact their state senators and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
