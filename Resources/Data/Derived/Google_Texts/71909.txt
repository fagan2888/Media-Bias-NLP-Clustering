SAVANNAH, Ga. (WJCL) - More than 2,000 seats were filled in the Savannah Civic Center Sunday, where the Johnny Mercer Theater had high energy pulsing throughout the night.

Self described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders made his way through Savannah.

"Somebody told me Georgia was a conservative state, I guess not," he said.

He continues to see notable success reaching young voters, something evident by Sunday's turnout. One Auburn University college student traveled five hours for the event.

"I just really feel like it's time that we have a president who's kind of an outsider," Charles Brownlee said.

Many college students there said Sanders' free tuition plan appeals to them in particular.

"You can't go to school for a reasonable price anymore," Brownlee said. "I got scholarships and I'm still going to be tens of thousands of dollars in debt, probably."

From the stage, Sanders said his plan aims to keep America's jails less full.

"It costs less money to send a young person to the University of Georgia than to lock them up," he said. "Let's send them to the University of Georgia."

He also touched on his plan for a $15 an hour work wage.

"It is not a radical socialist idea to say that if somebody in America works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty," Sanders said.

Sanders also took a moment to weigh in on how to defeat ISIS.

"I think the United States and Europe should be supportive, air strikes, and other efforts, but I think at the end of the day, ISIS gets crushed when the Muslim nations stand up themselves and win the fight for Islam."

Some supports Sunday were surprised by the turnout in Savannah.

"You never know in this town," Roger Guy said. "It's a conservative place, yet we filled up this theater."
