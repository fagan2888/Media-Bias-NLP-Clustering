Just this week, he revealed how immoderate he is on women\u2019s reproductive rights and health, saying the federal government is spending too much for gynecological-related medical services, which includes abortion. Bush also keeps peddling the line that he opposes ground troops to fight ISIS, but would send in more special forces and trainers\u2014as if those soldiers have never been the harbinger of deploying more troops when war plans don\u2019t work.\n\nBen Carson: Carson keeps reciting the clich\u00e9 that Obamacare is one of the worst things federal government has ever forced on Americans. That\u2019s always been a bizarre right-wing complaint, especially as Obamacare is built on the conservative embrace of the private health insurance industry. It\u2019s also factually wrong, as evidenced by the 15-plus million people who have signed up for it. The optics of a retired African-American surgeon whacking Obama looks good on Fox News, but that\u2019s just another ruse.\n\nMarco Rubio: The clich\u00e9 Marco Rubio keeps repeating is that he is a fresh face bringing new ideas and energy to the GOP, just as John F. Kennedy did for Democrats in the 1960s. The big lie is that Rubio is a new Latino champion who breaks from past GOP policies. Even though his grandfather was an undocumented immigrant, Rubio has walked away from earlier immigration reforms and embraced the party\u2019s most draconian stances. He now opposes amnesty, the Dream Act, wants bigger border walls, and wants to require English proficiency for green cards.\n\nDonald Trump: Trump may be running as the anti-politician, speaking with a brashness that sets him apart from the veiled rhetoric of other GOP candidates. But Trump\u2019s speeches are filled with clich\u00e9s, whether racist diatribes against Mexican immigrants or endless boasts about his business acumen. The big lie coming from Trump goes beyond reducing the presidency to a negotiator-in-chief, but has to do with his many failures in business. Not only is his offend-all-comers campaign style undermining his brand (as business partners tear up the contracts), but Trump\u2019s past is filled with shady deals and business flops.\n\nScott Walker: Walker is running with the claim that he, above all other Republicans, has the best record of fighting for right-wing values and winning over voters in a purple state, or at least states with a notable Democratic presence. The fighter clich\u00e9 is tedious and one-dimensional, as if being the biggest bully is the top qualification for office. The big lie is Walker\u2019s tenure as governor has been anything but the success he claims. Wisconsin\u2019s economy has lagged behind its neighbors, and Walker\u2019s unprovoked political battles, from bashing unions to restricting abortion, have left Wisconsin with its most polarized electorate in years.\n\nTed Cruz: Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign is predicated on the libertarian conceit that America would be great again if politicians were truthful and if government ensured the widest possible liberties for all citizens and businesses. The clich\u00e9 that liberty heals all wounds and solves all problems is absurd. But the big lie is that candidate Cruz is a truth-teller, when he is actually a shameless provocateur, saying the White House\u2019s nuclear arms deal with Iran makes the administration \u201cthe leading financier of terrorism against America in the world.\u201d\n\nMike Huckabee: Former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee\u2019s leading claim to electoral fame, beside being an evangelical warrior in the White House, is that he knows the Clintons better than anyone, which makes him the best man to face Hillary. To start, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, and a bad one, to say that Hillary is a carbon copy of Bill. But the bigger clich\u00e9 and lie comes from the pages of his pre-campaign book, which divides America into two tribes\u2014rural rednecks and urban liberals\u2014and then stereotypes and insults Americans who live on the coasts in a manner that echoes his rants on his former Fox TV show.\n\nChris Christie. New Jersey Gov. Christie portrays himself as the candidate who\u2019s least afraid to tell hard truths and make grownup decisions. These clich\u00e9s fill his speeches, in which, as the Washington Post noted, Christie seems to recite every empty phrase in the campaign lexicon (\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\u201d \u201cIs America better off now?\u201d \u201cAre we going forward or backward?\u201d). But the big lie of Christie\u2019s campaign is that he brings people and solutions together, when in reality his record is filled with small-minded bullying, revenge-taking and ideological stances (like canceling a commuter tunnel to New York City) that make life harder for real people.\n\nRand Paul. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is running as the GOP candidate least likely to do all the clich\u00e9d tasks required of contenders, such as show up at Iowa pork roasts or pander to single-issue summits. But despite Paul\u2019s libertarian leanings, he has reversed course on many issues, to try to kickstart his campaign. Aid to Israel, curbing defense spending and overseas drone warfare are just three examples where he\u2019s flip-flopped, showing that Paul isn\u2019t a libertarian purist, but a politician playing to constituencies.\n\nJohn Kasich. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the last candidate to officially announce. He framed his candidacy in Reaganesque clich\u00e9s of restoring the American dream, expanding the military, cutting domestic spending, and upholding traditional values. The big lie behind his faith-and-family pronouncements is that Kasich made untold millions between his stints in office by working for the failed Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers, including helping to sell $500 million of bad debt to Ohio retirement funds. As governor, he cut social programs, environmental laws, public school spending, abortion and LGBT rights, penalized welfare recipients and gerrymandered legislative districts to ensure a GOP majority. In a field filled with charlatans, bullies and braggarts, Kasich is not another good old boy, he\u2019s a devious and dangerous right-wing hit man.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Scott-Walker-at-the-RNC-800x430.gif", "height": 430}, "title": "Here are the 10 biggest lies and clich\u00e9s spouted by the top 10 Republicans running for president \u2014 so far"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "The big lie is Walker\u2019s tenure as governor has been anything but the success he claims.\nThe big lie coming from Trump goes beyond reducing the presidency to a negotiator-in-chief, but has to do with his many failures in business.\nWhat follows is a list of some of the biggest clich\u00e9s and lies from the top 10 Republican contenders.\nThe big lie is that Rubio is a new Latino champion who breaks from past GOP policies.\nJeb Bush: The clich\u00e9 Jeb Bush promotes is that he\u2019s the \u201cmoderate\u201d in the GOP field, but that is also his biggest lie."}
