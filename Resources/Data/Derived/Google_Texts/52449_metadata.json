It\u2019s an industrial ballad. ... The absence of our usual aggressive punk vocals in this song is a reaction to this tragedy.\"\n\nEric Garner's last words \"are his, but we hope they can also stand for us and for many around the world, for all who can\u2019t breathe because authorities act with impunity and feel invincible and above the law in using power to humiliate, intimidate, hurt, kill and oppress,\" they continued. \"We\u2019ve known, on our own skin, what police brutality feels like, and we can\u2019t be silent on this issue.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\"We can\u2019t be silent on this issue\" say the Russian punk rockers and activists.", "title": "Pussy Riot Dedicate New Song, 'I Can't Breathe,' to Eric Garner and All 'Who Suffer From State Terror'", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/02/19/pussy-riot-dedicate-song-to-eric-garner", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14243664484414.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We can\u2019t be silent on this issue\" say the Russian punk rockers and activists.", "title": "Pussy Riot Dedicate New Song, 'I Can't Breathe,' to Eric Garner and All 'Who Suffer From State Terror'", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14243664484414.jpg", "creator": "enbrown", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-02-19T18:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/elizabeth-nolan-brown"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc291\"", "article_summary": "Russian punk rockers, feminists, and dissidents Pussy Riot released a new song Wednesday that was inspired by the death of American Eric Garner.\nIn The Guardian, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina explained that \"I Can't Breathe\" isn\u2019t \"like other Pussy Riot songs.\nIn the video for \"I Can't Breathe\" (posted below), two band members appear in Russian riot police uniforms as they're slowly buried alive.\nPussy Riot recorded the song in December after participating in New York City protests over Garner's death and police brutality more generally.\nThe song also features U.S. punk icon Richard Hell, Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer Nick Zimmer, and other Russian and American musicians."}
