Trauma nurse Jonathan Bartels, R.N., told KHN he was inspired by the short time spent in reflection, leading him to call a pause the next time a patient died.\n\nThe idea is to remember that the patient is a person who had a life and a family, and to thank the team for their efforts to save him or her. Bartels says he is able to \"sense and give back\" by pausing, and \"acknowledge the pain that I bore witness to in caring for that family and caring for that patient.\"\n\n\"The Pause\" has spread throughout the hospital and now is being taught at the university's medical school, according to the article. Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Washington, has since instituted a similar program.\n\nOne of the known risks of being exposed to death daily is \"death anxiety,\" which can lead to medical professionals stressing out about their own mortality. More traditional interventions include rotating emergency healthcare workers in and out of high-mortality settings. Experts also recommend adding nursing school curriculum focused on dealing with mortality.\n\nA related risk for nurses is \"compassion fatigue,\" in which the stress of showing compassion can cause fatigue and other symptoms outside of work, including an inability to \"switch off\" after work. Support from peers and supervisors can help, as can writing down thoughts and feelings.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the KHN article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nER nurses often suffer from 'death anxiety'\n\nStudy: Nurses that show more compassion suffer fatigue, stress\n\nER doc burnout buster: Innovative program aims to help with work-life balance\n\nHospitals try holistic approach to treat docs' stress, burnout\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical teams at the University of Virginia Medical Center find that pausing for a few moments after a patient dies helps them accept the loss and experience less emotional trauma.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Medical teams at the University of Virginia Medical Center find that pausing for a few moments after a patient dies helps them accept the loss and experience less emotional trauma.", "title": "Short pause after patient death helps medical teams recover emotionally", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/short-pause-after-patient-death-helps-medical-teams-recover-emotionally/2015-09-28", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "chaplains,Compassion Fatigue,death anxiety,Direct Care Workers,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,workplace stress", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc76\"", "article_summary": "Medical teams at the University of Virginia Medical Center find that pausing for a few moments after a patient dies helps them accept the loss and experience less emotional trauma.\nOne of the known risks of being exposed to death daily is \"death anxiety,\" which can lead to medical professionals stressing out about their own mortality.\n\"The Pause\" has spread throughout the hospital and now is being taught at the university's medical school, according to the article.\nTrauma nurse Jonathan Bartels, R.N., told KHN he was inspired by the short time spent in reflection, leading him to call a pause the next time a patient died.\nFor more:- here's the KHN articleRelated Articles:ER nurses often suffer from 'death anxiety'Study: Nurses that show more compassion suffer fatigue, stressER doc burnout buster: Innovative program aims to help with work-life balanceHospitals try holistic approach to treat docs' stress, burnout"}
