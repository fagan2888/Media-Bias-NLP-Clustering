What robots need to function in the home is vision and the ability to interact intelligently.'\n\nLast year, Dyson launched a \u00a3150million facility full of robots - but Sir James admits they are inefficient: 'They perform precise, highly controlled movements in an environment that doesn\u2019t change.\n\n'In a complex environment \u2013 the home or garden \u2013 a machine must understand and perceive its environment. Such technology would have wide ranging application. This is a starting point, and we will have to see where it leads - and that is what's exciting.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Sir,James,Dyson,reveals,firm,entering,race,build,affordable,robot,chores,home", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2555133/Sir-James-Dyson-reveals-firm-entering-race-build-affordable-robot-chores-home.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The entrepreneur said this week he will announce a \u00a35 million investment in a new robotics laboratory at Imperial College London to develop the technology.", "title": "Dyson race to build affordable robot to do chores around the home", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2555133/Sir-James-Dyson-reveals-firm-entering-race-build-affordable-robot-chores-home.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/09/article-2555133-1B5357E800000578-44_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2555133, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Sir,James,Dyson,reveals,firm,entering,race,build,affordable,robot,chores,home", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-02-09T13:08:41.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Mia+De+Graaf", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-02-10T10:04:22.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Sir James Dyson reveals firm entering race build affordable robot chores home"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The entrepreneur said this week he will announce a \u00a35 million investment in a new robotics laboratory at Imperial College London to develop the technology.", "title": "Dyson race to build affordable robot to do chores around the home", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2555133/Sir-James-Dyson-reveals-firm-entering-race-build-affordable-robot-chores-home.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/09/article-2555133-1B5357E800000578-44_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The entrepreneur said this week he will announce a \u00a35 million investment in a new robotics laboratory at Imperial College London to develop the technology."}, "article_summary": "Sir James Dyson reveals his firm are entering the race to build an affordable robot that can do chores around the homeEntrepreneur will invest in a new lab at Imperial College LondonHe said soon a 'new generation of robot' will be availableSir James is currently competing with Japanese firmsBritish inventor Sir James Dyson has revealed he is working on an affordable robot to carry out chores around the house.\nSir James told MailOnline: 'Domestic use will be the initial focus of the research.\nLast year, Dyson launched a \u00a3150million facility full of robots - but Sir James admits they are inefficient: 'They perform precise, highly controlled movements in an environment that doesn\u2019t change.\nSir James said soon a 'new generation of robot that understands the world around them will be able to clean the house, put out the bins and even keep an eye out for intruders'.\nThis is a starting point, and we will have to see where it leads - and that is what's exciting.'"}
