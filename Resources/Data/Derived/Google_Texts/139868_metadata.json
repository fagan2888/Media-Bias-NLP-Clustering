Those words define the president\u2019s most important duty. But Obama, himself a constitutional lawyer, is ignoring the Constitution and governing like a dictator. His latest ploy exempts unions from a fee the Affordable Care Act imposes.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University, who voted for Obama and professes to agree with him on health care and other issues, didn\u2019t mince words when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 3. He warned that Obama\u2019s power grabs are causing \u201cthe most serious constitutional crisis I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nSeveral law professors and policy experts laid out a litany of the president\u2019s constitutional transgressions. He has delayed and rewritten key provisions of his health care law and weaseled a special insurance subsidy for members of Congress the law did not provide. When Congress refused to enact his immigration and environmental policies, he imposed them by edict, granting amnesty to illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and forcing regulations on coal plants that will likely bankrupt that industry.\n\nMost recent is Obama\u2019s trick to spare unions from a fee that section 1341(b)(1)(A) of the Affordable Care Act unambiguously imposes on all large group health plans. Faithfully executing the law means applying it evenhandedly. Dictators do the opposite, playing favorites.\n\nThe union giveaway is buried on page 72,340 of the Federal Register for Dec. 2, a voluminous publication where government discloses its mind-numbing regulations. The Affordable Care Act sets up a reinsurance program to compensate insurers in the individual market, who are hit with high costs for covering people with preexisting conditions. The money is raised with a fee imposed on all group health plans, starting in 2014 and going through 2016, designed to raise $25 billion in all. Insurers and self-insured employers pay in proportion to the number of people they cover, so in 2014 the fee is $63 per covered person.\n\nFor three and a half years, the Obama administration crafted regulations to impose the fee on all large group plans.\n\nBut in the fall 2013, unions pressed for an exemption. Then, these words appeared on Dec. 2: \u201cOur continued study of this issue leads us to believe that this provision may reasonably be interpreted in one of two ways \u2014 it may be interpreted to mean that self-insured, self administered plans must make reinsurance contributions, or it may be interpreted to mean that such plans are excluded from the obligation \u2026 upon further consideration of the issue, we believe the statutory language can reasonably be read \u2026 \u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lie. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s reinsurance provision doesn\u2019t use the word \u201cself-administered\u201d or distinguish between plans that pay their own claims and plans that hire administrators. But Taft-Hartley union plans self-insure and self-administer, and will therefore be exempted by the Dec. 2 regulation.\n\nWriting government double-talk is a dark art. It\u2019s straight out of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d Orwell warned that totalitarian governments impudently claim that black is white, in contradiction to the plain truth, to sap the public\u2019s ability to think critically. The Obama administration does it, too.\n\nThe army of bureaucrats cranking out regulations and deceptions to justify them has no loyalty to the public or the U.S. Constitution. They are loyal to the state and have terrifying power over us.\n\nThe Dec. 2 rule will mean that insurers and other self-insured employers who are not exempted will pay more in 2015 and 2016 to meet the $25 billion target. It\u2019s zero sum.\n\nThey will have grounds to sue, but the president is counting on the fact they won\u2019t. Insurers, pharmaceutical companies and other industries are being corrupted by the Obama administration\u2019s cronyism. They figure they\u2019ll make up the sum somewhere else in a side deal with the administration.\n\nThe biggest loss is freedom. Each time Obama claims power the Constitution does not allow, he sets a menacing precedent for future presidents to rule by edict.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and the author of Beating Obamacare: Your Handbook for the New Healthcare Law.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Each time Obama claims power the Constitution does not allow, he sets a menacing precedent for future presidents to rule by edict.", "title": "All I want for Christmas is my freedom back", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/454343069-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/12/11/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-my-freedom-back/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Each time Obama claims power the Constitution does not allow, he sets a menacing precedent for future presidents to rule by edict.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/454343069-480x320.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Each time Obama claims power the Constitution does not allow, he sets a menacing precedent for future presidents to rule by edict."}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf3c\"", "article_summary": "He has delayed and rewritten key provisions of his health care law and weaseled a special insurance subsidy for members of Congress the law did not provide.\nThe money is raised with a fee imposed on all group health plans, starting in 2014 and going through 2016, designed to raise $25 billion in all.\nFor three and a half years, the Obama administration crafted regulations to impose the fee on all large group plans.\nMost recent is Obama\u2019s trick to spare unions from a fee that section 1341(b)(1)(A) of the Affordable Care Act unambiguously imposes on all large group health plans.\nThe biggest loss is freedom."}
