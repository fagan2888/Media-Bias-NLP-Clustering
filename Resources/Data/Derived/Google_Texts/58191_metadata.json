As an answer to this, we offer the below labor of love \u2013 \"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\" \u2013 dedicated and designed to getting you caught up and connected to the conversation.\n\nPiers Morgan and the three-year-old that questioned Chris Christie\n\nWhen Chris Christie took questions from a crowd during one of his Thursday town hall meetings, one tiny person, with a big question, stole the show as she directly asked the New Jersey Governor when he planned on fixing her house.\n\nSeveral hours later, three-year-old Nicole Mariano again stole hearts, joining \"Piers Morgan Live\" to discuss her family's home, which remains damaged following Hurricane Sandy.\n\nSeated on her mother's lap, Mariano smiled coyly at the camera as Piers Morgan sought specifics about her living situation.\n\n\u201cWe were approved for REM in the first rounds of approvals and our house is still unchanged from November 2012. It's exactly the same,\u201d said Nicole's mother, Kelly Brier. \u201cIt's incredibly frustrating. The process is definitely flawed and it's broken and there's a lot of finger pointing as to who's responsible for it but the reality, they're all responsible for it.\u201d\n\nAlso in studio on Thursday night, Nicole's grandmother suggested that the three-year-old is truly counting on Christie:\n\n\u201cHow could you look at that face and not say something?,\u201d said Joyce Brier. \u201cYou know, and she [Nicole] believes it. She sees a fan of his. She sees him on television.\u201d\n\nBefore he did \"Dirty Jobs,\" Mike Rowe sang opera and it was beautiful\n\nFor the first time in his adult life, the man that preaches a good day\u2019s work, is unemployed.\n\n\u201cYou know, it's odd,\u201d said Mike Rowe, joining \"Piers Morgan Live\" Thursday evening. \u201cBut I mean seriously it forces you to step back and go, 'okay. I've been really, really lucky \u2013 I know that.'\"\n\nAfter ten years on Discovery Channel\u2019s \"Dirty Jobs\" and serving as a commercial spokesman for Ford, Rowe has currently been under social media scrutiny for his narration in a recent Walmart commercial. He is the founder of the mikeroweWORKS Foundation, which provides scholarships in partnership with Scholarship America to fund those interested in jobs specific to a skilled trade.\n\nBut in addition to all of this, Rowe actually got his start with his voice, as opposed to his hands:\n\n\u201cYears ago in Baltimore I couldn't get into any of the unions that oversee our industry,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cBasically, it was getting into the opera. If I could fake my way to the opera, I would automatically become a part of the club and then I could sort of work my way into the industry.\u201d\n\nOn Morgan's prodding, Rowe proudly belted out a sampling, with his deep vice pulsating through the \"Piers Morgan Live\" studio. Click the above video to enjoy Rowe's vocal aptitude.\n\nThe co-writers and co-directors of \"The LEGO Movie\": We just try to make each other laugh\n\nLongtime pals and collaborators, Christopher Miller and Phil Lord joined forces to write and direct the smash-hit movie that sees the world through the eyes of what Fortune Magazine dubbed \u201cthe toy of the century\u201d: Legos.\n\nOne of the highest-grossing February releases in history, \"The Lego Movie\" is an animated family film with a cast chock full of celebrities voicing characters that range from original to true-to-the-box-set familiar:\n\n\u201cI don't know that we ever thought it was going to be this crazy popular but what we thought was, you know, it could be kind of fun,\u201d said Miller, joining Piers Morgan on Thursday.\n\nFriends since their college days at Dartmouth, Miller and Lord said they approached making \"The Lego Movie\" the same way they worked on former hits, including \"21 Jump Street\".\n\n\u201cWe tried to do things that we think are fun and interesting. We try to find something interesting to say,\u201d said Miller. \u201cAnd we don't try to talk down to kids or to make it for this focused group or this group or not. We just think it for each other and just so happens that our sense of humor is so juvenile that kids can go like it too.\u201d\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" took hundreds of people four years to make and was, said Lord, \u201cinsanely difficult.\u201d Lord and Miller worked with teams across the world to achieve the authentic feel of Lego pieces:\n\n\u201cIt was really complicated,\u201d Lord said. \u201cThe biggest trick was trying to digitally figure out how to make really tactile, homemade looking Lego bricks with scratches and dandruff and fingerprints and stuff like that, because we wanted it to feel like a movie that a kid made in his basement, a really expensive basement.\u201d\n\nHad the movie been made with actual Lego pieces, estimates place the total cost at millions of dollars worth of the plastic building bricks. But the mass success of the film may have less to do with computers, and more to do with comedy:\n\n\u201cWe just try to make each other laugh,\u201d Miller said.\n\nFor the next edition of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" watch CNN every night at 9.\n\n-\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether you fell asleep early, stayed out too late, or simply want to watch it again, we realize it's not always possible to get your entire \"Piers Morgan Live\" fix from television.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "\"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\": Thee three-year-old that questioned Chris Christie, Mike Rowe sings Opera, the Logo creators love to laugh", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/21/piers-morgan-live-rewind-thee-three-year-old-that-questioned-chris-christie-mike-rowe-sings-opera-the-logo-creators-love-to-laugh/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140220220843-pmt-mike-rowe-nicole-mariano-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Whether you fell asleep early, stayed out too late, or simply want to watch it again, we realize it's not always possible to get your entire \"Piers Morgan Live\" fix from television.", "title": "\"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\": Thee three-year-old that questioned Chris Christie, Mike Rowe sings Opera, the Logo creators love to laugh"}, "keywords": "in the chair, piers morgan live, rewind, the big story, renee wunderlich", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcac2\"", "article_summary": "-\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nSeveral hours later, three-year-old Nicole Mariano again stole hearts, joining \"Piers Morgan Live\" to discuss her family's home, which remains damaged following Hurricane Sandy.\nSeated on her mother's lap, Mariano smiled coyly at the camera as Piers Morgan sought specifics about her living situation.\nFor the next edition of \"Piers Morgan Live,\" watch CNN every night at 9.\nAs an answer to this, we offer the below labor of love \u2013 \"Piers Morgan Live, Rewind\" \u2013 dedicated and designed to getting you caught up and connected to the conversation."}
