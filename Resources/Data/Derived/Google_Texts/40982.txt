Jimmy Fallon has his own Top 10 List for fellow late-night host David Letterman.

Letterman, 66, who is known for the staple "Late Show" segment, announced his 2015 retirement from the CBS show this week and Fallon, 39, decided to bring a little humor as to why he made this decision.

"Pretty crazy news about Letterman," Fallon said on Friday's "Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon."

"I Love David Letterman obviously, I used to take the train down from college to New York City to go see him at "Late Show."

"Then I think after "Saturday Night Live," he asked me to guest host for him, when he had shingles. I think that's where I got the bug," he joked.

Fallon told the audience that he thought really hard about the reasons behind Letterman's choice to end of his longtime run as he sounded off the hilarious list.
