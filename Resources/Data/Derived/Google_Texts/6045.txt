A wanted sex offender who had been eluding capture for three years was caught in Douglas County Friday.

Toby Mohr, 39, was wanted on three charges of failure to register as a sex offender out of El Paso County. Warrants were issued in 2012, but until Friday the El Paso County Sheriff's Office says he'd successfully kept away from law enforcement.

But Friday, authorities were tipped off to Mohr's whereabouts in Douglas County. Douglas County deputies tracked him down Friday evening.

Mohr allegedly barricaded himself in a trailer when deputies tried to arrest him, but was soon taken into custody.

Mohr was booked in the El Paso County jail just before 10 Friday night.
