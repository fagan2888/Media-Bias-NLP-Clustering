Then they know who and what doesn't belong.\n\n\"So when you go out and get a good feel for what's normal, you don't have to look for what's abnormal, it jumps out at you,\" Dean said.\n\nOnly 50 of the 369 neighborhood associations in Tulsa have active citizen patrols right now, but the city wants more because police can't be everywhere all time.\n\n\"I equate a neighborhood to a patchwork quilt,\u201d Dean said. \u201cEvery neighbor paying attention is a patch in that quilt. The more patches you have, the better and the more patches you having moving around, even better.\"\n\nHe says police are just one patch in that quilt, and it takes all of us taking responsibility for our own safety to keep crime at bay.\n\nTo find out more about the Citizen Alert Patrols, the background checks and how it works, there is a meeting coming up on Feb. 25 from 6-8 p.m. at the Brookside Library, 1207 E. 45th Place.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Whether or not citizens vote to add more than 100 police officers to the streets through the Vision tax plan.
