Stone argued.\n\nHe pointed to the female terrorist in San Bernardino obtaining a K1 fianc\u00e9 visa and added, \u201cWe know that in France, one of the key operatives \u2026 also slipped seamlessly through their immigration process.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly reasonable proposal,\u201d Stone charged.\n\nBoyle also asked Roger about recent reports that Saudi Arabia\u2019s prince insulted Trump. \u201cThe Saudis bailed out George W. Bush,\u201d Stone alleged, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a Bush surrogate attacking the frontrunner\u201d because \u201che\u2019s got a horse in the race.\u201d\n\nStone also commented on recent news that an American Civil Liberties Union board member in Colorado resigned after posting on Facebook that Trump supporters should be shot before election day.\n\n\u201cThe frustration of the authoritarian left \u2026 they democratize communication in this country when they turned on the Internet,\u201d Stone mocked, saying that now the left want to regulate the Internet, adding that \u201cregulate means censor.\u201d\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] driving guys like this insane, and now they\u2019re talking about killing us\u201d to stop conservatives from taking back the country, stressed Stone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veteran political consultant Roger Stone joined Breitbart News Saturday and explained why \u201cTrump is somebody who can shake up the system.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Veteran political consultant Roger Stone joined Breitbart News Saturday and explained why \u201cTrump is somebody who can shake up the system.\u201d", "title": "Roger Stone: Donald Trump 'Can Shake Up the System' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Trump-Rally-in-Vegas-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/12/roger-stone-donald-trump-can-shake-system/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Veteran political consultant Roger Stone joined Breitbart News Saturday and explained why \u201cTrump is somebody who can shake up the system.\u201d", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Trump-Rally-in-Vegas-Getty.jpg", "title": "Roger Stone: Donald Trump 'Can Shake Up the System' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Breitbart News Saturday, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Roger Stone,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Radio,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Roger Stone", "published_time": "2015-12-12T08:26:50-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Radio"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Stone also pointed to Clinton\u2019s foreign policy, saying, \u201cShe armed ISIS.\u201d\u201cThis is the blueprint for beating her,\u201d Stone added about her foreign policy.\n\u201cTrump is obviously very strong,\u201d Stone said, arguing that Trump runs stronger with black voters, Catholics, and union workers than what former Republican nominee Mitt Romney achieved in the past election.\nBoyle also asked Roger about recent reports that Saudi Arabia\u2019s prince insulted Trump.\n\u201cDonald Trump will demolish her on that.\u201d\u201cLook at her policies all over the Middle East and explain how Donald Trump is dangerous compared to that,\u201d Stone challenged, referencing Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state and the Benghazi terror attack, Libya, and now the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group\u2019s continued growth, blaming Clinton and President Obama for the mayhem going on with ISIS.\nStone argued."}
