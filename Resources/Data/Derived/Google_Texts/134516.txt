Kansas legislators are considering a measure aimed at limiting wrongful convictions by requiring law enforcement agencies to create written policies for dealing with eyewitnesses to crimes.

Innocence Project policy advocate Michelle Feldman says eyewitness misidentification accounts for the majority of convictions overturned nationally based on DNA evidence since 1989.

The bill would create safeguards against law enforcement sending subtle clues about which suspects in lineups are thought to be the perpetrators. Witnesses would also be informed that they're not required to identify someone from the lineup.

The House Judiciary Committee and the full Senate have approved the measure, which will get further consideration when lawmakers return from a break on April 27.
