Read our full Commencement coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to apply, be accepted to, and attend Harvard. It\u2019s another to do that while writing a successful book and helping shift the public discourse around health care.\n\nThat was the demanding path of Lauren A. Taylor, who arrived at Harvard Divinity School in 2012 with a book contract and an interest in global health partnerships.\n\nTaylor\u2019s 2013 \u201cThe American Health Care Paradox: Why Spending More Is Getting Us Less,\u201d co-authored with Yale\u2019s Elizabeth H. Bradley, argues that American health outcomes could improve significantly with greater investment in social services.\n\n\u201cWe hit a zeitgeist in the public health world,\u201d said Taylor of the popular work that landed her numerous speaking engagements, including spots on MSNBC and C-SPAN. \u201cWe are standing on the shoulders of decades and decades of public health research. It was a matter of reformulating a lot of that research for a 2013\u20132014 audience who were wrestling with what the Affordable Care Act meant, and U.S. health care spending being 18 percent of GDP.\u201d\n\nA national tragedy drew Taylor toward service. On Sept. 11, 2001, her father left home in Manhasset, N.Y., for his job at the World Trade Center. He survived unharmed, but dozens of people from their Long Island community lost their lives in the terrorist attacks. \u201cI realized life can be very, very short and that I needed to figure out something to do with my life that felt meaningful.\u201d\n\nA joint degree program at Yale University allowed her to graduate in five years with a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s in public health. Work with Bradley at Yale\u2019s Global Health Leadership Institute followed. Then Taylor got stuck in academic limbo. Her interest in global health partnerships was \u201ctoo conceptual\u201d for Yale\u2019s school of public health, she was told, and \u201ctoo applied\u201d for its philosophy department.\n\nWhen friends suggested a divinity school at a big academic center, Taylor realized Harvard would be the perfect intellectual home, one that would support her varied interests. \u201cI knew I could be successful here,\u201d she said.\n\nConvinced that Harvard was the right fit, she didn\u2019t apply anywhere else. \u201cIf they\u2019d rejected me,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do \u2014 I guess collect myself and reapply.\u201d\n\nAt Harvard, success has followed. In addition to writing her book, Taylor received a $25,000 grant from the Harvard Global Health Institute to study a collaboration between Pentecostal faith healers, \u201cthe main purveyors of mental health care,\u201d and psychologists and psychiatrists in Ghana. She said her Harvard years also provided crucial insights. Being immersed in a supportive community of people who were constantly pushing her to define and defend her interests, she said, helped her to solidify them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a unique environment, having people press you on things that otherwise are considered totally out of bounds. The core sense of wanting to live a service-oriented life is really just crystal-clear for me now. I would not trade my time at Harvard Divinity School for anything.\u201d\n\nHaving found her niche, Taylor won\u2019t go far after graduation. She\u2019ll pursue her Ph.D. in health management based at Harvard Business School. She said she is looking forward to continuing to collaborate with people from across the Harvard community who are, as she is, \u201cready to change the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#99283c", "news_keywords": "Commencement 2015, Commencement 2015 Profile, Elizabeth H.
