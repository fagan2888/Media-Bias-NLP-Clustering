Nevertheless, in the almost always right Real Clear Politics polling average, Republicans are failing to pull away or trailing (see North Carolina) in several of the key races they must win to win big this fall.\n\nLook no further than my home state of Iowa, where Republicans could potentially blow two very winnable races for House and Senate because they\u2019re running on absolutely nothing other than milquetoast pabulum that makes Romney 2012 look like Winston Churchill.\n\nIn Iowa\u2019s U.S. Senate race, the tough-talking Joni Ernst, who cruised to a primary romp in a crowded field thanks to clever ads that depicted her as a gutsy military veteran and sassy farm girl, has been replaced by a demur and defensive general election candidate. In fact, if you watch television here, it appears the Koch brothers are actually running for the retiring Tom Harkin\u2019s seat instead, since they\u2019re pretty much the object of the Democratic attack machine\u2019s obsession. Despite Congressman Bruce Braley\u2019s numerous and well-publicized gaffes, not to mention the fact he\u2019s on the wrong side of every issue voters are the angriest about this year, he\u2019s currently holding a slim lead in the race after unleashing two months of relentless attack ads against Ernst.\n\nIn one of the most memorable campaign ads so far this year, Ernst promised to go to Washington and \u201ccastrate\u201d the gutless ruling class. But right now she\u2019s the one being spayed and neutered by the Braley campaign.\n\nThen there\u2019s the 3rd Congressional District race, where Iowa\u2019s version of Nancy Pelosi is threatening to claim retiring Republican Tom Latham\u2019s seat. Former Democratic state Sen. Staci \u201cI wouldn\u2019t revoke the passports of terrorists\u201d Appel, who suffered one of the worst losses by an incumbent state legislator in Iowa history in her last campaign in 2010, currently leads Republican challenger David Young. The former chief-of-staff to popular long-time Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, Young is running \u201cthe wimpiest and most meaningless ads I have seen in a long time,\u201d one veteran GOP strategist told me.\n\nHere\u2019s Young talking about how all that Iowans want is a good meal (in this case chicken strips and French fries) and good government.\n\nSince surely there must have been some trite Midwestern clich\u00e9s left over from that ad that still needed to be expressed, here\u2019s Young talking about getting Congress together at the kitchen table over a pot of coffee to fix our problems, because \u201cit\u2019s an Iowa thing.\u201d I mean, duh, why didn\u2019t we think of that?\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a statewide radio ad voiced by Grassley that talks about how Young was so inspired to be a public servant that he bought everyone in his Senate office a pair of toenail clippers as a humble reminder of who they work for. Because you have to be so servant-oriented you have to be willing to clip your constituents\u2019 ingrown toenails or something.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not kidding. If only I were. I can see it now: \u201cVote for Young and get mani-pedis as well as smaller government!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though, people can clip their own toenails. What they can\u2019t do on their own is get rid of Obamacare, secure the border, and hold a lawless and unpopular president in check. If only there were people available who could occupy influential positions that allowed them do that on our behalf. Ah, shucks, why didn\u2019t the Founding Fathers think of that?\n\nSnark aside, Braley and Appel support all of the Marxist policies currently threatening the future of the country, and the Republican candidates in my state are treating this existential threat like a student body election. Who knows? Maybe in his next television ad, Young will promise us an extra day of chocolate milk for school lunches and longer recess, while Ernst sets the record for most blah-blah-blah references to \u201cIowa values\u201d in one campaign. Dare to dream.\n\nFor liberty\u2019s sake, how about making this very simple for voters? Ernst and Young \u2014 as well as Republicans running for any office anywhere in America this year \u2014 ought to be running on the same exact message: \u201cMy Democratic opponent, brought to you by lawless President Obama and tall the people who gave you everything happening right now (Obamacare, border crisis, bad economy, Common Core, etc.) you\u2019re opposed to/angry about.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it, period. Nothing more, nothing less is needed.\n\nObama is polling underwater with the American people on virtually every meaningful policy issue. Even more worrisome for the Left is the fact that the solid majority of Americans don\u2019t consider Obama a strong leader, and by a 17-point margin in the recent ABC News poll Americans felt Obama has done more to divide rather than unite the country.\n\nThis should not be a \u201cprevent defense\u201d election. The American people (or at least the increasingly dwindling numbers of those still paying attention) seem ready and willing to pronounce harsh judgment on Obamaism. Now all they need is an opposition party that calls the question.\n\n(Steve Deace is a nationally-syndicated talk show host and also the author of the new book \u201cRules for Patriots: How Conservatives Can Win Again.\u201d You can \u201clike\u201d him on Facebook or follow him on Twitter @SteveDeaceShow.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "This should not be a \u201cprevent defense\u201d election.
