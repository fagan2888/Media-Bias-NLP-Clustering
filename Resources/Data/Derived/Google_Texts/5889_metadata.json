Medicaid could be next headache\n\nA new phase of the Obamacare launch is coming, this one involving Medicaid. And it could be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\n\nOn Nov. 1, the health law\u2019s malfunctioning enrollment system is supposed to send reams of data to states so they can begin placing thousands of people into Medicaid. But state officials say that transfer system has barely been tested and could be vulnerable to technical failures like those that have crippled the broader Obamacare sign-up process.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re flying blind on what the process is,\u201d said Kathleen Nolan, state policy head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been the capacity to do a lot of the testing. \u2026 There\u2019s a natural concern that with a major load of data to be sent all at once \u2014 there is concern that what has been tested may not be able to handle the volume.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge for state governments, and people trying to sign up for the low-income health care program could be left unsure of their coverage status.\n\n( WATCH: 7 quotes on Obamacare glitches)\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, who runs the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, on a conference call with states Tuesday did not offer a timetable for a full repair, according to Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. The date was already postponed once, from Oct. 1.\n\nNolan said some people managed to sign up on the flawed HealthCare.gov website only to be told to reach out to their local Medicaid agencies to finalize enrollment. But the local Medicaid offices can\u2019t confirm anything because the applications haven\u2019t been transferred.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting a little confused,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nA federal Medicaid spokeswoman said the Obama administration has delivered a basic snapshot of the Medicaid-eligible population to help states get a sense of the numbers so they can plan.\n\nBut that so-called flat file includes only names and addresses, not nearly the level of data state Medicaid programs need to process applications.\n\nUnder Obamacare, millions of low-income uninsured people are expected to enroll in Medicaid, which will be expanded significantly in about half the states on Jan. 1. Plus, the health law\u2019s enrollment push is expected to bring out of the woodwork people who are currently eligible but haven\u2019t already signed up for Medicaid. Early data from states running their own enrollment systems are reporting tens of thousands of new Medicaid enrollees so far this month, a potential indicator of strong interest.\n\n( WATCH: 10 things Obama wants you to know about healthcare law)\n\nStates running their own health insurance exchanges have encountered fewer problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-stop shopping experience,\u201d said Carrie Banahan, executive director of Kentucky\u2019s enrollment system, Kynect. Banahan said the state was able to integrate all of its enrollment \u2014 Medicaid and other parts of Obamacare. \u201cSince the system makes a single eligibility determination, that wasn\u2019t an issue. In states that don\u2019t have integrated eligibility systems, I can see where that could be an issue.\u201d\n\nSome Medicaid experts say the transfer may have to be delayed past Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cThey cannot afford to dump bad data on the states, and it would waste precious time,\u201d said Kip Piper, a former adviser to CMS. \u201cPerhaps they will take a more baby step on Nov. 1, allowing states to accept a small number of files and run them through their eligibility systems.\u201d\n\nDennis Smith, a conservative health care consultant who has worked on Medicaid for former President George W. Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and The Heritage Foundation, predicted delay, although he doesn\u2019t expect a flood of applications. He said states will be so concerned about the accuracy of the files after all the problems with the federal portal that there will be \u201ca lot of double-checking.\u201d He worries that further delay could leave some people without coverage on Jan. 1 because states can take up to 45 days to review applications.\n\nThere is a potential workaround. Smith noted that people can also sign up for Medicaid directly through the state. That could ease pressure on the federal enrollment system in the short run, he said.\n\nBut aside from that, state Medicaid programs can\u2019t do much to prepare for Nov. 1 other than wait for the federal government to hit the \u201con\u201d switch, said Nolan. There\u2019s no Plan B if things go awry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot the Medicaid directors can do until they get the applications,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get the applications, I\u2019m not sure what the contingency strategy is.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "State officials say the program's expansion might also be beset by technical failures.", "title": "Medicaid could be next headache", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/medicaid-could-be-the-next-headache-for-obamacare-98760.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110605_medicaid_patient_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "obamacare,medicaid,health care", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "State officials say the program's expansion might also be beset by technical failures.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9823\"", "article_summary": "Medicaid could be next headacheA new phase of the Obamacare launch is coming, this one involving Medicaid.\nBut that so-called flat file includes only names and addresses, not nearly the level of data state Medicaid programs need to process applications.\nBanahan said the state was able to integrate all of its enrollment \u2014 Medicaid and other parts of Obamacare.\nThat could ease pressure on the federal enrollment system in the short run, he said.\nUnder Obamacare, millions of low-income uninsured people are expected to enroll in Medicaid, which will be expanded significantly in about half the states on Jan. 1."}
