The Berkeley County Sheriff's Office has arrested 30-year-old Robert Washington, after they say he murdered 27-year-old Michael Vanwert.

On Thursday deputies responded to a shooting on Harriet Tubman Lane, in unincorporated Moncks corner.

There witnesses alleged that Washington had shot Vanwert and then took his body. Washington was then arrested on Saturday, and Vanwert's remains were found off of Black Tom Road near Moncks corner.

Authorities also have charged Washington's girlfriend 26-year-old Jessika Key with accessory after the fact of murder, after they say Key knew about the murder and helped Washington hide from authorities.

No motive has yet been released for the murder.

Both Washington, and Key are being held at the Hill-Finklea Detention center. Their bond hearing is set for Saturday.
