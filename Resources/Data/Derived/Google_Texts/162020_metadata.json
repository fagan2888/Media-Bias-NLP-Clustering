It is not a lifetime achievement award. Rather, we\u2019re looking for newsmakers whose actions in a given week are worth celebrating. Nominate our next Truthdigger here.\n\nThe extreme want of coverage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in even the independent, alternative press is a testament to the near-complete domination of politics and the news media by transnational corporate interests. This was made possible\u2014and we could say, was achieved\u2014by the gradual, long-standing and ongoing economic starvation of journalists, editors and publishers who do not work under the aegis of those interests. Were it not for a relatively small group of committed professionals and other concerned people, we\u2019d know even less.\n\nIf like many news readers you haven\u2019t been informed, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a hyper-secret multinational trade accord born in the darkened basement of neoliberalism. It has the full support of Democratic President Barack Obama, who, along with its other promoters, describe it as a way to \u201cmodernize\u201d the international economy. That language should give you pause. Modernization is the same advertisement U.S. Treasury leaders Bob Rubin, Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner slapped on the 1999 act that repealed Glass-Steagall, legislation from the 1930s that placed a barrier between mom-and-pop and investment banking, and for almost a century prevented a repeat of the Great Depression. \u201cModernization\u201d is code for deregulation and its full register of economic horrors, including depressed wages, high prices, lost jobs and unnecessary and increasing danger for workers and the environment, and deregulation is what the TPP is all about.\n\nFew people outside the international cabal hatching the scheme seem to know this with the force and precision of Lori Wallach. Wallach is a lawyer and the founder and director of Global Trade Watch, an arm of the U.S. public advocacy group Public Citizen that has monitored the major trends and consequences of economic globalization\u2014the driven and increasing interdependence of international markets and economies, to the conspicuous benefit of major Western corporations\u2014since 1995. For the last two decades, she has shared her expertise on the impact of international trade deals such as NAFTA and CAFTA on \u201cjobs, off-shoring, wages, the environment, public health and food safety\u201d with legislators, civil society groups, scholars, journalists and activists around the world.\n\nOver the years Wallach has appeared on nearly every major news network and been quoted extensively in leading papers. In advance of Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s appearance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Indonesia next week, where he\u2019ll affirm the American government\u2019s interest in the developing trade contract, Wallach appeared on \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d on Friday to give viewers a concise run-through on what is publicly know about the deal. \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d host Amy Goodman introduced the topic as follows:\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\n\u201cThe TPP is often referred to by critics as \u2018NAFTA on steroids\u2019 and would establish a free trade zone that would stretch from Vietnam to Chile, encompass 800 million people\u2014about a third of world trade and nearly 40 percent of the global economy. While the text of the treaty has been largely negotiated behind closed doors, more than 600 corporate advisers reportedly have access to the measure, including employees of Halliburton and Monsanto.\u201d\n\nWallach filled in the blanks: \u201c[O]ne of the most important things to understand is it\u2019s not really mainly about trade. I guess the way to think about it is as a corporate Trojan horse. The agreement has 29 chapters, and only five of them have to do with trade. The other 24 chapters either handcuff our domestic governments, limiting food safety, environmental standards, financial regulation, energy and climate policy, or establishing new powers for corporations.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are the same investor privileges that promote job offshoring to lower-wage countries. There is a ban on Buy Local procurement, so that corporations have a right to do sourcing, basically taking our tax dollars, and instead of investing them in our local economy, sending them offshore. There are new rights to, for instance, have freedom to enter other countries and take natural resources, a right for mining, a right for oil, gas, without approval.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s a whole set of very worrisome issues relating to Internet freedom. Through sort of the backdoor of the copyright chapter of TPP is a whole chunk of SOPA, the Stop Online Privacy Act, that activism around the country successfully derailed a year ago. Think about all the things that would be really hard to get into effect as a corporation in public, a lot of them rejected here and in the other 11 countries, and that is what\u2019s bundled in to the TPP. And every country would be required to change its laws domestically to meet these rules. The binding provision is, each country shall ensure the conformity of domestic laws, regulations and procedures.\u201d (Italics added.)\n\n\u201cNow, the only reason I know that level of detail is because a few texts have leaked, and I have been following the negotiations and grilling negotiators from other countries to try and find between the lines what the hell is going on; otherwise, totally secret.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cafta, capitalism, corporations, corporatism, economy, global trade watch, lori wallach, modernization, nafta, neoliberalism, public citizen, tpp, trans pacific partnership, wall street, world trade organization, wto", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "This critic of globalization is one of the few voices trying to alert the public to a secretive, ongoing effort to create a legal means for corporations to attack and subvert government.\n - 2013/10/05", "title": "Truthdigger of the Week: Lori Wallach: Alexander Reed Kelly", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/truthdigger_of_the_week_lori_wallach_20131005", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/lori_wallach_copy.png", "height": 232}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This critic of globalization is one of the few voices trying to alert the public to a secretive, ongoing effort to create a legal means for corporations to attack and subvert government.", "title": "Truthdigger of the Week: Lori Wallach | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/truthdigger_of_the_week_lori_wallach_20131005/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/lori_wallach_copy.png", "height": 232}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Truthdigger of the Week: Lori Wallach, cafta, capitalism, corporations, corporatism, economy, global trade watch, lori wallach, modernization, nafta, neoliberalism, public citizen, tpp, trans pacific partnership, wall street, world trade organization, wto", "article": {"tag": "cafta, capitalism, corporations, corporatism, economy, global trade watch, lori wallach, modernization, nafta, neoliberalism, public citizen, tpp, trans pacific partnership, wall street, world trade organization, wto", "published_time": "2013-10-05T22:43:18-08:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T05:53:20-08:00"}, "description": "This critic of globalization is one of the few voices trying to alert the public to a secretive, ongoing effort to create a legal means for corporations to attack and subvert government.\n - 2013/10/05"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a2d\"", "article_summary": "By Alexander Reed KellyEvery week the Truthdig editorial staff selects a Truthdigger of the Week, a group or person worthy of recognition for speaking truth to power, breaking the story or blowing the whistle.\nFew people outside the international cabal hatching the scheme seem to know this with the force and precision of Lori Wallach.\nOver the years Wallach has appeared on nearly every major news network and been quoted extensively in leading papers.\nRather, we\u2019re looking for newsmakers whose actions in a given week are worth celebrating.\nWere it not for a relatively small group of committed professionals and other concerned people, we\u2019d know even less."}
