A Plos Genetics-published study has concluded that dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor that got extinct some 15,000 years ago.

A group of researchers from UCLA also found that world's domestic dog breeds are more similar to each other on genetic basis than to a wolf.

One of the other things that have been uncovered through the study is that human domestication of dogs has started around 32,000 to 18,000 years ago. It is expected that this domesticated has began in Europe.

Though dogs have evolved a lot, but it shall be noted that a wolf and a dog can still mate and have their pups. The study researchers said that they have noticed certain genetic things that are common in dogs and wolves, but they said that it might be due to their occasionally interbreeding.

In order to reach at the above given result, the study researchers have carried out sequencing of genomes. For it, they have chosen two modern-day dog breeds, a basenji and the dingo. They also sequenced a golden jackal.

"We also find genetic flux, that is, interbreeding of wolves from Israel and basenji dogs (native to east Africa), and of the wolves of China and the (Australian) dingo, after that divergence", affirmed Ortega Del Vecchyo, one of the co-authors of the study.
