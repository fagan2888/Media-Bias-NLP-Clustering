Langhorne\n\nThe message is front and center in candidate Misty Hart\u2019s yard signs, social media, endorsements, campaign literature, vehicle decals and frequently in her own words.\n\nHart, who is running for Evansville city clerk in the May 5 Democratic primary election, sells herself as an \u201cOperation Iraqi Enduring Freedom veteran.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Hart served in Iraq or Afghanistan, the primary theater of Operation Enduring Freedom. It\u2019s not mentioned in her campaign material, but Hart acknowledged last week that she never left Indiana during a nearly four-month stint supporting overseas-bound military police and medical personnel of the Indiana Air National Guard\u2019s 181st Fighter Wing. She was a member of the 181st, a reserve component of the Air Force.\n\nFrom February until June 2003, Hart said, she worked from the unit\u2019s base in Terre Haute, Ind., \u201cto help them get their equipment, help them get their gear together, help in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s where she gets into trouble with C. Larry Rhodes, a Newburgh, Ind., resident who said he saw combat in the Vietnam War as an airborne ranger in the Indiana Army National Guard.\n\nRhodes said he appreciated the service of military personnel who supported U.S. soldiers in Vietnam from stateside posts and they are unquestionably veterans \u2014 but if one of them called himself a \u201cVietnam War veteran,\u201d there would be a problem.\n\n\u201cNumber one, they weren\u2019t subjected to enemy fire. They did not have to suffer through the environment, the heat, the bad living conditions, the hostile population at times, the separation of family being deployed at 10,000 miles away versus maybe being in the United States,\u201d Rhodes said.\n\nRhodes, a military support activist who works with local veterans, spent two weeks in Iraq in 2006 producing a television documentary about Evansville-area soldiers there. He said there is tremendous sensitivity among veterans who served overseas about claims of war veteran status by those who served stateside.\n\n\u201cShe never set foot on foreign soil,\u201d Rhodes said of Hart.\n\nHart declined to make available her DD Form 214, a U.S. Defense Department-issued document that verifies veterans\u2019 duty assignments. Hart said her DD214 contains too much personal information, including her Social Security number. The Vanderburgh County Recorder\u2019s Office, where the document is on file, declined to release it on the grounds that it is not a public record. Many veterans and records repositories argue that the Privacy Act of 1974 limits access to a veteran\u2019s DD214 to the veteran himself or his legal guardian.\n\nDebate\n\nHart\u2019s campaign did say in a January news release announcing her candidacy that she worked \u201cfor support of Operation Iraqi Enduring Freedom,\u201d but it did not indicate whether she was overseas. Last week, she drew a distinction about her service, which she said ended with an honorable discharge as a staff sergeant in 2006.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said I was a combat veteran. A combat veteran is completely different. A combat veteran is the one that\u2019s actually on the front line, going overseas,\u201d she said. \u201cA veteran\u2019s a veteran, no matter if you\u2019re combat or if you\u2019re stateside in support. We\u2019re all on the same mission.\u201d\n\nDon Montgomery, an Evansville resident who said he served as a vehicle driver for convoy operations in Iraq in 2005 and 2006, does not agree.\n\nMontgomery, who served with the Indiana Army National Guard\u2019s 163rd Field Artillery, said it is misleading for reserve soldiers who played stateside support roles to claim the status of war veteran.\n\n\u201cBeing stateside, I don\u2019t believe \u2018Iraqi/Enduring Freedom veteran\u2019 terminology is correct,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing the phrase, \u2018Iraqi or Enduring Freedom veteran,\u2019 automatically assumes that they were deployed overseas.\u201d\n\nHart, a 32-year-old West Side resident, is the daughter of City Councilman Al Lindsey and a deputy in the Vanderburgh County Treasurer\u2019s Office. A photograph of her wearing her Indiana Air National Guard uniform appears prominently in her campaign literature. Her signs proclaim, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget ... Let\u2019s elect a vet!\u201d\n\nHart\u2019s opponent in next month\u2019s Democratic primary, incumbent Clerk Laura Brown Windhorst, claims no military service. Windhorst declined to comment on Hart.\n\nThere is some support for Hart\u2019s view in the military community.\n\nLucas Worthington, an Evansville resident who was part of a 163rd security force training Iraqi police, said military service is military service regardless of deployment.\n\n\u201cRegardless of in what capacity anybody serves the military in, I strongly believe that whether they go to Iraq, they go to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, they go to guard the border \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d Worthington said. \u201cNinety-eight percent of the population don\u2019t make that decision (to serve). I don\u2019t base anybody\u2019s military service or career on what they accomplished in the military or whether they deployed or not. They still had the guts and the courage to just raise their right hand and say, \u2018I\u2019m willing to\u2019 \u2014 so to me it doesn\u2019t matter what (Hart) claims she did or claims she didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nMaster Sgt. Darin Hubble, Fort Wayne-based spokesman for the Indiana Air National Guard, said any service member who supports a war effort is a veteran of that war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very wired world these days, and much of the horsepower of the Air National Guard is brain power, not necessarily dropping thousand-pound bombs,\u201d Hubble said. \u201cIt comes down to precision type of exercise of engineering and computer support \u2014 everything that they can think of that makes it possible, people somewhere are doing and not all those things have to be done from a very sandy location.\u201d\n\nAt times Hart has claimed to be a veteran of the Air Force. Hubble said those claims are legitimate.\n\n\u201cJust like someone who\u2019s in the Army National Guard is part of the Army, someone who\u2019s part of the Air National Guard is part of the Air Force,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018M. Hart\u2019\n\nOn a separate front, Hart is accused by political opponents of trying to perpetrate a deception on voters \u2014 a charge she denies.\n\nAt her own request, her name will appear on next month\u2019s Democratic primary ballot as \u201cM. Hart\u201d -- a designation that state election law allows.\n\nBut Windhorst\u2019s supporters call it an obvious ploy to deceive primary voters into thinking they are voting for longtime Pigeon Township Trustee Mary Hart, vice chairman of the Vanderburgh County Democratic Party and Misty Hart\u2019s campaign chairman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one more of the silly games that they play,\u201d said Coroner Annie Groves, a Windhorst supporter whose mother, Mary Ann Eickhoff, is on Pigeon Township\u2019s advisory board.\n\nIn her news release, Misty Hart called Mary Hart a \u201cDemocrat party icon\u201d and a lifelong friend. The two women are not related.\n\nMisty Hart said she asked to appear on the ballot as \u201cM. Hart\u201d because her campaign committee advised her to do it. She said she didn\u2019t ask why.\n\n\u201cI went and took the advice of people that are older than me that know more about this stuff than I do, and we\u2019ll see where it takes us,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked whether she inquired why she would want to present herself to voters as M. Hart, Hart said she has faith in her campaign committee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really question stuff that\u2019s not a big deal to me. As long as my last name\u2019s on that ballot, that\u2019s the only thing I really care about, is that people vote for it, so either way,\u201d she said.\n\nHart rejected the idea that voters casting ballots for \u201cM. Hart\u201d may think they are voting for Mary Hart.\n\n\u201cI could have put, \u2018Misty Hart,\u2019 and they still would have voted for me, knowing it wasn\u2019t Mary Hart,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Hart said the \u201cM. Hart\u201d designation was indeed strategic \u2014 but not as a ruse to make primary voters think they are voting for her and not Misty Hart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so she\u2019s at the top of the ballot,\u201d Mary Hart said, noting that Misty Hart\u2019s name will appear above Windhorst\u2019s that way.\n\n\u201cAs her campaign chairman, I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s best for her,\u201d Mary Hart said.\n\nBut County Clerk Debbie Stucki, the county\u2019s chief elections officer, was baffled by that explanation. Misty Hart\u2019s name would appear above Windhorst\u2019s anyway, Stucki said, because her last name comes before Windhorst\u2019s in the alphabet.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Candidate's claims of war veteran status questioned", "og": {"url": "http://www.courierpress.com/news/candidates-claims-of-war-veteran-status-questioned-ep-1055093596-325488161.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/mistyhart_1430009130316_17331327_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "The message is front and center in candidate Misty Hart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yard signs, social media, endorsements, campaign literature, vehicle decals and frequently in her own words.
