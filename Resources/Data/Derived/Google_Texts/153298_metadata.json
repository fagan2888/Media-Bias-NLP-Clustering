(Photo: BOB BIELK/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)Buy Photo\n\nTwo South Jersey doctors have launched a website that allows consumers to shop for surgery the same way they now shop for airplane tickets.\n\nTruprice.healthcare is designed to bring transparency and competition to an industry that has little of either in a bid to lower costs and improve care, Dr. Mark Gantner and Dr. Raymond Weiand said.\n\n\u201cThe confusion (that comes from a medical invoice) goes away because what we\u2019re trying to do is provide to the consumer one price with no surprises,\u201d Weiand said.\n\nThe website is in its early stages. So far, it has prices for more than 30 procedures from about a dozen doctors \u2013 orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists and ophthalmologists \u2013 in Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties.\n\nIts web address is unusual; the doctors took advantage of changes in 2014 that allowed companies to purchase domain names other than .com.\n\nIts target is employers who self-insure their workers and consumers whose insurance plans have high deductibles and strict doctor networks. Instead of going online to buy, say, an airline ticket along with a hotel room and rental car, consumers can put in their cart an arthroscopic knee surgery, a diagnostic image and a few physical therapy sessions.\n\nTruprice.healthcare comes to the market as consumer advocates call on the health care industry to shed more light on the price of its services.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, requires most Americans to be covered by health insurance. And some of the policies carry with them high out-of-pocket costs. But consumers rarely know what they \u2013 or their insurance company \u2013 are paying until after they\u2019ve been treated.\n\nNew Jersey gets an \u2018F\u2019\n\nStates have made little progress requiring that prices be disclosed, according to the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute and Catalyst for Payment Reform, two research groups that advocate for more transparency.\n\nIn the groups\u2019 2015 Report Card on State Price Transparency Laws, New Jersey was one of 45 states given an F.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a functional market without having information on cost and quality that\u2019s available to all stakeholders,\u201d said Francois de Brantes, executive director of the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, based in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cHealth care is the only industry to date where people thought it was OK that only the health plan \u2013 who isn\u2019t in many ways the ultimate buyer \u2013 would know what the specific price is for any service for which they negotiated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no one can get an overall price estimate for an entire episode for illness or treatment.\u201d\n\nGantner, 48, of Toms River, is an anesthesiologist. Weiand, 57, of Egg Harbor is an orthopedic surgeon. Like many doctors, they often commiserated. Their expenses were rising. Their reimbursements were flat. Their patients were saddled with big out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nTo top it off, no one knew what anything cost.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s insanity\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to going onto a car lot and the salesman says, \u2018Listen, pick any car you want, we\u2019ll send you the bill in 30 days. No returns, by the way,\u2019 \u201d Gantner said. \u201cAnd so you walk around, you have no idea what the price is, you get in a nice car you like and then you get a bill and go, \u2018Whoa!\u2019 That\u2019s our health care system. It\u2019s insanity.\u201d\n\nThey came up with an idea: Create a website where patients can research the cost of the service and the quality of the doctor \u2013 and purchase the service upfront. Consumers or their employers would pay a fee to Truprice that is factored into the price.\n\nThey hired a development company from Denver, Colorado, to build the site. They approached doctors to provide price information. And they financed the startup out of their own pockets.\n\nThe idea applies free-market rules used by nearly every other industry. But it\u2019s not a slam-dunk. Consumers historically have paid a premium to their insurance companies and not given a second thought about the cost of a doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nAfter Obamacare, that\u2019s changing. Consumers pay more for their own care and need to consider whether to get treatment and where to go. But only rarely do they get the price beforehand.\n\nGantner and Weiand envision a site \u2013 first focusing on southern New Jersey and eventually nationwide \u2013 that lays it out like the TV game show \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal.\u201d You can get arthroscopic knee surgery for $4,200 here or you can see how it plays out through your insurance plan.\n\n\u201cThe industry needs a model where providers are competing on quality and price because that, in the end, is what\u2019s going to improve health care and lower costs for the consumer,\u201d Gantner said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LlQWiX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Two South Jersey doctors have started Truprice.healthcare to help people shop for medical treatment.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Two South Jersey doctors have started Truprice.healthcare to help people shop for medical treatment.", "title": "No medical mystery: Website shows doctor prices", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/money/business/consumer/2015/08/19/truprice-healthcare-medical-prices/32032585/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two South Jersey doctors have started Truprice.healthcare to help people shop for medical treatment.", "title": "No medical mystery: Website shows doctor prices", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50b6f52575971d25bf5d6e40094f7741623dd4a7/c=436-0-2064-1628&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/19/AsburyPark/B9318236216Z.1_20150819222641_000_GMMBJD3P0.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Truprice, truprice.healthcare, doctor, prices, costs, medical"}, "article_summary": "Its target is employers who self-insure their workers and consumers whose insurance plans have high deductibles and strict doctor networks.\nTruprice.healthcare comes to the market as consumer advocates call on the health care industry to shed more light on the price of its services.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, requires most Americans to be covered by health insurance.\nBuy Photo The home page of Truprice.healthcare, a website that lets patients see the price of health services before they get them.\n(Photo: BOB BIELK/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)Buy PhotoTwo South Jersey doctors have launched a website that allows consumers to shop for surgery the same way they now shop for airplane tickets."}
