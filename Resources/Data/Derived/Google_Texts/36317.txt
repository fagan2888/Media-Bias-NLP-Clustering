“Common sense tells you the decision to believe someone depends on prior experiences with them. Translation, given Benghazi and that despicable video, and you can keep your healthcare plan and your doctor, and there’s not a smidgen of corruption in the IRS, and Bowe Bergdahl served with honor and distinction. Do I need to keep going? But I want to believe the president. This is just too important, not only for us, but for our children and our grandchildren. There are two sides to every deal. How do we know if we can trust the other side? How do we know if we can trust Iran? But I guess that I don’t have to worry because our president has us covered” she stated.

Pirro added, “the Iranians tried to keep their underground fortress, Fordo, a secret from us and the rest of the world when they were building it. And assuming that inspectors can even find evidence of noncompliance, the resolution process would take so long, who knows what the Iranians would accomplish in that time? And why are the common folk in Iran jumping up and down? If it’s such a great deal for them, why do I feel like it may not be such a great deal for us? Why do the optics look wrong? Why aren’t we dancing in the streets celebrating? I do want to believe the president, but there are those who say this is simply a bad deal.”
