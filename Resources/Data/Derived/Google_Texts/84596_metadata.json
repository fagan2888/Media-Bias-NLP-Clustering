Ted Cruz had already secured the majority of delegates from Colorado ahead of Saturday's state GOP convention. Seventeen of the delegates were formally pledged to him. Four others were placed in his tally but could change their vote in Cleveland.\n\nWith this confidence, Cruz addressed the convention Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Here\u2019s the story the national media's not reporting,\" Cruz told convention goers. \"In two weeks, in ten elections in a row, we have beaten Donald Trump. Soon we can say 11.\"\n\nCruz repeated his oft repeated slam on Trump by saying anyone can print \"Make America Great Again\" on a hat, but a leader needs to back up lofty phrases with action.\n\nIn addition to the press and Donald Trump, Cruz had a message for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Hillary wants to move back into 1600 Pennsylvania Av. I have different government housing in mind.\" @tedcruz #cogop pic.twitter.com/mLgEeOi9Z3 \u2014 David Jesse (@davidsjesse) April 9, 2016\n\nAnother snapshot from the convention reveals just how Cruz-friendly the crowd was.\n\nCrowd erupts as @tedcruz wraps up.
