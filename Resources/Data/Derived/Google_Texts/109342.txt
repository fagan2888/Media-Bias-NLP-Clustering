Kevin Spacey, the lead actor in Netflix’s drama about politics in the nation’s capital, House of Cards, appeared on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday to discuss the show and Hollywood’s discovery of the dramas unfolding in Washington D.C. During that interview, the host asked Spacey if President Barack Obama admires the “ruthlessly efficient” character he plays in that television show.

“Is Washington more exciting than Hollywood?” Stephanopoulos asked.

“For me, it’s like performance art,” Spacey said. He added the storylines on his program are not “that crazy” when compared to the average story broadcast on the evening news.

“It does seem that even President Obama has a little bit of Frank Underwood envy — the ruthlessly efficient Frank Underwood,” the host observed.

“I can imagine why he would,” Spacey said. The actor added that he thinks it must be interesting for the American public to view what a “very effective Congress” looks like. “I can imagine he must feel, gosh, I wish we could move that quickly,” Spacey observed.

The actor made Stephanopoulos laugh when he said that he hears from viewers that they believe most of the show is accurate, with the possible exception that “you could never get an education bill passed that fast.”
