That dynamo has a wheel that touches the back tire, and as the stationary bike moves, the wheel turns a magnet inside a coil. The energy is then transferred to the toaster.\n\nBefore the Olympic track cyclist began, the crew was told that as soon as F\u00f6rstemann stopped peddling the toast would pop up. F\u00f6rstemann mounted the bike and peddled faster and faster, steadily gaining resistance as time passed. His pants grew coarser and his face looked agitated.\n\nThen he stopped and the toast sprang out.\n\nHe was able to make the toast, but only after peddling as hard as he could. F\u00f6rstemann needed to lie down after he finished, grunting as he did.\n\n\u201cMy legs hurt,\u201d F\u00f6rstemann says in the video. He is referring to his 29-inch quads.\n\nUltimately, though, he wasn\u2019t able to generate all that much energy. He only managed to generate 0,021kWh. It took one Robert to toast the bread. According to the results, it would take 180 Roberts to power a car and 43,000 Roberts to power an airplane. These are numbers that might make those of us who aren\u2019t in Olympic shape wallow in shame.\n\nEven F\u00f6rstemann was surprised with how hard it would be: \u201cNobody can believe how much work to toast it. I know it now. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "olympic, cyclist, robert, forstemann, tries, power, toaster, using, his, legs, can, he, do, it", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Olympic track cyclist generated as much energy as he could to power a toaster for a graduation project.", "title": "Watch Olympic Cyclist Robert F\u00f6rstemann Try To Power A Toaster [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/olympic-cyclist-robert-forstemann-tries-power-toaster-using-his-legs-can-he-do-it-336768", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/05/olympic-cyclist-robert-forstemann-tries-power-toaster-using-his-legs-can-he-do-it.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Olympic track cyclist generated as much energy as he could to power a toaster for a graduation project.", "title": "Watch Olympic Cyclist Robert F\u00f6rstemann Try To Power A Toaster [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/olympic-cyclist-robert-forstemann-tries-power-toaster-using-his-legs-can-he-do-it-336768", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/05/olympic-cyclist-robert-forstemann-tries-power-toaster-using-his-legs-can-he-do-it.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/05/olympic-cyclist-robert-forstemann-tries-power-toaster-using-his-legs-can-he-do-it.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-05T15:39:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T15:53:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Olympic track cyclist generated as much energy as he could to power a toaster for a graduation project."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd62e5\"", "article_summary": "Before the Olympic track cyclist began, the crew was told that as soon as F\u00f6rstemann stopped peddling the toast would pop up.\nAccording to the results, it would take 180 Roberts to power a car and 43,000 Roberts to power an airplane.\nFor a graduation project at the Stockholm Academy of the Dramatic Arts, student Nathan Grossman enlisted 2012 Olympic bronze medalist Robert F\u00f6rstemann to see whether he could generate enough power to toast bread in a 700-watt toaster.\nThe energy is transferred using a bicycle dynamo that acts as a generator.\nEven F\u00f6rstemann was surprised with how hard it would be: \u201cNobody can believe how much work to toast it."}
