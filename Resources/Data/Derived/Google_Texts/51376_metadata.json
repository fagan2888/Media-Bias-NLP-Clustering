Similarly, the data regarding health insurance coverage showed that last year the number of uninsured Americans dropped by 8.8 million.\n\nRelated: Welfare programs shown to reduce poverty in America\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the percentage of people without health insurance for the entire calendar year was 10.4%, or 33 million people, lower than the rate, 13.3%, and the number of uninsured, 41.8 million, in 2013,\u201d Victoria Velkoff, chief of the social, economic and housing statistics division at the bureau, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe decrease in the uninsured rate was 2.9%, or 8.8 million people.\u201d\n\nAmericans with full-time jobs were the least likely to be uninsured.\n\n\u201cThis is dramatic proof that the Affordable Care Act is a stunning success,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA. \u201cThe historic decrease in the number of uninsured Americans is unmistakably attributable to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cThe numbers show that the greatest gains were among moderate-income families, communities of color and young people \u2013 the precise groups that most needed help in gaining health insurance. According to the report, households with incomes below $25,000 a year saw their rate of coverage increase by 4.3%, and households between $25,000 and $49,999 saw an increase of 5%. Hispanics, black people and Asians increased coverage rates by about 4%. And the rate of uninsured between ages 26 to 34 went down by 5.5%.\u201d\n\nDespite those gains, 16.6% of Americans living in households with an annual income of less than $25,000 had no health insurance coverage last year.\n\n\u201cLow-wage workplaces typically do not offer health insurance,\u201d said Arline Geronimus, professor of health behavior and health education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.\n\nHealth care costs incurred by the low-income Americans can actually force them into poverty or keep them there.\n\nThe supplemental poverty measure (SPM) report released on Wednesday looks at the effectiveness of various elements in alleviating poverty as well as effects of various other expenses. In 2014, the SPM was 15.3% \u2013 that\u2019s equivalent to more than 48 million Americans living in poverty.\n\nThe SPM report found that last year social security benefits reduced SPM by 8.2%, tax credits reduced it by 3.1% and food stamps reduced it by 1.5%. Out-of-pocket expenses, however, increased the SPM by 3.5%. Each percentage point is equivalent to more than 3 million Americans.\n\n\u201cIn the US system, we all have out-of-pocket expenses for medical care: co-pays, deductibles, etc. This is true even for folks with strong health insurance,\u201d explained Geronimus.\n\nCheaper health plans \u2013 those that might be more affordable to low-income Americans \u2013 often have higher co-pays and deductibles.\n\nGeronimus was not surprised that out of pocket medical expenses were presented by the US Census bureau as one of the biggest ticket items to increase poverty rate.\n\n\u201cNot only is health care very expensive in the US, but the poor are in worse health and the uninsured are more likely to use expensive forms of healthcare \u2013 like emergency rooms,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, the same co-pays or deductibles would be a larger share of their income.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The number of uninsured Americans decreased by 8.8 million in 2014, according to poverty measure data released by the US Census bureau", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The number of uninsured Americans decreased by 8.8 million in 2014, according to poverty measure data released by the US Census bureau", "title": "Census data shows Obamacare and welfare kept millions out of poverty", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/17/census-data-obamacare-welfare-poverty", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9/0_158_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=dddeca76b2bc6c5d1bef8b72e82547d8", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/17/census-data-obamacare-welfare-poverty?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/17/census-data-obamacare-welfare-poverty", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/17/census-data-obamacare-welfare-poverty?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@kasperka", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9/0_158_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/sep/17/census-data-obamacare-welfare-poverty?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US income inequality,Poverty,US politics,Barack Obama,Health insurance,US news,Money", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-09-17T11:30:08.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jana-kasperkevic", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:29:19.000Z", "tag": "US income inequality,Poverty,US politics,Barack Obama,Health insurance,US news,Money"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e56117a38f01fbd094540f19d141d7eeec2b9ae9/0_158_3000_1800/3000.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=d9b41a37410e966b0b2e508238e60209", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US income inequality,Poverty,US politics,Barack Obama,Health insurance,US news,Money"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0d6\"", "article_summary": "Similarly, the data regarding health insurance coverage showed that last year the number of uninsured Americans dropped by 8.8 million.\n\u201cLow-wage workplaces typically do not offer health insurance,\u201d said Arline Geronimus, professor of health behavior and health education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.\n\u201cThe decrease in the uninsured rate was 2.9%, or 8.8 million people.\u201dAmericans with full-time jobs were the least likely to be uninsured.\nGeronimus was not surprised that out of pocket medical expenses were presented by the US Census bureau as one of the biggest ticket items to increase poverty rate.\n\u201cThe historic decrease in the number of uninsured Americans is unmistakably attributable to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation."}
