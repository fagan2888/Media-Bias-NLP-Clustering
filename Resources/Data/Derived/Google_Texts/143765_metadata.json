Ron Johnson, found more than half a million people received the funds in the form of advanced premium tax credits, which the Internal Revenue Service and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have no viable plan to recover.\n\nCurrently, the agency is using a \u201cpay and chase\u201d model where a portion of the premium is paid before the enrollee is verified, followed by the IRS chasing after the payment when the enrollee is deemed ineligible.\n\nThe committee\u2019s findings said agencies did not coordinate on a plan to retrieve the funds.\n\n\u201cEven though the IRS ultimately assumed responsibility for the recoupment process, it still lacks an effective plan,\u201d the report reads. \u201cInstead, the IRS plans to rely on tax forms that do not solicit the information required to identify or recoup improperly awarded credits.\u201d\n\nAccording to Johnson, the plan the agency developed is \u201cineffective and insufficient.\u201d\n\nCMS said individuals\u2019 failure to provide the necessary documentation does not necessarily mean they are not eligible for the credits.\n\n\u201cLack of verification does not mean an individual is ineligible for financial assistance, but only that a Marketplace did not receive sufficient information to verify eligibility in the time period outlined in the law,\u201d CMS spokesman Aaron Albright told Fox News.\n\nThe Senate committee\u2019s findings fall in line with a Government Accountability Office report released in July showing 11 out of 12 times federal investigators provided fraudulent documents, they were accepted by the federal health care exchange and provided subsides.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
