Although the dog was humanely euthanized at a local veterinary clinic due to its symptoms, the four people involved, including the dog\u2019s owner, two veterinary technicians, and a \u201cclose contact\u201d of the dog\u2019s owner, received adequate treatment and made full recoveries.\n\n\u201cAlthough human plague is rare in North America, it remains a public health concern in the western United States where Y. pestis circulates among wild rodent populations,\u201d CDC researchers concluded in their research. \u201cThe risk for plague can be minimized by avoidance of possibly infected rodents (e.g., prairie dogs) and their fleas.\u201d\n\nBack in June 2014, a middle-aged man with no history of major illnesses developed a fever and cough that worsened significantly over the next 24 hours. After doctors diagnosed the man with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics that had no effect on his condition, blood tests taken by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment revealed Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes the plague. An investigation led by Tri-County Health Department discovered the man\u2019s 2-year-old pit bull was the root of the outbreak.\n\nWhile the first human-to-human transmission of the plague since 1924 is certainly an interesting case, researchers confirm that the United States does not have to express concern over a Middle Ages-styled \u201cBlack Death\u201d breaking out. The researchers are still trying to determine if the fourth patient involved in the outbreak, a close contact of the dog\u2019s owner, transmitted the plague by being around the dog\u2019s dead body or by being around the owner through his initial symptoms.\n\n\u201cAll suspected or confirmed plague cases and rodent die-offs in areas where plague is endemic should be reported immediately to public health officials so that exposures can be minimized to prevent additional transmission,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cOnce plague is suspected, appropriate precautions and treatment should be initiated immediately, and clinical specimens should be collected and tested as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC, the pneumonic plague can be spread from person to person by breathing in aerosolized bacteria. It can also be spread via inhaling Y. pestis that is suspended in respiratory droplets from a person or animal with the pneumonic plague. Initial signs of the plague include fever, headache, weakness, and fast-acting pneumonia. Pneumonia tends to progress two to four days and, left untreated, can result in respiratory failure and the patient\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cEarly recognition of plague, especially the pneumonic form, is critical to effective clinical management and a timely public health response,\u201d the research team added. \u201cVeterinarians should consider plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs, in areas where plague is endemic.\u201d\n\nSource: Miller L, House J, Runfola J, et al.
