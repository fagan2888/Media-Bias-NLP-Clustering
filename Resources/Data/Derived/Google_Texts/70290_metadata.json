Buckley, News\n\nAccording to the Republican contenders for the presidency who \u201cdebated\u201d on CNBC Wednesday night, America\u2019s problems today are caused by \u201cthe mainstream media,\u201d which is \u201cthe ultimate super PAC\u201d for the Democrats.\n\nThis charge is nothing new. Since the 1950s, Movement Conservatives have fought the fair examination of their ideas. They embrace a worldview in which a few wealthy men control the economy and dominate society. This idea repels most Americans. When voters can see it clearly, they oppose it. Movement Conservatives have gained power only by obfuscating reality. They make war on the media because it sheds daylight on their machinations. Transparency threatens their power.\n\nIn 1951, a young William F. Buckley, Jr. began the war on the American media. He joined big businessmen in hating the New Deal consensus that called for government regulation and social welfare measures to protect workers. Surely, government bureaucrats should not tell society\u2019s leaders how to run their businesses. Such such an intrusion undermined God\u2019s organization of a proper society, one with a few select leaders on top. In \u201cGod and Man at Yale,\u201d Buckley railed that secular New Dealers were destroying America. The principles of religion and a free market economy were non-negotiable, he insisted. Unfortunately, when given fair access to facts, Americans chose secular ideas and business regulation. The only way to return Christianity and individualism to dominance in American society was to inculcate those values in followers. He showed how to do this in the book itself: he misrepresented his opponents, he cherry-picked quotations to make them sound damning, he posed as a persecuted victim.\n\nWhen voters elected Republican Dwight Eisenhower president in the following year on a platform he called the \u201cMiddle Way,\u201d big-business Republicans were horrified that the heresies of government regulation had infected their own party. They insisted government regulation was communism, and it was destroying the country. Trying to undercut the president, they attacked media that supported Eisenhower, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, Time, and Life, as communist rags.\n\nIn 1954, Buckley and his brother-in-law L. Brent Bozell attacked the American media itself. In \u201cMcCarthy and His Enemies,\u201d they divided the nation into two factions. There were a few, true Americans\u2014people like them\u2014who stood for American values. They called this tiny faction \u201cConservatives.\u201d These Conservatives stood against the \u201cLiberals\u201d\u2014the vast majority of Americans who accepted the idea of government regulation\u2013who were forcing communism and secularism on America. These Liberals, they claimed, were winning politically because they had taken over college campuses, the government and the national media. To combat the \u201cliberal media\u201d Buckley launched the National Review in 1955, promising to return America to its true principles.\n\nMovement Conservatives jumped on the idea that a cabal of liberals in the media was undermining their political success. Their worldview was correct, dictated by God even, so that anyone who disagreed must either be evil or misled. The only way to explain Goldwater\u2019s disastrous loss in 1964 was that a liberal media \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d had sabotaged him.\n\nThe Nixon administration took this idea a step further to explain away its own disasters. Increasingly embattled by anti-war protesters, Nixon\u2019s men insisted that their policies were popular, but a hostile popular press was misleading the public. In November 1969, Vice President Spiro Agnew railed against the eastern elites who controlled major media networks. The following year, he uttered speechwriter William Safire\u2019s famous dictum that anti-Nixon reporters were simply the \u201cnattering nabobs of negativism\u201d and made a thinly veiled threat that if reporters didn\u2019t back off, the administration would start to regulate them. Nixon\u2019s hatred of the press became so consuming that he created the \u201cPlumbers\u201d investigations unit to stop leaks. The Washington Post\u2019s continued gnawing at the Watergate scandal made Nixon\u2019s hatred of the press complete. When he resigned, he blamed his downfall not on the criminal activities in his own White House, but rather on the \u201cleaks and accusations and innuendo\u201d published by the liberal media.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The real story behind CNBC debate, and Fox News' very existence, comes down to the right's fear of being exposed", "title": "GOP hates the media because they are liars: The damning, evil history of the right\u2019s war on a free press", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The real story behind CNBC debate, and Fox News' very existence, comes down to the right's fear of being exposed", "title": "GOP hates the media because they are liars: The damning, evil history of the right\u2019s war on a free press", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/01/gop_hates_the_media_because_they_are_liars_the_damning_evil_history_of_the_rights_war_on_a_free_press/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/spiro_agnew_nabobs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The real story behind CNBC debate, and Fox News' very existence, comes down to the right's fear of being exposed", "title": "GOP hates the media because they are liars: The damning, evil history of the right\u2019s war on a free press", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/spiro_agnew_nabobs.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Cox Richardson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, cnbc debate, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Media Criticism, Ted Cruz, William F.
