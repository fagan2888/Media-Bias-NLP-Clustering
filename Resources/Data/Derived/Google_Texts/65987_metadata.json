Let me find an instance and paste. Okay, here\u2019s one:\n\nI remember back in the Reagan \u201980s, when little places like my [hometown of] Ann Arbor, Mich., were declaring themselves \u201cnuclear-free zones.\u201d I used to think, \u201cYeah, but the American nuclear deterrent protects you regardless.\u201d I also thought, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be kind of cool if places like Ann Arbor could actually exempt themselves?

Ain\u2019t it grand?\u201d\n\nKevin asks us to imagine if Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi had said something like the following, during the debate over the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cMany of our reforms will be controversial, slow to succeed, and fraught with uncertainty, and some may fail. The difficulty will come not because we were ill prepared or [because] we did not work hard, but rather because health care is complex, and reform is an imprecise process about which the experts as yet know little.\u201d\n\nI have a pretty good imagination, I think, but I can\u2019t stretch it that far.\n\nThis passage, from Kevin, made my heart sing:\n\n[Steve Jobs] did not feel the need to dedicate his life to charity because he believed that his contribution to making the world a better place was Apple\u2019s products and the business itself. He did give away a great deal of money, but that was as a matter of course \u2014 it was clear that rather than \u201cgiving something back\u201d out of his profits, he saw his profits as evidence of how much he had given.\n\nA thousand times yes. Why can\u2019t people understand this? Why can\u2019t businessmen themselves understand it?\n\nI expressed some of this frustration years ago, in 2004, when I was reporting from the winter conclave in Davos. See what you think:\n\n[Carly Fiorina] is CEO of Hewlett Packard, and she speaks in crisp, clear English. It is almost completely devoid of international-conference-speak, which is refreshing. She is like a cool glass of verbal water. But what is the content of that water? She says that \u201cthe fundamental objective\u201d of her company \u2014 the fundamental objective, mind you! \u2014 is not \u201cto make money\u201d but \u201cto do good,\u201d \u201cto be a good international citizen.\u201d When she says \u201cmake money,\u201d she makes it sound so dirty. She borrows the old Quaker business about not just doing well but doing good. Fine and dandy, of course, but I find myself wishing \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 that businessmen would be a little less defensive and more self-confident. They have nothing to apologize for. Does Hewlett Packard want to do good? Then let it invent and manufacture products that people need \u2014 or want, or that make their lives better \u2014 and sell them at affordable prices. That is doing good. I hate to be more pro-Hewlett Packard than the CEO of Hewlett Packard, but . . . I tell you, I would wet my pants with joy if one of these people, at one of these conferences, said, \u201cYou know? People like Henry Ford and Bill Gates have done more for humanity than any thousand soi-disant benefactors-of-humanity put together.\u201d\n\nAmen. (Oops, that\u2019s not for me to say.) Just to be clear, I admire Carly Fiorina, and I dearly wanted her to win her Senate race in 2010. That\u2019s when I kind of \u201cgave up,\u201d I think, on California: We put up Fiorina and Meg Whitman, and the public wanted retreads from the New Left (which is now elderly): Barbara Boxer and Jerry Brown. What can you do?\n\nIt comes as no surprise, says Kevin, that\n\npoliticians and those who prefer to do their business through political processes back away from discussing the facts on the ground and retreat into arguments from morality. \u201cNever mind what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d the argument goes; \u201cthis is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nYes, indeed. This is what we have heard, essentially, from Democrats in the wake of Obamacare\u2019s rollout. What does it matter if the program actually \u201cworks,\u201d you know? Do you hate the black and the poor and the wretched uninsured?\n\nLet me quote a congressman, James Clyburn: \u201cIf we were to look at what we were attempting to do with the Affordable Health Care Act, you will know that what we\u2019re trying to do is change a values system in our country.\u201d\n\nYes \u2014 give him points for candor, I say.\n\nKevin quotes Daniel Cloud, who wrote, \u201cClassical civilization as a whole died a very long and gruesome physical death once there was no longer any place you could sail to if you wanted to get away from Caesar.\u201d I thought of Ted Cruz \u2014 of his dad, actually.\n\nTed has said a thousand times, on the stump and off, \u201cMy dad always told me, \u2018When we had to leave Cuba, we had someplace to go to, someplace to flee to \u2014 America. But if we lose our freedom here, where would we go?\u2019\u201d America is the last hill, it seems. (Till the next one?)\n\nI heard Ted say this for many years before he ran for office. It is not a campaign line, but very much part of his mental makeup.\n\nKevin tells us that the word \u201cczar\u201d came from \u201cCaesar.\u201d Never knew that (though it seems obvious).\n\nThe things Kevin knows! More than once I\u2019ve said to him, \u201cHow in the world did you know that?\u201d or \u201cHow in the world did you know all that?\u201d Usually, he just smiles.\n\nKevin refers to \u201cthe wisdom of the three great Johns\u201d: Locke, Mill, and Milton. I will try to think of them that way from now on (and we could name many more great Johns \u2014 beginning with the Biblical ones).\n\nI\u2019m not sure I entirely buy the following, but I mainly buy it, and I love the sentence:\n\nLeaving people to make their own decisions under their own standards means you get T. S. Eliot and Larry Flynt, while putting politics in charge means you get the National Endowment for the Arts and People\u2019s Daily . . . and the guillotine.\n\nKevin makes much of the idea of exiting \u2014 the importance of Exit. You have to be able to leave something, especially a corrupt, stifling, or tyrannical system. I got to thinking that the main problem with illiberal societies is No Exit. (\u201cNo Exit,\u201d as you well know, is the English title we give to Sartre\u2019s play Huis clos.)\n\nThe worst regimes don\u2019t allow their citizens to leave. These people have to remain slaves forever. They can\u2019t even vote with their feet, by absenting themselves from the country. They can\u2019t even take a pathetic raft, with maybe some tires underneath it. Think of the Cubans, gunned down in the water, within sight of the shore. This is \u2014 to reach for \u201cthe strongest of all epithets,\u201d as Norman Podhoretz says \u2014 evil.\n\nSpeaking of evil, I once decided not to buy products from China, after reading one too many stories about slave labor. Political prisoners are made to work in laogai, the Chinese gulag. My resolve lasted about two days. The rain melted it away. It was raining in New York, and I needed to buy an umbrella. I went to several stores, getting soaked. There wasn\u2019t a single umbrella not made in the PRC.\n\nI know that international trade has done a world of good for the average Chinese person. I understand this full well, and I rejoice in it. But I wish there were a way for us to know whether a particular product is slave-labor or not.\n\n(I once interviewed a former political prisoner who was made to do two things, between bouts of torture: assemble Christmas lights and sew Homer Simpson bedroom slippers. You put your foot into Homer\u2019s mouth.)\n\nWhy do I bring this up? Oh, yes: Kevin has some words about boycotting, and very interesting they are, too.\n\nYou remember the Chick-fil-A controversy, I trust. The people who run this fast-food chain oppose gay marriage. Therefore, some people thought that Chick-fil-A should die (in a nutshell).\n\nKevin writes, \u201cThe mayors of Chicago, Boston, and San Francisco all threatened to use their official powers to impede Chick-fil-A\u2019s business operations in their cities.\u201d He then says, \u201cThere were many who opposed Chick-fil-A\u2019s position and supported gay marriage who nonetheless thought this improper.\u201d\n\nReally? I\u2019m glad to hear it. There are \u201cmany\u201d of them? I just seem never to meet them.\n\n(Incidentally, if I decided to boycott companies that are run and staffed by people who support gay marriage, I\u2019d be seriously SOL. Might have to go around wearing a barrel \u2014 if I could find a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d barrel-maker. Which he would be, right?)\n\nI could go on and on, and already have, I\u2019m afraid. Do you think three parts is enough? And this third installment has been longish.\n\nBottom line, it is simply a joy to be with Kevin Williamson \u2014 the mind and the spirit. Reading his book, The End Is Near and It\u2019s Going to Be Awesome, is the next best thing to hanging with the man himself.

But if we lose our freedom here, where would we go?\u2019\u201d America is the last hill, it seems. (Till the next one?)\n\nI heard Ted say this for many years before he ran for office. It is not a campaign line, but very much part of his mental makeup.\n\nKevin tells us that the word \u201cczar\u201d came from \u201cCaesar.\u201d Never knew that (though it seems obvious).\n\nThe things Kevin knows! More than once I\u2019ve said to him, \u201cHow in the world did you know that?\u201d or \u201cHow in the world did you know all that?\u201d Usually, he just smiles.\n\nKevin refers to \u201cthe wisdom of the three great Johns\u201d: Locke, Mill, and Milton. I will try to think of them that way from now on (and we could name many more great Johns \u2014 beginning with the Biblical ones).\n\nI\u2019m not sure I entirely buy the following, but I mainly buy it, and I love the sentence:\n\n\nLeaving people to make their own decisions under their own standards means you get T. S. Eliot and Larry Flynt, while putting politics in charge means you get the National Endowment for the Arts and People\u2019s Daily . . . and the guillotine.\n\n\n#ad#Kevin makes much of the idea of exiting \u2014 the importance of Exit. You have to be able to leave something, especially a corrupt, stifling, or tyrannical system. I got to thinking that the main problem with illiberal societies is No Exit. (\u201cNo Exit,\u201d as you well know, is the English title we give to Sartre\u2019s play Huis clos.)\n\nThe worst regimes don\u2019t allow their citizens to leave. These people have to remain slaves forever. They can\u2019t even vote with their feet, by absenting themselves from the country. They can\u2019t even take a pathetic raft, with maybe some tires underneath it. Think of the Cubans, gunned down in the water, within sight of the shore. This is \u2014 to reach for \u201cthe strongest of all epithets,\u201d as Norman Podhoretz says \u2014 evil.\n\nSpeaking of evil, I once decided not to buy products from China, after reading one too many stories about slave labor. Political prisoners are made to work in laogai, the Chinese gulag. My resolve lasted about two days. The rain melted it away. It was raining in New York, and I needed to buy an umbrella. I went to several stores, getting soaked. There wasn\u2019t a single umbrella not made in the PRC.\n\nI know that international trade has done a world of good for the average Chinese person. I understand this full well, and I rejoice in it. But I wish there were a way for us to know whether a particular product is slave-labor or not.\n\n(I once interviewed a former political prisoner who was made to do two things, between bouts of torture: assemble Christmas lights and sew Homer Simpson bedroom slippers. You put your foot into Homer\u2019s mouth.)\n\nWhy do I bring this up? Oh, yes: Kevin has some words about boycotting, and very interesting they are, too.\n\nYou remember the Chick-fil-A controversy, I trust. The people who run this fast-food chain oppose gay marriage. Therefore, some people thought that Chick-fil-A should die (in a nutshell).\n\nKevin writes, \u201cThe mayors of Chicago, Boston, and San Francisco all threatened to use their official powers to impede Chick-fil-A\u2019s business operations in their cities.\u201d He then says, \u201cThere were many who opposed Chick-fil-A\u2019s position and supported gay marriage who nonetheless thought this improper.\u201d\n\nReally? I\u2019m glad to hear it. There are \u201cmany\u201d of them? I just seem never to meet them.\n\n(Incidentally, if I decided to boycott companies that are run and staffed by people who support gay marriage, I\u2019d be seriously SOL. Might have to go around wearing a barrel \u2014 if I could find a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d barrel-maker. Which he would be, right?)\n\nI could go on and on, and already have, I\u2019m afraid. Do you think three parts is enough? And this third installment has been longish.\n\nBottom line, it is simply a joy to be with Kevin Williamson \u2014 the mind and the spirit. Reading his book, The End Is Near and It\u2019s Going to Be Awesome, is the next best thing to hanging with the man himself.

Williamson\u2019s new book, The End Is Near and It\u2019s Going to Be Awesome: How Going Broke Will Leave America Richer, Happier, and More Secure. (Available here.) For the first two parts of this series, go here and here. We conclude today.\n\nThere is a PBS slogan, or was: \u201cIf PBS doesn\u2019t do it, who will?\u201d Kevin suggests, \u201cIf the Pentagon doesn\u2019t do it, who will?\u201d That is \u201ca fair question,\u201d he says. Privatizing the U.S. military would be problematic.\n\nDiscoursing on the subject \u201cWhat Government Is For,\u201d Kevin says,\n\n\nIt would be impractical (and ugly) to try to fence off all of a city\u2019s sidewalks and charge a dime at a turnstile for their use . . . Likewise, we cannot really exclude somebody from the protection of a missile-defense system . . .\n\n\nI have been talking about something for a long time, and writing about it. Let me find an instance and paste. Okay, here\u2019s one:\n\n\nI remember back in the Reagan \u201980s, when little places like my [hometown of] Ann Arbor, Mich., were declaring themselves \u201cnuclear-free zones.\u201d I used to think, \u201cYeah, but the American nuclear deterrent protects you regardless.\u201d I also thought, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be kind of cool if places like Ann Arbor could actually exempt themselves? If there could be precise holes in the nuclear umbrella? Maybe Dr. Teller could set his mind to it?\u201d\n\n\nBut, as I went on to say, \u201cthe American serviceman, the American nuclear deterrent, and all the rest protect Noam Chomsky and your Betsy Ross-like great-aunt, regardless. Ain\u2019t it grand?\u201d\n\nKevin asks us to imagine if Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi had said something like the following, during the debate over the Affordable Care Act:\n\n#ad#\u201cMany of our reforms will be controversial, slow to succeed, and fraught with uncertainty, and some may fail. The difficulty will come not because we were ill prepared or [because] we did not work hard, but rather because health care is complex, and reform is an imprecise process about which the experts as yet know little.\u201d\n\nI have a pretty good imagination, I think, but I can\u2019t stretch it that far.\n\nThis passage, from Kevin, made my heart sing:\n\n\n[Steve Jobs] did not feel the need to dedicate his life to charity because he believed that his contribution to making the world a better place was Apple\u2019s products and the business itself. He did give away a great deal of money, but that was as a matter of course \u2014 it was clear that rather than \u201cgiving something back\u201d out of his profits, he saw his profits as evidence of how much he had given.\n\n\nA thousand times yes. Why can\u2019t people understand this? Why can\u2019t businessmen themselves understand it?\n\nI expressed some of this frustration years ago, in 2004, when I was reporting from the winter conclave in Davos. See what you think:\n\n\n[Carly Fiorina] is CEO of Hewlett Packard, and she speaks in crisp, clear English. It is almost completely devoid of international-conference-speak, which is refreshing. She is like a cool glass of verbal water.\n\nBut what is the content of that water? She says that \u201cthe fundamental objective\u201d of her company \u2014 the fundamental objective, mind you! \u2014 is not \u201cto make money\u201d but \u201cto do good,\u201d \u201cto be a good international citizen.\u201d When she says \u201cmake money,\u201d she makes it sound so dirty. She borrows the old Quaker business about not just doing well but doing good.\n\nFine and dandy, of course, but I find myself wishing \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 that businessmen would be a little less defensive and more self-confident. They have nothing to apologize for. Does Hewlett Packard want to do good? Then let it invent and manufacture products that people need \u2014 or want, or that make their lives better \u2014 and sell them at affordable prices. That is doing good.\n\nI hate to be more pro-Hewlett Packard than the CEO of Hewlett Packard, but . . . I tell you, I would wet my pants with joy if one of these people, at one of these conferences, said, \u201cYou know? People like Henry Ford and Bill Gates have done more for humanity than any thousand soi-disant benefactors-of-humanity put together.\u201d\n\n\nAmen. (Oops, that\u2019s not for me to say.) Just to be clear, I admire Carly Fiorina, and I dearly wanted her to win her Senate race in 2010. That\u2019s when I kind of \u201cgave up,\u201d I think, on California: We put up Fiorina and Meg Whitman, and the public wanted retreads from the New Left (which is now elderly): Barbara Boxer and Jerry Brown. What can you do?\n\nIt comes as no surprise, says Kevin, that\n\n\npoliticians and those who prefer to do their business through political processes back away from discussing the facts on the ground and retreat into arguments from morality. \u201cNever mind what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d the argument goes; \u201cthis is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\nYes, indeed. This is what we have heard, essentially, from Democrats in the wake of Obamacare\u2019s rollout. What does it matter if the program actually \u201cworks,\u201d you know? Do you hate the black and the poor and the wretched uninsured?\n\nLet me quote a congressman, James Clyburn: \u201cIf we were to look at what we were attempting to do with the Affordable Health Care Act, you will know that what we\u2019re trying to do is change a values system in our country.\u201d\n\nYes \u2014 give him points for candor, I say.\n\n#page#Kevin quotes Daniel Cloud, who wrote, \u201cClassical civilization as a whole died a very long and gruesome physical death once there was no longer any place you could sail to if you wanted to get away from Caesar.\u201d I thought of Ted Cruz \u2014 of his dad, actually.\n\nTed has said a thousand times, on the stump and off, \u201cMy dad always told me, \u2018When we had to leave Cuba, we had someplace to go to, someplace to flee to \u2014 America.
