Starting this year, women in Oregon can get hormonal contraceptives directly from a pharmacy\u2014no doctor's prescription required. The New York Times provides the details:\n\nThese birth control methods \u2014 which include pills, patches and rings \u2014 will still require prescriptions (so they are not technically over the counter), but now pharmacists who complete the Oregon training protocol can issue those prescriptions directly. At the pharmacy, women must complete a 20-question self-assessment so that pharmacists can determine which hormonal methods might be appropriate and safe. About 200 pharmacists in Oregon have completed the training so far and an aide to the bill\u2019s sponsor said that most of the major chain pharmacies, including Rite Aid, Costco and Walgreens, have signed agreements to train a significant number of pharmacists. ....Under the Affordable Care Act, all prescription birth control is covered by insurance. The only possible additional cost is a one-time or annual fee of $25 or so for the assessment services provided by the pharmacist. It is possible that insurers will cover that fee, but that is yet to be determined.\n\nGood for Oregon. Making contraceptives more easily available leads to more consistent use, which in turn makes them more effective. Every state should do this.\n\nAnd California, which is also a pretty cool state, is following suit later this year. Unlike Oregon, which requires a doctor to write the first prescription for women under 18, California's law has no age restriction at all. In the contest for coolness, California will soon be taking the lead.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/01/oregon-no-doctor-needed-birth-control-prescriptions", "type": "article", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "In Oregon, no doctor needed for birth control prescriptions"}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/01/oregon-no-doctor-needed-birth-control-prescriptions", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "title": "In Oregon, no doctor needed for birth control prescriptions", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "Unlike Oregon, which requires a doctor to write the first prescription for women under 18, California's law has no age restriction at all.\nThe New York Times provides the details:These birth control methods \u2014 which include pills, patches and rings \u2014 will still require prescriptions (so they are not technically over the counter), but now pharmacists who complete the Oregon training protocol can issue those prescriptions directly.\nStarting this year, women in Oregon can get hormonal contraceptives directly from a pharmacy\u2014no doctor's prescription required.\nThe temporary appearance of the Bundy clan notwithstanding, Oregon is a pretty cool state.\n....Under the Affordable Care Act, all prescription birth control is covered by insurance."}
