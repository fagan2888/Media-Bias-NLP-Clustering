In particular, DOJ has increased both civil and criminal investigations into the billing and providing of therapy minutes. At least five FCA cases involving therapy minutes settled in the millions in 2014 and 2015, and at least two of those cases settled for over $30 million each. The magnitude and increased frequency of these settlements implies there are almost certainly many still-confidential investigations being conducted country-wide, and DOJ\u2019s recent intervention in the whistleblower case against ManorCare confirms DOJ remains ready and willing to litigate these cases.\n\nWhile particular allegations vary on the margins, DOJ\u2019s scrutiny of therapy practices is common at its core. Practices DOJ has questioned include:\n\n\u2022 Presumptive placement of patients at maximally-reimbursable reimbursement levels (ultrahigh RUG rates);\n\n\n\n\u2022 High numbers of patients being placed at maximally-reimbursable reimbursement levels;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Minutes billed at and not above minimum to meet reimbursement levels;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Minutes seemingly billed in intervals instead of precise billing;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Billing for more minutes than actually provided;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Billing initial evaluation sessions as therapy minutes;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Selection of assessment reference dates that maximize reimbursement;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Billing unskilled services as skilled services;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Billing group therapy as individual therapy;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Non-qualified individuals planning or providing therapy minutes;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Deviations from patient plans of care to hit minimum minutes for different therapy disciplines;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Rewarding employees or contractors in ways that may seem to incentivize excessive provision or billing of therapy minutes;\n\n\n\n\u2022 Documentation deficiencies; and,\n\n\n\n\u2022 Deficient medical directorship arrangements.\n\nDOJ has contended these practices result in the submission of false claims to the government for reimbursement, resulting in FCA liability and health care fraud.\n\nManorCare Inc.\n\nDOJ recently intervened in three FCA whistleblower suits against ManorCare and filed a consolidated complaint. In the pleading, DOJ contends that ManorCare directed its administrators and therapists to deliver excess care to reach ultrahigh reimbursement levels that were unwarranted and caused the government to reimburse the company above the amount to which it was lawfully entitled. ManorCare allegedly set unrealistic billing goals for its facilities, threatened to terminate those who did not cooperate, and retained patients in their facilities after the proper time for discharge, all in order to increase reimbursement payments.\n\nSignificant Recent Settlements\n\nWhile the allegations against ManorCare are pending, other therapy providers have entered into major settlements rather than litigate and risk significant penalties.\n\nExtendicare \u2014 $38 million\n\nThe government alleged that nursing services provided were deficient and the provider billed Medicare and Medicaid for medically unreasonable and unnecessary rehabilitation therapy services. The government also contended that Extendicare increased therapy particularly during assessment reference periods so it could bill Medicare at the highest possible reimbursement rate.\n\nRehabCare and Rehab Systems of Missouri \u2014 $30 million\n\nThe government claimed that RehabCare paid Rehab Systems of Missouri $400,000 to $600,000 in exchange for referrals for rehabilitation services, and that RehabCare allowed Rehab Systems of Missouri to retain a percentage of the revenue generated by each referral.\n\nArchCare \u2014 $3.5 million; Episcopal Ministries to the Aging \u2013 $1.3 million; Life Care Services and ParkVista \u2013 3.75 million\n\nIn each of these cases, the government alleged these providers had engaged in a variety of questionable practices, including that they failed to prevent RehabCare from presumptively placing patients at highest reimbursement levels, providing the minimum minutes needed to hit reimbursement levels, discouraging the billing of minutes beyond the threshold for reimbursement levels, and providing unnecessary therapy to increase reimbursement. In the Life Care case, the government also contended that RehabCare was improperly paid a percentage of revenue generated and that Life Care Services unlawfully received the free services of a RehabCare employee.\n\nNot Without Warning\n\nThe increased government activity in this arena has not arrived without warning. In the last few years, the OIG has issued at least two reports questioning the billing practices of Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs). A 2012 OIG report found that a fourth of all SNF claims submitted in 2009, amounting to $1.5 billion, were incorrect. A 2010 OIG report observed that, from 2006 to 2008, SNFs increasingly billed at more expensive levels of care, for-profit SNFs were far more likely than nonprofit or government SNFs to bill for expensive levels of care, and that a number of SNFs had questionable billing practices including abnormally high billings in relation to other SNFs.\n\nAn Ounce of Prevention\u2026\n\nDOJ\u2019s constant pursuit of therapy companies demonstrates its commitment to curtail this perceived area of potential fraud and abuse. To avoid DOJ\u2019s target, companies should routinely audit therapy minutes, provider utilization, incentives that could be viewed as unlawful kickbacks, and medical necessity. In addition, skilled facilities that have contracted with therapy companies should undertake the same review to avoid allegations of collusion or conspiracy. And if you discover outliers or other red flags (e.g., billing only at ultra-high RUG rates), investigate and determine the cause. If you question a practice, relationship or system, addressing it immediately and making an assessment of whether disclosure is mandatory will save you the expense and resource allocation of a lawsuit in the future.
