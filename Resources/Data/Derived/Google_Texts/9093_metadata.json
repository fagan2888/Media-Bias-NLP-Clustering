To RSVP, go to https://www.hillaryclinton.com/events and search for \u201cCedar Rapids.\u201d\n\nIn her hourlong town hall meeting at NewBo City Market, Clinton warned that if a Republican is elected president the Affordable Care Act would be repealed and women would pay more for health care than men pay and Planned Parenthood would lose its federal funding.\n\nAnother of those stark differences, Clinton said is that she supports marriage equality, civil rights, workers\u2019 rights, voting rights and a woman\u2019s right to choose. Republicans are \u201cagainst any kind of rights as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nResponding to a young woman who asked if there would be more job openings for women in sports under a Clinton administration, she said that the fastest way to increase middle class incomes would be to raise the minimum wage and make sure women get equal pay for the work they do.\n\nEarlier Monday in Davenport, Clinton warned President Barack Obama\u2019s impending executive actions to tighten controls on guns and other executive actions could be swept away if a Republican becomes the next president. The president\u2019s actions to fight climate change also could be in danger.\n\n\u201cThey could be undone the first day by a Republican president,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton also promised to keep America \u201csafer and strong\u201d by conducting an air campaign in partnership with Arabs and Kurds to retake territory controlled by ISIS.\n\n\u201cThat is work that must be done by the Iraqis and the Syrians themselves. I am against sending American combat troops,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThat\u2019s the most important issues for Barb Perkinson of Marion, who was sandwiched into the back row of the crowd along with her granddaughter and great-granddaughter.\n\n\u201cNot losing any more young fathers and sons in foreign wars\u201d is Perkinson\u2019s top priority, who also is interested in electing the first woman president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the deciding factor, but I don\u2019t hear anyone saying that electing a woman doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the 77-year-old grandmother said about her conversations with women in her circle of friends. She believes Clinton has the experience in government and in foreign affairs to do the job \u201cdespite the criticisms the president faces.\u201d\n\nGranddaughter Jessica Stiers, 30, also of Marion, said electing a female president \u201cis huge to me because it would change things and we need change.\u201d\n\nStiers doesn\u2019t talk politics frequently, but based on conversations with female friends in her age group, \u201cthe female factor plays a big role.\u201d\n\nHer daughter, Anabelle, 9, said it would be \u201ccool to have a woman as president.\u201d\n\nClinton also revealed a New Year\u2019s resolution when asked about Donald Trump\u2019s claim she and Obama created ISIS.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve adopted a New Year\u2019s resolution,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can live in his alternative reality and I\u2019m not going to respond", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CEDAR RAPIDS - Iowans are the nation's 'first line of defense against Republicans and their poorly thought-out policies that would set us back and rip awa", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - Iowans are the nation's 'first line of defense against Republicans and their poorly thought-out policies that would set us back and rip away our progress,' Democrat Hillary Clinton said in Cedar Rapids Monday.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/democratic-presidential/clinton-calls-iowans-first-line-of-defense-against-gop-during-visit-to-newbo-20160104", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160104/ARTICLE/160109867/AR/0/AR-160109867.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/democratic-presidential/clinton-calls-iowans-first-line-of-defense-against-gop-during-visit-to-newbo-20160104", "title": "Clinton calls Iowans 'first line of defense' against GOP during visit to NewBo", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - Iowans are the nation's 'first line of defense against Republicans and their poorly thought-out policies that would set us back and rip away our progress,' Democrat Hillary Clinton said in Cedar Rapids Monday.", "site": "@gazettedotcom"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"title": "Clinton calls Iowans 'first line of defense' against GOP during visit to NewBo", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2016-01-04T18:48:48-05:00", "modDate": "2016-01-04T18:48:00-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Her campaign also announced that former President Bill Clinton will visit the National Czech & Slovak at 12:45 p.m. Thursday.\n\u201cNot losing any more young fathers and sons in foreign wars\u201d is Perkinson\u2019s top priority, who also is interested in electing the first woman president.\n\u201cThey could be undone the first day by a Republican president,\u201d she said.\nAnother of those stark differences, Clinton said is that she supports marriage equality, civil rights, workers\u2019 rights, voting rights and a woman\u2019s right to choose.\nCEDAR RAPIDS \u2014 Iowans are the nation\u2019s \u201cfirst line of defense against Republicans and their poorly thought-out policies that would set us back and rip away our progress,\u201d Democrat Hillary Clinton said in Cedar Rapids Monday."}
