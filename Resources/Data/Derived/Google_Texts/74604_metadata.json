Horowitz said that between 2004 and 2009, the FBI tripled its use of bulk collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows government agents to compel businesses to turn over records and documents, and increasingly scooped up records of Americans who had no ties to official terrorism investigations.\n\nThe FBI did finally come up with procedures to try to minimize the information it was gathering on nontargets, but it took far too long, Mr. Horowitz said in the 77-page report, which comes just as Congress is trying to decide whether to extend, rewrite or entirely nix Section 215.\n\nPHOTOS: Bang for your buck: Best handguns under $500\n\nBackers say the Patriot Act powers are critical and must be kept intact, particularly with the spread of the threat from terrorists. But opponents have doubted the efficacy of Section 215, particularly when it\u2019s used to justify bulk data collection such as in the case of the National Security Agency\u2019s phone metadata program, revealed in leaks from former government contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nThe new report adds ammunition to those opponents, with the inspector general concluding that no major cases have been broken by use of the Patriot Act\u2019s records-snooping provisions.\n\n\u201cThe agents we interviewed did not identify any major case developments that resulted from use of the records obtained in response to Section 215 orders,\u201d the inspector general concluded \u2014 though he said agents did view the material they gathered as \u201cvaluable\u201d in developing other leads or corroborating information.\n\nPHOTOS: 21 best guns for home protection\n\nThe report said agents bumped their number of bulk-data requests under Section 215 from seven in 2004 to 21 in 2009 as a result of technological advances and legislative changes that the intelligence community believed expanded the reach of the law.\n\nIncreasingly, that meant scooping up information on those who weren\u2019t targets of a terrorism investigation, Mr. Horowitz said. He said that while Section 215 authority allows the government to do that, the FBI needed more checks to make sure it was using the power properly.\n\n\u201cWhile the expanded scope of these requests can be important uses of Section 215 authority, we believe these expanded uses require continued significant oversight,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe report was an update to a previous study done in 2008 that urged the department to figure out ways to minimize the amount of data it was gathering on ordinary Americans even as it was targeting terrorists.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s report Mr. Horowitz said the administration finally came up with procedures \u2014 five years later. He said it never should have taken that long but that he considers that issue solved.\n\nThe report was heavily redacted, and key details were deleted. The entire chart showing the number of Section 215 requests made from 2007 through 2009 was blacked out, as was the breakdown of what types of investigations they stemmed from: counterintelligence, counterterrorism, cyber or foreign intelligence investigations.\n\nSection 215 of the Patriot Act is slated to expire at the end of this month. The House, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, passed a bill to renew it but also to limit it so the government could no longer do bulk collection such as the NSA phone data program. That legislation is known as the USA Freedom Act.\n\nBut Senate Republican leaders have balked, insisting the NSA program and Section 215 should be kept intact as is.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is leading the fight to protect the NSA program, is counting on his opponents not being able to muster the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, leaving them with the choice of either extending Section 215 or seeing all of the powers expire \u2014 including those that would go after specific terrorist suspects. Mr. McConnell believes that, faced with that choice, enough of his colleagues will vote to extend all of the powers.\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey asked Congress this week to make sure Section 215 and two other parts of the Patriot Act, also slated to expire at the end of the month, are preserved. Those other powers include the ability to target lone wolf actors and to switch wiretaps if suspects switch their phones.\n\nAs for Section 215, Mr. Comey said Congress should at least preserve the power to go after individuals\u2019 records.\n\n\u201cIf we lose that authority, which I don\u2019t think is controversial with folks, that is a big problem,\u201d he said Wednesday at a forum at the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nBut most of the Section 215 debate has revolved around bulk collection. Earlier this month a federal appeals court ruled that the Patriot Act does not envision the kind of phone program the NSA has been running, which gathers and stores five years\u2019 worth of records of the numbers, dates and durations of calls made in the U.S.\n\nFor anti-bulk surveillance advocates, Thursday\u2019s report further undermines Section 215.\n\n\u201cThis report adds to the mounting evidence that Section 215 has done little to protect Americans and should be put to rest,\u201d said American Civil Liberties Union Staff Attorney Alex Abdo.\n\nBulk data collection creates false leads, ties up investigative resources and, essentially, undermines national security, said Stephen Kohn, an attorney at Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, LLP and advocate for government whistleblowers. Also, increased FBI dependency on that bulk data collection indicates that the agency is lacking the appropriate resources for conducting successful counterterrorism operations, Mr. Kohn said.\n\n\u201cThey have a large amount of agents who are working counterterrorism that have no human resources, no leads, no infiltrations, so they have nothing else to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, when they staffed up and made [counterterrorism] a major priority, these agents need to do something. And they\u2019re doing what they know to do, and that\u2019s electronic surveillance.\u201d\n\nBut former FBI agents said opponents wanted to callously cripple one of the government\u2019s investigative agencies by depriving it of a critical data collection tool at a time of new terror threats.\n\n\u201cISIS is singing a siren song, calling people to their death to crash on the rocks \u2014 and it\u2019s the rocks that ISIS will take credit for,\u201d said Ron Hosko, president of Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund and former assistant director of the FBI. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for those who are disaffected, disconnected and willing to commit murder. So if we\u2019re willing to take away tools, OK, congressman, stand behind it [and] take the credit for putting the FBI in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FBI agents can't point to any major terrorism cases they've cracked thanks to the key snooping powers in the Patriot Act, the Justice Department's inspector general said in a report Thursday that could complicate efforts to keep key parts of the law operating.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "FBI agents can\u2019t point to any major terrorism cases they\u2019ve cracked thanks to the key snooping powers in the Patriot Act, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general said in a report Thursday that could complicate efforts to keep key parts of the law operating.", "title": "FBI admits Patriot Act snooping powers didn\u2019t crack any major terrorism cases", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/fbi-admits-patriot-act-snooping-powers-didnt-crack/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/Comey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/Comey.jpg", "description": "FBI agents can't point to any major terrorism cases they've cracked thanks to the key snooping powers in the Patriot Act, the Justice Department's inspector general said in a report Thursday that coul", "card": "summary", "title": "FBI admits Patriot Act snooping powers didn\u2019t crack any major te"}, "Author": "Maggie Ybarra", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, Michael E Horowitz, Congress"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Bang for your buck: Best handguns under $500Backers say the Patriot Act powers are critical and must be kept intact, particularly with the spread of the threat from terrorists.\nAs for Section 215, Mr. Comey said Congress should at least preserve the power to go after individuals\u2019 records.\nSection 215 of the Patriot Act is slated to expire at the end of this month.\nIn Thursday\u2019s report Mr. Horowitz said the administration finally came up with procedures \u2014 five years later.\nFBI agents can\u2019t point to any major terrorism cases they\u2019ve cracked thanks to the key snooping powers in the Patriot Act, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general said in a report Thursday that could complicate efforts to keep key parts of the law operating."}
