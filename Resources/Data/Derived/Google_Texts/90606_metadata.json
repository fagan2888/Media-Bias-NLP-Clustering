If you really break down the details in Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic plan, you\u2019ll see that there are several key areas women entrepreneurs should be excited about.\n\nHere are a few:\n\n1. Major tax relief for small businesses and the middle class.\n\nClinton promises to rebuild a healthy middle class and help small businesses. She wants to close the loopholes that are being used by the wealthy. She wants to require that earners of more than $1 million pay a 30 percent tax rate (following the Buffet Rule).\n\nThe middle class will not see any tax increases (ie, the people making less than $250,000 a year). She hopes to be the \u201csmall business president\u201d by reducing federal, state and local compliance costs. She wants to provide tax relief and cut the red tape in order to allow growth.\n\nIt\u2019s important we reduce taxes on small businesses, as they help our communities thrive.\n\n2. Encourages women to enter the workforce.\n\nClinton knows the barriers women with families face when they enter the workforce. This lack of childcare and maternity leave makes it harder for women to break the glass ceiling.\n\nWe can\u2019t be the most powerful country in the world if we don\u2019t support one of the most significant groups in our country. Hilary\u2019s Expanded Childcare Plan would make preschool more accessible for low-income families, as well as guarantee up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.\n\nAs a businesswoman, I see the imperative need for these plans. I believe we need more strong female business leaders and owners. This plan would encourage more women to continue pursuing their careers, even after they have families.\n\n3. A brighter future for students.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing millions of American students graduate from college with an average of $28,950 in student loan debt and no promised future. When we hinder our future generation, we all pay for the consequences.\n\nCollege graduates are struggling to pay off their student loans. In turn, they\u2019re unable to invest in their futures.\n\nHilary plans to reward four-year public colleges and universities if they prevent students from taking out loans. They will also receive a portion of $175 billion in grants if they agree to end budget cuts, decrease tuition and increase spending on higher education.\n\nInvesting in our future generation will give us great economic gains.\n\n4. Expanded employment opportunities.\n\nHilary is a huge advocate of expanding employment opportunities. Her goal is to create well-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, as well as scientific and medical research.\n\nShe would provide \u201cincentives for corporations that invest in employees, and strip tax benefits from companies that move jobs overseas.\u201d Her aggressive plan will increase the minimum wage and improve benefits for workers, all while giving companies an incentive to share their profits with their employees.\n\nThere\u2019s no more time to waste when it comes to building up the workforce.\n\n5. Lowered health care costs.\n\nAs I grew up on welfare, I understand the struggles many Americans face. Health care is expensive, and even with Obamacare, a decent health plan still costs a lot of money. By lowering health care costs, we\u2019d give every American the chance to have a quality health care plan.\n\nThese people would finally be able to receive the treatment and medication they need at a fair price. We\u2019re one of the richest nations in the world, and we still have such huge health care inequalities. Improved health care plans will facilitate a thriving nation.\n\nOf course, as November draws near, it\u2019s important every woman does her research in order to understand where each candidate stands. Understand their goals before you cast your vote.\n\nOur nation needs more informed and empowered women. Let\u2019s exercise our rights.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's economic plan will get more women entrepreneurs in the workforce in a lot of surprising ways.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "description": "She knows how it can be.", "title": "5 Ways Women Will Be The First To Benefit From Hillary's Economic Plan", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2016/04/13133514/elite-daily-hillary-clinton-rex.jpg", "url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/5-ways-women-will-first-benefit-hillarys-economic-plan/1483217/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Elite Daily", "description": "She knows how it can be.", "title": "5 Ways Women Will Be The First To Benefit From Hillary\u2019s Economic Plan", "image": {"src": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2016/04/13133514/elite-daily-hillary-clinton-rex.jpg"}, "creator": "@JennyQTa9", "site": "@EliteDaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/5-ways-women-will-first-benefit-hillarys-economic-plan/1483217/"}, "ios": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/5-ways-women-will-first-benefit-hillarys-economic-plan/1483217/", "app_store_id": 1032458504, "app_name": "Elite Daily"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 378366428966386}, "keywords": "entrepreneurs, feminism, hillary, president, economic policies", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily", "section": "News", "tag": "hillary clinton", "published_time": "2016-05-06T15:56:05+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.elitestatic.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/apple_favicon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "entrepreneurs, feminism,  hillary,  president,  economic policies"}, "article_summary": "By lowering health care costs, we\u2019d give every American the chance to have a quality health care plan.\nHealth care is expensive, and even with Obamacare, a decent health plan still costs a lot of money.\nWe\u2019re one of the richest nations in the world, and we still have such huge health care inequalities.\nIf you really break down the details in Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic plan, you\u2019ll see that there are several key areas women entrepreneurs should be excited about.\nImproved health care plans will facilitate a thriving nation."}
