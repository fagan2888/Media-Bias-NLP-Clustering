Poo-Pourri said it just wanted to say thank you for the \"care and dedication\" that healthcare workers show to others during the holidays.\n\nKevin Furhman, chief of operations at The Oaks, said the gift evoked a few giggles, but was appreciated.\n\n\"They thought it was nice, and the product itself they felt it was something they could use,\" said Furhman.\n\nFurhman said they have already distributed the spray, which claims to create an odor-blocking barrier in toilet bowls, to the facility's staff.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nSince each two-ounce bottle retails for $9.95, the purveyors of Poo-Pourri claim to have shipped more than $700,000 worth of its odor-killing concoction.\n\nDirector of Public Relations for MedStar Washington So Young Pak said they will distribute the bottles donated to them in January, and the arrival of the anti-stink spray will give workers a light-hearted, somewhat comical and well-deserved distraction from the often difficult work they do.\n\n\"Healthcare workers across the country deliver unwavering care to the members of their communities every day, and it's nice to have Poo-Pourri recognize them for their efforts.\"\n\nTwitter: @BethJSanborn", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/poo-pourri-gift-gives-hospital-workers-chuckle-ahead-holidays", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/poopourri-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "While the delivery of thousands of bottles of Poo-Pourri \"before you go\" bathroom spray to several hospitals won't solve any pressing supply chain needs, recipients of the unexpected holiday gift said the gesture doesn't stink.", "title": "Poo-Pourri gift gives hospital workers a chuckle ahead of holidays"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/poopourri-feature.jpg"}, "description": "While the delivery of thousands of bottles of Poo-Pourri \"before you go\" bathroom spray to several hospitals won't solve any pressing supply chain needs, recipients of the unexpected holiday gift said the gesture doesn't stink.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Poo-Pourri gift gives hospital workers a chuckle ahead of holidays"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While the delivery of thousands of bottles of Poo-Pourri \"before you go\" bathroom spray to several hospitals won't solve any pressing supply chain needs, recipients of the unexpected holiday gift said the gesture doesn't stink.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Poo-Pourri said it just wanted to say thank you for the \"care and dedication\" that healthcare workers show to others during the holidays.\n\"Healthcare workers across the country deliver unwavering care to the members of their communities every day, and it's nice to have Poo-Pourri recognize them for their efforts.\"\nKevin Furhman, chief of operations at The Oaks, said the gift evoked a few giggles, but was appreciated.\nWhile the delivery of thousands of bottles of Poo-Pourri \"before you go\" bathroom spray to several hospitals won't solve any pressing supply chain needs, recipients of the unexpected holiday gift said the gesture doesn't stink.\nFurhman said they have already distributed the spray, which claims to create an odor-blocking barrier in toilet bowls, to the facility's staff."}
