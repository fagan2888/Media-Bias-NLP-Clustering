(AP) - A Minnesota snack food company has bought a potato chip factory in northwestern Pennsylvania with plans to hire up to 100 workers - and triple that many if the company\u2019s growth projections come true.\n\nOfficials with KLN Family Brands, of Perham, Minn., hoped to be making kettle-cooked potato chips, popcorn and other snacks at the former Troyer Farms plant in Waterford Township by this spring, the Erie Times-News (http://bit.ly/1eVbcDB ) reported Thursday.\n\nThe property had been leased to Bickel\u2019s Snack Foods Inc., which bought the Troyer Farms snack food business in December 2008 but shut down production in the spring of 2011. Seventy-seven workers were laid off when Bickel moved its production to York, where that company is based.\n\nCharlie Nelson, one of KLN\u2019s owners who serves as vice president of sales and marketing, said the company bought the plant in hopes of rehiring some former Troyer Farms workers.\n\n\u201cWe will be able to bring on people who have some experience and know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the key for us.\u201d\n\nTwo other keys are the plant\u2019s location, and the fact that there\u2019s room to expand the business.\n\nKLN has a plant in Phoenix, in addition to its Minnesota headquarters, and needed a northeastern U.S. distribution point.\n\nThe company makes Barrel O\u2019Fun Snack Foods and private label chips and snacks.\n\n\u201cWe knew we needed to be out East in general,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cFreight is a challenge for us, especially when shipping salty snacks. It\u2019s a very light product, and you have to be near the population base.\u201d\n\nThe company is hoping it will quickly outgrow the 160,000-square-foot building. If that happens, KLN plans to expand into another facility and use the current plant as a warehouse. That could result in a total of 250 to 300 workers.\n\nThe jobs will pay more than minimum wage, though company officials won\u2019t say how much, and employees will get benefits including health insurance, paid vacations, profit-sharing, a retirement plan and even housing loans for veteran employees.\n\n\u201cI came to appreciate the way they treat their employees, and their customer satisfaction speaks to the quality of the company and its management,\u201d said John Elliott, president of the Greater Erie Industrial Development Corp. The agency is seeking permits to build a water treatment plant and extend municipal water service to the property at a cost of about $7 million.\n\nKLN has about 1,250 employees and Nelson said, \u201cWe try to stress family in everything we do. Our people work hard, and we have a lot of loyalty to them. We do try to care about our employees and have them benefit from our growth.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Erie Times-News, http://www.goerie.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Minnesota snack food company has bought a potato chip factory in northwestern Pennsylvania with plans to hire up to 100 workers - and triple that many if the company's growth projections come true.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/23/minnesota-snack-firm-buying-nw-pa-troyer-plant/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Minnesota snack food company has bought a potato chip factory in northwestern Pennsylvania with plans to hire up to 100 workers - and triple that many if the company\u2019s growth projections come true.", "title": "Minnesota snack firm buying Pa. chip factory"}, "twitter": {"title": "Minnesota snack firm buying Pa. chip factory", "description": "A Minnesota snack food company has bought a potato chip factory in northwestern Pennsylvania with plans to hire up to 100 workers - and triple that many if the company's growth projections come true.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Labor, Kln Family Brands, Charlie Nelson, Troyer Farms"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf27c\"", "article_summary": "The property had been leased to Bickel\u2019s Snack Foods Inc., which bought the Troyer Farms snack food business in December 2008 but shut down production in the spring of 2011.\nWATERFORD, Pa.
