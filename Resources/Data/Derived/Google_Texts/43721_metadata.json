For instance, The Physicians Foundation last year found that nearly one-third of doctors ages 45 or younger and one-quarter of doctors 46 and older gave the health reform law an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade. Meanwhile, another survey conducted around the time the ACA was passed found that the majority of medical students supported the law, even though just about half said they understood it.\n\nChanges Starting Before Medical School\n\nFuture doctors are seeing some changes before they even enter medical school.\n\nIn April, sections on neuroscience, psychology and sociology were added to the Medical College Admissions Test. A section on humanities and social sciences also has been added.\n\nThe changes are the first major revision to the MCAT in more than two decades. In a letter explaining the changes, Association of American Medical Colleges President and CEO Darrell Kirch wrote, \u201cThe health care system of tomorrow will require a different kind of physician.\u201d Further, experts at AAMC \u2014 which administers the test \u2014 wrote in a Journal of the American Medical Association article that \u201ctomorrow\u2019s physicians need broader skills and knowledge than in the past.\u201d\n\nMedical students Allan Joseph and Karan Chhabra recently wrote in Forbes that the \u201crevision sends an important message.\u201d According to Joseph and Chhabra \u2014 students at Brown University\u2019s Warren Alpert Medical School and Rutgers\u2019 Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, respectively \u2014 \u201cThe current premedical curriculum only adds to the prevailing attitude that success in the \u2018hard sciences\u2019 (biology, chemistry, organic chemistry and physics) is all that determines success in medicine and that the social determinants of health are \u2018soft\u2019 in comparison.\u201d But social sciences are \u201ccritical,\u201d the two argue, adding that modern hospitals require \u201cempathetic communication, tech savvy and the ability to respond to a rapidly changing body of knowledge.\u201d\n\nMedical Schools, Residencies Re-Evaluating Focus\n\nIn response to the ACA and other reform efforts, some medical schools are increasing their focus on population health and patient-centered care.\n\nJanis Orlowski, chief health care officer at AAMC, told California Healthline, \u201cWe are seeing the need for medical students and physicians in general to have information about treating populations as opposed to just treating an individual patient.\n\n\u201cWhat are the parameters that would improve the health of a larger swath of people \u2014 that\u2019s something medical schools are beginning to incorporate into their curriculums.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, AAMC is re-evaluating the requirements for graduate medical education to ensure they prepare new doctors for the changing health care landscape in the U.S. Orlowski said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to relook at our curriculum and relook at the competencies that a graduating physician should have.\u201d\n\nAAMC\u2019s Optimizing Graduate Medical Education initiative attempts to do just that.\n\nThe initiative was launched because of the many \u201cchanging forces\u201d in today\u2019s health care landscape \u2014 including requirements and goals of the ACA, Orlowski said.\n\nAccording to the initiative, \u201cRecent and emerging trends \u2026 are demanding rapid and simultaneous changes in medical education and health care delivery.\n\n\u201cAchieving these goals requires physicians who are well equipped to focus on issues such as systems thinking, population health, health equity, continuous improvement and interprofessional collaboration. Education and training programs are adapting to meet these needs, but they need support from the broader systems in which they operate.\u201d\n\nResidency Opportunities Aren\u2019t Keeping Up With Demand\n\nMedical school enrollment has climbed rapidly, with enrollment on target to increase nearly 30% by 2019, according to a survey. However, residency slots for new doctors have not kept pace.\n\n\u201cThe problem we have right now is we\u2019re not seeing an increase in the number of residency slots under the ACA,\u201d Orlowski said.\n\nAbout 87% of U.S. medical schools deans say they are concerned about the availability of clinical training sites, while 71% say they are concerned that medical school enrollment will outpace residency slots.\n\nCongress in 1997 froze funding for medical residencies. But a bill (HR 2124) introduced last week would amend the Social Security Act to provide funding for more residency slots.\n\nThe ACA has made graduate medical education more important than ever \u2014 more physicians are needed to treat the increasing number of residents who have gained coverage under the law. In fact, AAMC predicts a shortage of up to 90,000 doctors by 2025 because of the aging population, an increase in individuals living with chronic diseases and other factors. AAMC said the physician supply also will grow, but not fast enough.\n\nMedical Schools, Teaching Programs \u2018Embrace\u2019 Changes\n\nFrom taking the MCAT to treating patients, the way that future doctors are selected and trained is shifting in the wake of ACA implementation.\n\nOrlowski said that the refocus on population health reminds her that many public health programs used to be part of medical schools. She said that what we\u2019re seeing now is \u201cthe reintegration of public health concepts into the medical curriculum.\u201d\n\nShe added that officials at teaching hospitals and teaching programs are eager to \u201cembrace the changes that are going on.\u201d\n\nAround the Nation\n\nCoercing reform? Kansas and Texas have thrown their support behind a lawsuit filed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) alleging that the federal government is illegally attempting to force states to expand their Medicaid programs by not renewing funding measures for uncompensated care programs.\n\nPredicting SCOTUS ruling.
