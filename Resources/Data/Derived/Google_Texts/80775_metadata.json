And the opponents who say its working terribly are saying too much. We simply do not know how its working yet,\" Gruber said, adding that details would start to emerge over the next several months.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Why Obamacare desperately needs watchdog: US rep)\n\n\"We just need to be patient and let it work out.
