But he is flat-out revered in Tennessee, where he played college football for the Volunteers. (I went to high school in Chattanooga and the level of love for Manning there can't be overstated.) His visit certainly meant a lot.\n\nIt's also a classic Manning-type visit too. He showed up, did good for the lives of others and didn't make any noise about it.\n\nWe've seen Manning go the extra mile to meet North Pole fans, quietly pay tribute to a young Broncos fan who passed and send a letter to the mother of a Colts fan she lost.\n\nIn short, Manning's known for a lot of things -- both good and bad -- he does on the field. But his off-field stuff continues to have an incredible impact on football fans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning visited with Chattanooga Police and military members after the tragic Tennessee shooting last week.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning visited with Chattanooga Police and military members after the tragic Tennessee shooting last week.", "title": "Peyton Manning visited Chattanooga Police after Tennessee shooting", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25245467/peyton-manning-visited-chattanooga-police-after-tennessee-shooting", "image": "http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/Peyton_Manning_Visits_Chattanooga_Police_Tennessee_Shooting.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning visited with Chattanooga Police and military members after the tragic Tennessee shooting last week.", "title": "Peyton Manning visited Chattanooga Police after Tennessee shooting", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25245467/peyton-manning-visited-chattanooga-police-after-tennessee-shooting", "image": "http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/Peyton_Manning_Visits_Chattanooga_Police_Tennessee_Shooting.png", "creator": "@EyeOnNFL", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 25245467, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "sports news scores information, NFL football MLB baseball NBA basketball live scores news standings teams players, NCAA college basketball football scores news polls rankings, fantasy football news player rankings advice, fantasy baseball basketball news, CBS fantasy sports, golf tennis soccer autos auto racing tour de france, summer winter Olympics, CBSSports.com Sports Line, CBS SportsLine.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbc4\"", "article_summary": "Last week, a tragic shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee claimed the lives of four Marines, while also wounding two other men and a Chattanooga Police officer.\nThank you for stopping by and for your support Peyton Manning #chanews pic.twitter.com/UgaLHvrFXR \u2014 Chattanooga Police (@ChattanoogaPD) July 19, 2015Manning started his NFL career with the Colts and now lives in Denver.\n(I went to high school in Chattanooga and the level of love for Manning there can't be overstated.)\nThe shooting occurred at the Naval Marine Corps Reserve base near Amnicola Highway which is, according to WCRB TV in Chattanooga, where Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning came by to support the police and military members suffering after the loss of their friends.\nThe police confirmed the visit by posting a pic of Manning and an officer on Twitter."}
