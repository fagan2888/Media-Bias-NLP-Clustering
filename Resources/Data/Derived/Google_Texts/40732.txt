Despite dire warnings of a big wave of new patients swamping doctors' offices and disrupting care after getting health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, there was actually a small net decrease in patient visits last year for primary care physicians, according to data collected from almost 20,000 doctors.

But even in the face of that decline, primary care doctors actually saw a net revenue increase of 3 percent or more from their patients in 2014. The findings came in data compiled by ACAView, an Obamacare-measuring project of Athenahealth and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Josh Gray, head of research at Athenahealth, said the findings disprove "two nightmare scenarios" suggested by some prior to the implementation of Obamacare. Those skeptics warned of a double whammy of too many patients to handle and fewer reimbursements for doctors.

"Neither of those scenarios came to pass," Gray said.

The ACA began taking full effect in 2014, when millions of people gained coverage from private health plans sold through government-run Obamacare exchanges, and others who previously had difficulty buying insurance purchased plans outside the exchanges.
