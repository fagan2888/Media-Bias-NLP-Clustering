On Friday night’s episode of “Real Time,” host Bill Maher continued to criticize liberal “ninnies” who think 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed should be lionized for what the comedian characterized as “taking the back off something.”

Maher played a YouTube clip of someone opening up an alarm clock and placing it in a pencil case, and claimed that it looked both exactly like what Ahmed brought with him to school and exactly like a bomb. “This is like pouring milk on a bowl of Cheerios and claiming you invented cereal,” Maher said.

“And then made it look like a bomb!” guest S.E. Cupp added.

School officials “absolutely did the right thing, thinking it looked like a bomb,” Maher said.

“But it didn’t look like a bomb, it looked like a clock,” Ron Reagan replied.

“It looked exactly like a bomb!” Maher shouted.

“Haven’t you seen any of the ‘Die Hard’ movies?” Cupp asked, momentarily confusing Hollywood with reality.
