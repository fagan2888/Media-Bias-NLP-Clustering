Dialysis patients had the highest cost at $7,142 per person per year, the findings showed.\n\nSpending for Part D-covered medications was more than two times higher for chronic kidney disease patients who received Medicare's low-income subsidy than for those who did not -- $6,088 versus $2,873. Out-of-pocket costs were 1 percent to 2 percent for patients who got the subsidy, and between 28 percent and 32 percent for those who did not, according to the report.\n\nThe study authors also reported that just over 69 percent of Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease were enrolled in Medicare Part D, as well as about 74 percent of patients with kidney failure.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide a snapshot view of the major issues in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease in the U.S.,\" Balkrishnan said. \"There are definitely gaps there in the treatment of many patients, which can be improved upon.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation has more about chronic kidney disease.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/kidney-cancer-news-431/briefs-3-28-kidney-disease-costs-ajkd-uva-release-batch-2597-709424.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/kidney1114.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Researchers consider ways to manage patients' care effectively and rein in the cost", "title": "Medicare Spends Billions on Chronic Kidney Disease, Study Finds"}, "description": "Researchers consider ways to manage patients' care effectively and rein in the cost", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "More informationThe National Kidney Foundation has more about chronic kidney disease.\nIn 2013, Medicare spent $50 billion on chronic kidney disease among people 65 and older, and $31 billion on those with kidney failure, the researchers found.\nEn Espa\u00f1olTUESDAY, March 29, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Chronic kidney disease affects nearly 14 percent of Americans and costs Medicare billions of dollars a year, a new study reveals.\nThe study authors also reported that just over 69 percent of Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease were enrolled in Medicare Part D, as well as about 74 percent of patients with kidney failure.\nSpending for prescriptions for Part D patients with kidney failure was $6,673 a year per patient, 2.6 times higher than for general Medicare patients."}
