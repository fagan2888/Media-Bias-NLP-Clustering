And so the team had to operate just right, and they had to go just fast enough to get rid of everyone else, but not so fast that we were blowing our own team up, because we needed the whole team to do what you guys saw.\u201d\n\nGarmin-Sharp rode off the front to catch the breakaway in Denver while holding off advancing riders from behind.\n\n\u201cThe thing with Alex that makes him a special rider is when the team does an extraordinary effort like that, and he knows he\u2019s the beneficiary of that, he comes through,\u201d Vaughters said. \u201cHe comes through in high-pressure situations when it\u2019s all on him.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: 2014 USA Pro Challenge, Final Stage\n\nWATCH: Alex Howes won the final stage of the USA Pro Challenge\n\nJersey winners. Aspen\u2019s Tejay van Garderen of BMC Racing won the overall race leader\u2019s yellow jersey and the best Colorado rider jersey. Boulder\u2019s Kiel Reijnen of UnitedHealthcare won the green sprinter\u2019s jersey. Ben Jacques-Maynes of Jamis-Hagens Berman won the king of the mountains (KOM) jersey. French rider Cl\u00e9ment Chevrier of Bissell Development Team retained the best young rider jersey.\n\nAnd Jens Voigt, the 42-year-old German rider of Trek Factory Racing competing in his final pro race, was awarded the most aggressive rider jersey.\n\nBack for more. The Pro Challenge requires about $1.5 million per day to be put on successfully, race CEO Shawn Hunter said. The race plans to expand next year to include a women\u2019s component, an announcement that drew applause from riders on stage.\n\nHunter reiterated that the race is on pace with its five-year plan to break even and said television ratings were the best they\u2019ve been in four years, without providing specific figures.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Garmin-Sharp strategy comes up aces in win by Alex Howes in Stage 7", "title": "Garmin-Sharp strategy comes up aces in win by Alex Howes in Stage 7", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/24/garmin-sharp-strategy-comes-up-aces-in-win-by-alex-howes-in-stage-7/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__alex-howesp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__alex-howesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T22:34:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:31:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe012d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe comes through in high-pressure situations when it\u2019s all on him.\u201dPHOTOS: 2014 USA Pro Challenge, Final StageWATCH: Alex Howes won the final stage of the USA Pro ChallengeJersey winners.\nBy the time Garmin-Sharp cyclist Alex Howes made his sprint finish down Broadway in Denver for Stage 7 of the USA Pro Challenge, he was all alone.\nAspen\u2019s Tejay van Garderen of BMC Racing won the overall race leader\u2019s yellow jersey and the best Colorado rider jersey.\nAnd Jens Voigt, the 42-year-old German rider of Trek Factory Racing competing in his final pro race, was awarded the most aggressive rider jersey.\nFrench rider Cl\u00e9ment Chevrier of Bissell Development Team retained the best young rider jersey."}
