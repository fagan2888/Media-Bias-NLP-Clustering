Tuition at public schools has increased 28 percent over the same period.

The cost of public higher education in some other states has skyrocketed, led by Arizona (72 percent), Georgia (68 percent) and Louisiana (66 percent).\n\nAnalysts graded each of the states on its support for higher education, with 19 states receiving a failing grade, up from 11 states last year. Wyoming was the only state in the country to receive a grade of \u201cA\u201d on the report.\n\nThree-quarters of American college students attend public colleges.
