Reed says.\n\nCombined public and private funding for research was up 2.7 percent, from $431.4 million in FY14 to $443.0 million in FY15.\n\n\u201cFaculty continue to make important strides in securing federal grants and they continue to conduct groundbreaking research despite a very challenging research funding landscape.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014UI Vice President for Research and Economic Development Daniel A. Reed\n\nAlso up in FY15 were the total number of awards granted (up 3 percent, from 2,185 in FY14 to 2,240 in FY15). There were 169 new sponsors of both research funding and other funding in FY15.\n\nTotal external funding for FY15 (which includes gift commitments and charitable grants supporting research through the University of Iowa Foundation) was up 9.6 percent, from $515.8 million in FY14 to $565.2 million in FY15, the highest level since the sunset of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) continued to provide the lion\u2019s share of public research support, at $146.7 million, followed by the Department of Health and Human Services (non-NIH funding) at $22.4 million, the National Science Foundation at $11.3 million, and Department of Defense at $10.5 million.\n\nBusiness/corporation research support rose 28 percent (from $71.4 million to $91.7 million) while state/local government funding (most of it federal dollars transferred through state agencies) increased 45 percent (from $32.8 million to $47.5 million).\n\nReed says federal funding for basic research is critical for continued United States economic competitiveness. He said it\u2019s also important for finding solutions and accelerating discovery across a range of critical 21st century issues, from biomedical research to treat and cure infectious diseases, cancer and heart disease through environmental and energy sustainability to public policy. Although total research and total external dollars were slightly up in FY15 at the UI, there was a 7 percent decline in overall federal research funding, from $250.1 million to $231.9 million.\n\nReed says recent efforts by Congress to address research funding shortfalls in biomedicine are encouraging but that major discoveries\u2014and the economic benefits that result\u2014require significant, ongoing, national investment. Proposed funding increases would reduce the time required for translating scientific advancements into new treatments and therapies for a range of conditions and diseases.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the U.S. economic growth since the Second World War is attributable to science-driven technological innovation,\u201d Reed says, pointing to biomedicine and the computing and communication industries as examples. \u201cThe source of much of this innovation was federally funded basic research, which helped lead to life-saving vaccines, new drugs, diagnostic imaging, modern communication devices, and the Internet.\n\n\u201cIf we want our children and their children to experience the same opportunities in the future, as a country we need to do what we did half a century ago and make funding basic research a national priority,\u201d Reed says.\n\nA detailed breakdown of research funding from FY11 to FY15 is available at the University of Iowa Research Information System website.\n\nFY15-14 Federal and Non-federal Research Funding Federal agency FY15 FY14 Dept. of Agriculture $1,301,845 $723,098 Dept. of Defense $10,466,785 $8,764,697 Dept. of Health and Human Services $169,117,018 $186,450,438 Dept. of Education $20,839,992 $21,733,525 Dept. of Commerce $16,700 $90,910 Dept. of Interior $134,573 $155,766 Dept. of Transportation $3,968,170 $2,389,077 Dept. of Energy $2,231,491 $2,225,644 National Science Foundation $11,340,464 $14,887,698 NASA $4,088,772 $3,884,757 Environmental Protection Agency $0 $304,585 Other $8,383,266 $8,512,657 Federal Subtotal $231,889,076 $250,122,852 Non-federal FY15 FY14 Commodity NA NA Foreign federal govt $358,984 $83,063 Foreign higher education $748,305 $202,951 Foreign nonprofits $611,674 $448,683 Higher education $31,748,222 $33,038,849 Individuals $5,592 $6,250 Industry/corporate (foreign and domestic) $91,719,378 $71,423,251 Iowa local govt/school districts $640,533 $463,461 Non-Iowa state & local govt $1,087,924 $885,528 Nonprofit organizations $38,357,835 $43,303,253 State of Iowa $45,857,159 $31,464,072 Other non-federal $0 $0 Non-federal Subtotal $206,635,606 $181,319,361 Total $443,024,682 $431,442,213\n\nFY15-14 Federal and Non-federal Total External Funding Federal agency FY15 FY14 Dept. of Agriculture $1,301,845 $723,098 Dept. of Defense $10,466,785 $8,764,697 Dept. of Health and Human Services $169,117,018 $186,450,438 Dept. of Education $20,839,992 $21,733,525 Dept. of Commerce $16,700 $90,910 Dept. of Interior $134,573 $155,766 Dept. of Transportation $3,968,170 $2,389,077 Dept. of Energy $2,231,491 $2,225,644 National Science Foundation $11,340,464 $14,887,698 NASA $4,088,772 $3,884,757 Environmental Protection Agency $0 $304,585 Other $8,383,266 $8,512,657 Federal Subtotal $231,889,076 $250,122,852 Non-federal FY15 FY14 Commodity NA NA Foreign federal govt $358,984 $83,063 Foreign higher education $748,305 $202,951 Foreign nonprofits $611,674 $448,683 Higher education $31,748,222 $33,038,849 Individuals $84,132,469 $60,927,054 Industry/corporate (foreign and domestic) $105,508,245 $87,112,127 Iowa local govt/school districts $640,533 $463,461 Non-Iowa state & local govt $1,087,924 $885,528 Nonprofit organizations $49,924,695 $47,287,923 State of Iowa $45,857,159 $31,464,072 Other non-federal $12,733,821 $3,737,628 Non-federal Subtotal $328,852,031 $265,661,340 Total $565,241,106 $515,784,192\n\nResearch examples\n\nA number of research grants and contracts secured or continued in FY15 will directly benefit Iowans and the Midwest.\n\nTanya Uden-Holman, clinical professor and associate dean for education and student affairs in the UI College of Public Health, received $2.8 million from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Health Resources and Services Administration to support her work with the Midwestern Public Health Training Center. Covering the four-state region of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, the center will help improve public health by strengthening the technical, scientific, managerial, and leadership competencies of the public health workforce.\n\nPeter Damiano, director of the Public Policy Center and professor in the UI Department of Preventive and Community Dentistry, and the health policy research team at the PPC are involved in a series of funded studies with the Iowa Department of Human Services evaluating programs aimed to reform the health care system for chronically ill and vulnerable populations in Iowa. These programs include the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, Iowa\u2019s version of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, the Medicaid Health Home and Integrated Health Home programs, the Medicaid managed care programs, and the Dental Wellness Plan.\n\nTwo UI colleges that saw increases in research funding in FY15 were the Carver College of Medicine (up 8 percent, from $200.5 million to $215.8 million) and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (up 4 percent, from $43.5 million to $45.4 million).\n\nIn the area of medicine, Curt Sigmund, chair and department executive officer of pharmacology and the Roy J. Carver Chair in Hypertension Research in the Carver College of Medicine (along with fellow lead investigators Mark Santillan, Gary Pierce, and Justin Grobe), received a four-year, $3.7 million grant from the American Heart Association to create one of four national Strategically Focused Hypertension Research Centers. The UI center\u2019s focus is on finding a cure for preeclampsia, a cardiovascular disorder generally occurring late in pregnancy that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine and often results in an early delivery, creating immediate and potentially lifelong risks to both mother and baby.\n\nBetween 5 percent and 7 percent of all pregnancies in the United States are affected by preeclampsia, equating to roughly 4,000 pregnancies in Iowa or around 500,000 in the United States per year. More than 100,000 women worldwide die from the disease each year.\n\nScott Lindgren and David Wacker, professors of pediatrics in the Carver College of Medicine Stead Family Department of Pediatrics, received $2.6 million from the NIH as principal investigators for a study exploring new methods of behavioral assessment and treatment for children with autism by using communication technologies (telehealth). This will allow families to get support in their homes without having to travel to a clinic or medical center.\n\nOther funding for medical-related research include a five-year, $3.2 million NIH grant to better understand the causes of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; $691,504 from the NIH to study changes in DNA related to post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in people who suffer military sexual trauma; and $4.2 million from the NIH to support the UI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, which helps researchers across disciplines translate basic science research and test new treatments and interventions, among other activities.\n\nIn the social sciences and humanities, Michael O\u2019Hara, professor and Starch Faculty Fellow in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, received $147,000 from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to evaluate \u201cMomMoodBooster,\u201d an online intervention to help female military veterans from across the country cope with postpartum depression. Mark Blumberg, the F. Wendell Miller Professor of Psychology, received a $2.4 million MERIT Award from the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (part of $4.9 million in funding over 10 years) to study the role that \u201csleep twitches\u201d play in early brain development.\n\nJonathan Wilcox, chair of the Department of English, received a $141,286 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to conduct a four-week, hands-on faculty seminar where participants learned how medieval-style manuscripts were created, from shaping animal hides into parchment to mimicking stylish calligraphy and ornamentation, and explored the importance of the materiality of books in the digital age.\n\nIn an innovative experiment between a university and a liberal arts college, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided $1.6 million for a four-year project: \u201cDigital Bridges for Humanistic Inquiry: A Grinnell College/University of Iowa Partnership.\u201d Supported on the UI side by the Obermann Center for Advanced Studies, faculty and students will explore teaching, learning, and research in the digital liberal arts by creating new collaborative practices for the humanities.\n\nThe Obermann Center is also part of a Mellon-funded 15-university consortium, \u201cHumanities Without Walls,\u201d that provides opportunities for faculty collaborations across the Midwest and includes a summer institute on careers in the humanities for two graduate students from each of the member universities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both research funding and total external funding to the University of Iowa rose in 2014-15, with new and continued grants and contracts fueling research that will benefit Iowa, the Midwest, and the world.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Iowa Now", "description": "Both research funding and total external funding to the University of Iowa rose in 2014-15, with new and continued grants and contracts fueling research that will benefit Iowa, the Midwest, and the world.", "title": "UI-sponsored research, total external funding up in FY 2015", "url": "http://now.uiowa.edu/2015/07/ui-sponsored-research-total-external-funding-fy-2015", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T10:40:30-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://now.uiowa.edu/2015/07/ui-sponsored-research-total-external-funding-fy-2015", "title": "UI-sponsored research, total external funding up in FY 2015", "description": "Both research funding and total external funding to the University of Iowa rose in 2014-15, with new and continued grants and contracts fueling research that will benefit Iowa, the Midwest, and the world.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "uiowa", "id": 14534931}}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T09:00:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T10:40:30-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A detailed breakdown of research funding from FY11 to FY15 is available at the University of Iowa Research Information System website.\nAlthough total research and total external dollars were slightly up in FY15 at the UI, there was a 7 percent decline in overall federal research funding, from $250.1 million to $231.9 million.\nBoth research funding and total external funding to the University of Iowa rose in 2014-15, with new and continued grants and contracts fueling research that will benefit Iowa, the Midwest, and the world.\nThere were 169 new sponsors of both research funding and other funding in FY15.\nFY15-14 Federal and Non-federal Research Funding Federal agency FY15 FY14 Dept."}
