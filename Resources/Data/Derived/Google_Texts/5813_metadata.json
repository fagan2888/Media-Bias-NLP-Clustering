Girlfriend happens to be about a couple of Nebraska boys finding love (with each other) the summer after finishing high school. When Will and Mike are singing about a girlfriend, they are really beginning to acknowledge their nascent romantic feelings for each other. Whether gay or straight, the tender story and awkwardness of first love are relatable for everyone.\n\nThe story, which is set in 1993, starts high school graduation day. Will, played by Ryder Bach, declares it \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d and expresses how grateful he is to have survived the ordeal of being a gay, nerd with a love of musicals in a Midwest high school. \u201cThis year, I resolve to drop my bad habit of learning things,\u201d he smirked. He is tearing up his books and also singing \u201cShould auld acquaintance be forgot? Yes!\u201d\n\nMike, played by Curt Hansen, is the classic Prom King (\u201cor runner up\u201d \u2013 Will is not sure) jock who has a full ride to college in the fall. He is planning to be pre-med to please his doctor dad and talks a lot about an out-of-town girlfriend. Mike clearly wants to protect his reputation and live up to expectations, but he considers graduation to be a chance to stop denying his feelings.\n\nWhen the handsome jock calls and asks him to the movies, Will proclaims, \u201cMy life has finally become the musical I always thought it was.\u201d After their first trip to the movies as friends, he comments, \u201cI feel as if I\u2019m in \u2018Grease.\u2019 The movie, not the country.\u201d The line is clearly intended to show how universal the story of the popular kid hooking up over summer with someone unexpected is.\u201d\n\nThe more time they hang out or talk on the phone (or sing harmonies), the world seems right, even if they have not yet realized their feelings for each other. They are in the car singing \u201cAnd then I saw you coming my way. Don\u2019t you need to get in the arms of a good friend? Oh, cuz believe me, I\u2019d sure love to call you my girlfriend.\u201d Slowly, they start singing it to each other, grasping a deeper, personal meaning and attraction. They use the song, and others, to express what they cannot say directly to each other.\n\nThe show as directed by Les Waters, who staged an earlier version at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2010, patiently allows the characters to realize their attraction. The audience knows they will eventually kiss, but enjoys and recalls the awkward moves to get closer, put an arm around the other and then timidly kiss. The gulf they cross is not just the hesitation of new love; they also need to deal with Mike\u2019s jock friends and hesitation to show who he really is.\n\nEventually the characters feel comfortable to really enjoy each other\u2019s company, singing and dancing. They eventually do not care who knows about them. For Will, it is love. For Mike, he knows he is leaving for college and no longer feels the need to conform to expectations.\n\nThe musical\u2019s songs are largely from Sweet\u2019s 1991 Girlfriend album, with three from other Sweet albums. The lyrics propel the plot, but the witty dialog by Todd Almond adds context. Music director Julie Wolf and her four-woman band add the right levels of exuberance and edge to the music.\n\nBach is sweet and believable as the geeky character, who offers wry comments and winsome expressions. Hanson is great at conveying his discomfort trying on a new life. He has a powerful voice that sometimes overpowered Back a little, but most of the time they were great together.\n\nFor those looking for a small, intimate musical or a great date night, Girlfriend is touching. Girlfriend, with its altrock music and story that recalls anyone\u2019s first love, will be at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in the Culver City section of Los Angeles County through August 9, 2015.\n\nWritten and edited by Dyanne Weiss\n\nSources:\n\nPerformance July 19, 2015\n\nCenter Theatre Group: Girlfriend\n\nLos Angeles Times: In \u2018Girlfriend,\u2019 Matthew Sweet\u2019s lyrics tell the story\n\nPlaybill: Sweet\u2019s \u201cGirlfriend\u201d CD Gets a Musical Theatre Makeover\n\nPhotos by Craig Schwartz, courtesy Center Theatre Group\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Girlfriend is a poignant\u00a0musical that opened Sunday at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in the Los Angeles area that recalls first love with music by altrock veteran Matthew Sweet.
