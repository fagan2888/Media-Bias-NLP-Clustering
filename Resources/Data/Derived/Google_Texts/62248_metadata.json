The move had caused controversy inside the company, especially after Armstrong made a mess of an already tense situation with staffers by rationalizing the cuts because of higher health-care costs.\n\nWorse still, he used the example of two \u201cdistressed babies\u201d of employees \u2014 claiming that each cost $1 million to care for \u2014 as one of those expenses.\n\nSaid Armstrong, in part, at an employee meeting:\n\n\u201cWe had a $7.1 million bill from the Obamacare act in general and we had multiple other things that happened at the company healthcare-wise. Two things that happened in 2012 we had two AOLers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were okay in general. And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost.\u201d\n\nUrg.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s public utterance problems comes just as the company turned in a very decent quarter, which should have been the focus this week, if not for him essentially stepping all over it with what is a classic case of foot-in-mouth disease.
