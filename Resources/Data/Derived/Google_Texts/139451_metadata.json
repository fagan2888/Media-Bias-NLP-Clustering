The study found that 15.6 percent of eighth graders report using marijuana in their lifetimes, as well as 33.7 percent of 10th graders, and 44.4 percent of 12th graders. In the past month, 6.5 percent of eighth graders, 16.6 percent of 10th graders and 21.2 percent of 12th graders admitted to marijuana use.\n\nAccording to the authors of the study, \u201cpersonal disapproval\u201d of the use of pot also fell among students in the eighth and 12th grades. \u201cReported availability\u201d of the drug is \u201cdown significantly\u201d in the eighth and 10th grades, which the authors speculate \u201cmay help to explain the modest decline in use this year.\u201d\n\nThe number of teens who use pot on a daily basis fell, with 5.8 percent of seniors reporting daily use, compared to 6.5 percent in 2013. The researchers defined daily or near-daily marijuana use as \u201cuse on 20 or more occasions in the prior 30 days.\u201d\n\nConversely, the authors of the study found that \u201cthe belief that regular marijuana use harms the user, however, continues to fall among youth, so changes in this belief do not seem to explain the change in use this year, as it has done over most of the life of the study.\u201d\n\nThe study of 40,000 teens indicates that their use of other harmful substances \u2013 such as alcohol and cigarettes \u2013 also has decreased. Less than 15 percent of high school seniors reported smoking cigarettes in the last month, and less than 40 percent report drinking alcohol.\n\nThe Washington Post notes that the study was conducted this spring, as several states and the District of Columbia debated legalizing marijuana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marijuana use is down among teens, according to a new study by the National Institutes on Drug Abuse and the University of Michigan.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Marijuana use is down among teens, according to a new study by the National Institutes on Drug Abuse and the University of Michigan.", "title": "What Percentage of Teens Use Marijuana?
