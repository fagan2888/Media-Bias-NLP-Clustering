The fight between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz continues as the billionaire candidate keeps sniping at the Texas senator on Twitter.

I am self-funding my campaign – putting up my own money, not controlled. Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2016

After Cruz attacked Trump’s New York values, Trump called him a “hypocrite:”

Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016

This morning, Trump pointed out that Cruz “supported liberal Justice John Roberts” who upheld Obamacare in the Supreme court:

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. https://t.co/gBnsNgomom — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2016

He linked to a National Review editorial authored by Cruz in 2005 calling Roberts “the right stuff.”

“As an individual, John Roberts is undoubtedly a principled conservative, as is the president who appointed him,” Cruz wrote, referring to President George W. Bush.
