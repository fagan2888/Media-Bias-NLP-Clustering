But for a group of Native American youth from several of New Mexico\u2019s pueblos, fun meant working outside on a warm, sunny day hauling tons of rock with other tribal youth, community volunteers and staff from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in an effort to restore fish passages along the lower Santa Fe River on Cochiti Pueblo.\n\nAbove the loud crunch of gravel being shoveled into buckets, with sweat dripping from their brows, their hands rough from a full day\u2019s work of loading and unloading bucket after bucket of crushed rock, one could hear the laughter and camaraderie of the four Tribal Youth Conservation Corp (TYCC) team members: Emmanuel Yepa, 16, of Cochiti Pueblo/Northern Cheyenne; Kuien Quintana, 17, of Cochiti Pueblo, Dominic Bailon, 18, of Santo Domingo Pueblo and Xavier Lovato, 17, of Santo Domingo/Cochiti Pueblo. While fully enjoying and living in the moment as they stabilized the riverbank under the watchful eye of their project advisors, these tribal youth TYCC also have a keen focus on their possible future natural resource careers.\n\n\u201cI really enjoy this type of work here on the river,\u201d said TYCC member Kuien Quintana. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for a career down the road where I get to work in the outdoors.

This three-mile section of the river is home to a small population of Rio Grande suckers and provides habitat for wildlife. Elementary school students previously planted native plants such as long-leaf cottonwoods, roses and willows along the banks, and the pueblo hopes for the potential reintroduction of Rio Grande Cutthroat trout in the river, which was abundant on Cochiti Pueblo prior to the construction of Cochiti Dam in 1969.\n\nStarted in 2012, the Tribal Youth Conservation Corps is a USFWS program geared toward Native American high-school students who work on natural resource conservation projects.
