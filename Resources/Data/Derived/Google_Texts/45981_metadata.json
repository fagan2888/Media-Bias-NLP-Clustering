Obviously, both of these comparisons are absolutely ridiculous. The law that attempts to ensure that all Americans have health insurance is actually worse than the atrocities committed by Nazis, Soviets, and terrorists combined.\n\nAfter North Carolina State Senator Bob Rucho's Sunday morning Obamacare musings provoked some angry replies on Twitter, he added:\n\nThose that tweeted, put your thinking caps back on:\"The PEN is mightier than the SWORD.\"Edward Bulwar-Lytton,1839. But surely you knew that. \u2014 Bob Rucho (@SenatorBobRucho) December 15, 2013\n\nThis is Rucho's most controversial tweet to date, though not for lack of trying. Since joining the site in October, Rucho has asked what the president is \"smoking\" and marked the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination by declaring \"JFK could have been the founder and leader of the Tea Party. The real democrat party has been hijacked.\"\n\nToday's comment is an impressive effort, but in the future we'd like to see some more disgusting imagery in his inflammatory tweets, maybe like Maine Governor Paul LePage's gross Vaseline insult.
