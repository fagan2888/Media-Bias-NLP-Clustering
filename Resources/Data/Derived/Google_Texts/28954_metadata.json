I opposed it. He enthusiastically supported Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus plan \u2014 he thought it should have been bigger. I think it was a disaster and a waste of money\u2026 he argued that Obamacare should be expanded to make it socialized medicine for everyone. Actually, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have basically the same healthcare plan.\u201d\n\nIndependent Journal decided to fact-check Cruz\u2019s allegations.\n\nTrump on TARP:\n\nIn September 2008, when CNN\u2019s Kiran Chetry asked if the bailout needed to pass, Trump said:\n\n\u201cWell, I think it would be better if it passed\u2026 Nobody really knows what impact it\u2019s going to have. Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn\u2019t. But certainly it is worth a shot\u2026 I think overall, it\u2019s a probable positive.\u201d\n\nTrump did express skepticism that it might not work, and a desire to see the government buy good loans as well, but he still strongly favored TARP.\n\nSpeaking with Larry King on April 15, 2009, Trump said:\n\n\u201cI do agree with what they\u2019re doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn\u2019t matter, but you have to keep the banks going.\u201d\n\nTrump on the stimulus:\n\nIn February 2009, Trump spoke with Fox News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren, and praised Obama\u2019s stimulus package:\n\n\u201cWell, I have analyzed the bill as closely as it can be analyzed in this quick a period of time, but he\u2019s really got a combination of both. He is doing the taxes, he is doing rebates, and he is also doing lots of public works\u2026 I think it goes quickly. It is easily done\u2026but building infrastructure, building great projects, putting people to work in that sense is also very good, so I think you have a combination of both \u2014 plus he is doing a rebate system and I think that is good also.\u201d\n\nTrump on healthcare:\n\nDuring a September interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Trump proposed a form of government-subsidized healthcare:\n\nTRUMP: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, \u2018No, no, the lower 25 percent that can\u2019t afford private.\u2019 But\u2026\u201d SCOTT PELLEY: \u201cUniversal Healthcare?\u201d TRUMP: \u201cI am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now\u2026\u201d PELLEY: \u201cWho pays for it?\u201d TRUMP: \u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it.
