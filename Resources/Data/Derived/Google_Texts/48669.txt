A Denver police officer has been jailed on nine charges — including child abuse, domestic violence and a weapons charge — filed by the Thornton Police Department, officials said Monday.

Daniel Diaz Deleon, 42, was arrested for harassment, obstructing a peace officer, resisting arrest, domestic violence, child abuse, criminal mischief, false imprisonment, reckless endangerment and prohibited use of weapons, according to Adams County Jail records.

Documents related to the weekend arrest were not immediately available.

Deleon was being held on $5,000 bail.

Deleon has been ordered to speak with his commanders, said department spokesman Sonny Jackson.

Once that meeting happens, the command staff will decide how to handle his employment status, Jackson said.

Most likely, Deleon will be put on desk duty while the charges are pending, said Detective Mary McIver, a department spokeswoman.

Deleon, a detective who was hired in 2004, is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday.

Thornton police were dispatched at 11:53 p.m. Saturday to a domestic violence in progress call on the 900 block of Thorncreek Court.

As officers arrived, they heard gunshots inside the house. A dispatcher was able to contact Deleon inside. He then came outside, where he was arrested, said Thornton Officer Matt Barnes, a department spokesman.
