Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump held a town-hall style meeting at Lenoir-Rhyne University's P.E. Monroe Auditorium earlier today (Monday, March 14). The event began close to two hours late due to flight delays.

The candidate, who was joined by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, spoke of his local connections to North Carolina, including business interests in the Lake Norman area.

Trump discussed trade issues and was around that time the first two protesters were pulled out of the auditorium.

Trump re-stated his stance on several issues he's discussed at previous campaign stops. Those included plans to repeal Obamacare, improve the education level, replenish the military, and improving healthcare to veterans, who he said are receiving worse care than illegal immigrants. He also discussed eliminating common core and turning education over to the states.

There were additional incidents involving protests from the audience, and more people were pulled out of the venue. There were some incidents outside the building as well.

As the event progressed, Trump took aim at Hillary Clinton and the current administration as well. He also criticized Bernie Sanders' plan.

Trump wrapped up by saying Hillary Clintons' support of Barack Obama will kill her in the general election.

The North Carolina Primary Election is Tuesday (March 15).
