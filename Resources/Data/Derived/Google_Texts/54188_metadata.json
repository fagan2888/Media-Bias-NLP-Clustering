As recently as January, just before a weeklong strike by mental health workers, the HMO took direct aim at the union. John Nelson, vice president of government relations for Kaiser Permanente, released a statement that read in part:\n\n\u201cNUHW is a small California union representing fewer than 5,000 of Kaiser Permanente\u00b9s 175,000 employees. Since its creation in 2009, it has never negotiated a contract with Kaiser Permanente. In fact, NUHW stands alone as the only union that has been unwilling or unable to reach a fair agreement concerning a contract covering our employees during that time.\u201d\n\nFor weeks since, the two had not been at the bargaining table.\n\nBut now, in the midst of a second DMHC report finding significant deficiencies in Kaiser\u2019s mental health care, the relationship appears to be thawing.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple meetings scheduled through next week where Kaiser management is seriously listening to their clinicians, getting their ideas how to fix the DMHC\u2019s findings,\u201d said NUHW President Sal Roselli. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful \u2014 I\u2019m not saying this is going to happen \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful\u201d that a contract that \u201cformalizes change in how Kaiser provides care and engages with clinicians\u201d could be forthcoming.\n\nKaiser confirmed that bargaining resumed last week in Northern California. It said that bargaining in Southern California is scheduled for the second week in March.\n\n\u201cAs we have said all along, we need the union representing mental health care providers to work with us cooperatively,\u201d said John Nelson in a statement sent to KQED. \u201cDelays, roadblocks, and other challenges to continued improvement do nothing to help our members and patients. We all deliver our best when we work constructively together to remove obstacles and solve problems more quickly.\n\nHe said that Kaiser \u201cremain(s) committed to resolving our differences.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The contract negotiations take place as state regulators cited Kaiser for deficiencies in mental health services.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"4-Year Contract Dispute Between Kaiser, NUHW Thaws; Union 'Hopeful'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/02\\/26\\/4-year-contract-dispute-between-kaiser-nuhw-thaws-union-hopeful\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-26 09:58:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-27 09:49:19\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24020,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[\"Kaiser\",\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/07\\/6980198171_a6cbed3bdf_k-e1424973125499.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The contract negotiations take place as state regulators cited Kaiser for deficiencies in mental health services.", "title": "4-Year Contract Dispute Between Kaiser, NUHW Thaws; Union \u2018Hopeful\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/02/26/4-year-contract-dispute-between-kaiser-nuhw-thaws-union-hopeful/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/07/6980198171_a6cbed3bdf_k-640x358.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "kaiser,mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbb0\"", "article_summary": "But now, in the midst of a second DMHC report finding significant deficiencies in Kaiser\u2019s mental health care, the relationship appears to be thawing.\nJohn Nelson, vice president of government relations for Kaiser Permanente, released a statement that read in part:\u201cNUHW is a small California union representing fewer than 5,000 of Kaiser Permanente\u00b9s 175,000 employees.\nAs recently as January, just before a weeklong strike by mental health workers, the HMO took direct aim at the union.\n\u201cAs we have said all along, we need the union representing mental health care providers to work with us cooperatively,\u201d said John Nelson in a statement sent to KQED.\nFor more than four years, the National Union of Healthcare Workers, representing 2,600 Kaiser mental health clinicians in California, has been in a small war with the health care giant."}
