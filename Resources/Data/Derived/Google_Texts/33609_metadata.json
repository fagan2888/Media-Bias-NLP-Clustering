Chris Christie is doubling down on his controversial support for the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys and might go watch them play at Lambeau Field next Sunday.\n\n\u201cI hope to,\u201d Christie said Monday on WFAN\u2019s \u201cBoomer & Carton\u201d radio show, when asked if he will join the team once again as it faces off against the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round playoff game.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt could even turn into a political reunion of sorts, if Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 a Packers fan and fellow Republican \u2014 are both in attendance.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Blitz: Christie's brother mocks governor's football foes)\n\n\u201cIf I do go to Lambeau this weekend, of course Scott and I are friends and I\u2019ll see Scott,\u201d Christie said.\n\nThe New Jersey governor\u2019s long-term fandom for the Cowboys has come under recent scrutiny as his high-profile friendship with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been on display. The pair have taken in games in Jones\u2019 suite this season, which has elicited backlash on Twitter. Christie\u2019s brother Todd came to his defense late Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post.\n\nChristie, who visited with the team in the locker room after Sunday\u2019s 24-20 win against the Detroit Lions, said he didn\u2019t get any heat when the Cowboys played poorly in the past few seasons.\n\n\u201cWe all know what this is about, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI would take all the abuse that I\u2019m taking from some of these folks in return for Cowboys playoffs wins.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Christie to hit string of inaugurations)\n\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m governor of New Jersey doesn\u2019t mean I change who I root for,\u201d Christie added.\n\nAlthough he is executive of the state, Christie isn\u2019t above superstitions. He explained that he wore the same orange sweater to all five Cowboys games he attended this season, adding the team won each time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need advice on how to root for the Dallas Cowboys; I\u2019ve been doing it for 43 years,\u201d Christie said.\n\nChristie also dismissed suggestions that his high-five was rejected by Jones in an awkward embrace during Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIt was pandemonium in there,\u201d Christie said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to describe the level of intensity in the Jones box. \u2026 So, no, believe me, I\u2019m sitting in Jerry Jones\u2019 box, how do I feel dissed?\u201d\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The New Jersey governor says he will see Scott Walker if they both attend the game next week.", "title": "Christie won't back down, may watch Cowboys in Green Bay", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/chris-christie-dallas-cowboys-lambeau-field-113969.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/05/150105_chris_christie_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Scott Walker,NFL,Chris Christie,Football", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The New Jersey governor says he will see Scott Walker if they both attend the game next week.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda611\"", "article_summary": "Christie won't back down, may watch Cowboys in Green BayNot one to shy away from anything, New Jersey Gov.\nChris Christie is doubling down on his controversial support for the NFL\u2019s Dallas Cowboys and might go watch them play at Lambeau Field next Sunday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need advice on how to root for the Dallas Cowboys; I\u2019ve been doing it for 43 years,\u201d Christie said.\n( Also on POLITICO: Blitz: Christie's brother mocks governor's football foes)\u201cIf I do go to Lambeau this weekend, of course Scott and I are friends and I\u2019ll see Scott,\u201d Christie said.\nThe New Jersey governor\u2019s long-term fandom for the Cowboys has come under recent scrutiny as his high-profile friendship with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been on display."}
