Orrin Hatch (Utah), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, on Tuesday said at a panel hearing that he was open to a short-term fix for the rash of offshore deals.\n\nBut Hatch rejected calls for the legislation to be made retroactive to May, calling instead for a more targeted solution that is at odds with the main Democratic proposals.\n\nOther Republicans on the panel, meanwhile, showed limited interest in Hatch\u2019s approach.\n\nThe Utah senator accused Democrats of politicizing the issue, with the debate coming as Senate leaders are bringing a bill to the floor that targets companies that move jobs overseas.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing chorus out there among some of my friends on the other side of the aisle to use corporate inversions as a political wedge issue in an election year,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not the direction we take.\u201d\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden Ron WydenBill would require nominees to release tax returns Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version Overnight Cybersecurity: House to offer bill on government hacking powers MORE (D-Ore.) and Robert Stack, the Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs, both pressed for quick action on inversions, and for Washington to then enact the broader rewrite of the tax code that both parties say they desire.\n\nAfter the hearing, Wyden said that he believed there was a \u201creal desire\u201d among senators to tackle what he called the \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d of companies moving offshore. But he declined to comment on Hatch's demands or say when the Finance panel might take up any inversion measure.\n\n\u201cI certainly am not interested in building any walls,\u201d Wyden said about tackling inversions before tax reform. \u201cI want to close a loophole. And then I want to drain the swamp.\u201d\n\nCongressional interest in cross-border tax deals jumped in May, with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to take over AstraZeneca.\n\nSince then, the pharmacy chain Walgreen and the medical device company MedTronic have also moved closer to inverting. Last week, the pharmaceutical company AbbVie clinched the largest offshore deal involving an inversion, coming in at close to $55 billion.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 proposed fix would essentially force any U.S. company that merges with a smaller foreign competitor to be considered American for tax purposes.\n\n\u201cThese inversion transactions are on the increase and indeed, we're aware of many more inversions in the works right now,\u201d said Stack, who called on Congress to pass legislation immediately.\n\nDemocrats have said that the deals are especially galling because companies that invert change little about their business practices and continue to take advantage of U.S. resources, including infrastructure and tax incentives.\n\n\u201cIt has a long-term effect. It's permanent,\u201d Stack said about inversions. \u201cAnd so, the cost of waiting I think is very high.\n\nBut some Democrats are worried that their proposal doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer (N.Y.), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, said that Congress should take a deeper look at the tax breaks companies can use even after they move their legal address.\n\nAfter an inversion, companies still have to pay taxes on their domestic operations. But corporations, Schumer charged, can almost wipe out those obligations by taking a deduction on loans from a parent company abroad to a U.S. subsidiary.\n\n\u201cSaying that we should wait for tax reform to deal with inversions is a green light to allow many more inversions to occur,\u201d said Schumer, who added that he still backed the anti-inversion legislation from Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.).\n\nGOP tax writers have said for weeks that the Democrats\u2019 plan would needlessly punish corporations while failing to solve the major problem: the U.S.\u2019s 35 percent corporate tax rate.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said that the current wave of inversions is different from the cross-border deals that led him and a bipartisan group of lawmakers to enact legislation in 2004.\n\nThat legislation said that a merged company that was at least 20 percent foreign-owned could shift its legal address abroad. The Democratic proposal would boost that to 50 percent.\n\nThe new deals, Grassley said, have been driven far more by legitimate business reasons than the inversions he worried about a decade ago.\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) added that he thought a short-term inversion deal would actually make it harder to rewrite the tax code, not be the springboard that Wyden and other Democrats claim.\n\nPortman chided Stack, saying he didn\u2019t see the leadership required from the Obama administration to overhaul the tax code. Other Republicans criticized Treasury Secretary Jack Lew\u2019s push for inversion legislation, which included a call for \u201ca new sense of economic patriotism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are economic signals right now that are driving a lot of the decisionmaking that our businesses are following,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), a member of GOP leadership. \u201cSo I think some of this inflammatory rhetoric and accusing them of not being economic patriots is really not helpful.\u201d\n\nHatch said a short-term inversion deal should line up with the House, where Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) is deeply skeptical about targeted proposals.\n\nThe Utah senator also specified that any deal should not bring in more revenue to the Treasury, saying it should instead spur momentum for tax reform and move the U.S. toward a system that exempts most offshore corporate income.\n\nWyden said after the hearing that the congressional interest on inversions had already had some impact, with deals now including language that would allow companies to back out if there were changes in tax rules.\n\nBut the chairman said a legislative fix was the only way to truly stop inversions from becoming more widespread.\n\n\u201cIf the Congress doesn\u2019t do anything, you might have 25 more of these deals,\u201d Wyden said after the hearing. \u201cYou start moving really toward having two sets of rules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The two parties are deeply divided over how to address the burst of offshore tax deals.", "description": "The two parties are deeply divided over how to address the burst of offshore tax deals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bernie Becker", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The two parties are deeply divided over how to address the burst of offshore tax deals.", "title": "Lawmakers fault \u2018inversion\u2019 craze, but split on solution", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/212995-lawmakers-fault-inversion-craze-but-split-on-solution", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-22T15:49:18-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-22T15:49-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/212995-lawmakers-fault-inversion-craze-but-split-on-solution", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-22T15:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-22T15:10:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-22T15:49:18-04:00"}, "keywords": "Ron Wyden, Chuck Schumer, Chuck Grassley, Corporate inversion, Orrin Hatch, Tax avoidance,Ron Wyden,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/212995-lawmakers-fault-inversion-craze-but-split-on-solution", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The two parties are deeply divided over how to address the burst of offshore tax deals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers fault \u2018inversion\u2019 craze, but split on solution"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers fault \u2018inversion\u2019 craze, but split on solution"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2851\"", "article_summary": "After an inversion, companies still have to pay taxes on their domestic operations.\n\u201cIf the Congress doesn\u2019t do anything, you might have 25 more of these deals,\u201d Wyden said after the hearing.\nADVERTISEMENTWhile both parties broadly agree the \u201cinversion\u201d deals threaten to drain the Treasury\u2019s coffers and weaken the U.S. tax base, they are finding little common ground when it comes to a legislative solution.\nBut he declined to comment on Hatch's demands or say when the Finance panel might take up any inversion measure.\nAfter the hearing, Wyden said that he believed there was a \u201creal desire\u201d among senators to tackle what he called the \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d of companies moving offshore."}
