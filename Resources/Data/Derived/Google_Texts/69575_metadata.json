Nugent, 66, called the president \"a pathological liar & America hating goon\" and made references to Obamacare, Benghazi, the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal and the IRS abuse scandal. \"The guy is a bad man & psychotic liar,\" Nugent wrote.\n\n\"Heartbreakingly the president of the United States is a pathological liar & America hating goon. Oh, and BTW, if you like your Dr, you can keep your Dr. And NO, we will not provide security for our fellow Americans in ultra-dangerous terrorist regions like Benghazi.
