Fathers and daughters in the Twin Ports laced up their dancing shoes for the 2nd annual Daddy-Daughter Princess Ball on Sunday at Clyde Iron Works in Duluth.

Families could enjoy crafts, pizza and a full candy buffet. There was also a silly photo booth and everyone could meet their favorite princess as well.

Peter Cpin says it's nice to have something fun and affordable to do with his daughter, Clara, that won't break the bank.

"It's a fun time to get out and make memories with your daughter and dance like a crazy person," Cpin said.

"A Sweet Event" produced the ball, with the mission to help everyone become a stronger family unit.
