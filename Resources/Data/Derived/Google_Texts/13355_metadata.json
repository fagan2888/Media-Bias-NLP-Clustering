Expectations are the ACA will blow past the administration\u2019s goal of 9 million for 2015.\n\nAs Politico reported, the quiet push to get people enrolled was an intentional White House strategy:\n\nObamacare enrollment draws to a close Sunday night, and all signs point to the White House easily meeting its target of getting 9 million Americans covered in 2015 \u2014 a drama-free ending to a season that proved a 180-degree turnaround from last year\u2019s many problems. The quiet conclusion isn\u2019t just because HealthCare.gov hasn\u2019t been on the verge of collapse. The White House intentionally adopted a lower key, more targeted pitch this year. There were a lot fewer star-studded tweets promoting the website and coverage.\n\nRed states whose political leaders oppose the ACA the most have seen a huge surge in enrollment, \u201cRepublicans who thought that they were stopping the law by refusing to set up their own state exchanges have created a trap for themselves. Florida, Maine, Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina have all covered at least 40% of their eligible residents under the federal exchange. Arkansas also depends on subsidies to fund their \u201cprivate option\u201d plan. All of these states will face an immediate backlash if the Supreme Court rules that only states that have set up exchanges are eligible for subsidies.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the ACA deadline can come and go and civilization will not collapse is proof that Republicans have been and remain completely wrong on healthcare. Tens of millions of people have access to affordable healthcare because of the law.\n\nThe mainstream press has largely ignored the story of the biggest change to the nation\u2019s health care accessibility in decades exceeding goals and expectations. The press remains interested in only discussing perceived failures. The same media establishment that was breathlessly predicting doom for the ACA when the website launch struggled is silent today.\n\nThe ACA is working. Demand is higher than even the White House predicted, but don\u2019t expect to hear any of this from a media that delights in criticizing this president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The media hasn't talked about Obamacare since the website was fixed, but very quietly the president's health care law has morphed into a raging success as enrollment is projected to be 2 million over the administration's 2015 goal.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The media hasn't talked about Obamacare since the website was fixed, but very quietly the president's health care law has morphed into a raging success as enrollment is projected to be 2 million over the administration's 2015 goal.", "title": "Another Obama Success The Media Won't Talk About: Obamacare To Blow Past 2015 Goals", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/15/obama-success-media-talk-about-obamacare-blow-2015-goals.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Obama_On_Computer.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-15T16:10:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,aca deadline,aca sign up numbers,obamacare enrollment deadline,red states obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-02-15T16:10:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-15T16:10:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aca deadline, aca sign up numbers, obamacare enrollment deadline, red states obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9efc\"", "article_summary": "Demand is higher than even the White House predicted, but don\u2019t expect to hear any of this from a media that delights in criticizing this president.\nThe White House intentionally adopted a lower key, more targeted pitch this year.\nThe same media establishment that was breathlessly predicting doom for the ACA when the website launch struggled is silent today.\nExpectations are the ACA will blow past the administration\u2019s goal of 9 million for 2015.\nEnrollment as of February 13 was estimated to be at 11.3 million."}
