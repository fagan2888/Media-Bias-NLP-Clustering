That makes us do our job a little bit better. When they're happy, we're happy, we do a great job and everybody has a fantastic time.\"\n\nIf you missed the pirate party Friday or Saturday, you still have one more day to catch the action .\n\nSunday, October 11th, the pirates will move to Grand Lagoon at the Captain Anderson's Marina.
