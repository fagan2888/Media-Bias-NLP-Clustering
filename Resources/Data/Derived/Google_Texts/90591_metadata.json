Your illness is not as bad as you make it out to be. You don\u2019t have to think about your bipolar disorder that frequently. Bipolar disorder is not a real medical illness.\n\nHowever, people who have real experience with bipolar, including consumers, doctors, and therapists, find it the illness extremely valid, hard to treat, and chronic and lifelong in nature.\n\nI have never had a psychiatrist, nurse, or licensed professional counselor tell me any of the things listed above.\n\nThe people who say these things are usually \u201claypeople\u201d who have no practical experience with bipolar, or that desperately want to convince themselves that illnesses such as these are not real (or as bad as we say it is) in order to protect their feelings.\n\nI don\u2019t get upset about these opinions because they are just that\u2014it is quite clear to quickly discern when you are talking to someone that knows nothing about mental illness.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, really, that the most ignorant people I\u2019ve met in life happen to be the ones with the most \u201cadvice\u201d.\n\nIt seems like a defense mechanism, for various reasons.\n\nBut what\u2019s the point?\n\nModern society has become a place where everyone thinks they are an expert on everything. Just take a look at Twitter.\n\nWe now have the itch to express what we are thinking all the time\u2014even if no one asked us.\n\nThat opportunity allows me to write this blog. However, this opinion-based society does not, by its very nature, always promote the greater good.\n\n\u201cEveryone experiences those types of symptoms.\u201d\n\nThis opinion is one of the biggest indicators that a person does not even have basic knowledge of bipolar disorder.\n\nYes, you\u2019re right that every person is capable of getting angry, being sad, and feeling elated.\n\nObviously, many people are unclear about the extremes in mood that define this disorder.\n\nDuring extreme episodes of mania, I have experienced paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations.\n\nMy depressive episodes have resulted in suicide attempts, self-harm, and distorted thinking.\n\nIn taking the time to educate oneself about bipolar disorder, the validity of the difference between typical mood swings and bipolar mood swings becomes very clear.\n\n\u201cSurely you don\u2019t need medication for the rest of your life\u2026do you even need it now?\u201d\n\nYep\u2014maybe I\u2019m under the false impression that I will be dealing with this chronic condition for the rest of my life\u2014maybe several professional clinicians, over the course of 13 years, are lying to me.\n\nBipolar disorder is a chronic brain illness that ebbs and flows, but does not show evidence of ever \u201cgoing away\u201d. In fact, without treatment, bipolar disorder symptoms get worse.\n\nI know several people diagnosed with bipolar that are twice my age that would vouch for the fact that bipolar disorder will not loosen it\u2019s grip if we ignore it.\n\n\u201cIs bipolar disorder really that bad?\u201d\n\nThere are days when my bipolar symptoms don\u2019t affect me, sure.\n\nBut you know what? I am jumping for joy on those days.\n\nLike any chronic illness, it\u2019s always there, and it is going to remind you that it is, especially if you don\u2019t take care of yourself.\n\nIt is true that you can take steps to lessen the negative impact of the illness.\n\nHowever, bipolar disorder can and will take control when it wants, even if you are taking your medication.\n\n\u201cDo you really need to think about bipolar all the time?\u201d\n\nThe short answer\u2014yes.\n\nI take medication for it every day. I am affected by symptoms like irritability and low energy quite frequently and that is quite a vivid reminder.\n\nI don\u2019t think about it 24 hours a day, but just like a physical illness like diabetes, if you ignore it, you\u2019re being irresponsible with your health.\n\n\u201cIs bipolar even real?\u201d\n\nThis is the best one. This takes the cake.\n\nThe term \u201cmanic depression\u201d, the first term referring to bipolar disorder, was formulated by a German psychiatrist in the early 1900s. References to this illness have been in every single Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders since the publication\u2019s inception.\n\nLithium, still considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for bipolar treatment, was added into the practice of psychiatry around 1950.\n\nSince then, progress on information relating to the validity and the treatment of bipolar disorder has developed rapidly.\n\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it. Ask the medical doctors and world-renowned scientists at the National Institute of Mental Health, the World Health Organization, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, and the top medical schools in the country if bipolar disorder is a \u201creal illness\u201d.\n\nBipolar disorder mimics many other life experiences that are only experienced by a small percentage of people, in that the majority of others cannot imagine what it is like to walk in our shoes.\n\nThe easiest thing is to ignore or refute what you don\u2019t understand. That is a very closed-minded and unfortunate way to live.\n\nHave you heard any of these opinions? Which one do you hear the most? How do you choose to respond, if at all?\n\nSources:\n\nBP Hope: Through the Ages, It\u2019s Been Here\n\nPhoto Credit: Daniel Go via Compfight", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Psych Central.com", "description": "If you have bipolar disorder, you\u2019ve probably had the pleasure (cough, cough) of dealing with people who feel the need to tell you the \u201ctruth\u201d about your illness.
