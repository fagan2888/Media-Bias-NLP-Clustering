But the OFA haul of nearly $21 million this year has been led by 19 individuals\u2014including one married couple\u2014that have raised $100,000 or more for the organization, or over $3.3 million combined. Here are the 19 individuals, with their title and total amount given, who form the big-money core of the Obama effort.\n\nFred Eychaner, CEO of Newsweb Corp., $500,000\n\nEychaner has ponied up as much as anyone else for OFA. Ironically, liberals can thank Fox News and the Wall Street Journal media titan, Republican billionaire Rupert Murdoch, for Eychaner\u2019s generosity: Eychaner, the CEO of Newsweb Corp., a Chicago-based commercial printing company, sold Murdoch a Chicago television station for $425 million in 2002.\n\nIn 2012, Eychaner gave $3.5 million to Priorities USA (infamous for running an ad basically blaming Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for a woman\u2019s cancer death), nearly $4 million to Majority PAC, $3.75 million to House Majority PAC, and another $750,000 for Women Vote!, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). He also bundled at least $500,000 for Obama.\n\nA ballet-lover, Eychaner was appointed by President Obama in 2010 as a General Trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He is also on the Chicago Joffrey Ballet Board of Directors, which holds Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel as Honorary Chairman. It seems that Eychaner, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, has earned Obama\u2019s graces. But he has also stayed in Hillary\u2019s, donating more than $25 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the Washington Post.\n\nKimberly White / Bloomberg News / Getty Images David Shaw\n\nDavid Shaw, Founder of hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co., $500,000\n\nIn 1996, Fortune called Shaw\u2019s company, D.E. Shaw & Co., \u201cthe ultimate quant shop, a nest of mathematicians, computer scientists, and other devotees of quantitative analysis who use their arcane sciences to monitor the world\u2019s financial markets and squeeze profits out of places most people would never think of looking.\u201d\n\nShaw\u2019s success in the years since have allowed him to leave his perch atop Wall Street and conduct research in the field of computational biochemistry and promote Democratic causes. As a top Democrat backer, he and his wife Beth have doled out half a million to OFA, bundled between $200,000 and $500,000 for the Obama 2012 campaign, and hosted fundraisers at his Upper West side home in New York city. He served on the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology for Presidents Clinton (1994) and Obama (2009) and is now worth $3.5 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nShaw\u2019s and Eychaner\u2019s fundraising of $500,000 each would have allowed them the privilege of serving on an advisory board with quartely meetings with the president, according to a February report in the New York Times, but the White House has subsequently disputed a price-for-access program.\n\nAmy Goldman Fowler, Real Estate Heiress, $250,000\n\nFowler is the daughter of Sol Goldman, a real estate investor who once co-owned the Chrysler building. Despite donating at least $1.5 million to Planned Parenthood in 2011 and 2012, Fowler is much better known in vegetable garden circles than for her Democratic efforts. But if her continued spending holds up\u2014Fowler has already given $250,000 to Planned Parenthood\u2019s Action Fund for the 2013-2014 cycle\u2014she\u2019ll be better known how she uses her funds as a heiress than her last book, The Heirloom Tomato.\n\nPhilip Munger, Philanthropist, $250,000\n\nThe first, single largest contribution to Organizing for Action came from New York philanthropist Munger, the son of Charles Munger, the billionaire who serves as right-hand man to Obama-pal Warren Buffett. Philip Munger has been active in Democratic causes, donating $450,000 to left-leaning candidates since 2008, according to the Financial Times. Philip\u2019s brother Charles, on the other hand, gave over $2 million to Romney and various political groups in the 2012 cycle, according to CRP.\n\nJudith and Bill Scheide, Philanthropists, $250,000\n\nThe Scheides gave $317,600 to Democratic causes in the 2012 cycle, and bundled between $50,000 and $100,000 according to CRP. They are members of Corporate Accountability International and have an eponymous rare book collection (including a Shakespeare First Folio) within Princeton University\u2019s library. Bill, a musician who founded the Bach Aria Group, earned his money the old-fashioned way, inheriting his family\u2019s fortune from Standard Oil.\n\nRyan Smith, Man of Mystery, $201,260\n\nSmith is identified in OFA records as hailing from Salt Lake City, Utah, but otherwise there are few public records identifying him. According to CRP, Smith is not related to Utah\u2019s Ryan Smith of Qualtrics.\n\nAnne Getty Earhart, Heiress $150,000\n\nEarhart inherited $400 million from her grandfather, oilman J. Paul Getty, in 1986, according to California Watch. In the 2012 cycle, she gave three Democratic PACs a total of $1.75 million, according to CRP. A trustee on the California Nature Conservancy board, she has donated in the past to PACs promoting candidates with environmental friendly records.\n\nRyan Miller / Getty Images\n\nMarcy Carsey, T.V. producer, $125,000\n\nAlthough she wasn\u2019t featured in John McCain\u2019s 2008 attack ad, Carsey is a Hollywood super star, and Obama is lucky to have her. Carsey, of Carsey-Werner productions, is one of most powerful people in show business, responsible for some of TVs most popular shows, including, \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d \u201dRoseanne,\u201d and \u201cThat 70s Show.\u201d The Emmy-award winning television producer has donated $20 million to her alma mater, the University of New Hampshire, to create a public policy school.\n\nIn the past Carsey has been a strong supporter of Emily\u2019s List, which supports pro-choice female Democrats, and she\u2019s earnestly awaiting the first female president\u2014she donated in June $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary PAC, the ceiling limit the group has allowed. She hosted Jon Carson, the OFA director, Obama\u2019s re-election manager Jim Messina and finance director Rufus Gifford for a State of the Union watch party earlier this year.\n\nJohn D. Goldman, former Chairman of Willis Insurance Services of California, Inc., $125,000\n\nGoldman made his money in insurance but has turned to focus on the arts and Stanford, where he earned his MBA. A President of the San Francisco Symphony, Goldman was named by President Obama to the Advisory Committee on the Arts for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 2011. Goldman has already spent nearly $65,000 this year in preparation for the 2014 midterms, and threw in a few thousand for Rep. Joe Kennedy\u2019s reelection race.\n\nNicola M. Miner, Oracle Heiress, $125,000\n\nThe daughter of a co-founder of Oracle, Miner gave $123,813 in the 2012 cycle, most of it to the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and three other Democratic PACs\u2014House Majority, Majority, and American Bridget 21st Century. Miner has given over $30,000 to the DCCC this year.\n\nMilner and her husband, Boonville author Robert Mailer Anderson, are also big bundlers. They hosted Obama for a dinner last year, charging the 70 supporters reportedly $35,800 per ticket. In October, the couple held a luncheon at the San Francisco Jazz Center for Obama to benefit the DNC; tickets reportedly ran up to $10,000 for a family of five.\n\nImaad Zuberi, Venture Capitalist, $125,000\n\nZuberi, who sits on the Executive Committee for the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, is a partner at a boutique private equity firm in California. During the President\u2019s reelection race, Zuberi bundled at least $500,000 for the President, and gave over $50,000 of his own money to Obama and the DNC in 2012, according to CRP. This year, Zuberi has given over $30,000 to the DNC and over $10,000 more to Democratic incumbents.\n\nJonathan Alcorn / Bloomberg / Getty Images Stephen Cloobeck\n\nStephen Cloobeck, Founder of Diamond Resorts International, $100,000\n\nStephen Cloobeck is the Chairman and Founder of Diamond Resorts International, which owns and operates vacation ownership resorts with its subsidiaries around the world. A bipartisan donor, Cloobeck has given thousands of dollars this year to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the newest Senator, Cory Booker (D-N.J.), according to CRP.
