DURANGO, Colo. (AP) — Southern Ute tribal members are concerned about the fate of the Southern Ute Cultural Center and Museum and the artifacts of their ancestors.

The Southern Ute Tribal Council is canceling the museum’s nonprofit status and has announced a management takeover because the museum has not met its financial goals for five years.

Tribal Council member Amy Barry says the museum is now conducting an inventory to find out what is on loan and what the museum bought.

According to the Durango Herald (http://tinyurl.com/joq2owu ), collections must be given back to their owners or renegotiated if it loses nonprofit status.

Some donors have already reclaimed their artifacts.
