The subsidiary also paid out 105 percent of the income it received in premiums to cover health claims. For the 71,709 new members on Medicaid, the numbers were far worse, with Partners paying out 120 percent of its premium income to cover claims.\n\nThe health care giant also said its insurance subsidiary incurred $20 million in unrecovered costs for Sovaldi, a wonder drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2013 to treat hepatitis C patients. The drug is priced at $1,000 a pill and typically costs $84,000 for a standard course of treatment, which usually results in a cure. Partners said the state did not adjust rates to reflect the cost of the new drug. Partners also said Neighborhood Health Plan lost $11 million in revenue \u201cresulting from the state\u2019s delay in effectively implementing an insurance exchange pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBMC Health Net Plan, an insurance subsidiary of Boston Medical Center, reported a $43 million operating loss for the year ending Sept. 30 for many of the same reasons. A company spokesman said its Sovaldi losses were $19 million and the remaining $24 million in losses came from the Patrick administration\u2019s \u201cAffordable Care Act implementation, or lack thereof.\u201d\n\nThe handful of companies who insure state Medicaid patients received a 3.7 percent average increase in rates starting in October, but they said that boost was half of what they needed to break even. Rich Copp, a spokesman for Partners, said the company is talking with state officials about the problem but declined to characterize those negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a process. We\u2019re working with the state to address the rate issues,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Kibbe, a spokesman for the executive office of Health and Human Services, confirmed talks are going on with the so-called managed care organizations that provide insurance coverage to Medicaid patients. \u201cWe have had ongoing conversations with MCOs about their financial performance, and are working with Neighborhood Health on their specific issues,\u201d he said.\n\nCopp said Partners has not ordered layoffs or other cost-cutting measures at Neighborhood Health Plan to deal with the losses. Officials previously said they are exploring options to address the losses at the insurance subsidiary, including the remote possibility of selling the company.\n\nState officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nMeet the Author Bruce Mohl Editor , CommonWealth About Bruce Mohl Bruce Mohl is the editor of CommonWealth magazine.
