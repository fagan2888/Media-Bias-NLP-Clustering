A plan to allow Colorado to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with universal health care will be on the Colorado ballot in 2016.

Supporters of universal health care attained over 158,000 qualified signatures, 60,000 more than required to put the measure on the ballot.

The ColoradoCareYes campaign says the plan would cost $3 billion per year; however, it would save $9 billion in health care costs. Employers would pay 7% of a worker’s wages into the system while workers would put 3% into the system.

Dissenters claim the measure would be too costly.

In 2011, Vermont lawmakers passed universal health care; however, earlier this year the state abandoned the $4.3 billion single-payer plan, stating it was too expensive.

As noted by Al Jazeera America, “the campaign is expected to face intense opposition and could make for a heavily funded, highly visible debate over the viability of single-payer health care in a key swing state in the 2016 presidential election.”
