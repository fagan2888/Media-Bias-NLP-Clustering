Dr. Oz Teams Up with Charlie Sheen to Find the Cure for HIV

One of the men is a heart surgeon and television host and the other is working to kick his drugs-and-prostitutes image; although an unlikely duo, they have a common goal in mind.It was less than two months ago that Charlie Sheen confirmed in an interview on the TODAY show that he is infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Sheen revealed that he has unprotected sex because of his undetectable levels of HIV, thanks to medication. On January 6, Dr. Oz appeared on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen and weighed in on Sheen’s recent divulgation. A woman called in and asked about the upcoming interview with Sheen on The Dr. Oz Show – which is set to air on January 11 and 12.“He wants to chase the cure, and so, we’re going to be taking some untraveled roads together looking for it,” Dr. Oz said, referring to the former Two and Half Men star.It’s no secret, and frankly no surprise, that multiple women have come forward with lawsuits against Sheen, claiming that he never disclosed his HIV status to them before having protected or unprotected sex. However, one woman who had sex with Sheen will appear on The Dr. Oz Show interview – but she not suing the star. In fact, the woman is a nurse and pointed out that there has never been a case where an infected man with undetectable HIV levels passed on the virus to another person. It sounds like this particular woman was aware that Sheen was HIV-positive beforehand.But what does Dr. Oz have to say about Sheen’s sexual activity sans protection?“I still think it’s irresponsible to have sex if you have HIV without protection,” he affirmed.Grab the popcorn, this should be a good episode.
