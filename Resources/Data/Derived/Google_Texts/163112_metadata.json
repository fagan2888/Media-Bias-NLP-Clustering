The company's job was to build software to accept online applications and payments from consumers buying from Nevada's health insurance marketplace under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe state launched the software a year ago today. But it never worked correctly. An audit found 1,500 glitches and consumers complained they paid for insurance but got nothing in return.\n\nUnder the original contract, the state was scheduled to pay Xerox $22 million by now. But the state has paid only $12.3 million.\n\nXerox has filed invoices, or requests for payment, for an additional $4.4 million this year. Requests for about one-quarter of that money came after the state fired Xerox in May, according to documents obtained by the Sun through a request under Nevada public records law.\n\nThat money hasn't been paid, and it's unclear why.\n\nThat leaves a balance of about $5.3 million on the $22 million schedule. The state either refused to pay or Xerox never asked for that money, said Shawna DeRousse, chief operating officer of the exchange.\n\nThe jobs that the company hasn't been paid for line up with problems highlighted by audits and consumers' complaints, including the payment system.\n\n\u201cThere are still deliverables that we have not accepted,\u201d DeRousse said\n\nNevada and Xerox have so far decided to resolve their disputes quietly, in private and out of court.\n\nOfficials at the state and Xerox declined to disclose details of their negotiations.\n\nThe Nevada attorney general also refused the Sun's request under the state's public records law to disclose all of Xerox's billings and invoices.\n\nNormally, records about state spending are quickly disclosed. But in a letter, Deputy Attorney General Dennis Belcourt said public interest in keeping some of the state\u2019s financial records private outweighed the public benefit in making them public.\n\nPrivacy, said state spokesman Tyler Klimas, offers \u201cthe best outcome and benefit for Nevadans.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its state contract talks, Xerox faces two class-action lawsuits because of the exchange's failures. Around 150 consumers representing the class said they paid Xerox for health insurance but didn\u2019t receive it. Insurance brokers also sued to recover fees they said they never received through the system.\n\nNevada and the nation Nevada lawmakers and Gov. Brian Sandoval created the Silver State Exchange in 2011 to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Nevada was one of 17 states \u2014 and the only one with a Republican governor \u2014 to build a state-run system. The state predicted 118,000 people would buy health insurance plans through the exchange. But only an estimated 38,000 people signed up. Because the software was so flawed, all of those people must re-enroll again this fall through the federal government's online software system. Nevada is one of four states to scrap exchanges built for the 2013-2014 enrollment period. Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon are the others.\n\nNot all states and software companies have been so private about their breakups.\n\nIn Oregon, software giant Oracle sued the state in August in federal court and demanded $23 million. The state then sued Oracle in state court and accused the company of wire fraud.\n\nIn Nevada, both sides say the talks have been amicable.\n\nXerox has a reason to keep the break up graceful. The company, which hopes to continue expanding from copier company to software contractor, has ongoing business in Nevada and in the health care industry.\n\nIts health care division serves 36 million people in 37 states, including Affordable Care Act software in Kentucky, Connecticut and Virginia. Xerox also recently won a $500 million contract in New York to build Medicaid software.\n\nDespite its health exchange problems, Xerox salvaged other contracts in Nevada.\n\nSandoval briefly held up two Xerox contracts worth $7.8 million for work with the state Treasurer's Office. The contracts had no relation to the health care exchange, but Sandoval wanted to make sure the problems wouldn't be repeated.\n\nXerox also has a long history of providing copiers and scanners to state offices.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After firing Xerox for major flaws with its health insurance software, Nevada\u2019s leaders are in confidential talks with the tech company to close out the $75 million contract and ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "After firing Xerox for major flaws with its health insurance software, Nevada\u2019s leaders are in confidential talks with the tech company to close out the $75 million contract and ...", "title": "Nevada, Xerox in private talks to settle $75 million health care contract out of court", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2014/oct/01/nevada-xerox-private-talks-settle-75-million-healt/", "image": "http://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/croppedphotos/2013/06/21/0825_SUN_Dottys_01_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LasVegasSun", "image": "//media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/croppedphotos/2013/06/21/0825_SUN_Dottys_01_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "creator": "@KyleRoerink1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-01T02:00", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/kyle-roerink/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "news_keywords": "Politics,News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa71\"", "article_summary": "Nevada, Xerox in private talks to settle $75 million health care contract out of courtAfter firing Xerox for major flaws with its health insurance software, Nevada\u2019s leaders are in confidential talks with the tech company to close out the $75 million contract and keep the dispute out of court.\nThe contracts had no relation to the health care exchange, but Sandoval wanted to make sure the problems wouldn't be repeated.\nIts health care division serves 36 million people in 37 states, including Affordable Care Act software in Kentucky, Connecticut and Virginia.\nAround 150 consumers representing the class said they paid Xerox for health insurance but didn\u2019t receive it.\nXerox also recently won a $500 million contract in New York to build Medicaid software."}
