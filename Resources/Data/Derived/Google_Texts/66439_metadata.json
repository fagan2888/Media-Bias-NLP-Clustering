It is part of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, but many of the changes occurred on October 1, 2013.\n\nIn recent years, FEMA has been giving out more money in helping with natural disasters than they have been taking in. Because of that FEMA is making some changes, meaning some people\u2019s insurance rates will go up, while others may go down.\n\nLife on the river can be peaceful, even serene. Don Hudson knows, he\u2019s lived on the Rock River for 35 years.\n\n\u201cIt's a great place to live,\u201d said Hudson.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a dark side to the river life,\n\n\u201cYou're gambling,\u201d said Hudson.\n\nThat dark side is flooding.\n\n\u201cLast couple of years, we didn't get any water and we thought aw heck, we don't need it, and then all of a sudden\u2026it hit us,\u201d he added.\n\nHi them with $7,000 in damage because the Hudson\u2019s didn\u2019t have flood insurance. They\u2019re now getting insurance, but because they weren\u2019t insured when the Biggert-Waters Act went into effect, they\u2019ll be paying a lot more.\n\n\u201cOh yes, ya, an awful lot more,\u201d said Hudson.\n\nStarting October 1, 2013, businesses, owners of homes with severe repetitive loss, those not insured, and those who have a lapse in their policy will have to pay a 25% increase in premium rates each year until they meet the full rates.\n\n\"It could definitely be hundreds, I don't know that I've seen anything go up thousands yet. Could it? Possibly,\" said Lynn Fox of Molyneaux Insurance.\n\nThey'll also have to fill out an elevation certificate, which will determine how much flood insurance could cost.\n\n\"They might have lower or they might have higher flood insurance,\" said Fox.\n\nBut for Don, the $400 cost of the certificate, plus an initial estimate of $2,700 a year for insurance,\n\n\u201cIt means bankruptcy, cause we're, we're both retired and we only got so much, and by the time you pay all this insurance you gotta pay, it's gonna kill us,\u201d said Hudson.\n\nOne realtor News Eight talked with said some homeowners who live near Duck Creek could see their rates jump from $1,000 a year to $6,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buried in the government shutdown and even the launch of Obamacare, is an increase in some flood insurance rates.
