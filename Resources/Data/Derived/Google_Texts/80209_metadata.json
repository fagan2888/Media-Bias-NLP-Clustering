Ms. Fernandez\u2019s handpicked heir, Buenos Aires Gov. Daniel Scioli, scored 48 percent and conceded early on on the election night.\n\nA highly emotional Mr. Macri danced and sang to chants of \u201cArgentina, Argentina\u201d and \u201cYes, we can\u201d from the crowd gathered at his victory rally. Accompanied by leaders of his Cambiemos coalition of both center-left and center-right forces, he reiterated his key campaign promises of eliminating poverty and fighting the drug trade.\n\n\u201cThank you for having believed that, together, we can build the Argentina we deserve,\u201d Mr. Macri said. \u201cToday is a historic day. It\u2019s a change of times.\u201d\n\nIn an apparent effort to counter those who had painted him as the candidate of the rich, Mr. Macri paid special homage to his longtime secretary, Anita, whom he invited onto the stage and included in a long list of \u201cthank you\u201d greetings to political leaders and operatives.\n\nThe president-elect had long been viewed as the underdog until Mr. Scioli scored unexpectedly little support in the vote\u2019s Oct. 25 first round. But most who last month backed third-place finisher Sergio Massa apparently went for Mr. Macri on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a new era of dialogue [and] respect, an era in which we can work [together] even though we think differently,\u201d Mr. Massa, who served as Cabinet chief before breaking with Ms. Fernandez, said in an apparent jab at the president with whom the capital\u2019s mayor had a tense relationship.\n\nMr. Scioli, meanwhile, congratulated his rival while defending the outgoing president\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cThe people have chosen an alternative,\u201d the governor said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that God enlightens him.\u201d\n\nWith his victory, Mr. Macri \u2014 who founded his center-right PRO party just 10 years ago \u2014 put an end to the 12-year reign in which Ms. Fernandez and Nestor Kirchner, her late husband and predecessor, dominated the Argentine political landscape with a leftist brand of Peronism that had seemed invincible.\n\nBut on Dec. 10, the outgoing president will be forced to bestow the presidential sash upon her successor, whom she accused of having run a \u201csewer campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitically, it means the end of the Kirchnerist era after 12 years,\u201d said Mariano de Vedia, a political commentator for the La Nacion daily.\n\nTo battle rampant inflation and attract foreign investments, Mr. Macri is likely to revise key tenets of the incumbent\u2019s economic policy. Most notably, he has promised to do away with the unpopular currency controls put into place to prop up an economy reeling from the end of a commodities boom, which in turn powered the first part of the Kirchners\u2019 rule.\n\nOn the international front, the 56-year-old engineer may rethink the partnerships Ms. Fernandez forged with Beijing and Moscow, and instead try to mend the strained ties with Washington that the two-term president leaves behind, Mr. de Vedia said.\n\n\u201cHe is going to exhibit a government [that is] more aligned with the United States and with Europe,\u201d Mr. de Vedia said. \u201cThat change will be immediate, I believe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Macri\u2019s victory almost certainly spells an end to Argentina\u2019s entanglement with Venezuela, whose leftist leaders \u2014 embattled President Nicolas Maduro and his late predecessor, Hugo Chavez \u2014 the Kirchners counted among their closest allies, said political scientist Pablo Camusso.\n\nMr. Macri repeatedly has accused Mr. Maduro of human right violations and has called for Caracas to be suspended from the Mercosur trade bloc.\n\n\u201cHe could produce an earthquake with respect to what was, for a decade, [Argentina\u2018s] foreign policy in Latin America.\u201d Mr. Camusso said. \u201cMacri\u2019s victory will lead to certain complications with the Mercosur.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s inauguration will take place in fewer than 20 days in the Argentine Congress, where Mr. Marci\u2019s Cambiemos coalition lacks a majority. Mr. Macri will thus need to forge deals with Peronist lawmakers now loyal to Ms. Fernandez, a feat possible only if more moderate forces take control of Argentina\u2019s dominant political movement.\n\nThough his PRO party will control the key electoral districts of Buenos Aires City and the surrounding province, Mr. Macri seems aware of his predicament in the legislature and has not tired of exhorting the values of \u201cdialogue\u201d during his campaign. He further urged the outgoing president to ensure an \u201corderly transition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that we will all be working [together] as we sit around the same table on Dec. 11,\u201d Mr. Marci said.\n\nThe role Ms. Fernandez may play on that date, or what her political fate may hold during the next four years, meanwhile, remains a mystery. But the 62-year-old may well aspire to retain \u2014 or regain \u2014 the leadership of the Peronist movement, Mr. de Vedia said.\n\n\u201cThat is not going to be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be a mid- to long-term strategy.\u201d\n\nAt least on Sunday, though, Ms. Fernandez seemed to have understood that the political winds in Argentina were changing.\n\n\u201cThe future will now be what Argentines want it to be,\u201d she said after voting in the southern Santa Cruz province. \u201cNothing is forever.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mauricio Macri will be Argentina's next president as voters on Sunday picked the center-right Buenos Aires mayor to succeed populist Cristina Fernandez, the winner's longtime political nemesis.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mauricio Macri will be Argentina\u2019s next president as voters on Sunday picked the center-right Buenos Aires mayor to succeed populist Cristina Fernandez, the winner\u2019s longtime political nemesis.", "title": "Mauricio Macri wins Argentina presidential runoff, ends Kirchners\u2019 leftist reign", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/mauricio-macri-wins-argentina-presidential-runoff-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/11222015_argentina-elections-738201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/11222015_argentina-elections-738201.jpg", "description": "Mauricio Macri will be Argentina's next president as voters on Sunday picked the center-right Buenos Aires mayor to succeed populist Cristina Fernandez, the winner's longtime political nemesis.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mauricio Macri wins Argentina presidential runoff, ends Kirchners\u0335"}, "Author": "Andre F.
