If the hospitals agree to the extension, the state would promise to rule by Nov. 30. If the hospitals decline, the state says it will rule by May 28, according to the commissioners\u2019 letter.\n\nHospital association officials confirmed receipt of the response Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe received the response from DSS/DRS and are reviewing it with counsel,\" said Michele Sharp, vice president of communications for the CHA.\n\nFriday\u2019s state response comes after months of intense feuding over the hospital tax.\n\nThe state began collecting the tax in 2012, intending to redistribute the proceeds to the hospitals as a way of drawing down matching federal grants. That year the hospitals paid about $350 million in taxes and received about $400 million in state and federal funds.\n\nBut when the state began experiencing severe budget pressures, it started returning less and less to the hospitals. This year, hospitals are projected to owe $556.1 million in taxes but are slated to receive only $164.3 million.\n\nThe payout could have been even less. In September, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy slashed the state budget, cutting the amount going to $64 million. In response, the Connecticut Hospital Association started an aggressive PR campaign to reverse the cuts.\n\nThe governor countered by shaming health care executives over their multi-million-dollar salaries and the hospitals\u2019 supposedly high profit margins.\n\nA December budget deal arrived at the $164.3 million figure.\n\nHospital and CHA officials have said they hope to keep this dispute out of the courts. But if they do so, they won\u2019t be the first in the region; their counterparts in New Hampshire fought a similar fight and were able to force a settlement that restored the flow of revenue to the hospitals.\n\nConnecticut hospital officials and advocates have repeatedly said the hospital tax is costing them millions of dollars and forcing hospitals to cut services and staff.\n\n\u201cOur goal is fairly simple,\u201d Stephen Frayne, the CHA\u2019s senior vice president of health policy, said earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019d prefer to be taking care of patients rather than have to fight this out in the court system, but we are left with no choice because we\u2019re being taxed into oblivion.\u201d\n\nIn response to the original filing, Department of Social Services spokesman David Dearborn cited figures suggesting that state hospitals had more than $900 million in profits last year \u2014 although the CHA disputes those figures as grossly misleading.\n\nDearborn also contended that Medicaid payments to hospitals have increased over the last decade, and that hospitals are seeing fewer patients without coverage because of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cEven in an industry that made $916 million last year alone - and one in which there is exorbitant CEO pay - the hospital association is asking Connecticut taxpayers to foot more of the bill,\u201d said Dearborn in a statement earlier in January.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "The filings requested that the state departments of revenue and social services issue declaratory rulings that the tax is invalid and unenforceable, a key step toward a possible legal battle with the state.
