These include such provisions as limits on pre-existing condition exclusions, prohibitions on health-status-based discrimination, guarantees on renewability of coverage and mental health coverage parity.\n\nThe final regulations are effective Dec. 1 and apply to group health plans and group health insurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nEligibility for excepted benefits also doesn't preclude an inpidual from getting a premium tax credit to help pay for coverage in an ACA exchange, a factor that could be key for employers since they won't face penalties under the ACA employer mandate unless an employee got such a credit.\n\nIn the final rules, the departments of the Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services said they finalized the proposed rules, issued Dec. 20 (see previous article), with only minor modifications.\n\nDental, Vision, Long-Term Care\n\nWith regard to limited-scope vision and dental benefits as well as long-term care benefits, the final rules stuck with the proposal to eliminate the requirement under HIPAA regulations that participants pay an additional premium or contribution for limited-scope vision or dental benefits to qualify as excepted benefits.\n\nThe departments said the final regulations clarify that the benefits don't have to be offered in connection with a separate offer of major medical or \u201cprimary\u201d group health coverage under a plan \u201cto meet the statutory criterion that such benefits are \u2018otherwise not an integral part of the plan.' \u201d\n\nThe final rules state that vision, dental or long-term care benefits can qualify as excepted benefits if they meet one of two criteria: participants in an employer's primary health-care plan are allowed to decline the benefits or the claims for the benefits are administered under a separate contract from claims administration for any other benefits under the plan.\n\nEmployee Assistance Programs\n\nThe final rules largely kept the four criteria for employee assistance programs the same as in the proposed regulations.\n\nThose are:\n\nthey don't provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care,\n\ntheir benefits can't be coordinated with the benefits under another group health plan,\n\nthey can't require employee premiums or contributions as a condition of participation, and\n\nthey can't impose cost-sharing requirements.\n\nWraparound Coverage\n\nIn the final rules, the departments said they were postponing addressing limited wraparound coverage, saying they still intend to publish regulations on the matter, \u201ctaking into account the extensive comments received on this issue.\u201d\n\nIn comments on the proposed rules, employee benefits, business and medical groups said the provisions on wraparound coverage wouldn't benefit workers who will most need such supplemental coverage: those who will go to the ACA marketplaces for health insurance because either their employer dropped coverage or they aren't eligible for or can't afford the employer-provided coverage (see previous article).\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and America's Health Insurance Plans went further, saying the federal government should withdraw this part of the proposal.\n\nWraparound coverage supplements core coverage and, in the health-care context, might provide such things as extra benefits, broader networks or cost-sharing reductions.\n\nThe final regulations are effective Dec. 1 and apply to group health plans and group health insurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2015. They are scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Oct. 1.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Phil Kushin at pkushin@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Sue Doyle at sdoyle@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/excepted-benefits-final-n17179895629/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Final rules on health-care benefits exempt from market reforms instituted by two major federal laws provide criteria for dental, vision and long-term care benefits and employee assistance programs...", "title": "Excepted Benefits Final Rules Address Dental, Vision, but Punt on Wraparound"}, "csrf-token": "8eyH--KI5dKhR8PiEL-qMY38GJtvxd4f7mzB0_r_HG87cvSZlPwb-1gIaQzAHqPZ85xYKYC5JPMYoL8VJQUfOraIoJc3xz1BeNx7YtPGeCc1:JqnG4jKHgCLnmguRDuqITkzvZFv7VOYcGb92E-q29LpJLPti7BPYLXZNM_eSbLeNXggt_8HNPpu1FA4q95ZkZ6lJ_cZEaH5Hr-Cnhi67Nr81", "description": "Final rules on health-care benefits exempt from market reforms instituted by two major federal laws provide criteria for dental, vision and long-term care benefits and employee assistance programs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "9697, RIN 1545-BL90), issued Sept. 26, address one of four forms of excepted benefits: limited excepted benefits, which include, among other things, limited-scope vision or dental benefits and long-term care benefits.\nDental, Vision, Long-Term CareWith regard to limited-scope vision and dental benefits as well as long-term care benefits, the final rules stuck with the proposal to eliminate the requirement under HIPAA regulations that participants pay an additional premium or contribution for limited-scope vision or dental benefits to qualify as excepted benefits.\nThe final rules (T.D.\nThe final regulations are effective Dec. 1 and apply to group health plans and group health insurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2015.\nThese include such provisions as limits on pre-existing condition exclusions, prohibitions on health-status-based discrimination, guarantees on renewability of coverage and mental health coverage parity."}
