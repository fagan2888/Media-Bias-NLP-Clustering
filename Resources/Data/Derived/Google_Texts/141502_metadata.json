But the Interior Department is not alone; the inspector general position is vacant in seven other agencies as well.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, held a hearing recently to address \u201cwhy this White House, who claimed to wanting to be the most transparent administration in history, has taken so long to fill so many positions of inspectors general.\u201d\n\nSome 33 federal agencies are required by law to have presidentially appointed inspectors general to identify wasteful practices and general government misconduct. But, according to the Project on Governmental Oversight, the Obama administration has left these positions open for, on average, 613 days, which is hundreds of days longer than even President Clinton, who was second with 453 days.\n\nJohnson said having acting inspectors general in these roles is not the same as those who confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhen IG positions remain unfilled, their offices are run by acting IGs who, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned, are not granted the same protections afforded to Senate-confirmed IGs,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey are not truly independent, as they can be removed by the agency at any time; they are only temporary and do not drive office policy, and they are at greater risk of compromising their work to appease the agency or the president.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has been operating with a temporary inspector general since December 2013. The Department of Interior has been without a permanent inspector general for more than six years.\n\nBut there is another problem with the acting inspectors general: They are not supposed to serve in that capacity for more than 210 days. But seven of the eight people current serving in those roles will have been in for more than a year by the end of this month.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Michael Horowitz, the inspector general for the Department of Justice, this requirement leaves the agency vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened is the acting IGs, which are often the deputy inspectors general, simply fall back to be the deputy inspectors general, and there is no acting and there is no confirmed IG,\u201d Horowitz said.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s slowness in appointing inspectors general weakens the accountability of federal agencies and dilutes governmental transparency for the American people, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThe need for permanent IGs is a bipartisan issue,\u201d Johnson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eight of the 33 inspector general posts in the federal government are vacant, and the Obama administration has been slow to fill them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Eight of the 33 inspector general posts in the federal government are vacant, and the Obama administration has been slow to fill them.", "title": "Why Won't Obama Appoint Inspectors General?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/xnaphotos480415.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-04T14:57:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1G9oAnZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Eight of the 33 inspector general posts in the federal government are vacant, and the Obama administration has been slow to fill them.", "title": "Why Won't Obama Appoint Inspectors General?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/xnaphotos480415.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2015-06-04T13:38:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T14:57:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "inspectors general, government accountability, Department of the Interior, Department of Veterans' Affairs, POGO, Sen.
