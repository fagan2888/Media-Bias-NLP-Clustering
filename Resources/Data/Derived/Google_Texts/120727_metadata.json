But he will serve as Semyon Varlamov\u2019s backup Tuesday night as Colorado\u2019s MVP last season returns from a troubling groin injury, coach Patrick Roy said after Tuesday\u2019s morning skate at the Pepsi Center.\n\nVarlamov has missed 12 of the last 14 games and six of the first 19 with the same the ailment. Pickard has been sensational during his absence while playing ahead of Reto Berra, with Pickard\u2019s save percentage climbing to .939, second highest in the NHL.\n\nRoy said if Varlamov remains healthy and plays to his standards, Pickard will ultimately be returned to Cleveland and play with the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League. Roy wants the 22-year-old Pickard to continue to play and reassigning him would provide salary relief, because he is on his three-year, two-way entry level contract.\n\n\u201cVarly\u2019s the No. 1 guy here,\u201d Pickard said. \u201cHe\u2019s healthy now and he deserves to play because he\u2019s a world-class goalie and he was one of the reasons why they were so good last year. He looks ready and very good in practice.\u201d\n\nAVS MAILBAG: Pose a question for Mike Chambers\n\nVarlamov doesn\u2019t usually talk after morning skates and politely asked to postpone an interview until after the game.\n\nMeanwhile, Roy said fourth-line forward Patrick Bordeleau will miss 8-10 weeks with a fractured kneecap, suffered in his long-awaited return Saturday night in Buffalo. Bordeleau had missed the first 31 games after undergoing offseason back surgery.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov back in net for Avs; Patrick Bordeleau out 8-10 weeks", "title": "Semyon Varlamov back in net for Avs; Patrick Bordeleau out 8-10 weeks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/23/semyon-varlamov-back-in-net-for-avs-patrick-bordeleau-out-8-10-weeks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__semyon-varlamov-avs-092314ap1-2.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__semyon-varlamov-avs-092314ap1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-23T11:57:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:36:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1df\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Roy said fourth-line forward Patrick Bordeleau will miss 8-10 weeks with a fractured kneecap, suffered in his long-awaited return Saturday night in Buffalo.\nBut he will serve as Semyon Varlamov\u2019s backup Tuesday night as Colorado\u2019s MVP last season returns from a troubling groin injury, coach Patrick Roy said after Tuesday\u2019s morning skate at the Pepsi Center.\nVarlamov has missed 12 of the last 14 games and six of the first 19 with the same the ailment.\n\u201cHe\u2019s healthy now and he deserves to play because he\u2019s a world-class goalie and he was one of the reasons why they were so good last year.\nRookie goalie sensation Calvin Pickard will remain with the Avalanche through Christmas and is scheduled to start Saturday against the visiting Chicago Blackhawks."}
