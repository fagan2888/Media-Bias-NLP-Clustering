Authorities are looking for a diabetic 15-year-old runaway girl from Wisconsin and her companions, accused of stealing two vehicles and leading police on a chase across two northeast Colorado counties.

Breanna Gomez ran away from her home in Eau Claire, Wis., on Monday night, according to a news alert from the Weld County Sheriffâ€™s Office. Investigators believe Gomez is traveling with her 16-year-old boyfriend, Spencer Linville, and two other male teens.

The four were allegedly riding in a stolen vehicle when officers chased them through Washington and Morgan counties. Officers found that vehicle abandoned in Weld County on Thursday.

Gomez was last seen near Roggen, shortly before the group allegedly stole a light blue Chrysler Town and Country minivan with Colorado license plate 876WZS.

Gomez is an insulin-dependent diabetic who takes insulin five times a day.

Her medication was found in the stolen vehicle that was abandoned in Weld County.

Authorities requested an alert about the teenager because without her medication, she may begin to have seizures.

Gomez is about 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighs 150 pounds and has blue eyes. Police say her hair may now be black.

Investigators say the group may be en route to Riverside, Calif.

Anyone with information about the teenagers is asked to call their local authorities.
