You can count rural emergency medical service providers among those who will be adjusting to the Affordable Care Act.

At an Illinois EMS Summit in Springfield, Lt. Gov. Sheila Simon described the ACA as "version 1.0" and said everyone involved is simply experimenting to see what "version 1.1" will look like. Simon says the Affordable Care Act has ramifications for the rural EMS community, since - right now - many people simply use the ambulance as their ride to the hospital: "When we have more people who are insured, I think we will have more people who are able to engage in (preventive) care. (There will be) less need to respond to an emergency if you've been able to address your health care in advance."



Simon says it also is counterproductive that the insurance is more expensive in rural areas, many of which have more poverty, such as southern Illinois.
