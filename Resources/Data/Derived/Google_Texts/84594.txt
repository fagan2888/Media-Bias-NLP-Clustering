What a week of economic news. If you’ve been following The Upshot, none of the gloomy news out of Europe or the nerve-rattling slide in the American stock market should come as a surprise. Neil Irwin, David Leonhardt and others here have been writing about the global asset boom and the factors that are now pushing things down.

Nonetheless, when the market shudders, it can still make you want a stiff drink. We didn’t have to look far for this week’s Upshot With a Twist. We just slid over to our colleagues’ wonderful new Cooking app and website. It has drinks, too, so we looked through their suggestions.

And there it was, the perfect cocktail for a topsy-turvy week in the markets: The Upside-Down Martini. It’s more vermouth than gin, which is not how the world is supposed to work, but then, Germany’s economic descent and a yield on the 10-year Treasury that dipped below 2 percent for a spell are also a little downside-up.

The Upside-Down Martini

¾ oz. gin

3 ¾ oz Noilly Prat vermouth

Lemon twist, for garnish

Combine the gin and vermouth in a mixing glass with ice and stir. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with the lemon twist.
