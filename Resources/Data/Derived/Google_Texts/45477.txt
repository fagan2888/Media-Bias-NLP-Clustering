Platte River Hoists Deal With Huskie Tools

The investment follows up the PE firms purchase of Profile Products Earlier in 2015

Platte River Equity has acquired Huskie Tools Inc. from Harren Equity Partners for undisclosed terms.

Huskie, founded in 1976, makes cutting tools and hoists that are used by utility and industrial workers. Harren invested in Glendale Heights, Illinois-based Huskie in 2011.

Platte River managing director Peter Calamari says Huskie is primed for growth because investments are being made in the North American infrastructure sector.

“We are looking forward to working closely with Platte River and learning from their prior experiences as we continue to develop new products, penetrate new end markets and expand geographically,” says Huskie Tools vice president of operations, Roger Richter.

Earlier in 2015, Platte River purchased Profile Products LLC, a maker of products that are designed to minimize soil loss and help seed growth.

Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar & Scott LLP represented Platte River. The PE firm received financing from Madison Capital. Harris Williams & Co. advised Huskie.
