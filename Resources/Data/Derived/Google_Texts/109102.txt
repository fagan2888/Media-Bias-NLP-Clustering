NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A 78-year-old New Jersey who ran an illegal sports betting website connected to the Genovese organized crime family has been sentenced to prison.

Joseph Graziano pleaded guilty last July to a racketeering conspiracy count. He was sentenced Tuesday to 18 months in prison, three years of supervised release and ordered to pay a $16,000 fine. He also forfeited $1 million to the United States.

Graziano was the principal owner of a Costa Rica-based illegal online sports betting website called Beteagle.com. He admitted to conspiring with crime family members in the siteâ€™s operation.

Prosecutors say Graziano helped members of and associates of organized crime to take their traditional illegal betting activities online.
