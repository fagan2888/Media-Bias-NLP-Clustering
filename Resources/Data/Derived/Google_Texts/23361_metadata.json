She will have scans to determine the extent of the injury.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pretty optimistic, which is a good sign,\u201d coach Jill Ellis said. \u201cShe\u2019s a tremendous player. It would be a loss if we didn\u2019t have her.\u201d\n\nMorgan, who has 49 goals in 77 international caps for the U.S., was sidelined for seven months after injuring the same ankle during training last October. She returned to action in June with her club, the Portland Thorns of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League.\n\nTobin Heath scored twice, and Carli Lloyd, Whitney Engen and Megan Rapinoe had one goal each as the U.S. improved to 2-0 in the group stage of tournament, which serves as qualifying for next year\u2019s World Cup.\n\nGoalkeeper Hope Solo got her 75th shutout and didn\u2019t need to make a single save as the Americans outshot Guatemala 21-0.\n\nThe U.S. had started the tournament with an unimpressive 1-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago.\n\n\u201cThings opened up, and we converted our chances this time,\u201d Rapinoe said.\n\nThe U.S. is seeking its third World Cup title but first since 1999. The Americans lead Group A with six points, followed by Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago with three each. Guatemala is last on zero points.\n\nThe top two teams in each of two groups advance to the semifinals on Oct. 24 in Chester, Pennsylvania. The top three teams qualify for the World Cup in Canada, and the loser of the third-place game meets a South American nation in a playoff for another berth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Morgan, who has 49 goals in 77 international caps for the U.S., was sidelined for seven months after injuring the same ankle during training last October.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Morgan, who has 49 goals in 77 international caps for the U.S., was sidelined for seven months after injuring the same ankle during training last October.", "title": "Alex Morgan ankle injury mars U.S. World Cup qualifying win over Guatemala", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/18/alex-morgan-ankle-injury-mars-us-world-cup-qualify/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/18/concacaf-guatemala-us_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/18/concacaf-guatemala-us_lanc.jpg", "description": "Morgan, who has 49 goals in 77 international caps for the U.S., was sidelined for seven months after injuring the same ankle during training last October.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Alex Morgan ankle injury mars U.S. World Cup qualifying win over Guate"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Guatemala, Alex Morgan, Jill Ellis, World Cup"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9704\"", "article_summary": "BRIDGEVIEW, Illinois \u2014 Star forward Alex Morgan reinjured her left ankle in a U.S. qualifying match for the Women\u2019s World Cup on Friday, just months after returning from a lengthy layoff.\nThe U.S. is seeking its third World Cup title but first since 1999.\nMorgan hurt her ankle in a collision with Guatemala defender Londy Barrios in the 37th minute of the United States\u2019 5-0 win in the CONCACAF Women\u2019s Championship.\nThe top three teams qualify for the World Cup in Canada, and the loser of the third-place game meets a South American nation in a playoff for another berth.\nThe U.S. had started the tournament with an unimpressive 1-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago."}
