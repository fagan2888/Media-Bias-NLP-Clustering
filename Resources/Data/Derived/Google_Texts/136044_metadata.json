Gallup noted that Michigan experienced one of the \u201csharpest turnarounds of any state\u201d in the seven years its has conducted the survey.\n\nNick Loris, an economist who focuses on energy, environmental and regulatory issues at The Heritage Foundation, said North Dakota\u2019s No. 1 ranking came as no surprise.\n\n\u201cEnergy development on private and state-owned lands in North Dakota and Texas is a critical reason why they rank at the top,\u201d said Loris. \u201cThe regulatory environment has allowed companies in these states to create jobs, grow the economy, and increased energy supplies to save families money\u2014all while effectively protecting the environment.\u201d\n\nIn his recent State of the State address, Gov. Jack Dalrymple, R-N.D., said energy jobs were a large factor in his state\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cWe should all be proud of the vital role our state is playing to help America strengthen its energy independence,\u201d said Dalrymple.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, North Dakota\u2019s economy has averaged an annual growth rate of 10.3 percent, nearly three times that of the nation\u2019s economy,\u201d he added. \u201cWe also continue to have the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rate at just 2.4 percent, and our growing commercial activity has created more than 106,000 new jobs in the past 10 years.\u201d\n\nDalrymple said North Dakota\u2019s \u201ceconomic progress has not been confined to oil country,\u201d and pointed out that the state\u2019s population and personal income rates are growing as well.\n\nJames Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, closely follows job growth. He noted that the labor market has slowly recovered since the recession ended. Last year represented a move in a positive direction.\n\n\u201cThis recovery stands in marked contrast to the forecasts of Keynesian analysts who predicted that the sequester\u2014a measure of spending restraint\u2014and end of extended unemployment insurance benefits would harm the economy,\u201d Sherk told The Daily Signal. \u201cInstead, the economy has improved.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Sherk said government should remove barriers to job creation.\n\n\u201cThe states with the fastest job growth have been those that have allowed hydraulic natural gas and oil extraction, with Texas and North Dakota enjoying some of the strongest labor markets in the country,\u201d Sherk said. \u201cNew York decided to ban this new energy extraction technique\u2014harming its workers and labor market.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is your state a good place to find a job?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Is your state a good place to find a job?", "title": "The 10 Best (and Worst) States to Find a Job", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000003370190_Large.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-13T22:52:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1AjzCWP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Is your state a good place to find a job?", "title": "The 10 Best (and Worst) States to Find a Job", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000003370190_Large.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs", "published_time": "2015-02-16T03:01:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-13T22:52:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jobs, North Dakota, Connecticut, Jack Dalrymple, Gallup, Gallup poll"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cb4\"", "article_summary": "Residents of North Dakota are most likely to report positive hiring conditions where they work, followed by Texas, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\u201cInstead, the economy has improved.\u201dLooking ahead, Sherk said government should remove barriers to job creation.\n\u201cThe states with the fastest job growth have been those that have allowed hydraulic natural gas and oil extraction, with Texas and North Dakota enjoying some of the strongest labor markets in the country,\u201d Sherk said.\n\u201cEnergy development on private and state-owned lands in North Dakota and Texas is a critical reason why they rank at the top,\u201d said Loris.\nJames Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, closely follows job growth."}
