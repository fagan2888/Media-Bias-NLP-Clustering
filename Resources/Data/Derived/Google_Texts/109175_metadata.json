Uncompensated care was expected to reach $540 million this year, officials said.\n\n\u201cBecause of the recession, a lot of people lost their jobs, so there was a sharp spike in unemployment and people not covered by insurance,\u201d Deputy City Manager Rick Naimark said. \u201cThere was a big increase in uninsured patients and this situation was putting our hospitals, the jobs they create and our health-care system at risk.\u201d\n\nLast December, the Phoenix City Council adopted an ordinance to tax local hospitals and pool the money, which generates federal matching funds for the hospitals.\n\nThe ordinance imposed a short-term tax \u2014 6 percent of net inpatient revenue \u2014 on 11 local hospitals. The hospitals cannot pass the tax along to patients.\n\nThe money created a funding source for AHCCCS and triggered a roughly 2-to-1 federal match, which AHCCCS distributed back to participating hospitals based on their share of uncompensated-care costs.\n\nOfficials originally estimated Phoenix hospitals would receive about $200 million in federal match. That figure will be closer to between $310 million and $315 million once the year is over, according to Naimark.\n\nThe city received federal matching dollars for an unexpected extra quarter, he said. There also were more hospital visits than expected.\n\nEither way, \u201cit\u2019s a significant infusion of federal dollars into the economy there,\u201d Naimark said.\n\nOn Oct. 22, the council received the first update on the effect of the ordinance.\n\nSo far, Phoenix has collected more than $131 million in taxes and drawn about $250 million in federal matching dollars.\n\nIn addition to the $272 million paid out to Phoenix hospitals, AHCCCS received nearly $29 million to expand its coverage for about 33,000 more children and 13,000 more adults.\n\nThe ordinance had a far-reaching effect on hospitals that served Phoenix\u2019s most impoverished communities, such as St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center in central Phoenix.\n\n\u201cDignity Health had over $81 million in charity care and bad debt last year alone, with St. Joe\u2019s being the lion\u2019s share of that,\u201d said Suzanne Pfister, former vice president of external affairs for Dignity Health. \u201cSo this (ordinance) literally balanced our budget last year.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, an effort to assess a similar tax on hospitals across Arizona failed in the Legislature. However, state lawmakers that year approved Senate Bill 1357, which allows cities to create their own pools of money to trigger federal matching dollars \u2014 effectively handing the issue over to local governments.\n\nSo far, Phoenix is the only city in Arizona to create such an ordinance.\n\n\u201cWho would have guessed that we could have pulled this off?\u201d said Reg Ballantyne, senior strategy adviser for Tenet Healthcare. In June, Tenet bought Vanguard Health Systems, which operated several Arizona hospitals as Abrazo Health Care. \u201cThis is our tax money being returned to Phoenix. We\u2019re a donor state.\u201d\n\nCity officials said none of the money came from Phoenix taxpayers or city coffers.\n\n\u201cThat money, if it didn\u2019t go here, would have gone to support jobs and health care in another community, and we wanted to be sure we got our fair share,\u201d Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said.\n\nPhoenix\u2019s Access to Care Ordinance is set to expire on Dec. 31. Phoenix exempted certain hospitals, including government, specialty, small children\u2019s and those that provide a significant percentage of care to out-of-state and Medicare patients.\n\nThe end of the Phoenix ordinance will coincide with the start of expanded AHCCCS coverage in Arizona.\n\nEarlier this year, the state Legislature broadened Medicaid eligibility to those earning less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level, a move that will trigger a similar disbursement of federal dollars that will pay for most of Arizona\u2019s health-care costs under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Amy B Wang", "description": "Phoenix ordinance a lifesaver for overburdened hospitals,Valley health-care leaders are crediting a Phoenix ordinance \u2014 one that taxes hospitals to draw federal matching dollars \u2014 with helping local hospitals bridge a year of potentially crippling costs to care for uninsured and underinsured patients.", "pubdate": "Sat Nov  2, 2013  8:59 PM", "creditline": "The Republic | azcentral.com", "headline": "Phoenix ordinance a lifesaver for overburdened hospitals", "section": "Community", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2g12", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "image": "http://i.azcentral.com/i/3/8/b/L169_CIFR75c2806c92e62bd152ee098543bdcb83.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Phoenix ordinance a lifesaver for overburdened hospitals"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Phoenix ordinance a lifesaver for overburdened hospitals, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"description": "Valley health-care leaders are crediting a Phoenix ordinance \u2014 one that taxes hospitals to draw federal matching dollars \u2014 with helping local hospitals bridge a year of potentially crippling costs to care for uninsured and underinsured patients.", "title": "Phoenix ordinance a lifesaver for overburdened hospitals", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/20131021phoenix-ordinance-lifesaver-overburdened-hospitals.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "account_id": 13115682}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26e4\"", "article_summary": "The end of the Phoenix ordinance will coincide with the start of expanded AHCCCS coverage in Arizona.\nThe Phoenix Access to Care Ordinance has resulted in more than $272 million distributed to participating hospitals since the city passed it in December.\nOfficials originally estimated Phoenix hospitals would receive about $200 million in federal match.\nPhoenix\u2019s Access to Care Ordinance is set to expire on Dec. 31.\nIn June, Tenet bought Vanguard Health Systems, which operated several Arizona hospitals as Abrazo Health Care."}
