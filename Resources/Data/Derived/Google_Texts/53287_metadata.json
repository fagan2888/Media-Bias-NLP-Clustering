Only thing is the 22-year-old Indianara Carvalho has had sex. Still, such inconsequential details don\u2019t matter in 2014, and Carvalho has announced that as a result of vaginal rejuvenation surgery, she will be a virgin\u2026 again.\n\nMiss BumBum is a reality TV show where a panel of judges teams up to find the best backside in Brazil. The winner receives both a monetary prize, endorsement deals, and of course, international recognition. The competition, which has been around for only the past four years, has faced a fair deal of criticism, such as British journalist Daisy Donovan, who upon visiting the show in 2013 described it as \u201ca spectacular feast of the flesh,\u201d the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThis year\u2019s winner hopes to restore a bit of class to the competition through the restoration of her own virginity. Carvalho is currently preparing for a total \u201cvaginal rejuvenation surgery,\u201d which includes a hymenoplasty, the NY Daily News reported. In order to ensure that her hymen sticks around, at least until she\u2019s ready to lose her virginity again, Carvalho must abstain from sex for at least three months after the surgery.\n\nSurgical repair of the hymen can either be temporary, consisting of a gel that will dissolve after a few days or a flap of skin cut from the vaginal wall to permanently recreate the hymen. Carvalho went for the permanent solution.\n\nCarvalho will have the surgery done just in time for a new photo-shoot that will be revealed before Christmas.\n\n\u201cI wanted to undergo surgery to reconstruct my virginity before I have new photographs done,\u201d Carvalho explained, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cI wouldn't feel good about appearing naked if I wasn't exactly as I came into the world, if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nThe restoration of her virginity was just for the photoshoots, though. Carvalho hopes her transformation will help to change the public\u2019s idea of the Miss BumBum competition.\n\n\u201cI think I also want to give a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title by being a virgin,\u201d Calvalho said.\n\nThe young model is also looking forward to once again lose her virginity to \u201csomeone special.\u201d\n\nHymen repair surgery is becoming a rather popular operation. Esmeralda Venegas, who runs a center in in New York City that specializes in this type of surgery, told ABC News that each year she sees hundreds of women who pay up to $2,500 to have their hymens repaired.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "miss, bumbum, 2014, indianara, carvalho, restores, her, virginity, effort, dignify, title", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Miss BumBum 2014 has revealed she will soon be undergoing a surgery to restore her hymen.", "title": "Miss BumBum 2014 Uses Surgery To Get Her Virginity Back", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miss-bumbum-2014-indianara-carvalho-restores-her-virginity-effort-dignify-title-313754", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/10/bumbum.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Miss BumBum 2014 has revealed she will soon be undergoing a surgery to restore her hymen.", "title": "Miss BumBum 2014 Uses Surgery To Get Her Virginity Back", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miss-bumbum-2014-indianara-carvalho-restores-her-virginity-effort-dignify-title-313754", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/10/bumbum.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/10/bumbum.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-10T14:24:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T14:24:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Miss BumBum 2014 has revealed she will soon be undergoing a surgery to restore her hymen."}, "article_summary": "Miss BumBum is a reality TV show where a panel of judges teams up to find the best backside in Brazil.\nCarvalho hopes her transformation will help to change the public\u2019s idea of the Miss BumBum competition.\n\u201cI think I also want to give a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title by being a virgin,\u201d Calvalho said.\nThis year\u2019s winner of Brazil\u2019s Miss BumBum competition wants to restore a bit of \u201crespect\u201d to the competition by showing that one doesn\u2019t need to have sex to be sexy.\n\u201cI wanted to undergo surgery to reconstruct my virginity before I have new photographs done,\u201d Carvalho explained, the Daily Mail reported."}
