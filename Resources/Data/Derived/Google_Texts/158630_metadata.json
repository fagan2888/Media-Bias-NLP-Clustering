As for the high-end health insurance coverage for wealthier consumers, Gold\u2019s median premium rate will jump 15 percent compared to 8 percent last year while Platinum\u2019s rate will rise by 12 percent, compared to 10 percent this year,\u201d the Fiscal Times explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the least expensive bronze plans, the average deductible for individuals is $5,731\u2014an 11 percent increase,\u201d the Fiscal Times explained.Last year, price increases were more moderate, increasing between 7 and 10 percent depending on the plan tier, the Examiner reported.Health experts and critics have been predicting the price hikes.\u201cShoppers' experiences vary widely depending on where they live. Average premiums are increasing in the vast majority of states, rising by as much as 26 percent in Oklahoma. They're coming down in a handful of states, including New Mexico, where they're falling by 14 percent,\u201d the Examiner reported.\u201cAnd shoppers have slightly fewer plan options during this enrollment period, which lasts through January. There are now 314 insurers participating in marketplaces around the country, down from 333 last year. While 16 percent of consumers will have more plans available to them, 40 percent will find fewer carriers competing in their county.\u201dThe fate of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as \"Obamacare\" to its detractors \u2014 is very much in the hands of the next president. A weak sign-up season could embolden opponents who are so far unwilling to relent, the Associated Press reported.To be sure, many have said the president's plan could soon be on life support itself.\"Obamacare is an unwieldy contraption that is sputtering badly,\" writes Newsmax Insider Rich Lowry. \"Yes, Obamacare has covered more people and has especially benefited those with pre-existing conditions (to be credible, Republican replacement plans have to do these things, as well), but the program is so poorly designed that, surely, even a new Democratic president will want to revisit it to try to make it more workable,\" Lowry contends.\"The problem with Obamacare in a nutshell is that on one hand, by imposing motley regulations and mandates, it increases the price of health insurance, and on the other hand, by providing subsidies, it tries to hide the cost \u2014 but not enough,\" Lowry said. GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina declares \"Obamacare has to be repealed because it\u2019s failing. It\u2019s failing the very people it was intended to help, but, also, it is crony-capitalism at its worst. Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government.\"Meanwhile, the program continues to face obstacles, challenges and difficulties.The majority of Obamacare\u2019s insurance co-ops\u201412 of 23\u2014have now folded, and their $1.24 billion in federal loans has all but vaporized. More will fail, nearly a million Americans may lose coverage, and now the contagion from their failures is spreading, The Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cThe co-ops are government-sponsored nonprofits that were supposed to increase competition, but instead they\u2019re causing the greatest insurance disruption in decades. The co-ops aren\u2019t merely jilting their displaced members or the taxpayers who supplied their 'seed money.' Local regulators are defying the feds to close them because other insurers are liable for their toxic balance sheets,\u201d the Journal reported.For his part, President Barack Obama told workers helping to enroll Americans in health care plans offered under Obamacare that they must fight efforts to scare off millions of Americans who still have not purchased insurance, Bloomberg reported. \"They\u2019ve been fed a lot of misinformation and this has become unfortunately this political issue that it never should have been,\" Obama reportedly told the workers on a conference call. \"That\u2019s in a lot of circumstances scared them off, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we reach them.\"Obama said that the government\u2019s data showed that six in 10 people still did not know that tax credits were available to help them purchase health insurance. He also warned that enrollment efforts would suffer from diminishing media coverage in the third year of the program.\"We\u2019re anticipating we\u2019re not going to have the same amount of national media attention we\u2019ve had in the past, so we\u2019re going to have to be more creative,\" Obama said.(Newsmax wire services contributed to this report).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, price, premium, cost", "pubdate": "2015-11-12T09:12:16", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Obamacare insurance plans are more expensive on average than last year, with double-digit premium increases, a new analysis warns.", "title": "Double-Digit Price Spikes Hit Obamacare", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/obamacare-price-premium-cost/2015/11/12/id/701787/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=528a06e6-c7e3-4a5f-8d3c-63e19c17174f&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/obamacare-price-premium-cost/2015/11/12/id/701787/", "title": "Double-Digit Price Spikes Hit Obamacare", "description": "Obamacare insurance plans are more expensive on average than last year, with double-digit premium increases, a new analysis warns.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1447319536, "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs", "keywords": "obamacare, price, premium, cost", "article": {"section": "StreetTalk", "published_time": "2015-11-12T09:12:16"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/obamacare-price-premium-cost/2015/11/12/id/701787/", "description": "Obamacare insurance plans are more expensive on average than last year, with double-digit premium increases, a new analysis warns."}, "article_summary": "\"Obama said that the government\u2019s data showed that six in 10 people still did not know that tax credits were available to help them purchase health insurance.\nAverage premiums are increasing in the vast majority of states, rising by as much as 26 percent in Oklahoma.\nHe also warned that enrollment efforts would suffer from diminishing media coverage in the third year of the program.\n\u201cThe co-ops are government-sponsored nonprofits that were supposed to increase competition, but instead they\u2019re causing the greatest insurance disruption in decades.\n\"Obamacare is an unwieldy contraption that is sputtering badly,\" writes Newsmax Insider Rich Lowry."}
