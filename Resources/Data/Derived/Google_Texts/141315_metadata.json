The industry is expected to expand at 3.1% annually between 2014 and 2019, according to data provider IBISWorld.\n\nThe expansion is likely buoyed by widening vision care coverage under the Affordable Care Act and optometrists expanding the scope of their services to include preventive care for the nation\u2019s burgeoning elderly population.\n\nFFL\u2019s latest deal, Clarkson Eyecare Inc., operates in the higher end of the market, offering customers more detailed eye care such as LASIK surgery.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 10,000 independents out there, most of them have just one-off locations,\u201d FFL managing director Chris Harris said. \u201cClarkson is going to be a great platform to start consolidation.\u201d\n\nFFL\u2019s November investment in Eyemart Express LLC leans towards the value segment of the market, providing consumers with eyewear at affordable price points.\n\nHPC advised the sellers on both the Clarkson and Eyemart transactions.\n\nMr. Puckett said private equity is already involved in the optical industry consolidation game, especially on the retail side of the business.\n\nKohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in February last year bought discount eyewear retailer National Vision Inc. for more than $1 billion from Berkshire Partners, the Wall Street Journal reported then, citing people familiar with the situation.\n\nBoston\u2019s Monitor Clipper Partners has been a backer of MyEyeDr., a vision care provider in the Washington, D.C. area since 2012. Cleveland-based Riverside Co. in August 2012 invested in IDOC LCC, an alliance of over 1,700 independent optometrists nationwide, while Varsity Healthcare Partners, of Los Angeles, acquired ophthalmologic and optometric services provider Katzen Eye Group to form EyeCare Services Partners Holdings LLC.\n\nMr. Puckett said he expects 50% of the optical retail industry will be consolidated in the next five years \u2013 some rolled up by private equity investors \u2014 producing more sizeable assets for buyout shops to acquire.\n\nBut so far, there is no clear market leader and national players with a broad network are far and few between. FFL\u2019s Clarkson, based in Ellisville, Miss., has 82 locations in the Midwest, compared with Visionworks of America Inc. \u2014 one of the largest eyewear companies in the U.S. \u2014 with over 660 optical retail stores, according to its website.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many operators with over 100 locations, but there are quite a few independents with under 50 locations,\u201d Mr. Puckett said. \u201cIt is logical for businesses to consolidate in a geographic area.\u201d\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Friedman Fleischer & Lowe\u2019s acquisition of a second platform in the optometry industry is a signal that consolidation in the industry is underway, and that private equity may play a more active role going forward.", "title": "Optometrists Catch FFL\u2019s Eye", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/13/optometrists-catch-ffls-eye/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HW011_OPTOME_E_20150413145814.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Optometrists Catch FFL\u2019s Eye", "description": "Friedman Fleischer & Lowe\u2019s acquisition of a second platform in the optometry industry is a signal that consolidation in the industry is underway, and that private equity may play a more active role going forward.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Friedman Fleischer & Lowe\u2019s acquisition of a second platform in the optometry industry is a signal that consolidation in the industry is underway, and that private equity may play a more active role going forward.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-04-13T19:13:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/13/optometrists-catch-ffls-eye/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-18315", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Friedman Fleischer & Lowe\u2019s acquisition of a second platform in the optometry industry is a signal that consolidation in the industry is underway, and that private equity may play a more active role going forward.", "title": "Optometrists Catch FFL\u2019s Eye", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/13/optometrists-catch-ffls-eye/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-18315", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-13T19:14:52-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2b8\"", "article_summary": "FFL\u2019s latest deal, Clarkson Eyecare Inc., operates in the higher end of the market, offering customers more detailed eye care such as LASIK surgery.\nMr. Puckett said private equity is already involved in the optical industry consolidation game, especially on the retail side of the business.\nHPC advises on deals in the optical and communications industry and has helped seal over a dozen optical transactions last year, including in optical retail, laboratory and coating.\nThomas Puckett, of merger and acquisition advisory firm HPC Puckett & Co., said the biggest challenge right now is for private equity firms to find sizeable assets to back.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many operators with over 100 locations, but there are quite a few independents with under 50 locations,\u201d Mr. Puckett said."}
