The report found 35 percent of hospitals with more than 150 beds are either in the process of or plan to replace their EDIS in 2016. The study further found the majority of those replacements (69 percent) will be hospitals currently employing enterprise EHR emergency modules who will migrate to best-of-breed EDIS systems able to integrate with the hospital\u2019s EHR.\n\nAnd, while almost 40 percent of hospitals employing enterprise EHR emergency modules state they are moderately to highly dissatisfied with their current EDIS, 90 percent report they have been denied budget funds to replace EDIS systems in 2016 and/or are being forced to make due with hospital-wide generic EHR systems.\n\nDoug Brown, Managing Partner of Black Book, explained many of these earlier EDIS purchases were completed as part of EHR systems, with hospitals spending anywhere from six months to two years implementing them only to remove them because of problems with physician productivity, patient satisfaction, and safety.\n\n\u201cMost best of breed EDIS solutions, not all, are fine tuned for the emergency department environment and workflows,\u201d Brown stated. \u201cIn contract, enterprise EHR solutions have typically been very generic with difficult customization processes and long implementations for emergency departments.\u201d\n\nEpic Systems fared poorest in the survey due to their inability to integrate with the best of breed EDIS solutions (86 percent) or to provide widespread connectivity to access external records (83 percent). Cerner, Allscripts, Healthland, Evident CPSI, and Meditech enterprise solutions all received more favorable ratings, with 79 percent of collective users of these systems reporting substantial enhancements in usability since 2010.\n\nWhen asked to list their most desirable features in a 2016 replacement EDIS, respondents\u2019 top six responses were: interoperability and connectivity with internal and external sources (93 percent); physician productivity improvements (89 percent); tablets and smart phones (87 percent); ease of use (86 percent); diagnosis enhancements (70 percent); and patient satisfaction (68 percent).\n\n\u201cObvious game changers in the EDIS replacement environment are developments in EDIS interoperability and mobility,\u201d Brown said, \u201cAs hospitals and emergency room physicians grapple with intense pressure to optimize processes with ED visits predicted to rise by double digits again in 2016, EDIS has emerged as a powerful solution to the challenges of a rapidly changing healthcare model.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Dissatisfaction is driving an upsurge in Emergency Department Information Technology replacements. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "Three-Quarters Of Hospitals Unhappy With Interoperability, Usability", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/934c201e/934c201e-9c04-4f1c-8491-778bb31dd31d/hospital_sign.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Dissatisfaction is driving an upsurge in Emergency Department Information Technology replacements.
