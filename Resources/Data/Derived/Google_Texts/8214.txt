Federal agents have arrested a man wanted for killing two brothers as they worked at their family's convenience store in Florida.

The Bradenton Herald reports that 25-year-old Devin Chandler was arrested Tuesday by U.S. marshals in Tampa. He faces two counts of murder and one count of armed robbery.

Investigators say a surveillance camera shows Chandler pick up a few items Monday afternoon at Snappy's Mart in Palmetto, then walk to the counter and shoot both brothers in the head. Authorities say Chandler took cash and cigarettes.

Police identified the victims as 23-year-old Khasem Yousef and 17-year-old Faares Yousef.

Chandler was released from prison in September 2011 after serving less than two years on a three-year sentence for attempted armed robbery with a weapon. Records show he's on probation.
