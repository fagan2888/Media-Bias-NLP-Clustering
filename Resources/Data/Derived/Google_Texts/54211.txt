LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Graffiti artists Dabs Myla aren't just creating the logo for the upcoming MTV Movie Awards, they're also designing and painting the sets.

The show's executive producer announced the creative collaboration Wednesday, saying this is the first time it has relied on one team of artists for so many duties. And they're graffiti artists.

Los Angeles-based Dabs Myla are a married couple who create large-scale graffiti murals, gallery paintings and three-dimensional installations. This is their first attempt at set design.

Myla said they are approaching the set as they would an installation, with the added consideration of camera angles.

She said the theme is "a really surreal, weird city scene with really large characters in there."

"Like the modern world," added Dabs.

The MTV Movie Awards are set for April 12.
