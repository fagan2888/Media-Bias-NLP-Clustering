Charles Schumer (D-NY), the White House is pushing ahead on the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, President Obama predicted the white-hot attitudes that surround the nuclear agreement today would cool once it\u2019s been given time to work.\n\n\"When this agreement is implemented and ... we've got inspectors on the ground and it becomes clear that Iran in fact is abiding by this agreement, then attitudes will change, because people will recognize that, in fact, whatever parade of horribles was presented in opposition have not come true,\" he said.\n\nRelated: Schumer\u2019s Iran Deal \u2018No\u2019 Vote Could Cost Him with Senate Dems\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry went on the attack at an event in New York City, suggesting that if the United States torpedoes the agreement and then demands other Western powers comply with economic sanctions against Iran, the dollar could soon lose its status as the world\u2019s reserve currency.\n\n\"If we turn around and nix the deal and then tell them, you're going to have to obey our rules and sanctions anyway, that is a recipe, very quickly .... for the American dollar to cease to be the reserve currency of the world,\" he said.\n\nCritics were quick to throw water on that argument, saying it was an exaggeration on Kerry\u2019s part and likely driven by the intense politics surrounding the Iran deal. CNN factcheck called the Obama/Kerry dollar risk an outright exaggeration.\n\nKerry played up the potential benefits of the agreement, arguing that if it goes into place, the U.S. will be in a much better position to press Iran on its destabilizing behavior and support for terror groups in the region, though \u201cwe\u2019ll do so with our eyes wide open.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s top diplomat also held out an olive branch to opponents, walking back comments Obama made last week compared GOP opponents of the deal with Iranian hardliners who chant \u201cDeath to America!\u201d\n\n\"I'm not accusing anyone of willfully choosing that or being a warmonger, or suggesting that they want that, even though you've heard some pretty flashy language in some hearings about who wins war and what happens,\" he said. \"But what I am saying is people really owe it to everybody to evaluate fully what happens if Congress were to override a veto and say no.\u201d\n\nWhile the administration engages in a fresh push for support, the politics surrounding the nuclear accord remain fluid.\n\nOn Monday, Democratic Senators Brian Schatz (HI) and Amy Klobuchar (MI) announced their support for the deal, bringing the grand total of Senate backers to 18, just over halfway to the 34 Obama needs to sustain a veto.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who the president considers as possible supporter of the agreement, predicted Obama would ultimately come out on top.\n\n\"I still believe that the president will have enough votes to sustain a veto,\" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told The Arizona Republic in an interview published over the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, three Democratic House members from California \u2013 Lois Capps, Mark Takano and Doris Matsui -- announced they would vote for the Iran deal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite losing the support of Sen.
