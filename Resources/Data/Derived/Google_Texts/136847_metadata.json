Randy Best, the company\u2019s founder and CEO, is a Texas entrepreneur and political donor, and he told the Post that his company has helped college professors gain access to online students while assisting schools in drawing more revenue.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRegarding Bush, Best said, \u201cHe is the closest thing we have to a bipartisan candidate.\u201d\n\nIn February 2013, Bush told a Florida university audience that, were he to become president, he would strive to be like Democrat President Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported on December 6, Bush has developed his own education \u201cempire,\u201d with his Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE) operating at a national level to spread his education reform vision, which includes the Common Core standards. An affiliate of FEE is Chiefs for Change, a coalition of current and former state education chiefs who also support the controversial standards. Some of the Chiefs for Change are also members of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), one of the two federally funded interstate consortia that are developing tests aligned with Common Core.\n\nBush has also served as founder and chairman of Foundation for Florida\u2019s Future, an organization that hopes to \u201cmake Florida\u2019s education system a model for the nation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Bush resigned from Barclays, according to spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, and also recently exited Tenet Healthcare Corp., a company that has actively supported and benefited from Obamacare.\n\nAccording to the Post, Bush is preparing to distance himself from the pitfalls of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Bush said Romney struggled with handling the topic of his successful private-equity firm, Bain Capital, allowing himself to be drawn \u201coff message.\u201d\n\nThough media have reported that Bush tops the list of GOP 2016 favorites, a new Rasmussen poll finds Republican voters are not enthusiastic about another Bush candidacy. Bush\u2019s ardent support for the Common Core standards and amnesty has made him widely unpopular with the party\u2019s conservative base.\n\nThe survey of 1,000 likely Republican voters found that just 33 percent of likely GOP voters across the country believe Bush should run for president in 2016, while 34 percent disagree, and another third are not sure.\n\nBush is still reviewing his other business endeavors, such as Jeb Bush & Associates, a consulting company, and Britton Hill Partnership, an investment advisory group for energy and aviation private-equity funds. Jeb Bush, Jr., the former Florida governor\u2019s son, is chief operating officer at Jeb Bush & Associates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush Resigns from All Boards, Including His Own Education Foundation", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jeb Bush Resigns from All Boards, Including His Own Education Foundation", "title": "Jeb Bush Resigns from All Boards, Including His Own Education Foundation - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Jeb-Bush-chuckling-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/01/jeb-bush-resigns-from-all-boards-including-his-own-education-foundation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush Resigns from All Boards, Including His Own Education Foundation", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Jeb-Bush-chuckling-AP.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush Resigns from All Boards, Including His Own Education Foundation - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential race, Common Core, education reform, Jeb Bush,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Education,Jeb Bush", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Jeb Bush", "published_time": "2015-01-01T10:25:16-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush, Jr., the former Florida governor\u2019s son, is chief operating officer at Jeb Bush & Associates.\nJeb Bush (R) has resigned from all his corporate and nonprofit board memberships, including chairmanship of the education foundation he founded\u2013more evidence that he is considering a 2016 presidential bid.\nBush is still reviewing his other business endeavors, such as Jeb Bush & Associates, a consulting company, and Britton Hill Partnership, an investment advisory group for energy and aviation private-equity funds.\nAccording to the Post, Bush is preparing to distance himself from the pitfalls of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\nThe Washington Post reports that Bush has also resigned as a paid adviser to Academic Partnerships, an education company that sells online courses to university students in exchange for a share of tuition payments."}
