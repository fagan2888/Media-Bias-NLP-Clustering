Earlier this month, patients across the nation lost their coverage of most compounded medicines \u2014 solutions that are tailored to their specific, individual needs.\n\nExpress Scripts, Inc., a pharmacy benefit manager, announced they would no longer provide coverage for 1,000 ingredients used in compounded medications. State employees in Alaska got a one-year reprieve from the similar attempt by the Aetna administrator of the state\u2019s prescription benefit plan to eliminate coverage of compounds, but I fear the same bad decision will be made again in January 2015, and it will be as wrong-headed then as it was a year earlier.\n\nCompounded medication allows patients to receive customized treatments for conditions when manufactured medications are not viable for the patient, either because they would have adverse health effects or because a commercial non-compound in the right dosage is simply not available. As a patient who uses a compounded medication, I can attest both to the benefits that compounding is crucial to my overall health and to the fact that the compound I use is not available in a non-compounded form.\n\nI have been on hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) for the past 11 years. I have been able to decrease the dosage of estradiol that I need for my health and am now down to where I need only 50 mg per day of progesterone to balance the estradiol. However, progesterone is not commercially available in a 50-mg. dosage, so I have been prescribed a compounded medicine at that dosage level. It is provided through Scott Watts and staff at Ron\u2019s Apothecary in Juneau.\n\nI have a friend who has also been on HRT for the past 12 years. She also needs a combination of estradiol and progesterone to maintain her health. However, the only commercially-available medicine for her prescribed dosage of that combination is prepared in a capsule containing peanut oil. She is highly-allergic to all nuts. Her healthcare practitioner prescribed a compounded form of what she needs that Ron\u2019s Apothecary puts together in a capsule with powdered forms of both estradiol and progesterone containing no peanut oil. Allergy problem averted; health maintained.\n\nNeither of us have any other recourse to what we need without the compounds we currently take. We know they are effective because when, on the advice of our health care practitioners, we have had trial periods of trying to make do with lower dosages, we suffer consequences that are extremely uncomfortable. Those consequences go away when we resume the original dosage of the compounded medicines. We also have confidence in the safety of our compounds. They are obtained by Ron\u2019s Apothecary from a manufacturing facility that is licensed and inspected by the Food and Drug Administration. They are prepared by a pharmacist licensed by the state of Alaska to do what he/ she does safely and skillfully. They are prepared in a pharmacy licensed by the state as having proper procedures and sanitation protocols in place for compounding. We have never even once, in a combined 23 years, had an adverse reaction to a compound prepared for us.\n\nIt is important we speak up to protect our access to the medications that help us thrive. For patients like me and my friend, compounds are the only option to treat our conditions. Denying the kind of coverage we currently get would be detrimental to our care and health. I am angry that thousands of patients in the United States have lost such coverage this week, and I will be angry again, and extremely frustrated, if the same thing happens to us in January, as the state has already been informed of the above dosage and allergy restrictions we face with branded drugs.\n\nI strongly encourage you to voice your concerns to Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich (D- AK) and Rep. Don Young, and if you are in a state of Alaska health care plan, you should also make your feelings and experiences known to the Department of Administration. It\u2019s time for our legislators and our government to stop allowing business decisions among pharmacy benefit managers to put our health and our quality of life at risk. Let the people who are licensed to prescribe and prepare medications be the only ones to make the decision, along with their patients, about whether compounds are appropriate to meet our needs.\n\n\u2022Terri Lauterbach is a Juneau resident.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Opinion, TERRI LAUTERBACH, Scott Watts, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "I am angry that access to compounded medications have been recently threatened by pharmacy benefit managers.", "title": "My Turn: Lost access to compounded medications is a dangerous move by insurance companies", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/opinion/2014-09-29/my-turn-lost-access-compunded-medications-dangerous-move-insurance-companies", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9bb\"", "article_summary": "I am angry that access to compounded medications have been recently threatened by pharmacy benefit managers.\nExpress Scripts, Inc., a pharmacy benefit manager, announced they would no longer provide coverage for 1,000 ingredients used in compounded medications.\nEarlier this month, patients across the nation lost their coverage of most compounded medicines \u2014 solutions that are tailored to their specific, individual needs.\nHowever, progesterone is not commercially available in a 50-mg. dosage, so I have been prescribed a compounded medicine at that dosage level.\nIt is important we speak up to protect our access to the medications that help us thrive."}
