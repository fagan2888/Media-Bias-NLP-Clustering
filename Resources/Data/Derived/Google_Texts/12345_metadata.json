State and lower federal courts are deeply split on those limits, and states frequently find themselves as defendants on both sides of the question\u2026.Justices of the Supreme Court have recognized that state Blaine amendments \u2018arose at a time of pervasive hostility to Catholics and constitutionalized an idea born of bigotry.\u2019\n\n\u2013 Excerpt from a legal brief filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the Justices to clear up the conflict among lower courts on the continuing validity of state provisions imposing flat bans on financial aid to religious institutions, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. On January 15, the Court agreed to review that issue in a case from Missouri.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTON, AND\u2026.\n\nAmong the proposed changes that never made it into the Constitution was the \u201cBlaine Amendment,\u201d proposed by a member of Congress from Maine in 1875 at the suggestion of President Ulysses S. Grant. The key language was this: \u201cNo money raised by taxation in any state for the support of public schools, or derived from any fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sect or denominations.\u201d\n\nHistorians have more or less accepted that Representative James G. Blaine\u2019s sponsorship of the measure cost him many votes of Irish Catholics in the 1884 presidential election when, as the Republican nominee, he refused to repudiate a pastor\u2019s denunciation of the Democrats as \u201cthe party of rum, Romanism and rebellion.\u201d Blaine lost.\n\nBut state versions of that proposal have fared much better. At one time, all but 11 states had their own \u201cBlaine amendments,\u201d and some of them swept more broadly than others. Today, such amendments remain in force in 35 states.\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has made clear that states are free to relax those bans, and are even free constitutionally to provide some forms of neutral aid that winds up in the budgets of religious institutions \u2013 especially when the aid is channeled according to the wishes of parents and children.\n\nBut, despite the existence of such bans for more than 140 years, the Supreme Court has never answered one key question about them: Does the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the \u201cfree exercise of religion\u201d actually require states to provide aid to religious institutions, if the aid has nothing to do with promoting religious beliefs or practices?\n\nAt last, the Justices have agreed to answer that question. They have a few cases on their current docket that raise the issue, but last Friday they chose for review the one that deals with a form of state aid that seems to have nothing, or next to nothing, to do with religion.\n\nMissouri, the state involved in the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Pauley, has a program of turning used tires into rubber surfacing material for playgrounds. It invites applications for the material, and selects those who will receive the aid, because of the limits of its supply. The cost of recycling of the tires is paid for by a fee imposed on the sale of new tires, so state funds are involved in the scheme.\n\nThe Trinity congregation runs a daycare center for children, and it has a playground used by the pupils as well as by neighbors in its Columbia community. Its playground is currently surfaced with \u201cpea gravel,\u201d which can be abrasive for the children\u2019s skin as they play about.\n\nIt applied for a grant, and was ranked fifth among 44 applicants. However, it was turned down by state officials, explicitly because of the Missouri constitution\u2019s \u201cBlaine Amendment,\u201d first adopted in 1875.\n\nThe amendment still reads in part: \u201cNo money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect, or denomination or religion\u201d\n\nLast May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit relied upon that clause in turning aside Trinity Lutheran\u2019s federal constitutional challenge to the denial of this aid. The three-judge Circuit Court panel split 2 to 1 in its ruling.\n\nThe majority commented that the church was seeking \u201can unprecedented ruling \u2013 that a state constitution violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause if it bars the grant of public funds to a church.\u201d The full Eighth Circuit Court of 10 judges split 5 to 5 in refusing to reconsider the panel ruling.\n\nThe church then took the case on to the Supreme Court, arguing that \u201cno public benefit could be further removed from the state\u2019s anti-establishment concerns than a grant for safe rubber playground surfaces that serve no religious function or purpose.\u201d Its appeal raised both the Free Exercise Clause and equal protection arguments against Missouri officials, noting that lower courts are split 3 to 2 on those questions.\n\nNoting that the state \u201cBlaine Amendment\u201d originated in Missouri in 1875, the church reminded the Justices that its adoption occurred at \u201cthe same time as the federal Blaine Amendment was prepared and debated. It thus shares the same grounding in hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general.\u201d\n\nBy adding that case to its docket for a decision that is likely during the current term, the Justices have immersed themselves even more deeply in the abiding controversy over church-state relations. Already under review is the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in a handful of cases raised by religious non-profit institutions that do not want any role in the ACA\u2019s provision of free contraceptive devices and counseling to women employees and students of those institutions.\n\nLike the ACA case, the Missouri church\u2019s appeal is likely to attract a long list of friend-of-the-court legal briefs, broadening the importance of the Justices\u2019 review of a truly fundamental constitutional debate.\n\nRecent Historical Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nRemembering the first black Cabinet member\n\nAlexander Hamilton: The nation\u2019s founding blogger\n\nThomas Paine: The original publishing viral superstar\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at a case accepted by the Supreme Court related to state tax funds and religious institutions.", "title": "Constitution Check: Are the states\u2019 \u201cBlaine Amendments\u201d on shaky ground?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/01/constitution-check-are-the-states-blaine-amendments-on-shaky-ground/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/307639437_ae1b3ba8c5_b.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/307639437_ae1b3ba8c5_b.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-19T11:37:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-19T11:37:00+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Noting that the state \u201cBlaine Amendment\u201d originated in Missouri in 1875, the church reminded the Justices that its adoption occurred at \u201cthe same time as the federal Blaine Amendment was prepared and debated.\nAt one time, all but 11 states had their own \u201cBlaine amendments,\u201d and some of them swept more broadly than others.\nHowever, it was turned down by state officials, explicitly because of the Missouri constitution\u2019s \u201cBlaine Amendment,\u201d first adopted in 1875.\nAmong the proposed changes that never made it into the Constitution was the \u201cBlaine Amendment,\u201d proposed by a member of Congress from Maine in 1875 at the suggestion of President Ulysses S.
