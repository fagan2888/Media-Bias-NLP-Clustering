And now talks to revive the series on Hulu have fallen apart.\n\nStreaming services bringing back beloved, low-rated series always seems like a good idea; sites like Netflix and Hulu are less beholden to ratings than are broadcast networks, and are better-positioned to capitalize on an intensely devoted fan base.\n\nAnd yet reviving canceled TV series comes with a lot of complications, including actors who\u2019ve moved on, as Netflix learned when its revival of \u201cArrested Development\u201d took the odd structure it did in order to accommodate all of its stars. The \u201cCommunity\u201d stars are still under contract until June 30, after which reviving the show will become \u201cArrested Development\u201d-level impossible, but they need to get paid. And broadcast TV shows are expensive \u2014 and only get more so as they age.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The series likely really is over -- now Dan Harmon can focus on his podcast", "title": "Time to panic, \u201cCommunity\u201d fans: Talks to revive show break down", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The series likely really is over -- now Dan Harmon can focus on his podcast", "title": "Time to panic, \u201cCommunity\u201d fans: Talks to revive show break down", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/24/time_to_panic_community_fans_talks_to_revive_show_break_down/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/community-canceled.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The series likely really is over -- now Dan Harmon can focus on his podcast", "title": "Time to panic, \u201cCommunity\u201d fans: Talks to revive show break down", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/community-canceled.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Community, hulu, NBC", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd20f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Community, hulu, NBC, Entertainment NewsThe meta-sitcom \u201cCommunity\u201d may finally be truly over.\nAnd broadcast TV shows are expensive \u2014 and only get more so as they age.\nAnd now talks to revive the series on Hulu have fallen apart.\nThe \u201cCommunity\u201d stars are still under contract until June 30, after which reviving the show will become \u201cArrested Development\u201d-level impossible, but they need to get paid.\nAfter dodging the bullet of cancellation several times \u2014 largely thanks to other series doing worse \u2014 the comedy met the end of the line at NBC last season."}
