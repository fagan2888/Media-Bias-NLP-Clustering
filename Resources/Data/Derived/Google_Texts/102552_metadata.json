There were 4,020 abortions in 2014 compared to 4,423 in 2013.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, the number of abortions decreased from nearly 5,400 to just over 4,420. That represents an 18.1 percent drop.\n\nThe reason for the decrease depends on who you ask.\n\nPenny Dickey with Planned Parenthood says a big reason for the decline has to do with more use of long-acting contraceptives in recent years.\n\n\u201cThat's when we really started to see that over time women are continuing to use these methods, and we have also seen the decline in abortion,\u201d Dickey said.\n\nDickey also cited increased education to make good decisions, the Affordable Care Act and changes to insurance plans for the decline.\n\n\u201cIt's been very encouraging to see that trend over the last couple of years,\u201d she said.\n\nJenifer Bowen, with Right to Life, argues the decline has to do with an increase in pregnancy centers, often next to Planned Parenthoods, and an increase in baby pictures on social media.\n\nShe argues contraception is not a factor and cited a huge failure rate.\n\n\u201cI think that that is a claim that oftentimes the abortion side of the debate will point to,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nBoth organizations say they will continue to work on education with the hope of helping women make smarter choices.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 22:17:54 CDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Jason Rantala", "og": {"site_name": "KCCI", "description": "Numbers from the Iowa Department of Public Health show an 18.1 percent decrease in abortions over the last few years.", "title": "Iowa sees dramatic drop in abortions over the years", "url": "http://www.kcci.com/news/latest-numbers-on-abortion-rate-in-iowa-released/35929856", "image": "http://www.kcci.com/image/view/-/35935072/medRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/d6306az/-/img-Iowa-sees-dramatic-drop-in-abortion-rates.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcci.com/news/latest-numbers-on-abortion-rate-in-iowa-released/35929856", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcci://content/article/35929856", "iphone": "kcci://content/article/35929856", "googleplay": "kcci://content/article/35929856"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcci", "iphone": "kcci", "googleplay": "kcci"}, "id": {"ipad": 505215818, "iphone": 505215818, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcci"}}, "site": "@KCCINews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcci://content/article/35929856", "app_name": "kcci", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcci"}, "ios": {"url": "kcci://content/article/35929856", "app_store_id": 505215818, "app_name": "kcci"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 239632779417960}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.kcci.com/news/latest-numbers-on-abortion-rate-in-iowa-released/35929856"}, "keywords": "abortion rates, iowa, iowa department of public health", "google-site-verification": "ouVXmtXTUso5qDougWesGSbnCjhBjWT_Ab9ajDvLc8A", "news_keywords": "abortion rates, iowa, iowa department of public health", "description": "Numbers from the Iowa Department of Public Health show an 18.1 percent decrease in abortions over the last few years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04ed\"", "article_summary": "The Iowa Department of Public Health released new numbers on abortion rates in the state.\nWatch videoThe department says abortion rates continue to decline in Iowa.\nBetween 2010 and 2013, the number of abortions decreased from nearly 5,400 to just over 4,420.\nBoth organizations say they will continue to work on education with the hope of helping women make smarter choices.\n\u201cThat's when we really started to see that over time women are continuing to use these methods, and we have also seen the decline in abortion,\u201d Dickey said."}
