An emergency response device said to predict falls. A combination home phone and tablet system that \u201ctransforms how older seniors connect with and are cared for by their loved ones.\u201d\n\nDaily, too, I hear tales of technology failing to do what older people or their worried families expect.\n\nI hear about frail elders who remove their emergency pendants at bedtime, then fall in the dark when they walk to the bathroom. About a 90-year-old in Sacramento, California who stored his never-worn emergency pendant in his refrigerator. About a Cambridge, Massachusetts, daughter who has tried four or five telephones \u2014 not cellphones or smartphones, but ordinary landlines \u2014 in an ongoing effort to find one simple enough for her 95-year-old mother to reliably dial her number and have a conversation.\n\nWhich scenario represents the likelier future for senior-oriented technology? It depends on whom you ask.\n\nEntrepreneurs are hard at work developing platforms, apps, sites and devices meant to help older adults manage their health, live independently and maintain family and social connections, all laudable goals.\n\nUntil a few years ago, \u201cthe whole tech world wasn\u2019t sufficiently focused on this enormous opportunity,\u201d said Stephen Johnston, a co-founder of Aging2.0, which connects technology companies with the senior care industry. \u201cIt\u2019s changing quite rapidly.\u201d\n\nA couple of recent developments have intensified U.S. entrepreneurial interest, said Laurie Orlov, a business analyst who began the Aging in Place Technology Watch blog in 2008.\n\nLast spring, a startup called Honor, which matches older adults with vetted home care workers, raised $20 million in venture capital from prominent Silicon Valley investors.\n\nIn addition, Medicare has begun to broaden the kinds of remote health monitoring \u2014 aka telehealth \u2014 that it will cover. Eventually, remote monitoring will be \u201cthe way people will stay out of emergency rooms and nursing homes,\u201d Orlov predicted.\n\nAs a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Ken Covinsky often hears from Silicon Valley tinkerers with big ideas. But he has become something of a skeptic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly well meaning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are assumptions that are at odds with the problems our patients and families are facing.\u201d\n\nTech people seem enamored, for example, with the prospect of continually monitoring older people using sensors that transmit information on when they get up, leave the house or open the refrigerator. Aside from the question of whether elders appreciate such scrutiny, Covinsky suspects that an hour or two a day from a home care worker would do them more good.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily need someone to know when they open the fridge,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need someone to make or deliver a good meal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/10/hffit30.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd08\"", "article_summary": "As a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Ken Covinsky often hears from Silicon Valley tinkerers with big ideas.\nEventually, remote monitoring will be \u201cthe way people will stay out of emergency rooms and nursing homes,\u201d Orlov predicted.\nBy Paula Span, New York Times News ServiceDaily, breathless announcements arrive in my inbox, heralding technology products for older adults.\nIn addition, Medicare has begun to broaden the kinds of remote health monitoring \u2014 aka telehealth \u2014 that it will cover.\nLast spring, a startup called Honor, which matches older adults with vetted home care workers, raised $20 million in venture capital from prominent Silicon Valley investors."}
