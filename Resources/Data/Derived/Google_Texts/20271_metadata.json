Everything you want in a player, he has. Defensively, he\u2019s unbelievable, Offensively, he\u2019s doing better that he was last year.\n\n\u201cYou hate to see a player of his stature get hurt. But I think you will see him (in this game) for many years.\u201d\n\nArenado has played in only 59 games and is hitting .289 with six homers and 30 RBIs. He\u2019s got a lot of growing to do, no doubt, but he certainly caught the eye of Beltre, who played the Rockies four times earlier this season.\n\nArenado has said he idolized Beltre as a kid, something Beltre finds a little disconcerting.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel old,\u201d the 35-year-old Beltre said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice in baseball to know that somebody else looks up to you. It\u2019s humbling, but it\u2019s nice to see that what you have done is appreciated by somebody. As good as he is, to know that he idolized you, it\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nBeltre said that he gave Arenado a gift when the two met in spring training, but he declined to say what it was.\n\nSaid Beltre: \u201cI don\u2019t like to say what it is, but the first time we met in spring training, I have him a nice gift.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Adrian Beltre,Nolan Arenado", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "All-star Adrian Beltre says that Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado would have been an all-star this season if Arenado had not been injured.", "title": "Adrian Beltre a big fan of Colorado Rockies' Nolan Arenado", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/14/18166/18166/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/06/nolan-arenado-495x348.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "All-star Adrian Beltre says that Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado would have been an all-star this season if Arenado had not been injured.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/14/18166/18166/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/06/nolan-arenado-495x348.jpg", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado has a big fan in all-star Adrian Beltre", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "All-star Adrian Beltre says that Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado would have been an all-star this season if Arenado had not been injured."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9228\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo doubt he\u2019ll be an all-star,\u201d Beltre said Monday afternoon.\nThat\u2019s not just my opinion, it\u2019s the viewpoint of Rangers all-star third baseman Adrian Beltre, who\u2019s been selected to his fourth Midsummer Classic.\nArenado has said he idolized Beltre as a kid, something Beltre finds a little disconcerting.\nSaid Beltre: \u201cI don\u2019t like to say what it is, but the first time we met in spring training, I have him a nice gift.\u201d\nHe\u2019s got a lot of growing to do, no doubt, but he certainly caught the eye of Beltre, who played the Rockies four times earlier this season."}
