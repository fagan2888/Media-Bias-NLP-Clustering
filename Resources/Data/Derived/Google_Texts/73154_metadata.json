In fundamental ways, it\u2019s similar to legislation previously introduced by Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa. and Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. \u2014 both strong animal advocates \u2014 that would put the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in charge of establishing and enforcing drug rules for horses on race day. It\u2019s our hope that the Barr-Tonko legislation, which covers just thoroughbred racing, will be amended \u2014 as the bill moves forward \u2014 to cover all horse racing, including quarter horse and standardbred racing, which have had their own share of doping scandals, such as the doping of several quarter horses with \u201cfrog juice\u201d in 2012.\n\nSome of the biggest names in thoroughbred training, such as Rick Dutrow and Doug O\u2019Neill, are chronic violators of the typically weak, highly variable state-based anti-drugging rules. And just about every horse running in the Triple Crown races this year was running on Lasix, a drug that is widely recognized as a performance enhancer. Doping horses for racing is more dangerous today than ever because breeding practices \u2014 which select for speed and champagne-glass legs \u2014 make the horses less sturdy and more vulnerable to breakdowns than they were even 10 or 20 years ago. Just hours before American Pharoah won the Belmont, a four-year-old colt named Helwan broke down, having shattered his ankle bone, and was euthanized on the track. New reports later stated it was Helwan\u2019s first time on Lasix, as he had previously only raced in Europe, where the drug has long been illegal. It\u2019s clear that our horse racing tracks in the United States are turning into crash sites.\n\nRight now, regulation of this industry is balkanized, with each of 38 racing jurisdictions having its own set of rules. They allow different medications, varying levels of permissible drugs, different penalties for violations, different rules on which horses are tested for drugs, and different laboratories to do the testing. Without one single regulating body, racehorse owners and trainers who are barred from racing in one jurisdiction can simply shop for a more permissive venue. This is a national industry, and like football or baseball or other major American sports \u2014 perhaps more so, since the equine athletes have no choice in the matter and cannot speak up for themselves \u2014 we need national standards to stop unethical trainers and veterinarians from doping horses to improve their chances of winning.\n\nThe industry is also plagued with dozens of poorly run and regulated tracks having fatality rates as much as three times the national average \u2014 the minor leagues of racing, if you will, such as Aqueduct in New York and Charlestown in West Virginia. Here and at other tracks across the country some trainers and owners are allowing unfit, unsound, even injured horses to compete. They are using drugs to get injured horses to run at full tilt, and they are even using performance-enhancing drugs, like Lasix, to push them beyond their physical limits and to put them in the money. They are gambling with the lives of these equine athletes, and this industry is in desperate need of a makeover. It starts with putting the horses ahead of profits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Performance-enhancing drugs impact more than just humans", "title": "Dozens of racing horses die every week because of drug abuse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Performance-enhancing drugs impact more than just humans", "title": "Dozens of racing horses die every week because of drug abuse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/02/dozens_of_racing_horses_die_every_week_because_of_drug_abuse_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/horse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Performance-enhancing drugs impact more than just humans", "title": "Dozens of racing horses die every week because of drug abuse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/horse.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Wayne Pacelle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Horse racing, Horses, racing, The Dodo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Horse racing, Horses, racing, The DodoThis piece originally appeared on The DodoThere is cause for hope that Congress may finally do something to impose some standards on horse racing and empower a non-governmental, independent organization to stop the widespread race-day doping of horses \u2014 a contributing factor to perhaps as many as 24 horses dying every week on American racetracks.\nIt\u2019s clear that our horse racing tracks in the United States are turning into crash sites.\nThey allow different medications, varying levels of permissible drugs, different penalties for violations, different rules on which horses are tested for drugs, and different laboratories to do the testing.\n3084, to create a single independent organization to set up and enforce uniform national anti-doping rules for thoroughbred racing.\nDoping horses for racing is more dangerous today than ever because breeding practices \u2014 which select for speed and champagne-glass legs \u2014 make the horses less sturdy and more vulnerable to breakdowns than they were even 10 or 20 years ago."}
