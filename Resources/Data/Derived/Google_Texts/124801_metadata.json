Justin Amash, have started a little caucus to represent the true, \u201chard-core\u201d alternative to the Republican Study Committee. The idea that anyone needs a more \u201chardcore\u201d Republican Study Committee seems to require some explaining. The RSC is (and has been for decades) effectively the House of Representatives\u2019 \u201cconservative caucus,\u201d the group you join to announce that you are officially not a RINO. It is also a sort of miniature right-wing think tank with extensive ties to the business and other interests that fund the right and keep Republicans in line. For years, it has produced alternative budgets and decried compromise and criticized leadership for being insufficiently dedicated to small government.\n\nIt has, it turns out, been too successful. The RSC\u2019s membership has increased rapidly as it became necessary for most House Republicans to signal their allegiance to ultra-conservatism; it now counts more than 170 members, including the most extreme members in the House, like Louie Gohmert, Michele Bachmann and Paul Broun, but also many more who rarely make headlines. There have been attempts to replace the RSC with something even more conservative in the past, but most of them \u2014 like Michele Bachmann\u2019s pathetic \u201cTea Party Caucus\u201d \u2014 were more about an individual lawmaker\u2019s play for press than about creating an alternative organization.\n\nThe problem is, the RSC, by any measure, won the battle for the House Republican caucus long ago. More than three-quarters of the GOP conference are now members, including everyone in leadership besides Boehner and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy. Its primary \u201crival,\u201d the \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican Main Street Partnership, currently has fewer than 50 members in the House.\n\nThis criticism is nothing new. Many RSC members, including some former chairmen, have long expressed concerns about its membership\u2014which now stands at 179 of 233 House Republicans. If three-quarters of the GOP Conference belongs to the RSC, they argue, the group cannot possibly practice the ideological purity on which its reputation was established. \u201cThe RSC today covers a fairly broad philosophical swath of the party. It\u2019s no longer just the hard-core right-wingers,\u201d [South Carolina Rep.. Mick] Mulvaney said, adding: \u201cIf you want to pay dues, you can get in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Liberty Caucus is a popular new far-right alternative to the far-right Republican Study Committee", "title": "House conservatives fed up with conservative caucus, form even more conservative caucus", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Liberty Caucus is a popular new far-right alternative to the far-right Republican Study Committee", "title": "House conservatives fed up with conservative caucus, form even more conservative caucus", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/17/house_conservatives_fed_up_with_conservative_caucus_form_even_more_conservative_caucus/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/amash_labrador.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Liberty Caucus is a popular new far-right alternative to the far-right Republican Study Committee", "title": "House conservatives fed up with conservative caucus, form even more conservative caucus", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/amash_labrador.jpg", "creator": "@pareene", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Pareene", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, conservative movement, Editor's Picks, Justin Amash, Republican Party, Republican Study Committee, U.S. House of Representatives", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4172\"", "article_summary": "The idea that anyone needs a more \u201chardcore\u201d Republican Study Committee seems to require some explaining.\nThe problem is, the RSC, by any measure, won the battle for the House Republican caucus long ago.\nMany RSC members, including some former chairmen, have long expressed concerns about its membership\u2014which now stands at 179 of 233 House Republicans.\nMore than three-quarters of the GOP conference are now members, including everyone in leadership besides Boehner and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.\nThe RSC is (and has been for decades) effectively the House of Representatives\u2019 \u201cconservative caucus,\u201d the group you join to announce that you are officially not a RINO."}
