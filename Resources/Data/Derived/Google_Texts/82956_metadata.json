But what can they do about it?\n\nIn Florida, where they live, obesity is the No. 1 health problem. It can\u2019t be the great weather, so what\u2019s happening? Is it a sedentary lifestyle? Is it the toxic nature of processed foods? Is it their genes, their environment, their unconquerable lust for sour cream and onion potato chips?\n\nIt\u2019s probably a mix of all these and more that makes obesity a national epidemic of massive proportions \u2014 a big, complex health care problem.\n\nBut not too big for Roz and Norm Levy. Like grass-roots organizers everywhere, they know the power of starting where you are, taking it step by step, exercising patience and positive thinking, and refusing to be discouraged. That\u2019s how you make a difference.\n\nAnd making a difference in your neighborhood, your town, is an essential part of living a healthier lifestyle. When you\u2019re grateful for what you have, you reach out to people in need.\n\nAt this point I need to tell you that Roz and Norm are close friends of my Gainesville, Florida, family, which is how I discovered them. Norm\u2019s an M.D., Ph.D. and president of the Alachua County Medical Society. Roz is a real estate broker and social activist who also heads up the Alachua County Medical Alliance. One day last year they went to hear the U.S. surgeon general give a talk. They were astonished to learn that 30 percent of every health care dollar goes toward treating obesity-related diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and stokes. Thirty percent!\n\nThat was the tipping point, Roz says. That\u2019s when they decided to launch a small grass-roots health campaign in Gainesville called COACH \u2014 Combatting Obesity for Alachua County\u2019s Health (which wins my brand new Best Acronym prize).\n\n\u201cYou have to start some place,\u201d she says, and for COACH, that place was the Santa Fe College track. The Alachua County Medical Society and Medical Alliance teamed up with public agencies, private businesses and volunteers to produce 10 Weekly Wellness Walks starting in January of 2014.\n\n\u201cWe want people to realize that walking is one of the best ways to put some exercise into their lives,\u201d says Roz. \u201cAll they need are their own two feet, a decent pair of shoes, a safe location and a bottle of water.\u201d\n\nThe weekly walks were organized for every Saturday morning, from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. They were free, fun and social. They kicked off with a 15-minute warm-up and some fitness tips from local coaches, trainers and physicians. There were water and fresh fruit to keep you fed, and sparkling cheerleaders to keep you motivated (such a Roz touch).\n\nAfter the 10 weeks, a survey was conducted. The results were released recently, and while only 25 percent of the nearly 300 participants took the survey, there was plenty of good news to report.\n\nOf the responders, 74 percent did 9-10 walks, 71 percent did 6-8 walks, and 50 percent went to the COACH website (www.walkgainesville.com) for more tips and ways to connect to other walks and walkers. Sixty percent got a free logbook (three walks required), and 80 percent went home with free pedometers (two walks). Participants reported they benefited from an improved self-image, help with weight control and making new friends.\n\n\u201cThe most valuable result is that 90 percent of the respondents are still walking,\u201d says Norm.\n\nAnother sign of success? The Wellness Walks will continue, this time two nights a week, with the Alachua County Health Department involved.\n\nAnd now the Levys and their respective organizations and partners will turn their anti-obesity attention to food. The Farm to School initiative they\u2019re pushing is all about getting healthy, local, sustainably produced foods into the Alachua County schools, along with farm tours, school gardens and cooking classes.\n\nSee why they\u2019re my heroes? And I\u2019m not alone. Roz and Norm received the HAP (Health Awareness Promotion) Award for best community service project from the American Medical Association Alliance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged,\u201d says Roz. \u201cWe kept it simple so it could be easily replicated in another community, and we are happy to share particulars with others.\u201d\n\nOf course they are. Because that\u2019s how change happens, community by community, step by step.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
