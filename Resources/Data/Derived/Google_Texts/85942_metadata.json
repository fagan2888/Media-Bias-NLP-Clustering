Let\u2019s talk about 2016.\n\nYes, 2016, when Hillary Clinton (or maybe, just maybe, Elizabeth Warren) will be the Democrats\u2019 standard-bearer challenging GOP nominee Jeb Bush\u2014or will it be Rand Paul?\u2014for the White House.\n\nOr say you\u2019re a Democrat and want a Joe Biden face-off against New Jersey\u2019s Republican Gov. Chris Christie? That could be in the cards, too. But please, don\u2019t leave off Jim Webb (a former Democratic senator from Virginia) or current Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (a Republican) from your long list.\n\nIt\u2019s too early for official declarations, of course. But all those names, and more, are in the mix for the presidential election in 2016, a mere two years away. Some have made statements openly contemplating running\u2014like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Others, like Massachusetts senator Warren, are being pushed to run by certain flanks of their party. Ted Cruz, on the Republican side, fits that bill (Need evidence? See runtedrun.com.)\n\nA list of the potential Republican candidates for 2016 includes about a dozen names, some familiar to many voters, some not. Names like Jeb Bush are certain to ring a bell, given his famous family. Other potential GOP contenders aren\u2019t as well-known. Those outside the Midwest, for instance, may have to stretch to place Mike Pence\u2019s name. (He\u2019s the governor of Indiana.)\n\nThere\u2019s been at least one more Republican to float his name since Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections: On Thursday, New York\u2019s former Gov. George Pataki said \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it, because it really comes down to the future of the country.\u201d\n\nKyle Kondik of the University of Virginia said how well any of those contenders do in 2016 hinges in part on congressional Republicans\u2019 relationship with President Barack Obama.\n\nHe said Republicans actually have an incentive for more gridlock if it leads to Obama remaining unpopular. \u201cIf Obama\u2019s approval ratings remain low, that will help the GOP presidential nominee,\u201d Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, told MarketWatch in an email.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the list is smaller, with the brightest star undoubtedly Clinton. But others are dipping their toes in the water. Alternatives to the former secretary of state may include individuals like Martin O\u2019Malley (the outgoing governor of Maryland) and even ultraliberal independent Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont. Sanders, who votes with Democrats, has said he\u2019s weighing a bid as an independent or a Democrat.\n\nAll the names in the 2016 stew come with their own personalities, baggage and appeal to different voters. On the right, Cruz and ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee are attractive to social conservatives. Warren is a hit with would-be tougher-on-Wall Street Democrats.\n\nBut who\u2019s up there in terms of winning the nomination?\n\nFor Democrats it\u2019s not even close. Hillary Clinton leads by more than 50 points in RealClearPolitics polling. Biden comes in second; Warren third; New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo fourth; and Sanders is in fifth. O\u2019Malley and Webb bring up the rear.\n\nBut don\u2019t count on the former New York senator being a shoo-in for the nomination, says Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group.\n\n\u201cMost Democrats are preparing to gear up for Hillary, but in private they worry that she hasn\u2019t shown much on the campaign trail,\u201d he wrote Monday. \u201cShe has made one gaffe after another in recent weeks and hasn\u2019t found a message. There\u2019s only one Democrat capable of snapping the party out of its funk this winter; all eyes will be on Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nThe Republican side is vastly different. Right now, it\u2019s Rand Paul who occupies the top spot among possible GOP contenders, according to RealClearPolitics. But his numbers are about the same as Jeb Bush\u2019s and Mike Huckabee\u2019s. Jindal is dead last.", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "With the midterm elections history, it\u2019s time to start thinking about the 2016 presidential race.
