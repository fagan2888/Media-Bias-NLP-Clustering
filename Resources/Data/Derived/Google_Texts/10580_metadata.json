Scullin Jr. on Saturday declared that the law in Washington, D.C., preventing individuals from carrying handguns in public is unconstitutional.\n\nIn his ruling, the federal judge concluded from previous decisions that \u201cthere is no longer any basis on which this Court can conclude that the District of Columbia\u2019s total ban on the public carrying of ready-to-use handguns outside the home is constitutional under any level of scrutiny.\u201d\n\nA senior U.S. District judge, Scullin is typically seated in New York.\n\nThe lawsuit filed against D.C. challenging the ban was instigated by four individuals along with the Washington state-based Second Amendment Foundation.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Alan Gura, insisted that Scullin\u2019s ruling will immediately take effect in the city.\n\n\u201cThe decision is in effect, unless and until the court stays its decision,\u201d asserted Gura. \u201cThis is now a decision that the city is required to follow \u2014 the idea that the city can prohibit absolutely the exercise of a constitutional right for all people at all times, that was struck down. That\u2019s just not going to fly.\u201d\n\nHe also called the city \u201csafer\u201d as a result of the ruling because individuals will now be able to defend themselves on the streets of D.C. should they need to.\n\n\u201cI believe the city is absolutely safer,\u201d Gura declared. \u201cMake no mistake about it. This is a fantastic improvement in public safety. Yes, we have a problem in America with gun violence. But no, that problem is not the result of law-abiding people carrying guns.\u201d\n\nMany individuals took to Twitter to express their relief at and support of the ruling.\n\n\u201cD.C. is one of the worst crime-ridden cities in America. It\u2019s about time that a ban on conceal carry is overturned! #2A #moregunslesscrime,\u201d wrote the Leadership Institute\u2019s Gabriella Hoffman.\n\n\u201cD.C.\u2018s flagrantly unconstitutional carry ban struck down in no uncertain terms. Hell. Yes,\u201d said Charles C.W. Cooke of National Review.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Judge Frederick J.
