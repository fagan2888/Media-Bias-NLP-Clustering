AMA Calls for Coverage Expansion, SGR Repeal

Undeterred by the results of the midterm elections, the American Medical Association is urging states that have rejected Medicaid expansion programs "to develop expansion waivers that help increase coverage options for their low income adult residents."

The American Medical Association is calling for expansion of health insurance coverage for adults in states that rejected Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and renewing the call for repeal of the sustainable growth rate formula.

The policy statement emerged this week from the AMA's annual House of Delegates meeting in Dallas, TX just days after Republican victories in the Nov. 4 midterm elections. Republicans flogged Obamacare for months on end during the campaign season, and many elected officials and pundits believe the PPACA may be in for more turbulence now that Republicans control the House and Senate.

In addition, Republican, or Republican-leaning governors in five states that opposed Medicaid expansion were re-elected last week, further reducing the likelihood of a program expansion.

Still, the nation's largest, oldest physicians association was undeterred.

"The AMA is sensitive to state concerns about expanding Medicaid in a traditional manner, but we believe they must find ways to expand health insurance coverage to their uninsured populations, especially as coverage disparities continue to grow between expansion and non-expansion states," AMA Immediate Past Board Chair, David O. Barbe, MD, said in prepared remarks.
