Although the world was able to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people without access to clean water five years ahead of schedule, sanitation improvement campaigns aren\u2019t expected to meet that threshold by the 2015 target date.\n\nPeople in countries that don\u2019t have effective sanitation systems and private toilets are exposed to a number of public health risks, including the possibility of infections, higher child death rates, and an increased risk for women to become victims of sexual violence while urinating or defecating in public areas. Those factors also exacerbate existing socioeconomic disparities.\n\n\u201cThe lack of improved sanitation largely contributes to the fact that almost 2,000 children die every day from preventable diarrhoeal diseases,\u201d the UN\u2019s statement on World Toilet Day notes. \u201cIt also impacts vulnerable populations such as persons with disabilities and women, who are more exposed to sexual violence. Lack of private toilets in schools is a major reason why girls do not continue their education once they enter puberty.\u201d\n\nIn fact, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimate that lack of sanitation causes 10 percent of the world\u2019s disease burden. In a 2010 study, the authors highlighted the approximate economic benefits of improving sanitation standards to meet Millennium Development Goals:\n\nCREDIT: PLOS Medicine\n\n\u201cThe health sector now needs to reassert its commitment and leadership to help achieve a world in which everybody has access to adequate sanitation,\u201d concluded the authors.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Lack of access to sanitation causes approximately 10 percent of global disease burden.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Lack of access to sanitation causes approximately 10 percent of global disease burden.", "title": "\u2018World Toilet Day\u2019 Shines A Light On The Public Health Dangers Of Inadequate Sanitation", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/19/2966921/world-toilet-day-sanitation/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_toilet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lack of access to sanitation causes approximately 10 percent of global disease burden.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_toilet-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018World Toilet Day\u2019 Shines A Light On The Public Health Dangers Of Inadequate Sanitation", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_toilet.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_toilet.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-19T13:42:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3c91\"", "article_summary": "Health \u2018World Toilet Day\u2019 Shines A Light On The Public Health Dangers Of Inadequate Sanitation CREDIT: ShutterstockThe United Nations has declared Tuesday, November 19 to be \u201cWorld Toilet Day.\u201d It\u2019s an attempt to promote developing nations\u2019 efforts to provide their people with clean water and sanitation systems, and to raise awareness about a critical public health disparity that more privileged nations often take for granted.\n\u201cThe lack of improved sanitation largely contributes to the fact that almost 2,000 children die every day from preventable diarrhoeal diseases,\u201d the UN\u2019s statement on World Toilet Day notes.\n\u201cWorld Toilet Day aims to change both behaviour and policy on issues ranging from enhancing water management to ending open-air defecation (which 1.1 billion people practice worldwide),\u201d write UN officials on the agency\u2019s website.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 2.6 billion people across the world \u2014 a third of the entire human population \u2014 don\u2019t have access to proper sanitation such as toilets or latrines.\n\u201cIt also impacts vulnerable populations such as persons with disabilities and women, who are more exposed to sexual violence."}
