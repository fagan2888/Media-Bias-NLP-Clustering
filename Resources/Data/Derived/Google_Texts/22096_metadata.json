To keep up with a \u201ckilling line\u201d that runs ever faster to deliver America\u2019s most popular meat to our plates \u2013 a breakneck rate of 140 birds a minute \u2013 a largely immigrant workforce of roughly 250,000 endures chronic and crippling injuries for poverty wages.\n\nTo churn out millions of processed chickens \u2013 30 million a day, and a record 89 pounds a year per American consumer \u2013 the poultry industry relies on severe yet normalized worker exploitation: chronic pain, lifelong repetitive motion injuries, and humiliation. After hours slicing through thousands of birds, knives grow dull, skid off the cold slippery parts, stabbing workers in the hand or arm. Poultry workers are still routinely denied bathroom breaks; some report wearing diapers to avoid soiling themselves while processing our chicken dinners without a break.\n\nThese \u201clives on the line,\u201d the title of a powerful new Oxfam America report, are the human reality behind our meals \u2013 and it turns out we are all paying a heavy price for so-called \u201ccheap chicken.\u201d This toll includes tens of thousands of workers maimed on the job each year, crippling bodies and livelihoods; billions of dollars in federal contracts to Tyson Foods and others, despite their long record of worker mistreatment and safety violations; and massive public expense for workers\u2019 emergency room visits and ongoing healthcare needs. (While there is no specific breakdown for the poultry industry, the National Safety Council estimates all workplace injuries and fatalities cost taxpayers $198 billion in 2012.)\n\nThe Oxfam report amplifies a growing movement pressuring the poultry and meat packing industries to both pay and treat their workers better. Just before the report went public, on October 23, Tyson announced it will increase worker pay at some of its plants; that same day, OSHA launched a program to encourage employers to improve worker safety. Earlier this year, after pressure from the Food Chain Alliance and other groups citing labor practices, the Los Angeles Unified School District postponed renewal of contracts with Tyson and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride to provide lunch meat.\n\nAt the root of Big Chicken\u2019s mistreatment of workers is the economic and political clout of a few powerful corporations and their industry lobbying arms, the National Chicken Council and the American Meat Institute \u2013 which have successfully pressured both Democrats and Republicans to speed up the assembly line and weaken regulations such as injury reporting. The top four companies \u2013 Tyson Foods, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Sanderson Farms and Perdue Farms \u2013 control 60 percent of the U.S. poultry market, churning out products under more than 30 name brands, according to Oxfam\u2019s report.\n\nWhile the industry touts officially declining injury rates, research by Oxfam, OSHA and others shows poultry companies discourage injury reporting by pressuring ailing workers to return to the assembly line \u2013 often leading to severe chronic injuries. A federal rule change secured by the industry in 2012 also restricted which injuries need to be reported. Even official injury data show disturbing hazards: poultry workers are five times more likely than the average employee to get hurt on the job, and seven times more likely to get carpal tunnel syndrome.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chicken is seen as cheap protein and convenient food.
