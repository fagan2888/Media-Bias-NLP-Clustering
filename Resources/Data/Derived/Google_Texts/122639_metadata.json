They examined the mothers\u2019 urine while they were pregnant, measuring the levels of metabolites for four phthalates. When the children were 7 years old, the researchers tested their IQ. The study \u201cshowed significant decrements in IQ associated with two specific phthalates,\u201d the authors wrote in their conclusion. Mothers who had concentrations of phthalates in the highest 25 percent ended up having kids with IQ scores up to six to eight points lower than kids of mothers who were in the lowest 25 percent of exposure to phthalates. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a substantial effect,\u201d Factor-Litvak told Time. \u201cHonestly, I think we were a bit surprised that the reduction was so large.\u201d\n\nPhthalates are chemical compounds often added into various products to keep them flexible; they\u2019re used to make plastic \u201cbendable\u201d and can be found nearly everywhere. They\u2019re used in cosmetics like soap, shampoo, hair spray, perfume, plastic toys, shower curtains, wallpaper, and even food packaging and plastic wrap. Though research is still being done on the harmful effects of phthalates, Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate is listed as \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,\u201d according to the 13th Report on Carcinogens from the National Toxicology Program.\n\nMore research will be needed for scientists to understand how exactly phthalates impact IQ levels, though they speculate that phthalates might act as endocrine disruptors to the mother\u2019s thyroid hormone, which is crucial in the development of a child\u2019s brain. \u201cThese findings are important to inform policy makers of the potentially harmful effects of this class of chemicals,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nIndeed, previous studies have shown that it\u2019s not just nail polish that isn\u2019t regulated properly, but also the acts of manicures and nail salons in general. One study published in JAMA Dermatology this year investigated whether the UV nail lamps at salons increased the risk of skin cancer in women who visited nail salons regularly. Though the risk was very small, the researchers concluded that it was important to improve regulatory procedures in nail salons. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s no regulation of nail lamp exposure,\u201d Dr. Chris Adigun, a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center, told NPR. \u201cFor patients who aren\u2019t concerned about the melanoma risk,\" it's important to \"know about the photo aging that comes from UV exposure.\u201d\n\nSource: Factor-Litvak P, Insel B, Calafat A, Liu X, Perera F, Rauh V.
