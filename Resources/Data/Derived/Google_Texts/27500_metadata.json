Lindsey Graham\u2019s (R-S.C.) campaign for president isn\u2019t just about damning the torpedoes and declaring war on any nation that dares to give America the side-eye. This week, Graham transparently pandered to the far-right base by reminding everyone that he also happens to be a total ghoul on the issue of reproductive rights.\n\nOn Thursday, Graham introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate titled \u201cThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\u201d A version of the bill was passed in the House already and, along the same lines, Graham\u2019s version would ban all abortions with few exceptions after the 20th week of pregnancy. The twisted reasoning goes like this: After 20 weeks, fetuses can feel pain. That\u2019s what they say. And by \u201cthey,\u201d I don\u2019t mean actual doctors. We\u2019ll circle back to that presently.\n\nSaid Graham, \u201cWhy do we want to let this happen five months into the pregnancy? I am dying for that debate. I\u2019m going to quite frankly insist that we have that debate.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Graham and the modern Republican Party have entirely divorced themselves from both reality and science. Before we dig into the science behind why Graham and the anti-choice base are horrendously wrong, the reality is that states where there are few if any anti-choice laws, abortion rates are dropping precipitously.\n\nAuthor and activist Kimberley Johnson brought to our attention a new study conducted by the AP, showing that pro-choice states such as New York, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, New Mexico, Nevada, Rhode Island and Connecticut showed steep declines in abortions by as much as 20 to 30 percent since 2010. Elsewhere, states like Louisiana and Michigan showed increases in abortions as women seeking access to abortion services in neighboring anti-choice states, including Texas, fled the restrictive laws in their home states.\n\nIt turns out, states that restrict abortion access showed slower declines in the abortion rate than pro-choice states, chiefly due to the fact that pro-choice states tend to also provide greater access to contraception. Naturally, this makes perfect sense given how affordable, readily-available contraception not only prevents unplanned pregnancies but also prevents abortions. Incongruously, however, anti-choice Republicans and activists have zero compulsion to help make contraception more available. Indeed, the exact opposite is true. This is transparently regressive and misogynistic, given how it effectively blocks women from either having or, indeed, preventing an abortion. Graham and the others are cynically cutting off all access to reproductive services, and it\u2019s not difficult to see this as anything other than a legislative war on women.\n\nBack to Lindsey Graham. The newly-minted presidential candidate is not only a leading conspirator in the crusade to slowly roll back reproductive rights; he also opposes the Affordable Care Act and its mandate for free access to contraception, including morning-after birth control (which merely prevents conception, not implantation, by the way). So, what\u2019s the deal with this arbitrary-sounding 20 week threshold? Again, Graham and the others are trying to tell us that after 20 weeks, fetuses feel pain. It turns out the Journal of the American Medical Association contradict\u2019s Graham\u2019s clueless take on fetal biology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lindsey Graham has introduced a new anti-abortion bill in the Senate, one that makes clear where GOP priorities are", "title": "The GOP\u2019s \u201cMad Max\u201d fantasy: Lindsey Graham fires the latest shot in the war on women", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lindsey Graham has introduced a new anti-abortion bill in the Senate, one that makes clear where GOP priorities are", "title": "The GOP\u2019s \u201cMad Max\u201d fantasy: Lindsey Graham fires the latest shot in the war on women", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/the_gops_mad_max_fantasy_lindsey_graham_fires_the_latest_shot_in_the_war_on_woman/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/lindsey_graham5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lindsey Graham has introduced a new anti-abortion bill in the Senate, one that makes clear where GOP priorities are", "title": "The GOP\u2019s \u201cMad Max\u201d fantasy: Lindsey Graham fires the latest shot in the war on women", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/lindsey_graham5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bob Cesca", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Anti-abortion movement, Lindsey Graham, The Republican Party, War on women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb424\"", "article_summary": "This week, Graham transparently pandered to the far-right base by reminding everyone that he also happens to be a total ghoul on the issue of reproductive rights.\nSo, what\u2019s the deal with this arbitrary-sounding 20 week threshold?\nThis is transparently regressive and misogynistic, given how it effectively blocks women from either having or, indeed, preventing an abortion.\nAgain, Graham and the others are trying to tell us that after 20 weeks, fetuses feel pain.\nElsewhere, states like Louisiana and Michigan showed increases in abortions as women seeking access to abortion services in neighboring anti-choice states, including Texas, fled the restrictive laws in their home states."}
