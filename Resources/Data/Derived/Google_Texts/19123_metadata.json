That little boy and his relatable story is now the premise for a children\u2019s book that will be distributed to 1,000 Maine foster children this holiday season.\n\nBucksport resident Jan Riddle recently self-published a \u201cflip book\u201d illustrated by Maine artist Stephen Costanza that features a young boy\u2019s story on one side and his sister\u2019s story on the other side. The two stories, \u201cShane\u2019s Best Week Ever!\u201d and \u201cJust Because,\u201d come together as the characters meet each other again at the center of the book.\n\nThe brother and sister in the book are separated when they have to go live with foster families. It is a situation Riddle and advocates say is all too common for children around Maine.\n\nCompleting a family\n\nThe Riddles hadn\u2019t planned on having a baby boy join their family through adoption. In fact, on their application with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, they had asked for a girl up to 2-years-old. Instead, they were told about Sean who had been born prematurely and was being immediately placed in a foster home.\n\nHe was the perfect person to complete their family.\n\n\u201cHe was this beautiful baby boy and I knew I was going to love him right away,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cHe\u2019s just an amazing person, he\u2019s very compassionate and quiet.\u201d\n\nIt took two years, but Jan and her now-late husband Rob immediately knew they were going to adopt Sean. Their biological daughter Kelleigh, just five years older than him, were fast friends and the family felt complete, Riddle said.\n\nRob died in 2010 and Kelleigh has gone off to college, so Jan and Sean, now 16, have found themselves holding close to each other, thankful for their relationship.\n\n\u201cWe really were blessed \u2026 there are good stories that come out of foster care,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cAll we have is each other and that\u2019s a good place to be, it\u2019s a dicey place to be sometimes too, but we\u2019re doing it and we\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nThe pair enjoys attending concerts together, playing video games and more recently, Sean has taken on more responsibility in the home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool that he\u2019s taking on more responsibility,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cWe have to do everything ourselves, but it means we are completely intermingled in each others\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nSince life has quieted a bit since they were a family of four, Riddle said she\u2019s had time to revisit her idea of writing a book inspired in part by Sean\u2019s story.\n\nA common story\n\nWhen Sean was 2-years-old Jan and Rob connected with the foster-adopt parents of his half brother born nine months prior. He too was in a foster home with a family hoping to adopt him.\n\nJan said the boys played well together, but the relationship didn\u2019t continue because the other family was not interested in their son knowing Sean.\n\nIt was heartbreaking for Jan. She had wanted the boys to grow up knowing one another as siblings. And while she respected the family\u2019s decision, her sadness at the situation stuck with her.\n\nOver the years, she met more children who were separated from their siblings, some knowingly, others who simply didn\u2019t know they had brothers or sisters. Their stories, all too common in the foster care system, gave way to the story of Savana and Shane.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that children are removed from their homes,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cBut then, to have them removed from their homes without their siblings, the book kind of speaks to that.\u201d\n\nRiddle hopes the story will help children coping with separation from a sibling realize the situation they\u2019re in is not their fault and a happy ending is possible. But she also wants to send a message to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a timely story \u2026 [DHHS] is doing a fantastic job often on very low funds \u2026 but I wanted people to know that these kids are separated and how devastating that is,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional issue for me so it comes from my compassion about the situation.\u201d\n\nBette Hoxie, the executive director for Adoptive and Foster Families of Maine, said the situation depicted in Riddle\u2019s book, while difficult to swallow, is all too real for many Maine children.\n\nThe foster care system in Maine is currently short of safe homes for children, meaning it\u2019s likely that if two or more children have to be removed from a home, that they will be separated.\n\n\u201cDHHS really tries to keep kids together, but sometimes it just isn\u2019t something we can do,\u201d Hoxie said adding that they hear from children who have left foster care that this aspect is one of the worst about having to leave.\n\n\u201cWithout exception we hear kids saying, \u2018I needed someone to anchor me \u2026 I needed my sibling,\u2019\u201d Hoxie said.\n\nA gift with a message\n\nEach holiday season, groups like Adoptive and Foster Families of Maine, throws parties for children around the state where each child is given a book and a gift. The organization also has a lending library with books talking about many aspects of foster care and adoption.\n\nThis year, 1,000 of those books, published through funding from a grant, will be Riddle\u2019s story, handed out by Hoxie and others at holiday events around the state. Several will go to foster parents in training, but the majority will go to children. They will not be sold because Riddle wants them given as gifts to the subset of readers she thinks needs them the most.\n\nHoxie said books with stories like the ones told in Riddle\u2019s book often help children understand sometimes complicated situations. They can also be translated or individualized to fit the child\u2019s circumstances at the time.\n\n\u201cBooks have a way of breaking down a situation,\u201d Hoxie said. \u201cIt provides the opportunity to give them a better understanding that they didn\u2019t create the situation and that they can be safe.\u201d\n\nThe books will be distributed to children at parties this week. Riddle said it\u2019s a dream come true and she\u2019s happy such good has come out of Sean\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an amazing boy, I\u2019m so grateful that he\u2019s here and has chosen to be in this place,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you would like more information about fostering a Maine child, contact Adoptive and Foster Families of Maine at 207-827-2331 or visit the DHHS Child and Family Services website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sixteen years ago, a tiny 4 pound baby, born 10 weeks early, came to live with a Bucksport family of three.
