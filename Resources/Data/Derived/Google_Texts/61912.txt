The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed a $63,000 fine against a Dawn milling plant over 11 alleged serious violations at the facility.

In October, OSHA’s Lubbock office inspected Richardson Milling Inc. under a program for industries engaged in grain-handling activities.

Inspectors cited the facility for a series of alleged violations, including failing to use approved electrical equipment in areas with dangerous levels of combustible dust, failing to properly guard belts and pulleys to prevent amputations, failing to secure compressed gas cylinders to prevent them from being knocked over and failing to remove an unapproved forklift with exposed conductor cables, which the agency said could potentially ignite combustible dust.

According to information from OSHA, a serious violation occurs when there is a substantial probability that death or serious harm could result from a hazard that the employer knew about or should have known about.

Juan Rodriguez, an OSHA spokesman, said the citations were issued Tuesday. Richardson Milling, a grain-milling plant, has 15 days from the receipt of the citations to comply, seek an information conference with OSHA’s area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review, Rodriguez said.

“Allowing grain milling dust to accumulate near equipment that could start an explosion is a recipe for disaster,” Elizabeth Linda Routh, OSHA’s area director in Lubbock, said in a statement. “Richardson Milling exposed its workers to preventable dangers.”

A woman who answered the phone at Richardson Milling in Dawn referred the Globe-News to a company spokeswoman, who did not immediately return a phone call Wednesday seeking comment on the investigation.
