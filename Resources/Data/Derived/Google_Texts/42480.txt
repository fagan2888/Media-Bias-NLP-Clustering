CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Starting this month, hatchery workers will begin stocking trout to 55 West Virginia waters.

The state Division of Natural Resources says trout hatcheries are located in the state’s highest mountains, where weather conditions often are much more severe than they are at lower elevations.

Winter weather conditions could slow the distribution of trout, which weigh in at 40,000 pounds.

Tom Oldham is a biologist with DNR’s cold-water fisheries arm.

He says any stockings that get missed because of weather will be made up before the end of the stocking season.

Most of the stockings will begin Monday.
