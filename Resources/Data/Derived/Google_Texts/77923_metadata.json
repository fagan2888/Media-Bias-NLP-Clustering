The New York Times reports that a similar measure was proposed and voted down in 2012, but a version presented by legislator Shimon Ohayon passed in Parliament by 44 to 17 Wednesday. It will now face committee hearings and three more Parliament votes before being signed in to law.\n\nAccording to the Times the proposed bill will \u201cmake it a crime to call someone a Nazi \u2014 or any other slur associated with the Third Reich \u2014 or to use Holocaust-related symbols in a noneducational way.\u201d The punishment? Up to $29,000 in fines and as much as six months in jail.\n\nThe move comes as a reaction to the increasing levity with which the words are bandied about\u2014the lawmakers in favor the bill think it\u2019s necessary in order to preserve a sense of reverence for one of the greatest human tragedies of the twentieth century.\n\n\u201cFreedom of speech is important, but in my opinion, every country has to establish certain value-based limits,\u201d says Rabbi and Parliament member Dov Lipman.\n\nWhat\u2019s weird is that we\u2019re not talking about curbing free speech in order to keep people from insulting Jews or the Jewish legacy. Israel is actually trying to forcibly stop people from degrading the Nazi reputation.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Making fun of Nazis has been a form of catharsis for Jews and non-Jews alike for decades. From Woody Allen movies to The Soup Nazi on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d making fun of Nazis has had constructive place in culture. It\u2019s lessened the sting of an incalculable atrocity, and giving the Nazi archetype some levity has been a way to exert a degree of dominance over a crushing period of history.\n\nSure, the comparisons to Hitler do get old. \u201cObamacare is just like Hitler.\u201d \u201cSuspending A-Rod from the Yankees is just like Hitler.\u201d It\u2019s obnoxious and it\u2019s tiresome. But if you\u2019re that evil, you\u2019re going to get parodied. People are going to take your image and use it as an insult. It\u2019s just a basic human impulse.\n\nOf course, the bill has plenty of opponents in Israel. Civil liberties lawyer Amir Fuchs tells the Times, \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t support using these words, and also the symbols of the Nazis, and using the Holocaust to persuade and to try to use it in every conversation. But you measure the freedom of speech in a democratic country in the freedom to say these disturbing and annoying things, not in what is nice and pleasant to hear.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"NO FREE SPEECH FOR YOU!\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "\u201cNO FREE SPEECH FOR YOU!\u201d", "title": "Israel may ban using the word \u2018Nazi\u2019 as an insult", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/213279/israel-may-ban-using-the-word-nazi-as-an-insult/", "image": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-16-at-11.14.32-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cNO FREE SPEECH FOR YOU!\u201d", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "israel ban the word nazi,israel ban word nazi,israel proposal ban word nazi,news", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-16T16:06:10Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-16T16:06:10Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe263c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNO FREE SPEECH FOR YOU!\u201dIsrael is provoking all kinds of free-speech issues with a proposed ban on using the word \u201cNazi\u201d as an insult.\nFrom Woody Allen movies to The Soup Nazi on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d making fun of Nazis has had constructive place in culture.\nIsrael is actually trying to forcibly stop people from degrading the Nazi reputation.\nAccording to the Times the proposed bill will \u201cmake it a crime to call someone a Nazi \u2014 or any other slur associated with the Third Reich \u2014 or to use Holocaust-related symbols in a noneducational way.\u201d The punishment?\nIt will now face committee hearings and three more Parliament votes before being signed in to law."}
