In one of many references to an American \u201cright to rise,\u201d he added:\n\nBut they are wrong. We believe that every American and every community has a right to pursue happiness. They have a right to rise. So I say: Let\u2019s go where our ideas can matter most. Where the failures of liberal government are most obvious. Let\u2019s deliver real conservative success.\n\nThe result, Bush added: \u201ca whole lot of new conservatives.\u201d\n\nHe specifically mentioned the energy, manufacturing, health care and technology sectors as subjects for future policy addresses anchored in \u201cconservative principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe progressive and liberal mindset believes that to every problem there is a Washington, D.C., solution,\u201d @JebBush says.\n\n\u201cThe progressive and liberal mindset believes that to every problem there is a Washington, D.C., solution,\u201d Bush said in a speech lasting just over 20 minutes. \u201cBut that instinct doesn\u2019t solve any problem, other than the problem of how to keep Washington\u2019s regional economy well lubricated.\u201d\n\nMichigan likely will hold its GOP presidential primary in late March, making it a significant prize.\n\n\u201cThe progress Detroit has made because of Republican leadership is undeniable, so it makes perfect sense for potential presidential candidates both to come and share their vision for our country, and learn from the results we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d the state\u2019s Republican Party chairman, Bobby Schostak, said in a statement to the Detroit News.\n\nBush recently formed two political action committees, both using the words \u201cRight to Rise,\u201d to raise money and otherwise further a bid for the presidency.\n\nWhile in Detroit, he planned to meet privately with potential donors and political supporters, \u201cgauging interest for a potential run for president,\u201d spokesman Kristy Campbell told the Detroit News.\n\nThe son and younger brother of previous presidents, Bush was seen as getting a big boost Friday when the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, announced that he would not seek the nomination a third time.\n\n\u201cTens of millions of Americans no longer see a clear path to rise above their challenges.\u201d\u2013@JebBush in Detroit\n\nBush\u2019s likely Republican rivals to his right include Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Some two dozen potential GOP candidates are looking at a race; none has announced.\n\nOther excerpts from Bush\u2019s prepared remarks provided by his RightToRisePAC.org:\n\nHow do we restore America\u2019s faith in the moral promise of our great nation that any child born today can reach further than their parents? This is an urgent issue: Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. And many more feel like they\u2019re stuck in place, working longer and harder, even as they\u2019re losing ground. Tens of millions of Americans no longer see a clear path to rise above their challenges.\n\n\u2026\n\nSix years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer \u2026 and millions of people have given up looking for a job altogether. Roughly two out of three American households live paycheck to paycheck. Any unexpected expense can push them into financial ruin. We have a record number of Americans on food stamps and living in poverty. The recovery has been everywhere but in the family paychecks. The American Dream has become a mirage for far too many. So the central question we face here in Detroit and across America is this: Can we restore that dream \u2014 that moral promise \u2014 that each generation can do better?\n\n\u2026\n\nOur nation has always valued such economic freedom because in economic freedom, each citizen has the power to propel themselves forward and upward. This really isn\u2019t understood in Washington, D.C. And you can see why: It\u2019s a company town. And the company is government. It\u2019s all they know. For several years now, they have been recklessly degrading the value of work, the incentive to work and the rewards of work.\n\n\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a better way. Let\u2019s define this path first by the core principles of a Right to Rise society because once we do that, the policies, the laws and the way forward will be much clearer.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis morning, 320 million Americans got up \u2026 and they are on 320 million different paths of life. It\u2019s our goal to see them succeed. And it\u2019s our responsibility to do everything possible to help them. Because by their success, they will not only build prosperity for themselves. They will renew the promise of this nation when everyone has the right to rise.\n\n>>> Watch the speech and Q&A on C-SPAN.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former Florida governor, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, calls for conservative reforms to reverse \u201cthe failures of liberal government.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The former Florida governor, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, calls for conservative reforms to reverse \u201cthe failures of liberal government.\u201d", "title": "Jeb Bush Outlines Conservative Reform Agenda in Detroit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos069387.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-04T15:57:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zS4YUh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The former Florida governor, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, calls for conservative reforms to reverse \u201cthe failures of liberal government.\u201d", "title": "Jeb Bush Outlines Conservative Reform Agenda in Detroit", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos069387.jpg"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-02-04T13:08:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T15:57:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, Right to Rise, detroit economic club, 2016 race for president, Republican presidential candidates, Mitt Romney, conservative Detroit Economic Club, Michigan primary"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLet\u2019s start with the simple principle of who holds the power,\u201d Bush said, according to excerpts of remarks as prepared for delivery.\nIn one of many references to an American \u201cright to rise,\u201d he added:But they are wrong.\nBush recently formed two political action committees, both using the words \u201cRight to Rise,\u201d to raise money and otherwise further a bid for the presidency.\n\u201cThe progressive and liberal mindset believes that to every problem there is a Washington, D.C., solution,\u201d Bush said in a speech lasting just over 20 minutes.\nThey will renew the promise of this nation when everyone has the right to rise."}
