Their reckless and often fraudulent actions resulted in part from compensation structures. Loan originators falsified mortgage documents to maximize commissions. Mortgage securitizers gutted quality control reviews to meet pay-connected approval quotas. Traders doubled down on high-risk positions for higher bonuses. And senior executives disguised their precarious dependence on overnight loans until they could cash in on their stock options.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFollowing numerous investigations highlighting the role of Wall Street pay in the crash, including a high-profile investigation by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Congress adopted Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. This provision directs the regulators to prohibit pay structure that \u201cencourages inappropriate risks.\u201d\n\nGiven the central role of pay in the crisis, Congress set an urgent deadline for regulators to prescribe a rule: April, 2011. That\u2019s more than three years ago, and while a proposed rule came out fairly quickly, it was weak, and we\u2019ve seen no signs that the final rule is near.\n\nOn July 3 of this year, President Obama declared the need for independence from Wall Street gambling. He called for banks to grow the \u201creal economy. . . not a situation in which we continue to see a lot of these banks take big risks because the profit incentive and the bonus incentive is there for them. That is an unfinished piece of business.\u201d\n\nTo her credit, Fed Chair Yellen has placed this rule on its agenda of priorities. So have all the other agencies that must jointly write the rule, with one notable exception: The Securities and Exchange Commission. Public Citizen recently documented the unusually slow pace of rule-making at the SEC, noting that Chair White has moved back most of the deadlines she originally set six months into her tenure. We urge her to hasten the pace on this rule and other pressing reform needs.\n\nBut next to Obama, Yellen is the nation\u2019s most important financial policymaker. The rule that the Fed and other regulators proposed in 2011 is woefully inadequate. It proposes no substantive changes, requiring only that banks adopt vague guidelines. It requires that a fraction of pay be deferred for three years, but most major banks have already adopted stronger deferral policies.\n\nOne idea addressed by Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo along with New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley calls for linking banker pay to the bank\u2019s debt. While stock options link pay to a rising stock price that might follow added risk, debt would link pay to the bank\u2019s reduction in risk. If the bank faltered, this debt would be converted to equity. That means the banker would sacrifice interest payments and the claim on debt repayment. Instead, the banker would hold equity presumably priced at market value substantially less than the debt. What is Yellen\u2019s view of this idea?\n\nMore broadly, we urge the Fed to replace a bonus system that draws away some of the brightest young minds who might otherwise work in technology or pharmaceutical industries.\n\nCan reforming banker pay address the yawning income gap? The concentration of wealth in the top centile is no better expressed than with excessive banker compensation. As part of the Fed\u2019s mandate to maximize employment, this concentration of corporate revenue in pay for the elite leave less for rank and file workers, less money to expand overall employment.\n\nWith this statute, the Fed and other regulators can establish rules that will restore sanity to banking, returning it to its mission of sober intermediation between savers and users of capital. It\u2019s time to finish this business.\n\nNaylor is a financial policy advocate for the Congress Watch project at Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Bankers' reckless and often fraudulent actions resulted in part from compensation structures.", "description": "Bankers' reckless and often fraudulent actions resulted in part from compensation structures.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Bankers' reckless and often fraudulent actions resulted in part from compensation structures.", "title": "Unfinished business: Banker pay reform", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/212005-unfinished-business-banker-pay-reform", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/212005-unfinished-business-banker-pay-reform", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-14T16:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Bartlett Naylor", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-14T16:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/212005-unfinished-business-banker-pay-reform", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Bankers' reckless and often fraudulent actions resulted in part from compensation structures.", "card": "summary", "title": "Unfinished business: Banker pay reform"}, "dcterms.title": "Unfinished business: Banker pay reform"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTFollowing numerous investigations highlighting the role of Wall Street pay in the crash, including a high-profile investigation by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Congress adopted Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.\nDaniel Tarullo along with New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley calls for linking banker pay to the bank\u2019s debt.\nCan reforming banker pay address the yawning income gap?\nOn July 3 of this year, President Obama declared the need for independence from Wall Street gambling.\nWhile stock options link pay to a rising stock price that might follow added risk, debt would link pay to the bank\u2019s reduction in risk."}
