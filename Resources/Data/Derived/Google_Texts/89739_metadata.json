On the potential for increasing sanctions on Russia, Obama said the U.S. and European allies are always looking at more penalties but \u201cat this point the sanctions we have in place are biting plenty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also very firm on the need to uphold core international principles,\u201d Obama said at a press conference to wrap up a weeklong Asia-Pacific tour. \u201cOne of those principles is that you don\u2019t invade other countries or finance proxies and support them in ways that break up a country that has mechanisms for democratic elections.\u201d\n\nDespite a cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels signed in Minsk, Belarus, in September, fighting continues and key conditions haven\u2019t been met. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of fueling the rebellion with a constant flow of troops and weapons, accusations Moscow has denied.\n\nObama said his interactions with Putin during summits he\u2019s attended on his tour were typical of their interactions \u2013 \u201cbusinesslike and blunt.\u201d He said Russia will continue to experience international isolation if Moscow doesn\u2019t take a different path. \u201cIt is not our preference to see Russia isolated the way it is,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin departed Australia shortly before Obama and European leaders opened their talks. French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron were among the European leaders attending the meeting, along with leaders from Italy and Spain and EU representatives.\n\nThe White House said the leaders in Sunday\u2019s meeting also were expected to discuss a proposed trade agreement between the U.S. and European Union.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama on Sunday bluntly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not living up to a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, but offered no new plans for how the West might change his calculus.", "pubdate": 20141116, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "President Barack Obama on Sunday bluntly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not living up to a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, but offered no new plans for how the West might change his calculus.", "title": "Obama criticizes Putin for not adhering to cease-fire", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/458791140.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-criticizes-putin-adhering-cease-fire/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "President Barack Obama on Sunday bluntly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not living up to a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, but offered no new plans for how the West might change his calculus.", "title": "Obama criticizes Putin for not adhering to cease-fire", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/458791140.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Vladimir Putin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, ceasefire, PBS NewsHour Weekend, russia, Ukraine, Vladimir Putin"}, "article_summary": "Putin departed Australia shortly before Obama and European leaders opened their talks.\nObama spoke shortly after huddling with European leaders to discuss the conflict and worsening security situation.\nBRISBANE, Australia \u2014 President Barack Obama on Sunday bluntly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not living up to a cease-fire agreement in Ukraine, but offered no new plans for how the West might change his calculus.\nUkraine and the West have accused Russia of fueling the rebellion with a constant flow of troops and weapons, accusations Moscow has denied.\nFrench President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron were among the European leaders attending the meeting, along with leaders from Italy and Spain and EU representatives."}
