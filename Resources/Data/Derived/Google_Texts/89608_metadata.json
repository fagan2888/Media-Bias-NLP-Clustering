Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) employed an analogy of building muscle during exercise with repeated movements, noting Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-Wis.) affinity for the P90X workout routine.\n\n\u201cNormally doing additional reps builds muscle mass. But the one muscle Republicans aren\u2019t exercising is their brain,\u201d she said during House floor debate on the legislation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPut down the political equivalent of that giant plate of nachos and exercise the hard job of governing,\u201d Speier said.\n\nThe House has voted more than 60 times since 2011 to undo the healthcare law. But Wednesday\u2019s vote will be the first time that Republicans will be able to send repeal legislation \u2014 which also defunds Planned Parenthood \u2014 to President Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nRepublicans are further expected to conduct votes to attempt to override the president\u2019s likely veto in the coming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
