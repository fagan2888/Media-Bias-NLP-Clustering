A May 12 trial date is set for a woman accused of providing alcoholic drinks to six teenagers, three of whom died in a car wreck.

The Hattiesburg American reports Kristi Morris, of Purvis, is scheduled for trial in Lamar County Justice Court on six counts of letting minors possess or consume alcoholic drinks on her property. A law called the Social Host law makes that illegal.

Morris was arrested Dec. 17, after an investigation of the wreck in September.

She also is charged with six counts of providing beer or light wine to someone under 21 years old and one of possessing such drinks in a dry county.

The charges carry total maximum penalties of 21 months in jail, $9,500 in fines and 30 days community service.
