Walker\u2019s novel, \u201cDietland,\u201d tells the story of Plum Kettle, a woman (like so many of us) who\u2019s battled with weight her whole life, and who finds a surprising and radical solution to the \u201cproblem\u201d of being a woman who doesn\u2019t fit in. Brown\u2019s work of science journalism, \u201cBody of Truth: How Science, History, and Culture Drive Our Obsession with Weight\u2014and What We Can Do About It,\u201d tackles many of the myths and assumptions we hold about weight, health and beauty, and suggests ways we can let go of at least some of our preoccupation with the number on the scale. Both writers want to change the conversation around weight. They recently chatted about what it will take to change that larger cultural conversation.\n\nHarriet Brown: One of the similarities between our books is the words we use to talk about weight. Or one word, anyway.\n\nSarai Walker: People are very uncomfortable with the word \u201cfat.\u201d To the general public it\u2019s jarring to hear that word used in a matter-of-fact way, when it\u2019s usually used as an insult.\n\nBrown: I use it about myself, and maybe about other people in a big-picture way. But I probably wouldn\u2019t use it to describe another person unless I knew how they felt about it.\n\nWalker: When I was doing my Ph.D., I registered for a couple of fat studies conferences. And it was a little uncomfortable for me at first. But the name \u201cfat studies\u201d forced me to say it. I went to these conferences and watched the way people used the word without any baggage. When I thought about it, all the alternatives are worse. Overweight, implying there\u2019s an ideal weight.\n\nBrown: Obese, which has become a diagnosis.\n\nWalker: What else is there? Chubby, zaftig \u2026\n\nBrown: Thick, curvy, heavy. They all seem vaguely insulting to me.\n\nWalker: They\u2019re all just trying not to say the word \u201cfat.\u201d Why not use it? The way I talk about it unsettles some people. But that\u2019s not a bad thing.\n\nBrown: It\u2019s part of changing the larger cultural conversation. Changing the rhetoric is one way to start to do that.\n\nWalker: Language is so powerful. People take notice.\n\nBrown: What do you hope people will notice when you use the word \u201cfat\u201d?\n\nWalker: The ultimate goal is to destigmatize the fat body. So to destigmatize that word is a first step. Ideally, to live in a world where different types of body shapes and sizes are all accepted. Where there\u2019s not one that\u2019s the norm and all the others are considered to deviate from that. I\u2019m trying to normalize the idea that fat isn\u2019t this horrible thing. It\u2019s just how some people are. Some people are fat, some people are thin. And what does fat even mean sometimes?\n\nBrown: Like the word \u201chealthy.\u201d What does that mean? These are comparative words. They\u2019re not absolute or objective.\n\nWalker: Something as small as a little three-letter word that unsettles people so much is dispiriting. It shows how far we have to go.\n\nBrown: I wonder if you\u2019ve gotten some of the same kinds of feedback I have. I get emails saying, \u201cYou\u2019re a horrible person who\u2019s going to be responsible for killing thousands of people because you\u2019re irresponsibly promoting this unhealthy lifestyle.\u201d I mean, hello \u2014 I\u2019m not promoting anything. I\u2019m telling some truths that actually should feel pretty damn liberating.\n\nWalker: NPR interviewed me and did a Facebook post about it, and a lot of the comments were like that. It seems to be the reaction from a large segment of the population. I think it\u2019s hilarious when someone leaves a comment on a review of my book saying, \u201cBut obesity is unhealthy!\u201d Do you think I haven\u2019t heard that rhetoric before? I wonder if this a different version of mansplaining.\n\nBrown: Thinsplaining. It\u2019s a thing.\n\nWalker: So how do you respond?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't feign concern for fat people's health to cover your disdain -- and no, \"fat\" doesn't have to be an insult", "title": "Back off, thinsplainers!
