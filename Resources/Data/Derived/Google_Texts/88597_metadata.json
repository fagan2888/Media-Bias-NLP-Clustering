For one, Evans doesn\u2019t have a track record of breaking news about the Lions, so we\u2019re not sure just how reliable his reporting is here. For another, Evans does have a track record of backtracking when his inflammatory statements are called into question.\n\nStill, this isn\u2019t the first time reports have surfaced that Suh\u2019s issues go beyond the well-publicized incidents like stomping on Evan Dietrich-Smith and kicking Matt Schaub in the groin. Which raises some tough questions about whether the Lions should want Suh to be a major part of their franchise going forward. As a No. 2 overall pick from the days before the current rookie salary structure, Suh has an enormous cap hit: He\u2019ll count $22.4 million against the Lions\u2019 salary cap this year. As a result, there\u2019s been talk that the Lions will try to lock Suh up to a long-term contract that provides some immediate cap relief. Suh has undeniable talent, but if he\u2019s a problem in the locker room, the Lions might be better off investing elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was reportedly a problem within Detroit's locker room last season, and getting Suh under control may be among the biggest tasks for new head coach Jim Caldwell.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/02/01/report-teammates-said-suh-was-a-problem-in-the-lions-locker-room/", "image": "https://nbcprofootballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/suh7.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was reportedly a problem within Detroit\u2019s locker room last season, and getting Suh under control may be among the biggest tasks for new head coach Jim Caldwell.
