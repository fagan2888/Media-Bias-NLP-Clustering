These special episodes usually consist of three short stories that are allowed to break the conventions of life in Springfield, with storylines that can include anything from aliens to zombies.\n\nDavid S. Cohen, one of the writers most dedicated to getting mathematics into \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d wrote the final part of \u201cTreehouse of Horror VI\u201d (1995), a segment titled \u201cHomer 3.\u201d This is, without doubt, the most intense and elegant integration of mathematics into \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d since the series began a quarter of a century ago.\n\nThe storyline begins quite innocently with Patty and Selma, Homer\u2019s sisters-in-law, paying a surprise visit to the Simpsons. Keen to avoid them, Homer hides behind a bookcase, where he encounters a mysterious portal that seems to lead into another universe. As the dulcet tones of Patty and Selma get louder, Homer hears that they want everyone to help clean and organize their collection of seashells. In desperation, he dives through the portal, leaving behind his two-dimensional Springfield environment and entering an incredible three-dimensional world. Homer is utterly perplexed by his new extra dimensionality and notices something shocking: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? I\u2019m so bulgy. My stomach sticks way out in front.\u201d\n\nInstead of being drawn in the classic flat-animation style of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d scenes set in this higher dimension have a sophisticated three-dimensional appearance. In fact, these scenes were generated using cutting-edge computer animation techniques, and the cost of generating them, even though they lasted less than five minutes, was far beyond the budget of an entire normal episode. Fortunately, a company named Pacific Data Images (PDI) volunteered its services, because it realized that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d would provide a global platform for showcasing its technology. Indeed, PDI signed a deal with DreamWorks later that year which led directly to the production of \u201cAntz\u201d and \u201cShrek,\u201d thereby kick-starting a revolution in film animation.\n\nWhen Homer approaches a signpost indicating the x, y, and z axes in his new three-dimensional universe, he alludes to the fact that he is standing within the most sophisticated animated scene ever to have appeared on television: \u201cMan, this place looks expensive. I feel like I\u2019m wasting a fortune just standing here. Well, better make the most of it.\u201dHomer makes another pertinent comment when he first encounters his new environment: \u201cThat\u2019s weird. It\u2019s like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.\u201d This is a nod to the fact that \u201cHomer 3\u201d is a tribute to a 1962 episode of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d titled\u201cLittle Girl Lost.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cLittle Girl Lost,\u201d the parents of a young girl named Tina become distraught when they enter her bedroom and cannot find her. Even more terrifying, they can still hear her voice echoing around them. Tina is invisible yet still audible. She is no longer in the room, but she seems just a breath away. Desperate for help, the parents call upon a family friend named Bill, who is a physicist. Having pinned down the location of a portal by chalking some coordinates on the bedroom wall, Bill declares that Tina has slipped into the fourth dimension. The parents struggle to understand the concept of a fourth dimension, because they (like all humans) have trained their brains to cope with our familiar three-dimensional world.\n\nAlthough Homer leaps from two to three dimensions, not from three to four dimensions, exactly the same sequence of events takes place in \u201cHomer 3.\u201d Marge cannot fathom what has happened to Homer, because she can hear him but not see him, and she also receives advice from a scientist, Professor John Nerdelbaum Frink, Jr.\n\nDespite his comically eccentric personality, it is important to not underestimate Professor\u2019s Frink\u2019s genius. Indeed, his scientific credentials are made clear in \u201cFrinkenstein,\u201d a story from \u201cTreehouse of Horror XIV\u201d (2003), when he receives a Nobel Prize from none other than Dudley R. Herschbach, who won his own Nobel Prize in 1986 and who voices his own character.*\n\nJust like the physicist in The Twilight Zone, Frink draws a chalk outline around the portal, watched by Ned Flanders, Chief Wiggum, Reverend Lovejoy, and Dr. Hibbert, who have all come to offer support. Frink then begins to explain the mystery: \u201cWell, it should be obvious to even the most dimwitted individual, who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology, that Homer Simpson has stumbled into . . . the third dimension.\u201d\n\nFrink\u2019s statement suggests that the characters in \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d are trapped in a two-dimensional world, and therefore they struggle to imagine the third dimension. The animated reality of Springfield is slightly more complicated than this, because we regularly see Homer and his family crossing behind and in front of each other, which ought to be impossible in a strictly two-dimensional universe. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d segment, let us assume that Frink is correct in implying the existence of only two dimensions in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d and let us see how he explains the concept of higher dimensions as he draws a diagram on the blackboard:\n\nProfessor Frink: Here is an ordinary square. Chief Wiggum: Whoa, whoa! Slow down, egghead! Professor Frink: But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe along the hypothetical z-axis . . . There. Everyone: [gasps] Professor Frink: This forms a three-dimensional object known as a cube, or a Frinkahedron in honor of its discoverer.\n\nFrink\u2019s explanation illustrates the relationship between two and three dimensions. In fact, his approach can be used to explain the relationship between all dimensions. If we start with zero dimensions, we have a zero-dimensional point. This point can be pulled in, say, the x direction to trace a path that forms a one-dimensional line. Next, the one-dimensional line can be pulled in the perpendicular y direction to form a two-dimensional square. This is where Professor Frink\u2019s explanation picks up, because the two-dimensional square can be pulled in the z direction, which is perpendicular to its face, to form a three-dimensional cube (or Frinkahedron).\n\nFinally, it is mathematically, if not physically, possible to go one step further by dragging the cube into another perpendicular direction (labeled the w dimension) to form a four-dimensional cube. Cubes in four (or more) dimensions are known as hypercubes.\n\nThe diagram of a four-dimensional hypercube is a mere sketch, the equivalent of a stick figure drawing being used to capture the essence of Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David. Nevertheless, the stick-figure hypercube suggests an emerging pattern that helps explain the geometry of shapes in four and even higher dimensions. Let us consider the number of endpoints or corners (known as vertices) that each object possesses as we move from dimension to dimension. The number of vertices follows a simple pattern: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, .. .. In other words, if d is the number of dimensions, then the number of vertices equals 2d. Hence, a ten-dimensional hypercube would have 210 or 1,024 vertices.\n\nDespite Professor Frink\u2019s deep understanding of higher dimensions, the bad news is that he is unable to save Homer, who is left to wander across his new universe. This leads to a bizarre series of events that ends with a visit to an erotic cake store. During this adventure, Homer encounters several fragments of mathematics which materialize in the three-dimensional landscape.\n\nFor example, soon after Homer travels through the portal, an apparently random series of numbers and letters floats in the far distance: 46 72 69 6E 6B 20 72 75 6C 65 73 21. The letters, in fact, are actually hexadecimal (or base 16) digits. Hexadecimal numbers are expressed using the usual digits 0 to 9, plus six others, namely A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, and F = 15. Together, each pair of hexadecimal digits represents a character in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which is a protocol for converting letters and punctuation into numbers, largely for the benefit of computers. According to the ASCII protocol, 46 represents \u201cF,\u201d 72 represents \u201cr,\u201d and so on. Translated, the entire sequence reads as a bold proclamation in praise of geeks: \u201cFrink rules!\u201d\n\nA few moments later, a second mathematical tidbit appears in the three-dimensional landscape, courtesy of writer David S. Cohen:\n\n1,78212 + 1,84112 = 1,92212\n\nThis is yet another false solution to Fermat\u2019s last theorem, just like the one created by Cohen for \u201cThe Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,\u201dwhich was discussed in chapter 3. The numbers have been carefully chosen so that the two sides of the equation are almost equal. If we match the sum of the first two squares to the sum of the third square, then the results are accurate for the first nine digits, as shown in bold:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Believe it or not, Homer can teach us a lot about advanced math.
