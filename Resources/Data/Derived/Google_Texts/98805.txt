Custer, SD

The famed Flintstones theme park in Custer is closing after Labor Day weekend and being transferred to a local hospitality company that hopes to keep operating the 50-year-old South Dakota vacation staple.



Owner Joe Speckels says the Flintstones Bedrock City Theme Park and Camping Resort was sold for $1.5 million to Custer Hospitality LCC, which operates several hotels in Custer.



Steve Olson, the director of operations for Custer Hospitality, tells the Rapid City Journal that the grounds will remain a campground and it's the company's intention to continue operating the theme park.



The new owners will have to negotiate with Warner Brothers, who hold the rights to the original Hanna-Barbera television series about the stone-age family.



The park is celebrating its 50th year in operation this year.
