Yes, you!\n\nWell, it\u2019s happened. Hillary Clinton has recently stated that she\u2019s against the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). This has occurred in spite of the fact that Clinton played a major role in negotiating the deal during her tenure as Secretary of State in the Obama administration.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on here?\n\nClinton is obviously trying to shore up support from the base of the Democratic Party, but it\u2019s sad that she\u2019s having to go this far to do it. According to CNN, Clinton has spoken up in favor of TPP on 45 occasions.\n\nThis is quite the volte-face. Frankly, the whole thing feels a bit slimy and opportunistic. Should that come as a surprise to anyone?\n\nThe Clintons love slimy.\n\nThe Clintons love opportunistic.\n\nThis is all quite Clintonesque.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has been consistently unimpressive; she and her team may be getting a bit paranoid now. Even if current Vice President Joe Biden declares his candidacy, Clinton is still likely to win the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders is running an admirable campaign, although it\u2019s highly unlikely he\u2019ll prevail either.\n\nAnd, while the race on the Republican side remains chaotic and underwhelming, there\u2019s reason to believe that Republicans will eventually rally around a reasonable candidate who actually has a chance of winning a general election.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Clinton\u2019s soporific, awkward campaign for a moment. The American public has been reminded of how stiff and inauthentic she is. It\u2019s not been comforting.\n\nDo Americans really want someone like her running the country?\n\nLeaving her awkwardness aside, the Clintons are a walking scandal machine. Essentially, this is not a couple that deserves more time in the White House.\n\nBesides, TPP is one of the few things that the Obama administration is actually getting right. The promotion of free trade is an essential component of U.S. global leadership.\n\nThe fact that this deal focuses on the Asia-Pacific makes it that much more important; Americans should want to be deeply connected to this vital region.\n\nThe TPP is by no means a done deal. And while no trade agreement is flawless, there is plenty in the TPP that merits approbation. To repeat, Clinton supported the deal too; she spoke out in favor of it on dozens of occasions.\n\nToo bad she\u2019s forgotten what genuine leadership looks like.\n\nTaylor Dibbert is a freelance writer and a Penn Kemble Fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).
