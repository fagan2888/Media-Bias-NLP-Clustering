Walmart just became the latest and largest retailer to announce that it will open its doors on Thanksgiving Day, even as a number of other chains are waiting until Black Friday to ring in the holiday shopping season.

Nearly a third of people who shopped sometime over the Thanksgiving weekend last year visited stores on Thursday, according to the National Retail Federation. Still, Black Friday remained the most popular day to shop, with almost two-thirds of people shopping then.
