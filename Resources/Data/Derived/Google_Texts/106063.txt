With the government shutdown finally in the rearview mirror, the Obama administration was finally ready to unveil www.healthcare.gov as a part of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. The website was designed to help simplify the process of signing up for Obamacare for the millions of Americans who might, potentially, be interested.

Except it doesn't work.

The website didn't load properly, long delays and timeouts meant that people were left facing the spinning wheel of death, and the site's calculator wasn't even working correctly.

Jon Stewart and the rest of The Daily Show folks didn't have any new episodes last week. So, on Monday, they finally took aim at the Obama administration and the rest of the Democrats for their inability to create a functioning website and screwing up after all of that build up.
