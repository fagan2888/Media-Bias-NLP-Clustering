Someone spent theirs defacing rock art dubbed \u201cPregnant Buffalo\u201d at Nine Mile Canyon in Utah.\n\nThe suspect carved the initials \u201cJMN\u201d and the date \u201c5/25/14\u201d into the dark patina next to the buffalo carving that is more than 1,000 years old. Worse still, the vandalism happened just minutes after archaeologist Jerry D. Spangler inspected the site for vandalism and saw none, reported Deseret News.\n\n\u201cEach act of vandalism is a selfish disregard of the aesthetic, spiritual and scientific values that constitute our collective past,\u201d Spangler, executive director of the Colorado Plateau Archaeological Alliance, told Deseret News. \u201cThese sites are non-renewable resources, and the damage done can never be completely repaired.\u201d\n\nSpangler also said the damage happened at about 12:20 p.m. on May 25. About 20 minutes after that two local property owners visited the site and saw two people scurrying away.\n\nAccording to The Salt Lake Tribune, federal officials from the Bureau of Land Management are in contact with two suspects but would not provide any more details.\n\nThe canyon where the damage occurred is actually 40 miles long, and has been dubbed the world\u2019s longest art gallery. Some 10,000 images are believed to date between 900 and 1250 A.D. in the canyon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How did you spend your Memorial Day weekend?
