The Ethics Committee will lose jurisdiction over Broun as soon as he leaves Congress. Panel extends Broun investigation

The House Ethics Committee will extend its investigation into retiring Rep. Paul Broun for alleged improper hiring of a consultant to advise him on his congressional work.

The ethics panel, which polices members of the House, is looking into a complaint that originated with the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent watchdog, that alleged Broun hired O’Donnell and Associates, a communications consultant, in apparent violation of the law and House rules. House lawmakers are allowed to hire contractors, but only for specific functions, such as staff training and “web services.” Broun paid O’Donnell and Associates more than $43,000 for communications services.

OCE also says that it has “substantial reason to believe” that Broun used government funds “to compensate an individual for services provided to one or more of his election campaigns, in violation of House rules and federal law.”

Broun denies any wrongdoing.

“As I mentioned before, I am fully cooperating with the House Ethics Committee and will continue to do so throughout their review,” Broun said in a statement. “I am confident that I acted in compliance with all House rules, and I look forward to a favorable resolution of this matter.”

Broun is not seeking reelection — he gave up his seat to run in the Republican Senate primary in Georgia. The Ethics Committee will lose jurisdiction over Broun as soon as he leaves Congress in mid-January.
