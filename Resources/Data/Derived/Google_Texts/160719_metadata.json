We are going to have to drive change in our medical plans,\u201d to control costs, he said.\n\nSome employers may stop offering benefits, meaning their employees may move to the public exchanges, he said, but those employees who aren't eligible for federal subsidies will face large out-of-pocket costs for potentially less value, Mr. Kirschbaum said.\n\nFor example, the Affordable Care Act's least expensive bronze plans still have deductibles that may reach $4,000 to $6,000, he said.\n\nSome employers provide high-deductible plans in that range but \u201cameliorate that deductible\u201d with a health savings account or a health reimbursement account, he said, but \u201cthat's not available on the public exchange.\u201d\n\nStill, the majority of employers \u201cexpect and want to continue to offer benefits to their employees \u2026 and not just because it's mandated or required, but because it's the right thing to do,\u201d said Rob Harkins, Willis' Boston-based practice leader for private exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt's a value proposition that you want to continue to do for your employees,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivate exchanges, though not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for tackling all costs, may offer opportunities to control annual increases by establishing a set dollar amount for employees to spend on benefits, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nAccording to research by Accenture P.L.C., about 6 million people currently shop for benefits through a private health insurance exchange. By 2018, Accenture predicts 40 million people will get health benefits through a private exchange.\n\nPrivate exchanges will help with the extensive IRS reporting requirements for full-time employee health coverage by providing a \u201cvehicle that could take all your benefits and put it into one neat package, and give you the employer the ability to (create) the report that you need to submit to the government,\u201d Mr. Harkins said.\n\nWhen deciding which exchange to use, employers should look at the structure of the platforms, which insurance providers the exchanges use, whether they allow fully insured or self-insured plans or both, and whether they have any limitations on plan design, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nIf a platform is built by an exchange provider, make sure it's in line with what you hope to offer employees. If not, look for a more customizable platform, he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Several factors are driving employers to private health insurance exchanges, one of the biggest being the 40% excise tax on high cost health care plans set to go into effect in 2018, said Jay Kirschbaum, St. Louis-based senior vice president and practice leader in Willis NorthIn...", "title": "Cadillac tax driving private health insurance exchange enrollment - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150629/NEWS03/150629832", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Several factors are driving employers to private health insurance exchanges, one of the biggest being the 40% excise tax on high cost health care plans set to go into effect in 2018, said Jay Kirschbaum, St. Louis-based senior vice president and practice leader in Willis NorthIn...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Cadillac tax driving private health insurance exchange enrollment - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "According to research by Accenture P.L.C., about 6 million people currently shop for benefits through a private health insurance exchange.\nIf a platform is built by an exchange provider, make sure it's in line with what you hope to offer employees.\nBy 2018, Accenture predicts 40 million people will get health benefits through a private exchange.\nPrivate exchanges, though not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for tackling all costs, may offer opportunities to control annual increases by establishing a set dollar amount for employees to spend on benefits, Mr. Harkins said.\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Several factors are driving employers to private health insurance exchanges, one of the biggest being the 40% excise tax on high cost health care plans set to go into effect in 2018, said Jay Kirschbaum, St. Louis-based senior vice president and practice leader in Willis North America Inc.'s national legal and research group."}
