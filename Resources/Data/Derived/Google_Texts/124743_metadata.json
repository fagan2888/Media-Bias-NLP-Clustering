The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nHealth care\n\nThe House of Representatives will vote on a measure this week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s legacy accomplishment.\n\nThe bill would strip key elements from the ACA, including the individual mandate to have insurance or pay a fine and the employer mandate to offer insurance. The measure also contains a provision to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a goal of conservative Republicans after secretly recorded videos surfaced last year that reportedly showed an employee of the organization discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nThis is the health care repeal bill that the Senate passed before adjourning for the holidays. If the bill clears the Republican-controlled House, it would be the first ACA repeal measure to reach Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nObama would certainly veto it. Still, Republicans view getting it through both chambers of Congress as a symbolic victory they can take on the campaign trail.\n\nSyrian refugees\n\nRepublicans intend to battle Obama\u2019s plan to bring 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States, fearing terrorists could enter the country through the resettlement program.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., placed a House-passed bill on the Senate calendar that would restrict the flow of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. It was written by Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has signaled that the Hudson-McCaul bill isn\u2019t going anywhere in the Senate.\n\nThis could present problems for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Several conservative Republicans expressed displeasure that the omnibus spending bill didn\u2019t include measures to stall or prevent Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nThe Islamic State\n\nWhile the debate over Syrian and Iraqi refugees rages, Ryan said he\u2019d like Congress to pass a war powers resolution against the Islamic State, commonly known as ISIS.\n\n\u201cIt would be a good symbol of American resolve to \u2026 go after ISIS, to thoroughly defeat and destroy ISIS,\u201d he said last month.\n\nDepending on how such a resolution is crafted, lawmakers could find a receptive White House. Obama said in a televised speech last month, \u201cIf Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL (another abbreviation for the Islamic State), it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists.\u201d\n\nGun control\n\nPresident Obama and congressional Democrats are arguing for stricter gun control measures.\n\nObama intends to use executive action to place new curbs on guns, reportedly including requiring more gun sellers to conduct background checks.\n\nLawmakers and Republican presidential candidates are already accusing Obama of executive overreach. \u201cSuch an expansion of governmental power would represent an abuse of one of the core individual rights protected by our Bill of Rights,\u201d Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., said Monday.\n\nCriminal justice overhaul\n\nObama wants it, the conservative Koch brothers want it, most of the 2016 presidential contenders want it, and the House and Senate have proposals to do it.\n\nRevamping the nation\u2019s criminal justice system may be one of the few areas where political parties and differing ideologies find common ground.\n\nSenate Democrats have concerns about a House overhaul bill that they contend would make it more difficult to sue corporations. The Senate criminal justice bill made it through the Judiciary Committee in October with provisions that limit mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders and give judges more leeway in some sentences. Four Republicans on the committee voted against it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only in overhauling the criminal justice system do Democrats and Republicans find common ground.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Only in overhauling the criminal justice system do Democrats and Republicans find common ground.", "title": "In Congress, expect renewed battles on guns, refugees and health care - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 702, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/778296_Congress-Budget-Battl_Rand.jpg", "height": 999}, "updated_time": "2016-01-05T20:31:34-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/05/in-congress-expect-renewed-battles-on-guns-refugees-and-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Only in overhauling the criminal justice system do Democrats and Republicans find common ground.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/778296_Congress-Budget-Battl_Rand.jpg", "title": "In Congress, expect renewed battles on guns, refugees and health care - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-01-05T20:05:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T20:31:34-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is the health care repeal bill that the Senate passed before adjourning for the holidays.\nSyrian refugeesRepublicans intend to battle Obama\u2019s plan to bring 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States, fearing terrorists could enter the country through the resettlement program.\nSenate Democrats have concerns about a House overhaul bill that they contend would make it more difficult to sue corporations.\nIf the bill clears the Republican-controlled House, it would be the first ACA repeal measure to reach Obama\u2019s desk.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., placed a House-passed bill on the Senate calendar that would restrict the flow of Syrian and Iraqi refugees."}
