One of the male victims, whom he would not identify, is in serious condition in UPMC Presbyterian in Oakland with a gunshot wound to the chest. Another man is in serious but stable condition there with a wound in the left thigh.\n\nA woman who might have been grazed in the leg was taken to Sewickley Hospital and later to Allegheny General Hospital. She was treated and released.\n\nA woman who rushed from the scene injured her knee and was treated in Sewickley Hospital and then released.\n\nMann said video from the bar showed the shooting and customers taking pictures with their cellphones. Police are trying to identify eight men and women believed to be from the Pittsburgh area who participated in the incident, some of whom might have fled in a white Acura.\n\n\u201cThey need to find us before we find them,\u201d Mann said.\n\nHe recommended those with information or pictures contact the police at 724-624-4263.\n\nBill Zlatos is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
