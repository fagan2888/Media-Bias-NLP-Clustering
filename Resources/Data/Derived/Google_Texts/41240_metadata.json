That statement is the latest in a slow march that seemingly began during a 30-minute speech at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013. Feet from President Barack Obama, Carson gave what many Republicans praised as a statement of conservative values, attacking political correctness and calling for health insurance savings accounts for everyone.\n\nHe echoed those statements Friday, and criticized members of the public who chose not to vote or made their decisions uninformed.\n\n\u201cMost people enter a voting booth and they look for a \u2018D,\u2019 an \u2018R,\u2019 or a name that\u2019s familiar,\u201d Carson said.\n\nSince his emergence on the national scene, Carson has become a regular contributor to Fox News and writes opinion columns for the Washington Times and American CurrentSee, a digital news magazine written for black conservatives. His support of Second Amendment rights and opposition to gay marriage, abortion and the Affordable Care Act have made him a darling of the Republican push to take back the White House, though Carson describes himself as without a political party.\n\nThe leader of a surgical team that successfully detached twins conjoined at the skull in 1987, Carson told a crowd of hundreds how his frugal mother raised him in a rough Detroit neighborhood to embrace knowledge and turned him from a \u201cdummy\u201d to a Yale-educated medical student at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cIf she were the secretary of the treasury, we wouldn\u2019t have this big of a deficit,\u201d Carson quipped.\n\nHe continued his criticism of the health care law, saying he believed in a savings account system that puts patients, rather than bureaucrats, in charge of their health care.\n\n\u201cThat makes every family their own insurance company, without a middleman,\u201d Carson said.\n\nRepublican voters seem to be taking note of Carson\u2019s rising visibility. In March, he finished third in a poll of attendees at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., losing only to runaway winner Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, both rumored to be strongly considering White House runs. He finished ahead of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who also has been floated as a potential candidate.\n\nLast month, Carson won a straw poll at a GOP dinner in Polk County in Iowa, where the first presidential caucus of 2016 will take place. Supporters nationwide say they\u2019ve raised $8 million for his run, though Carson has made no official announcement of his intentions.\n\nNo mention of a run for the presidency was made Friday, but Carson did criticize Obama for a statement the president made in 2009 that America is not a Christian nation, or a Jewish nation, or a Muslim nation. Carson has made that criticism multiple times in recent weeks, including at an event in Texas, and he continued to make the point in Spokane on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get to decide that,\u201d Carson said of Obama\u2019s statement, to lengthy applause and cheering. \u201cWe get to decide that.\u201d\n\nThe event, a fundraiser for the Life Services ministry, comes as the latest of Carson\u2019s six best-selling books sits near the top of the sales charts. \u201cOne Nation\u201d debuted atop the New York Times best-seller list and has spent 18 weeks in the top 10.\n\nAnnette Miller, executive director of Life Services, said the decision to book Carson as a speaker was not political, but reflected the shared values he has with the organization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really praying about having him come and speak for a couple years now,\u201d Miller said Friday.\n\nLife Services offers housing and health care options for young pregnant women who describe themselves as \u201cin crisis,\u201d Miller said. The nonprofit, which opposes abortion, has been in operation in Spokane for 23 years and performed more than 1,200 pregnancy tests last year, she said.\n\nThe 2,700-seat theater was nearly sold out. Attendees paid between $50 and $150.\n\nMiller said the message of Carson\u2019s latest book \u2013 that members of different political parties should listen to and be civil with one another \u2013 mirrors the message of the ministry.\n\n\u201cWe end up stifling thoughts, ideas and progress when we\u2019re in a gridlock,\u201d Miller said. \u201cParticularly from a political perspective, that\u2019s true in our country.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s speech was bookended by lengthy standing ovations. He encouraged attendees not to be swayed by what he called the \u201cpolitical correctness police\u201d and not to be satisfied with elected officials who are growing the national debt.\n\n\u201cWe need a nation that is not ashamed of who it is,\u201d Carson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rising conservative star Ben Carson did not apologize for avoiding political correctness at an event in Spokane on Friday night. \u201cIf you\u2019re white, and you disagree with a black progressive, you\u2019re a racist,\u201d said Carson, a staple of conservative talk shows who made waves this week announcing he was seriously considering a presidential run in 2016. \u201cIf you\u2019re black and you disagree, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Spokesman.com", "description": "Rising conservative star Ben Carson did not apologize for avoiding political correctness at an event in Spokane on Friday night. \u201cIf you\u2019re white, and you disagree with a black progressive, you\u2019re a racist,\u201d said Carson, a staple of conservative talk shows who made waves this week announcing he was seriously considering a presidential run in 2016. \u201cIf you\u2019re black and you disagree, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d", "title": "Carson enthuses Spokane audience", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/sep/27/carson-enthuses-spokane-audience/", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200.png", "updated_time": "2014-09-26T23:00:12.977051", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.spokesman.com/photos/2014/09/27/carson-27_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6", "site": "@SpokesmanReview", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "googlebot": "index, follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc863\"", "article_summary": "Rising conservative star Ben Carson did not apologize for avoiding political correctness at an event in Spokane on Friday night.\nSupporters nationwide say they\u2019ve raised $8 million for his run, though Carson has made no official announcement of his intentions.\n\u201cMost people enter a voting booth and they look for a \u2018D,\u2019 an \u2018R,\u2019 or a name that\u2019s familiar,\u201d Carson said.\nCarson has made that criticism multiple times in recent weeks, including at an event in Texas, and he continued to make the point in Spokane on Friday.\nFeet from President Barack Obama, Carson gave what many Republicans praised as a statement of conservative values, attacking political correctness and calling for health insurance savings accounts for everyone."}
