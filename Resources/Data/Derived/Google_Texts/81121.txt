A teenaged boy is dead after a crash in Greeley on Friday night, officials said.

Riley Young, 17, was identified by the Weld County Coroner as the teen who was killed when a vehicle who fled from police during a traffic stop crashed into his vehicle.

A Greeley police officer attempted to stop a silver Dodge Durango in the 800 block of 8th Avenue around 8:13 p.m. for a traffic violation, according to a Greeley Police Department news release.

The Durango fled from police and continued, speeding eastbound on 8th Street from 8th Avenue.

About four minutes later, police found a crash at the intersection of Highway 85 and 8th Street involving the Durango and a red Dodge Stratus that was northbound on Highway 85, police said.

Young, the driver of the Stratus, was pronounced dead on scene.

A passenger in the Stratus was extricated from the vehicle and taken to the North Colorado Medical Center in critical condition.

The driver of the Durango, who was ejected from the vehicle after it rolled multiple times, was also taken to North Colorado Medical Center.

According to police, witnesses said that the driver of the Durango was going faster than 80 miles per hour when the vehicle hit the Stratus.

Greeley police are continuing to investigate the crash.
