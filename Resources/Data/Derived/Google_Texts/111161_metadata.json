It isn't enough to eliminate the worst aspects of the current bureaucratic mess. We have to be able to answer affirmatively the question: is this the best we can do for our veterans? Anything less should be unacceptable. A slightly improved VA bureaucracy clearly fails that test. Second, the lessons we learn in thinking through a 21st century veterans' health system will teach us a lot about the characteristics of our future health system for all Americans. The same technologies that will improve veterans' health will help improve everyone's health. Third, replacing this obsolete bureaucracy with a new 21st century system will teach us a lot about how to replace every other bureaucracy. The VA could be the forerunner in a generation of profound transformation in government.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Gingrich, the smartphone \u2013 and the technological innovation it represents \u2013 should provide policymakers with tools to replace the functions the VA is supposed to provide and, as its own inspector general and various news reports have shown, has systemically failed to do so for some time. \u201cThe Smartphone shatters,\u201d Gingrich said, the hegemony of the VA\u2019s bureaucratic institutions \u201cbecause it shifts the location of power to the citizen\u201d \u2013 a vitally important part of the drive that must occur past reform to actual replacement of what does not work with that which does.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nPhone-based applications like Zocdoc, which allows users to find doctors in their area, read reviews about them, input insurance information, make an appointment and receive a confirmation email \u2013 all in about 24 hours or less \u2013 were cited by Gingrich as the kind of patient-centered replacements for failed programs the VA should be seeking to implement.\n\nThe numbers would tend to back up the idea. Founded in 2007, Zocdoc \u2013 which is diversified across about 40 different medical specialties \u2013 now serves 5 million patients a month (according to Gingrich, about as many as the VA) with only 400 employees, whereas the VA has 1,000 programmers alone.\n\nRegrettably, he suggested, policymakers in Washington lack the imagination necessary to start down the path to that kind of transformational change. And what they can\u2019t see they can\u2019t try to bring about. \u201cWashington is so absorbed in its own petty gossip, its own daily activities, its own definition of \u2018practical\u2019 and \u2018realistic\u2019 that it is very hard for Washington insiders to relax and let their imaginations develop the possibilities that are all around them,\u201d Gingrich said.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Newt Gingrich Explains How Smartphones Can Save the VA", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Newt Gingrich explains how smartphones can help fix the VA's problems for good.", "title": "VA Reform in the Palm of Your Hand", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/08/13/newt-gingrich-explains-how-smartphones-can-save-the-va", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/18/0d/cb45599f4bd99d1904f36440e12b/140804-smartphone-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Newt Gingrich Explains How Smartphones Can Save the VA", "description": "Newt Gingrich explains how smartphones can help fix the VA's problems for good.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Aug. 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,veterans,Department of Veterans Affairs,Gingrich, Newt,technology,smartphones,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Newt Gingrich explains how smartphones can help fix the VA's problems for good."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a63\"", "article_summary": "Second, the lessons we learn in thinking through a 21st century veterans' health system will teach us a lot about the characteristics of our future health system for all Americans.\nThe same technologies that will improve veterans' health will help improve everyone's health.\nThird, replacing this obsolete bureaucracy with a new 21st century system will teach us a lot about how to replace every other bureaucracy.\nRegrettably, he suggested, policymakers in Washington lack the imagination necessary to start down the path to that kind of transformational change.\nWe have to be able to answer affirmatively the question: is this the best we can do for our veterans?"}
