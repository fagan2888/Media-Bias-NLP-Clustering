(FORTUNE Global Forum/Flickr)\n\nTwo of the largest health insurance companies in the country recently left America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s leading trade group, citing concerns about direction. Now, AHIP is taking steps to persuade them to return to the fold.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans may have lost two prominent members in the past six months, but AHIP is ready to win them back, according to recent remarks by CEO Marilyn Tavenner.\n\nThe departure from AHIP of UnitedHealth Group (the largest U.S. health insurer) and Aetna (the third largest) is raising questions about the future of healthcare advocacy in Washington, DC, including whether competing associations may arise.\n\n\u201cAHIP has set forth a strategy and direction it feels best serves a membership profile and need that does not fit UnitedHealth Group and our diversified portfolio,\u201d UnitedHealth said last June. \u201cAHIP has to respond to its needs and interest of many members, which understandably resulted in a more limited and complicated advocacy focus.\u201d\n\nBut AHIP believes it can make its case to bring the former members back. Tavenner told Bloomberg Business last week that she\u2019s made it a priority in 2016 to welcome the two companies back into the fold.\n\n\u201cOne of our primary goals is to make sure we meet them at their space and have them rejoin AHIP,\u201d Tavenner said. \u201cFrom my perspective, the door is open and we want them back, and both of them know that.\u201d\n\nOne of the challenges that Tavenner and the rest of AHIP\u2019s leadership will face in this mission is the wildly diverging needs of the organization\u2019s members. Some insurers focus mainly on Medicare, while others concentrate on employee health insurance plans, long-term-care coverage, or life insurance. According to Bloomberg, these issues came to a head after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nReportedly, there may be room to change minds at Aetna and UnitedHealth. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini recently said the company might eventually rejoin AHIP if the conditions were more favorable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to win them back,\u201d Tavenner said in her comments to Bloomberg Business. \u201cPart of that is about strategy, part of that is about input. The board here recognizes that and wants to work with them as well.\u201d\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two major health insurance companies have recently quit America's Health Insurance Plans.
