These things are connected, to be sure. Both can be described as reflecting a paranoid and profoundly racist worldview that has long been endemic within American nationalism, the worldview that connects the Know-Nothings and slavery defenders of the 19th century to J. Edgar Hoover, Joe McCarthy, Strom Thurmond and the Tea Party.\n\nBut these two phenomena have separate histories and distinctive points of origin. If one side of the equation is \u201cRed Dawn\u201d paranoia, in which we imagine small-town cops prepared to do battle with heavily armed alien invaders at any moment, the other side is \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d paranoia, in which the enemy is right here at home, cleverly concealed as our neighbors and fellow citizens. As Glenn Greenwald, Heather Digby Parton and other commentators have explained this week (their pieces in particular are must-reads), the provision of military-style gear to local and state police at outlandish taxpayer expense began in earnest with the Reagan administration\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d a disastrous policy failure whose consequences are just as far-reaching as the equally inept \u201cwar on terror\u201d or the doomed invasion of Iraq.\n\nBut I\u2019m sorry, liberals \u2013 you don\u2019t get to blame the Republicans exclusively, or even primarily, for this one. It\u2019s been a truly bipartisan effort. Militarizing the cops goes along with the larger package of \u201csecurity\u201d issues that Democrats in Congress have largely embraced for fear of appearing soft on crime and terrorism, from NSA surveillance to the drone wars to the prison-building boom. There are some noteworthy exceptions, including Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who have spoken out forcefully on this complex of issues. But the loudest objections to the national-security state, and to the specific combination of ingredients we saw on the streets of Ferguson, have come from Rand Paul, which is exactly why Hillary Clinton fears him so much. She represents the Democratic Party\u2019s fundamental confusion about the nature and limits of state power, along with its innate tendency to abandon principle in search of perceived political advantage, which have led it to drink deeply from the cup of evil.\n\nReagan and his neocon brain trust \u2013 including a two-time secretary of defense and future Sith Lord named Dick Cheney \u2013 began the process that turned every small-town, donut-engorged police department and Podunk County band of sheriff\u2019s deputies into a heavily armed but poorly trained military unit. But succeeding administrations of both parties, Obama\u2019s very much included, have enthusiastically continued the buildup. From the beginning, there were powerful elements of xenophobia and racism at work. If the imagined threat that required the distribution of high-tech military gear to every cop in the nation was an invasion by Colombian drug lords or Mexican gangs, its actual effect was the imprisonment of African-American men, by the hundreds of thousands, for nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nBut for my money the strongest driving force was, well, money. This buildup began during the great privatization drive of the neoliberal economic order, and it created a new market and a massive new industry \u2014 which then was injected with Incredible Hulk juice in the fall of 2001. I don\u2019t actually believe that Cheney was the secret mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, but I sure hope he sent Osama bin Laden flowers the next morning, because those two guys were made for each other. There\u2019s no need to list here all the ways that 9/11 was like an answered prayer for \u201cthe most consequential vice president in American history\u201d (in Cheney\u2019s words) and his band of Leo Strauss disciples, who seized on the threat of terrorism as an all-purpose excuse for transforming America\u2019s global posture and the nature of executive power.\n\nOur topic today is the Department of Homeland Security, which became an unstoppable money-sucking juggernaut that no right-thinking legislator was allowed to question, still less oppose. (I still sometimes can\u2019t hear that name, apparently pilfered from a bad \u201970s science-fiction film, without snickering. But the joke has faded.) As Kim Murphy of the Los Angeles Times reported in 2011, federal and state governments spend around $75 billion a year on domestic security, and much of that money gets funneled to local jurisdictions in the form of high-tech military hardware they don\u2019t need and are not trained to use. One can only hope that Barack Obama and Eric Holder, who both appear genuinely anguished about what has happened in St. Louis County, have experienced some private anguish about the blowback of all that stupid, wasteful and destructive spending.\n\nIf many ordinary TV viewers and news consumers were startled by the heavily armed paramilitary force they saw on the streets of suburban St. Louis, they really shouldn\u2019t have been. As Greenwald notes, the ACLU published a critical report on the \u201cexcessive militarization of American policing\u201d just a few weeks ago, and a handful of mainstream reporters, including Murphy and the New York Times\u2019 Matt Apuzzo, have been paying attention all along. Apuzzo\u2019s crucial investigative report, published on June 8, painstakingly documents the military gear acquired by local police since 2006: at least 860 armored vehicles, more than 500 aircraft and close to 94,000 automatic weapons. Some of the anecdotes he uncovers would be humorous, if we weren\u2019t facing the less amusing consequences up close right now: an armored combat vehicle acquired by the police department in Neenah, Wisconsin, a city that has not had a murder for five years; a sheriff in rural western Maine requesting a mine-resistant vehicle to fend off the \u201cpreviously unimaginable threat from terrorist activities.\u201d It\u2019s true: More than anything else, al-Qaida covets those Down East taters.\n\nGreenwald has argued on several occasions that the ostensible focus on terrorism is a smokescreen, and that the primary purpose of this newly militarized policing is the suppression of internal dissent. That\u2019s a charge worth taking seriously, although I suspect the true historical picture is more complicated, and less driven by a clear-cut agenda. In considering the myriad sins of those who hold power over others, one should never discount the forces of inertia, greed and sheer stupidity. There is no question that big-city police departments have developed new resources and ever more sophisticated strategies aimed at managing and restricting public protest. But a lot of this stuff is just military waste product being handed out at random: There\u2019s not much internal dissent to be quelled in Neenah or Oxford County, Maine. If cops in those places ever try to use their high-tech military equipment the results are likely to be embarrassing, as with the notorious SWAT-team raids on unlicensed Orlando barbershops in 2010.\n\nBut Greenwald is absolutely right to observe that people who were shocked by what they saw in Ferguson evidently didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t care about the military-style police response to Occupy Wall Street in 2011, or to the protests he covered (for Salon) at the 2008 Republican convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Indeed, you can keep on pushing backward well before that, to the 2004 Republican convention in New York, the 2003 FTAA protests in Miami (a landmark event in law-enforcement theory and practice), the 1999 \u201cBattle in Seattle\u201d and so on. Those, of course, were all confrontations between the appointed defenders of law and order and largely white groups of radical or anarchist protesters who to some extent had marginalized themselves from mainstream society, or who could be spun as having done so. There was no evident dynamic of racism in play, and it was easy for onlookers to surrender to a narrative of false equivalency: Someone, somewhere broke a Starbucks window, so the tear gas and rubber bullets and pepper spray and mass arrests used against those who dared to express public dissent were understandable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two dark forces collided in Ferguson: The militarization of America's cops and a long tradition of racist violence", "title": "Ferguson\u2019s weaponized cops and America\u2019s long, ugly history of police violence", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Two dark forces collided in Ferguson: The militarization of America's cops and a long tradition of racist violence", "title": "Ferguson\u2019s weaponized cops and America\u2019s long, ugly history of police violence", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/16/fergusons_weaponized_cops_and_americas_long_ugly_history_of_police_violence/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/berkeley_police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two dark forces collided in Ferguson: The militarization of America's cops and a long tradition of racist violence", "title": "Ferguson\u2019s weaponized cops and America\u2019s long, ugly history of police violence", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/berkeley_police.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1960s, African American, African Americans, Editor's Picks, ferguson missouri, Police, police violence, Race, Racism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But I\u2019m sorry, liberals \u2013 you don\u2019t get to blame the Republicans exclusively, or even primarily, for this one.\n(I still sometimes can\u2019t hear that name, apparently pilfered from a bad \u201970s science-fiction film, without snickering.\nThat\u2019s a charge worth taking seriously, although I suspect the true historical picture is more complicated, and less driven by a clear-cut agenda.\nThere are some noteworthy exceptions, including Sen.
