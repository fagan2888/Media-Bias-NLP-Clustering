Steve King, Sen. Ted Cruz, The Right, News, Politics News\n\nHere\u2019s the good news, I guess. Even wingnuts are promising they\u2019ve given up on impeaching President Obama over his executive action deferring deportation. No less a zealot than Rep. Steve King is saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do the I-word, nobody wants to throw the nation into that kind of turmoil.\u201d You\u2019d think Obama\u2019s move would be a big fat softball pitch to King \u2013 maybe a cantaloupe? \u2013 demanding he take a swing at impeachment, but so far, it\u2019s not.\n\nStill, King and others are insisting they can defund government, or at least the agencies tasked with implementing Obama\u2019s move, and get away with it politically. That\u2019s even after the House GOP Appropriations chairman, Rep. Hal Rodgers, reminded them that the agency in question, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is entirely self-funded, via the fees it charges, and thus could continue to process requests. \u201cThe appropriations process cannot be used to \u2018defund\u2019 the agency,\u201d a committee statement said, according to Greg Sargent.\n\nBut conservatives continue to push the idea of passing riders to appropriations to defund certain agencies, or to fund only agencies they like, even though it\u2019s clear the congressional GOP leadership wants no part of a government shutdown showdown this time around. Sen. Ted Cruz, for instance, sneering that \u201cObama is not a monarch\u201d in Politico, says that if he vetoes a bill funding only certain parts of government, he will be blamed for the ensuing shutdown:\n\nPresident Obama will no doubt threaten a shutdown\u2014that seems to be the one card he repeatedly plays\u2014but Congress can authorize funding for agencies of government one at a time. If the President is unwilling to accept funding for, say, the Department of Homeland Security without his being able to unilaterally defy the law, he alone will be responsible for the consequences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The immigration agency the right wants to defund pays its own way via fees, but that won't stop the shutdown caucus", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s brainiac response: Why his immigration reaction is so wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The immigration agency the right wants to defund pays its own way via fees, but that won't stop the shutdown caucus", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s brainiac response: Why his immigration reaction is so wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/21/ted_cruzs_brainiac_response_why_his_immigration_reaction_is_so_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/ted_cruz_14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The immigration agency the right wants to defund pays its own way via fees, but that won't stop the shutdown caucus", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s brainiac response: Why his immigration reaction is so wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/ted_cruz_14.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Danny Vinik, Deferred deportation, executive action, GOP, Government shutdown, Greg Sargent, Josh Kraushaar, President Obama, Rep.
