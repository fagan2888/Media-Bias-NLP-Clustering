The AIDS Memorial Quilt, a blanket made up of thousands of panels that have been added since the 1980s, was put on display on Governors Island Monday, marking the first time the quilt has been back in New York City in more than a decade, according to organizers.

Two thousand panels of the quilt with around 5,000 names of AIDS victims were unfolded and and displayed on the island until Tuesday afternoon.

Now made up of more than 48,000 panels, the quilt was last displayed in its entirety in 1996 in Washington D.C, according to the NAMES Project Foundation. Portions of the quilt are regularly shown around the country.

The quilt is designed to be a “powerful visual reminder of the AIDS pandemic,” according to the NAMES Project. Many of the panels are sewn by family and friends to commemorate the lives of people who have died of AIDS.
