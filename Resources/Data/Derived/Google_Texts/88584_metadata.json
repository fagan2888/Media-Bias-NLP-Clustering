But no one ever called Congress a laboratory of democracy. Meanwhile, four states that strongly supported Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 passed minimum wage hikes in ballot referenda. Voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., legalized marijuana. The three biggest mayoral elections, in Oakland, California, San Jose, California, and the District of Columbia, were (not surprisingly) won by liberals.\n\nIs this the famed Metropolitan Revolution in action, the progressive fruits of a gradual devolution of authority toward states and cities?\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath. Despite bright spots of municipal innovation, like San Francisco\u2019s minimum wage hike, cities remain politically weak and subject to rurally dominated state legislatures.\n\nWhere the transfer of power to local authority has taken place, it\u2019s voters, rather than their representatives, who are making decisions on taxes, infrastructure and policy. It\u2019s a shift that, while democratic, will have mixed results for urban planning.\n\n* * *\n\nAt the state level, a few successful left-wing ballot initiatives ought not obscure the fact that Democrats control only eight of the 50 statehouses. The GOP is now in full control of 29 state legislatures, the largest number since 1928. Thirty-two of the nation\u2019s governors are Republicans.\n\nGenerally, that\u2019s bad news for cities\u2019 social programs, pension plans and non-automobile transportation. In Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio, anti-rail Republicans were easily reelected. In Maryland, Gov.-elect Larry Hogan is opposed to an expansion of the Washington, D.C., Metro in Montgomery County, and thinks the funds would be better spent on repairing roads and highways.\n\nIn New York, the Democrats\u2019 inability to take the statehouse will pose problems for Bill de Blasio. Though the Brooklynite mayor has become an international spokesman for progressive causes in cities, several items on his agenda \u2014 such as regaining control over New York City\u2019s rent regulations \u2014 will now be out of reach until 2016 at the earliest.\n\nStill, in some ways, cities and counties are taking control of their own policies with an eye toward improving urban life.\n\nThese initiatives aren\u2019t born of federal grants, or at the state capital, but on the ballot. Election Day is changing: It is no longer merely a choosing of candidates but a nationwide referendum on infrastructure.\n\nSeattle and San Francisco voted to increase funding for transit and alternative transportation; Wisconsin and Maryland opted to secure existing transit funding. Clayton County, in metro Atlanta, will raise the sales tax by a full percentage point to generate money for a bus system. Half of the $45 million the measure is expected to raise will fund regular bus service; the other half will be used for a pending, more expensive project, like commuter rail or BRT.\n\nThese victories mark the intersection of two trends, the first in politics and the second in transportation finance. The first statewide ballot initiative wasn\u2019t held until 1904, in Oregon, and after a surge in the 1920s, the method fell away in the postwar era to a low point in 1968. But it has since experienced \u201ca tremendous upsurge in usage,\u201d and it\u2019s now common for voters to find a handful of complex subjects posed as yes-or-no questions on the back of their ballots.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a few high-profile progressive victories, local politics isn't in much better shape than Washington", "author": "Henry Grabar", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite a few high-profile progressive victories, local politics isn't in much better shape than Washington", "title": "Why the midterm disaster is also terrible news for America\u2019s cities", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/why_the_midterm_disaster_is_also_terrible_news_for_americas_cities/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/boehner_mcconnell_cities.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite a few high-profile progressive victories, local politics isn't in much better shape than Washington", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/boehner_mcconnell_cities.jpg", "title": "Why the midterm disaster is also terrible news for America\u2019s cities", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why the midterm disaster is also terrible news for America\u2019s cities", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Dream City, local politics, New York City, urban planning", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf053\"", "article_summary": "Is this the famed Metropolitan Revolution in action, the progressive fruits of a gradual devolution of authority toward states and cities?\nStill, in some ways, cities and counties are taking control of their own policies with an eye toward improving urban life.\nDespite bright spots of municipal innovation, like San Francisco\u2019s minimum wage hike, cities remain politically weak and subject to rurally dominated state legislatures.\nGenerally, that\u2019s bad news for cities\u2019 social programs, pension plans and non-automobile transportation.\nMeanwhile, four states that strongly supported Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 passed minimum wage hikes in ballot referenda."}
