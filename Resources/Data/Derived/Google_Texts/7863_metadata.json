New, unwrapped toys can be dropped off at any of the program\u2019s locations, including Post-Crescent Media\u2019s office at 306 W. Washington St. in downtown Appleton. The campaign also is looking for volunteers.\n\nThumbs Down: To the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nReleased late last Friday \u2014 a time when news gets released that the releaser doesn\u2019t really want publicized \u2014 the report said what other reports and committees have said about this tragedy: There wasn\u2019t an order to \u201cstand down\u201d and there were no intelligence failures, nor was there a cover-up conspiracy.\n\n\u201cBased on the testimony and the documents we reviewed, we concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their actions saved lives,\u201d the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said.\n\nIt was the seventh investigation of Benghazi, all of which came up with many of the same conclusions. Unfortunately, there\u2019s another investigation coming, by a House Select Committee that House Speaker John Boehner appointed in May.\n\nThumbs Down: To the growing number of near-collisions of commercial planes on airport runways nationwide.\n\nA USA Today study of federal data showed that the close calls grew two-thirds between 2003 and 2013. It might be expected that the number of flights overall has grown in that time frame but it hasn\u2019t. Instead, more airlines are using larger airports as hubs, leading to more traffic at those airports.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration attributes the growing number of incidents to a better system for reporting the incidents. But some aviation experts say it wouldn\u2019t account for the increase entirely. And Congress and the Department of Transportation are asking questions of the FAA\u2019s Runway Safety Group, which is responsible for overseeing runway traffic.\n\nWe hope the added attention will curb a bad trend.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1xVRmQP", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Thumbs Up to Appleton Christmas Parade, Toys for Tots Facebook campaign.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Thumbs Up to Appleton Christmas Parade, Toys for Tots Facebook campaign.", "title": "Editorial: Thumbs Up and Down", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/11/29/editorial-thumbs/19612915/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thumbs Up to Appleton Christmas Parade, Toys for Tots Facebook campaign.", "creator": "@postcrescent", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/86265f321f1324d553c67b51ffc625af25e1390a/c=790-0-4335-3545&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/11/28/B9315295887Z.1_20141128105752_000+G2598Q9D2.1-0.jpg", "title": "Editorial: Thumbs Up and Down", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Thumbs Up to Appleton Christmas Parade, Toys for Tots Facebook campaign.\nThumbs Down: To the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.\nThumbs Up: To a Menasha man who\u2019s trying to put a smile of kids\u2019 faces at Christmas.\nThumbs Down: To the growing number of near-collisions of commercial planes on airport runways nationwide.\n(Photo: Joshua Bessex/Post-Crescent Media)Buy PhotoThumbs Up: To everyone who had a hand in Tuesday\u2019s Downtown Appleton Christmas Parade."}
