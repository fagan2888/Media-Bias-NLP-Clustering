Indeed, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reiterates the fundamental principle that every person has the right \u201cto seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u201d Each and every day, brave journalists make extraordinary risks to bring us stories we otherwise would not hear \u2013 exposing corruption, asking tough questions, or bearing witness to the dignity of innocent men, women and children suffering the horrors of war. In this service to humanity, hundreds of journalists have been killed in the past decade alone, while countless more have been harassed, threatened, imprisoned, and tortured. In the overwhelming majority of these cases, the perpetrators of these crimes against journalists go unpunished,\u201d Obama said in the statement.\n\n\u201cAll governments must protect the ability of journalists to write and speak freely. On this first-ever International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, the United States commends the priceless contributions by journalists to the freedom and security of us all, shining light into the darkness and giving voice to the voiceless. We honor the sacrifices so many journalists have made in their quest for the truth, and demand accountability for those who have committed crimes against journalists.\u201d\n\nBut Obama, who famously promised to have \u201cthe most open and transparent administration in history\u201d when he was inaugurated as president in 2009, has only paid lip service to these ideas. He publicly champions them, while his actions only impede the efforts of the American press.\n\nThe Obama administration has conducted a record number of leak investigations of federal employees and contractors accused of leaking classified information to journalists, Bloomberg reported. It has also prosecuted more whistle-blowers under espionage laws than all previous administrations combined.\n\nObama frequently holds only off-the-records meetings, as does his staff. The Associated Press reported earlier this year that each year of Obama\u2019s presidency access to government data and documents have gotten worse. His administration has \u201ccensored government files or outright denied access to them under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act\u201d a record 81,752 times.\n\nReporters Without Borders dropped the U.S. down to a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating in its 2014 annual press freedom report, ranking it below Canada and all the Scandinavian countries.\n\nExamples of altered and censored White House pool reports, the method by which reporters rely on for access to the president, have also aggravated these charges.\n\nThe only good thing about Obama\u2019s extreme actions is that it is inadvertently brought attention to government transparency issues, John Wonderlich, policy director of the transparency group the Sunlight Foundation, told Bloomberg in September.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration may have raised the profile of transparency, but sometimes by making it worse,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of taking real action, it has focused efforts on prosecuting whistle-blowers, embracing more money in our political system and permitting political review of requests under the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) President Barack Obama continued to champion the rights of a free press and the need for transparency Sunday, despite his own actions against those goals.
