So let us help.\n\nDo you speak Spinglish? Well, if you speak English, chances are you\u2019ve been using Spinglish for a long time, most likely without even knowing it. For example, have you ever overslept and missed a meeting and blamed your absence on a \u201cscheduling error\u201d? Tried to weasel out of a parking ticket because of an alleged \u201cmeter malfunction\u201d? Explained that a bounced check was merely the result of an \u201cunanticipated negative cash-balance accounting issue\u201d?\n\nOr, when you noticed that your hospital had billed you for a \u201cdisposable mucus recovery system,\u201d did you figure out they were charging you 15 bucks for a box of Kleenex? Are you aware that whenever companies say \u201cfor your convenience,\u201d they actually mean \u201cfor our convenience\u201d?\n\nIf you answered yes to even one of these questions, you\u2019re already on the road to mastering the devious vocabulary of verbal distortion, and with our indispensable bilingual dictionary as your guide, odds are you\u2019ll soon be earning your B.S. in B.S.\u2014or, better still, a coveted Spin Doctorate. And even if you\u2019re a rank beginner, don\u2019t despair: Spinglish: The Definitive Dictionary of Deceptive Language is virtually guaranteed to teach you how to succeed in business, politics\u2014and everything else\u2014without really lying!\n\nBut what precisely is Spinglish? Well, in spite of its polyglot-sounding name, it isn\u2019t some foreign language. It\u2019s just our native tongue, transformed into a sophisticated method of judicious miscommunication through the use of careful word choice and the artful rephrasing and reframing of familiar terms. To put it another way (which, of course, is what Spinglish is designed to do), it all comes down to making me sound better, or you sound worse, or both. I\u2019m a freedom fighter, you\u2019re a terrorist. I want to enhance revenues, you want to raise taxes. My product is artisanal, all-natural, and organic; yours is mass-produced, synthetic, and contains artificial additives.\n\nNeedless to say, any language can be used to convey or conceal all sorts of meanings and messages, but English is unique in its capacity for creative misdirection, thanks to a couple of remarkable linguistic resources. First, with over a million words, it has the largest vocabulary of any language in the world, and with more than a billion speakers, it is the most widely spoken.\n\nAnd second, English basically consists of two completely separate and complementary sub-languages: Latin, from the Romans who conquered England and bequeathed us mostly polysyllabic (and often nicely evasive) formulations like \u201cexterminate\u201d and \u201ccircumlocution,\u201d and the Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Nordic, and Germanic vernaculars of our barbarian ancestors on the wrong end of the catapult who gave us short, simple, cut-to-the-chase words like \u201ckill\u201d and \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nOf course, using language to control a narrative is nothing new. Long before George Orwell wrote 1984, our nation coined Orwellian terms like \u201cManifest Destiny\u201d to rationalize a transcontinental land grab, \u201cIndian reservations\u201d to refer to concentration camps for Native Americans, and \u201cBenevolent Assimilation\u201d to describe the violent seizure of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, to name just a few.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to distinguish between slang and jargon, which are spontaneously generated, and loaded language and weasel words, which are premeditated. Saying that a bunch of people who were fired were \u201cgiven the boot\u201d or that someone who died \u201ckicked the bucket\u201d is just colorful; describing mass layoffs with euphemisms like \u201cdownsizing\u201d or \u201crightsizing,\u201d or a death due to malpractice as a \u201cnegative patient care outcome,\u201d is deliberately deceptive.\n\nThe fact is, not only has Spinglish been around for a long time, it\u2019s everywhere: on Wall Street and Madison Avenue, inside the Beltway, in Silicon Valley and Hollywood, in the fields of Law, Medicine, the Arts\u2014you name it, and if you can name it, someone can rename it to make it sound a whole lot better and promote it with a flurry of press releases flogged by a host of professional Spinocchios and hundreds of highly paid liars with fireproof pants ready to pull the genuine imitation faux wool over your eyes.\n\nBut now, thanks to this shoot-from-the-lip glossary of time-tested, tried- and-untrue terminology, you, too, can have just the right self-serving phrase at the tip of your forked tongue, and no matter how embarrassing the situation or awkward the silence, you\u2019ll never be at a loss for misleading words again!\n\nSo apply some Sock-Puppet News-Job nose-growth-control cream, shown to be of significant value in limiting topical, prevarication-related nasal lengthening (your results may vary), put on that pair of Poppy-Khaki brand combustion-resistant trousers (certified 100% effective when worn with approved carbon-fiber undergarments), and issue a statement, run an ad, or just offer a simple explanation that tells it like it isn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t, and it couldn\u2019t ever have been.\n\nIncluded here are the intro and all the entries under G.\n\nG\n\ngallerist. Art dealer.\n\ngame improvement clubs. Golf equipment manufacturers\u2019 term or a set of \u201ceasy-to-hit\u201d hybrid irons and slice-proof woods designed for hopeless hackers. Such clubs tend to have extra-large heads or faces, and to be shorter than normal, design features that lessen the odds that striking the ball improperly will result in a bad shot.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Gambling, as described by spokespeople for the \u201cgaming\u201d industry. Although \u201cproblem gambling\u201d is widely recognized as a psychological disorder, there is apparently no \u201cproblem gaming.\u201d\n\n\n\ngarden of remembrance. A cemetery.\n\ngaseous intestinal by-product. Fart.\n\ngate rape. See: enhanced screening procedures.\n\ngender reassignment. Sex change surgery.\n\ngenerational ferment. A term used by a senior executive at the William Morris Agency in Hollywood to account for the abrupt departure of five important young agents who later explained their mass defection as simply a matter of wanting more money than the notoriously stingy firm was willing to pay.\n\ngentlemen\u2019s club.

Firing people.\n\nGlobal Climate Science Communications Action Plan. A strategy devised by the American Petroleum Institute, and largely funded by ExxonMobil, designed to raise \u201cserious questions about the scientific underpinnings\u201d behind proposed climate change legislation.\n\nGlobal War on Terror. See: War on Terror.\n\ngoing to Switzerland. A term for assisted suicide, based on the fact that legally sanctioned euthanasia is more readily available in that country than in most others.\n\ngood-natured grunts. Booing and hissing when you or your colleagues or associates are the ones being booed and hissed. The term was coined in 1989 by David Beckwith while he was Vice President Dan Quayle\u2019s press secretary to describe the reaction his boss received from cadets at the United States Military Academy when the subject of Quayle\u2019s service in the Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War came up.\n\n\n\ngood-neighbor policy. Invading a nearby country. For example, George Will wrote that the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 was \u201ca good- neighbor policy. America\u2019s role in Panama\u2014 in effect, administering a recount of last May\u2019s election\u2014 is an act of hemispheric hygiene.\u201d Example: \u201c\u00a1Caramba!\u201d shouted the National Guard major as American paratroopers began landing in Panama City. \u201cTwenty thousand of our good neighbors have decided to pay us an unexpected visit!\u201d\n\n\n\ngoodwill. A term on a financial balance sheet indicating the amount of overpayment for a corporate acquisition.\n\n\n\ngoodwill payments. Compensation payments. The term was used by the Peverel Group to describe the money it paid back to customers, most of them elderly, who had been hoodwinked by one of the company\u2019s subsidiaries into paying grossly inflated prices for burglar alarm upgrades. As The Guardian points out, calling the payments \u201ccompensation\u201d would have been \u201can admission of guilt.\u201d\n\ngovernment option. What Fox News Channel Vice President Bill Sammons, in 2009, instructed his on-air staff to call the \u201cpublic option\u201d originally included in President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which was then under debate in Congress. Sammons issued his directive the day after Republican strategist Frank Luntz, appearing on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News program, scolded Hannity for using the term \u201cpublic option\u201d to describe the government-run (but not government-funded) health insurance agency that would have been set up by President Obama\u2019s legislation, as originally written. \u201cIf you call it a \u2018public option,\u2019 the American people are split,\u201d Luntz explained, but \u201cif you call it the \u2018government option,\u2019 the public is overwhelmingly against it.\u201d In June 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, but only after the Senate had stripped the public option from the bill.\n\n\n\ngovernment relations professional. Lobbyist. According to The Hill newspaper, the American League of Lobbyists is considering rebranding itself \u201cThe Association of Government Relations Professionals\u201d as part of its mission to \u201cenhance the standing and reputation\u201d of its members. [See also: legislative leadership advocate.]\n\ngreat and good friend. The classic journalistic euphemism for \u201cmistress,\u201d coined by Time magazine to describe the relationship between Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst.\n\n\u201cgreat nightlife.\u201d A real-estate advertising term that, according to agent Kate Cocuzzo, means \u201cyou live above a bar.\u201d \u201cStock up on earplugs,\u201d she suggests. \u201cOr Scotch.\u201d\n\ngreat restraint.

In 2009, Eliot Spitzer, the governor of New York, was discovered to be \u201cClient 9\u201d of a high- priced call girl named Ashley Dupr\u00e9, a revelation that quickly led to his resignation from office. Shortly thereafter, he appeared on the Today show and, when host Matt Lauer quizzed him about his habit of consorting with prostitutes, he replied, \u201cI have tried to address these gremlins and confront them.\u201d To help him in his quest, the New York Post published side-by-side photos of a creature from the hit 1984 horror move Gremlins and a hooker so that Spitzer could study the difference between the two.\n\nground-mounted confirmatory route markers. A term for \u201croad signs\u201d favored by Scott L. Pickard, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Public Works.\n\ngroup home. Orphanage. [See also: congregate care facility.]\n\ngroup therapy. A Vietnam-era military term for the indiscriminate firing by more than one soldier of M-16 rifles set on full automatic for the purpose of quickly clearing an area of enemy soldiers.\n\n\n\nGuardian Deity of the Planet. One of the approximately 1,200 official titles carried by Kim Jong-Il, Supreme Leader of North Korea, until his death in December 2011. According to North Korea\u2019s Central Broadcasting Station, \u201c160 prominent leaders from across the world\u201d used this and some of Kim\u2019s other 1,199 titles \u201cto honor our Great General.\u201d [See also: Lodestar of the 21st Century.]\n\nvia Amazon \u2018Spinglish: The Definitive Dictionary of Deliberately Deceptive Language\u2019 by Henry Beard (Author), Christopher Cerf. 368 p.
