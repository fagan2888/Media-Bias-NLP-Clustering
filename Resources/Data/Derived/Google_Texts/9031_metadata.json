Raymond Ward, R-Bountiful, in an open GOP House caucus, that a woman Hughes had met with in March, Carol Frisby of Taylorsville, had died on Monday from colon cancer.\n\nHughes looked stunned. He took from Ward a note written to Hughes by Frisby on Saturday \u2013 when Ward and his wife visited Frisby and her husband, Brent, at the hospital.\n\nAnd put it in his suit pocket.\n\nWhen UtahPolicy asked Hughes after the caucus meeting if the state\u2019s refusal up to now to extend Medicaid benefits to low-income people was killing Utahns, Hughes seemed lost for words, upset.\n\nThen said he had to go to his office and left without answering the question.\n\nWhen Ward passed him the note, saying Hughes may remember Frisby from a meeting he had with her and five other health-challenged Utahns awaiting Medicaid expansion, Hughes did recall Frisby.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sweet lady,\u201d said Hughes.\n\nWard, a family doctor, told UtahPolicy after the caucus that Frisby is a perfect example of how Utah waiting to adopt any Medicaid expansion under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is killing people.\n\n\u201cWe should have (expanded Medicaid) two years ago,\u201d said Ward, who knows Frisby\u2019s medical history.\n\n\u201cThere are real people out there; (not having the expansion) is harming real people,\u201d said Ward.\n\n\u201cI know half a dozen people\u201d who may well have qualified for Medicaid expansion \u201cwho have died\u201d because they couldn\u2019t afford proper medical care, he added.\n\nWard had previously read the note to Hughes and said after caucus it was a bit difficult to understand because she was so ill. \u201cBasically, she thanked the speaker for meeting with her (earlier this year) and asked that something is done\u201d so others like her don\u2019t suffer, said Ward.\n\nWard said that Carol Frisby had colon symptoms three or four years ago, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.\n\nBut, as reported in this Deseret News story of several months ago, the Frisbys were living on $800 a month.\n\nCarol was at the time covered by the state\u2019s Primary Care Network. But PCN doesn\u2019t cover colonoscopies \u2013 where a doctor using a probe looks inside a patient\u2019s colon.\n\nIf cancerous polyps are found, they are clipped off. And the cancer doesn\u2019t spread.\n\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t afford the $2,000 test,\u201d said Ward.\n\nFrisby\u2019s cancer then spread throughout her body over several years.\n\nFinancially destitute, finally the Frisbys qualified for Medicaid, and Ward said more than $200,000 was spent on Carol trying to fight back her advanced cancer.\n\nBut treatments failed, and Carol Frisby died in hospice care Monday, said Ward.\n\nA $2,000 test could have saved a life and more than $200,000 in later medical care, said Ward \u2013 for colon cancer, if caught early, has a high rate of successful treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are real people out there\u201d now not covered by Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \u201cAnd real bad things\u201d are happening to them, said Ward, one of the few House Republicans who voted for GOP Gov. Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion plan.\n\nAt one point during the 2015 general session, the Senate passed Healthy Utah. But House Republicans refused to act on it and came up with their own Utah Cares alternative.\n\nHealthy Utah would have provided subsidized private health insurance for the estimated 66,000 people who fall into \u201cthe coverage gap\u201d \u2013 those who make 100 percent of the poverty income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\nCarol Frisby was one of those people, said Ward.\n\nUtah Cares would cover low-income up to 100 percent, and those above 100 percent to 138 percent would get PCN coverage \u2013 which is what the Frisbys had, but because PCN doesn\u2019t cover colonoscopies, she didn\u2019t get the test.\n\nHughes, R-Draper, and House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, told the caucus that talks/study by the \u201cGang of Six\u201d \u2013 six state GOP leaders looking for a Medicaid expansion solution \u2013 are going well.\n\nNo longer is the debate \u2013 as it was in the 2015 Legislature \u2013 between Healthy Utah and Utah Cares.\n\nRather, said Hughes, talks have moved forward, and a new solution is being sought \u2013 neither one being one of the former alternatives.\n\nA self-imposed July 31 deadline for the Six to come up with a recommendation will be missed.\n\nBut Dunnigan said he\u2019s still hopeful a special session can be called in the fall to adopt a Medicaid expansion plan.\n\nPerhaps the Legislature will act first, and then leaders will seek federal government waivers to implement it; perhaps the Six will go to the feds before the special session, said Dunnigan.\n\nThat is all still being discussed.\n\nBut for some, said Ward, it is too late.\n\nCarol Frisby is one.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If it hadn\u2019t already, Medicaid expansion got personal for Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes on Wednesday.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/6344-medicaid-expansion-debate-hits-home-for-hughes", "type": "article", "image": "http://utahpolicy.com/images/articles/20150715_Medicaid_Frisby.JPG", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Debate Hits Home for Hughes"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When Ward passed him the note, saying Hughes may remember Frisby from a meeting he had with her and five other health-challenged Utahns awaiting Medicaid expansion, Hughes did recall Frisby.\nIf it hadn\u2019t already, Medicaid expansion got personal for Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes on Wednesday.\nBut Dunnigan said he\u2019s still hopeful a special session can be called in the fall to adopt a Medicaid expansion plan.\nGary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion plan.\n\u201cThere are real people out there\u201d now not covered by Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion."}
