Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Michael C. Burgess , M.D. (R-TX), Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, issued the following statement on the federal ruling in House v. Burwell, the House of Representatives' lawsuit on Obamacare.

" The U.S. District Court's ruling is one step closer to victory for the American people and for the rule of law. The federal judge's decision confirms that the Obama Administration has been unlawfully paying insurers without the required authorization from Congress --violating the law and seizing a role clearly reserved for Congress in Article I of the Constitution .

"Billions of taxpayer dollars were dished out illegally to keep insurers from fleeing Obamacare, yet premiums continue to skyrocket and insurers continue to withdraw from markets across the country. Our founding fathers created a system of checks and balances to guard against the threat of a tyrannical government--the Obama Administration must stop operating like a monarchy and respect the role of Congress . This is not only another great victory for the United States House Committee on Rules which crafted the resolution, but also for the constitutional balance of power."
