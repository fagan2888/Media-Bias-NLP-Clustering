That\u2019s why candidates for governor offer mostly general ideas about how to deal with Louisiana\u2019s daunting fiscal challenges. They\u2019re afraid if they offer too much honesty and/or too many specifics it will cost them the election. They\u2019re right.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the candidates. They do what they do because voters demand it. To paraphrase Jack Nicholson\u2019s famous rant, the vast majority of voters can\u2019t handle the truth. Or, as French philosopher Joseph de Maistre observed, \u201cIn a democracy people get the leaders they deserve.\u201d\n\nIf you want hard truths about Louisiana\u2019s future, as well as some specific proposals for dealing with our state\u2019s challenges, check out an outfit called Blueprint Louisiana, a nonpartisan group of community and business leaders that was founded in 2006.\n\nI\u2019m not necessarily endorsing all of Blueprint\u2019s ideas, but I do think the organization\u2019s observations and suggestions are a good place to start an honest conversation about Louisiana\u2019s future.\n\nSome of Blueprint\u2019s earlier proposals were adopted by Gov. Bobby Jindal and state lawmakers after the group issued its first report in 2007. Others were watered down (\u201cethics reform,\u201d e.g.), while still others were ignored. Blueprint followed up in 2011, but by then Jindal was already looking to get out of Louisiana.\n\nBlueprint is back this year with recommendations in four major problem areas: transportation (particularly the role that infrastructure plays in economic growth), higher education, health care financing, and Louisiana\u2019s structural deficit.\n\nBlueprint\u2019s recommendations go farther into the policy weeds than any of the candidates, and they don\u2019t pull punches. For example, in the area of health care financing, Blueprint flat-out says Louisiana needs to expand Medicaid coverage. Yes, it\u2019s Obamacare, but it\u2019s also $7 billion in federal dollars (over time) to offer health insurance coverage to Louisiana people who are already working. It\u2019s worth noting that Blueprint\u2019s leaders are mostly business people \u2014 conservatives \u2014 not bleeding-heart liberals, academics or (dare I whisper) Democrats.\n\nFor some reason, anti-Obamacare ideologues (particularly Bobby Jindal) put forth the meme that expanding Medicaid would put more loafers on the public dole. That is more than a lie; it is a cruel hoax that demonizes the poor, blaming them for a fate that most of them were born into. The truth is this: Expanding Medicaid would actually encourage people to work because it would offer them a chance to get health insurance without penalizing them for earning slightly more than poverty-level wages. Blueprint accurately notes that there are moral as well as financial reasons for supporting this position.\n\nTry getting a \u201cconservative\u201d candidate for governor or the Legislature to admit that.\n\nIn the other three main areas of focus, Blueprint proposes sensible, structural reforms that others have pushed in recent years: protecting the Transportation Trust Fund against budget raids and increasing annual investments in the fund; preserving higher admission standards at public universities and reforming TOPS to make it sustainable; and building \u201chonest\u201d state budgets while raising recurring revenue and streamlining Louisiana\u2019s tax code.\n\nThere\u2019s much more at Blueprint\u2019s website. Let\u2019s hope it starts more than just a conversation.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Blog Post", "description": "We get the leaders we deserve because we don't demand better.
