They are usually performed on buses bearing the names of both HealthFair and the partner hospital.\n\nThe consumer group sent letters to hospitals in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Virginia.\n\nA leading physician group said Public Citizen had expressed legitimate concerns about these medical tests.\n\n\"The questions raised about screening have some merit,\" said Dr. Patrick T. O'Gara, president of the American College of Cardiology. \"We do not recommend broad and untargeted screening.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Consumer group urges hospitals to stop 'unethical' health screenings", "date": "2014-06-19", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "A prominent consumer group is calling on 20 hospitals, including three in Southern California, to stop marketing medical tests to patients that the group considers unnecessary and unethical.", "title": "Consumer group urges hospitals to stop 'unethical' health screenings", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hospital-heart-screenings-under-fire-20140618-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53a1d525/turbine/la-fi-hospital-heart-screenings-under-fire-20140618", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare, Public Citizen, health screenings, patients, HealthFair", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80548581", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "healthcare, Public Citizen, health screenings, patients, HealthFair", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "A prominent consumer group is calling on 20 hospitals, including three in Southern California, to stop marketing medical tests to patients that the group considers unnecessary and unethical.
