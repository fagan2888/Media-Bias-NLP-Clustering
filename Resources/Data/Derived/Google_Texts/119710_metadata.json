Counihan, chief executive of the Connecticut exchange.\n\n\"We had several states contact us at end of last year,\" Counihan said.\n\nThe functions of the exchanges include evaluating and certifying health plans, providing information about costs and benefits, sending files to insurance companies and government agencies, and collecting the data needed to enroll participants and determine the federal subsidies they may be eligible to receive.\n\nSome states have been experiencing problems with their own exchanges, while others were reluctant to take on the responsibility of running them, and ceded control to the federal government, whose own website, HealthCare.gov, has experienced well-documented problems.\n\n\"It struck us as a great opportunity for an exchange in a box,\" Counihan said. \"I think there is serious interest. We're not about to sign any contracts, but there are people that are kicking the tires.\"\n\nConnecticut could perform all or part of the services, and the fees charged would depend on the size of the state and the amount of services provided, Counihan said.\n\n\"I liken it to an Automatic Teller Machine,\" he said. \"Do you care who built the machine, or do you care that the money is given out and the proper balance is kept. If we had this option a year ago, we would have taken it in a New York minute.\"\n\nThe enrollment fair in Danbury was the latest in about 100 such events that have been held throughout the state since the law went into effect in October.\n\n\"This is pretty typical,\" said Monica Caballeros, one of three outreach workers who spent the afternoon guiding people through the process and directing those who wanted to enroll to brokers who would help them find the right plan.\n\n\"Obamacare isn't going to work for everyone, but almost everybody who came here has seen some benefit,\" she said.\n\nBoyd found a policy that was \"at least as good\" as the $300-plus per month package he was forced to drop last year, and at about a third of the cost.\n\n\"I just want to do a little more homework before I sign up,\" he said.\n\nFassler said she enrolled in what she said was a \"very affordable policy.\" Although currently in good health, she said she wanted the security of health insurance, \"because I'm clumsy.\"\n\njpirro@newstimes.com; 203-731-3342", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Robert Boyd, 41, of Danbury is a freelance magazine writer who hasn't had health insurance since he dropped his policy  because of the cost last summer.
