Showers will be around the Upstate from around 4 p.m. through 9 p.m., while the mountains will see rain mix with snow. Because of that a Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for portions of the mountains through Monday morning.\n\nThe Upstate and northeast GA could even see some small hail briefly as very cold air moves in. Highs will reach the mid 40s for the mountains and mid 50s in the Upstate.\n\nExpect temperatures below freezing in the mountains Sunday night with slowly clearing skies. Lows will fall to around 34 in the Upstate.\n\nBe sure to protect your sensitive plants and bring your pets inside or give them a warm place to sleep.\n\nThe sun will return into Monday but cool air will linger. Highs will only be in the 50s on Monday, but a steady warm-up is in store through the week. Monday night will bring one more opportunity for near-freezing temperatures, then more spring-like air will return by Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nCopyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation).
