He said: \u201cIt shows how serious we are about confronting state failure and tackling some the biggest social problems in our country. Together we will make sure that not a single child is left behind.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to put this right; to say to poorly performing local authorities: improve, or be taken over. We will not stand by while children are let down by inadequate social services.\u201d\n\nThe broad principle of the changes was announced in September and follow a series of child abuse scandals across the country. But the details are being set out for the first time on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe measures include:\n\n\u2022 More than \u00a3100m to attract more high-calibre graduates into social work by expanding the successful programmes Frontline and Step Up.\n\n\u2022 Working with six of the country\u2019s best local authorities: North Yorkshire, Hampshire, Tri-borough (Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea), Leeds, Durham, and Richmond and Kingston to give academy-style freedoms to high-performing authorities.\n\n\u2022 A drive to recruit new trust sponsors from the charity sector to help deliver innovative children\u2019s services. Morgan will chair a roundtable event in the new year with local authorities and major charities such as Barnardo\u2019s and the NSPCC.\n\n\u2022 A new What Works centre, to make sure social workers learn from the best practice in the country.\n\nMorgan said: \u201cEvery single day our most vulnerable children and young people are supported by dedicated, expert social workers \u2013 support that changes their lives for the better. But in too many towns and cities across the country, children in the most desperate of circumstances are being allowed to slip through the cracks. This simply isn\u2019t good enough and every single child failed is a child too many.\u201d\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the children\u2019s charity Barnardo\u2019s said it welcomed the announcement, but warned the government that it had to ensure that any group wanting to take over children\u2019s services had the relevant expertise to ensure vulnerable children got the best service possible.\n\nThe charity\u2019s chief executive, Javed Khan, said: \u201cWe need to ensure we have the best possible services across the UK to support children and families, especially those who are most vulnerable. There must be options, where it is best for the child, to use the expertise of the voluntary sector to complement those already in place.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "High-performing local authorities, charities and experts will take over struggling services under government plans", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Frances Perraudin", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "High-performing local authorities, charities and experts will take over struggling services under government plans", "title": "Councils failing children's services to be taken over by third parties", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/14/failing-childrens-services-new-regime-council-trusts", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41addbd59cd5262ab16db08321de8719523d71d7/304_2269_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=81f8425ddaa8b67a54e01161437dde62", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2015/dec/14/failing-childrens-services-new-regime-council-trusts?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/14/failing-childrens-services-new-regime-council-trusts", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2015/dec/14/failing-childrens-services-new-regime-council-trusts?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/41addbd59cd5262ab16db08321de8719523d71d7/304_2269_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2015/dec/14/failing-childrens-services-new-regime-council-trusts?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Children,Child protection,Society,UK news,David Cameron,Local government,Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-12-14T08:55:28.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewtaylor,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frances-perraudin", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:34:22.000Z", "tag": "Children,Child protection,Society,UK news,David Cameron,Local government,Politics"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41addbd59cd5262ab16db08321de8719523d71d7/304_2269_3494_2097/3494.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=cc697c288b501cf5afb393645230f80a", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Children,Child protection,Society,UK news,David Cameron,Local government,Politics"}, "article_summary": "Children\u2019s services that persistently fail young people will be taken out of councils\u2019 hands and given to other high-performing local authorities, children\u2019s charities or \u201cteams of experts\u201d, under plans unveiled by the government.\n\u2022 A drive to recruit new trust sponsors from the charity sector to help deliver innovative children\u2019s services.\n\u201cIt is our duty to put this right; to say to poorly performing local authorities: improve, or be taken over.\nThe education secretary, Nicky Morgan, has told local authorities that improving children\u2019s services is not just about money, but about finding a different way of doing things.\nMorgan will chair a roundtable event in the new year with local authorities and major charities such as Barnardo\u2019s and the NSPCC."}
