Be prepared for questions unrelated to why you are seeking medical help \u2014 questions that you don\u2019t want to answer.\n\nWhether you\u2019re at the dermatologist or the cardiologist, you\u2019ll likely be asked: \u201cAre you sexually active? If so, do you have one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?\u201d\n\nDoctors are being turned into government agents, where they\u2019re pressured financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary and violate their Hippocratic Oath to keep patients\u2019 records confidential.\n\nGoing to the doctor can be embarrassing. But for your own good, you confide in your doctor, as you wouldn\u2019t anyone else. What is happening here is different.\n\n\u201cThis is nasty business,\u201d says Dr. Adam Budzikowski, a New York cardiologist, who called the sex question \u201cinsensitive, stupid and very intrusive.\u201d He could not think of an occasion when a cardiologist would need such information.\n\nDoctors and hospitals who don\u2019t comply with the federal government\u2019s electronic health records requirements forego incentive payments now and face financial penalties from Medicare and Medicaid starting in 2015. The Department of Health and Human Services has already paid out over $12.7 billion in incentives to doctors and hospitals.\n\nDr. Richard Amerling, a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at Albert Einstein Medical College, explains that your medical record should be \u201ca story created by you and your doctor solely for your treatment and benefit.\u201d But the Obama administration\u2019s electronic record requirements are turning it \u201cinto an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential.\u201d\n\nLack of confidentiality is what concerned the New York Civil Liberties Union in a 2012 report. Electronic medical records have enormous benefits, but with one click of a mouse, every piece of information in a patient\u2019s record, including the social history, is transmitted, disclosing too much.\n\nThe social history questions also include whether you\u2019ve ever used drugs, including IV drugs.\n\nAs the NYCLU cautioned, revealing a patient\u2019s past drug problem, even if it was a decade ago, risks stigma.\n\nOn the other end of the political spectrum is the Goldwater Institute, a free-market think tank. It argues that by requiring everyone to have health insurance and then imposing penalties on insurers, doctors and hospitals that don\u2019t use the one click electronic system, you are violating Americans\u2019 medical privacy.\n\nProtests from these privacy advocates are largely ignored. On Jan. 17, HHS announced that if patients want to keep something out of their electronic record, they should pay cash. That\u2019s impractical for most people.\n\nIn 2010, when Congress was drafting Obamacare, the National Rifle Association saw the danger and demanded a protection that became Section 2716 of the final law. It bars the federal government from compelling doctors and hospitals to ask you if you own a firearm. That\u2019s the only question they can\u2019t be told to ask you.\n\nWhere are the women\u2019s rights groups that went to the barricades in the 1980s and 1990s to prevent the federal government from accessing women\u2019s health records? Hypocritically, they are silent now.\n\nPatients need to defend their own privacy by refusing to answer the intrusive \u201csocial history\u201d questions. If you need to confide something to your doctor pertaining to your own treatment, ask your doctor about keeping two sets of books so that your secrets stay in the office. Doctors take the Hippocratic oath seriously and will not be offended.\n\nAre such precautions paranoid? Hardly. We are only beginning to see the data collection ambitions of the executive branch. On Sept. 6, The New York Times reported that Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations show that the National Security Agency has \u201cbroadly compromised the guarantees that Internet companies have given consumers to reassure them that their communications, online bank and medical records, would be undecipherable to criminals or governments.\u201d\n\nBe cautious about sharing your medical secrets with Uncle Sam.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former Lt. governor of New York and the author of \u201cBeating Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Doctors are being turned into government agents.", "title": "Obama wants your sexual history", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/70747462-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/11/obama-wants-your-sexual-history/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Doctors are being turned into government agents.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/70747462-480x320.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Doctors are being turned into government agents."}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6a8\"", "article_summary": "Electronic medical records have enormous benefits, but with one click of a mouse, every piece of information in a patient\u2019s record, including the social history, is transmitted, disclosing too much.\nWhere are the women\u2019s rights groups that went to the barricades in the 1980s and 1990s to prevent the federal government from accessing women\u2019s health records?\nOn Jan. 17, HHS announced that if patients want to keep something out of their electronic record, they should pay cash.\nDoctors and hospitals who don\u2019t comply with the federal government\u2019s electronic health records requirements forego incentive payments now and face financial penalties from Medicare and Medicaid starting in 2015.\nBe prepared for questions unrelated to why you are seeking medical help \u2014 questions that you don\u2019t want to answer."}
