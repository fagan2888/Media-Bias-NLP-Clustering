I have 18 out of 34, and we have 18 committed \u2018Yes\u2019 votes to pass right-to-work, so we\u2019ll be the lead body on it,\u201d Cole said.\n\nCole said it \u201cmay be a tougher lift\u201d in the West Virginia House of Delegates, where his fellow Republicans hold 64 of 100 seats. House Speaker Tim Armstead has expressed support for right-to-work.\n\nThe West Virginia Legislature\u2019s 60-day session is scheduled to begin Jan. 13, and union bosses have already begun a marketing campaign against right-to-work.\n\nWest Virginia AFL-CIO leaders claim right-to-work would lower workers\u2019 pay and benefits and lead to more workplace deaths. The union coalition did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCole is unconvinced by the unions\u2019 arguments. \u201cTo me, this isn\u2019t union vs. anti-union. They\u2019ll frame it that way; I don\u2019t. This is about the right to choose,\u201d he said.\n\nRELATED: West Virginia union bosses panicking over right-to-work\n\nCole pointed to West Virginia\u2019s high unemployment rate, low labor force participation, low average wages and shrinking construction industry as signs that forced unionization isn\u2019t helping the state\u2019s workers.\n\n\u201cWhat could we possibly be protecting other than the status quo, which is not working for us in this state?\u201d Cole asked. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know what the unions are protecting other than union leadership\u2019s standard and style of living.\u201d\n\nA study by the West Virginia University Bureau of Business & Economic Research projected right-to-work would \u201csubstantially boost overall employment and output growth in the long-run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to make some bold steps and bold moves \u2014 and of course, it sounds bold but I just think it\u2019s common sense,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe need to do something differently if we want a different result.\u201d\n\nCole \u2014 who serves as lieutenant governor \u2014 is running in the 2016 race to replace term-limited Democrat Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, and he sees right-to-work as part of the foundation for his potential governorship.\n\n\u201cIn West Virginia we better set the stage for an economic turnaround,\u201d Cole said. \u201cPart of that is legal reforms, part of that is regulatory reforms, part of that is right-to-work.\u201d\n\n\u201cA year from now I want to be in a position to go out and knock on doors around this country and say to Fortune 500 companies, \u2018Listen, you need to move to West Virginia, you need to make an investment here, look at what we did,'\u201d he explained.\n\nTomblin would likely veto right-to-work if it\u2019s approved by state lawmakers. But the West Virginia Legislature could override a veto with simple majority votes in both houses.\n\n\u201cThe governor has five days when we put it on his desk,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIf he vetoes it, we can take it right back up.\u201d\n\nA potential veto factors heavily into Cole\u2019s desire to see right-to-work passed quickly. \u201cIf we do it late in the session he can just wait until we\u2019re gone and veto it and it\u2019s done for a year, so we\u2019ll take it up early,\u201d Cole told Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "West Virginia Senate President Bill Cole expects the state's lawmakers to vote on a right-to-work bill early in the upcoming legislative session.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "West Virginia Senate President Bill Cole expects the state's lawmakers to vote on a right-to-work bill early in the upcoming legislative session.", "title": "West Virginia right-to-work bill coming in January - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/bill-cole-west-virginia-legislature.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/249331/wv-right-to-work-january/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "West Virginia Senate President Bill Cole expects the state's lawmakers to vote on a right-to-work bill early in the upcoming legislative session.", "title": "West Virginia right-to-work bill coming in January - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/bill-cole-west-virginia-legislature.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-12-01T10:21:46+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "west virginia, west virginia right to work, rtw, west virginia rtw, bill cole, west virginia legislature, earl ray tomblin, west virginia senate, forced union dues"}, "article_summary": "West Virginia Senate President Bill Cole expects state lawmakers to vote on a right-to-work bill early in the upcoming legislative session.\nWest Virginia AFL-CIO leaders claim right-to-work would lower workers\u2019 pay and benefits and lead to more workplace deaths.\nThe West Virginia Legislature\u2019s 60-day session is scheduled to begin Jan. 13, and union bosses have already begun a marketing campaign against right-to-work.\nRELATED: West Virginia union bosses panicking over right-to-workCole pointed to West Virginia\u2019s high unemployment rate, low labor force participation, low average wages and shrinking construction industry as signs that forced unionization isn\u2019t helping the state\u2019s workers.\nCole said it \u201cmay be a tougher lift\u201d in the West Virginia House of Delegates, where his fellow Republicans hold 64 of 100 seats."}
