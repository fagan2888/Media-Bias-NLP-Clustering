This time, the Republican establishment is launching a few primary challenges of its own.\n\nSitting atop the target list is Justin Amash, the second-term congressman from Michigan. Dubbed the \u201cmost liberal Republican\u201d by Karl Rove, Amash is a favorite of the Club for Growth, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, and other Tea Party groups. But GOP moderates hope Gerald Ford\u2019s former district isn\u2019t an ideal base for the most influential Ron Paul Republican outside of libertarianism\u2019s first family.\n\nBrian Ellis is Amash\u2019s business-backed challenger and he is opting for a horseshoes strategy against the incumbent; he wants to hit Amash from both the left and the right. When it comes to defunding Obamacare and shutting down the government, Ellis will portray Amash as an uncompromising ideologue. On foreign policy and other issues, Ellis will say Amash isn\u2019t enough of a Republican team player.\n\nFor example, Amash has emerged as a leader in the bipartisan coalition to rein in the federal government\u2019s data-gathering and surveillance practices. Ellis emphasizes that he thinks Edward Snowden is a \u201cflat-out traitor.\u201d\n\nSo according to Ellis, Amash is too much like Ted Cruz and Ted Kennedy. But he\u2019s careful not to take the critique too far. He says he is just as gung ho against Obamacare. And he is also willing to rein in the National Security Agency.\n\nEllis dislikes it when Amash votes against seemingly conservative bills based on constitutional technicalities. But some of his complaints against Amash sound awfully technical themselves.\n\nIn an interview with the Weekly Standard, Ellis attacked his opponent\u2019s constitutional scruples in terms that belong in every Amash ad from here until the primary. Amash should stop voting against bills because he thinks they violate the Constitution, he suggested. \u201cIf something is unconstitutional, we have a court system that looks at that,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nAs the television pop psychologist Dr. Phil might ask, \u201cHow\u2019s that workin\u2019 for ya?\u201d A Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees upheld Obamacare, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the majority that pretended the individual mandate was constitutional.\n\nEllis, who promises to \u201cprotect the rights of the unborn\u201d and \u201cvote 100% pro-life,\u201d might recall that a Supreme Court with a Republican majority also reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. That would be the same Roe decision pro-choice Yale legal scholar John Hart Ely memorably argued is \u201cnot constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\u201d Edward Lazarus, a former clerk to Roe author Justice Harry Blackmun, wrote the decision \u201cborders on the indefensible.\u201d\n\nCongress (thanks in large part to Amash) may end up doing more to rein in the NSA, as Ellis says needs to be done, than the courts. Federal judges have so far issued contradictory decisions on the program. If you believe, as most conservatives claim to, that the federal government is limited to its constitutionally enumerated powers, the courts have given precious little relief in the last eighty years.\n\nInstead of punting constitutional judgments to the courts, the congressional oath of office has members swear to uphold and defend the Constitution. Ellis himself has a section of his campaign website with the heading \u201cDefend our Constitution,\u201d in which he proclaims, \u201cThe Constitution and Declaration of Independence are the frameworks that secure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for each of us blessed to be Americans.\u201d\n\nHow do they secure these rights if these frameworks mean whatever five Supreme Court justices say they mean?\n\nThe Tea Party, for all its faults, came into existence because many Republicans ceased to govern according to the conservative principles on which they campaigned. George W. Bush and a Republican-controlled Congress outspent Bill Clinton. Even conservatives succumbed to situational constitutionalism at best -- or crony capitalism at worst.\n\nEnter lawmakers like Amash, who are sticklers for constitutional detail and who use social media to explain their votes to the public. However uncomfortable some Republicans might be with this new way of doing business, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a very good argument for returning to the bad old days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Justin Amash cares if Bank of America gives to him or not,\u201d a bewildered lobbyist was quoted as saying in article about Wall Street\u2019s distaste for the Tea Party. What would you rather your congressman care about: Bank of America or the Constitution?\n\nImage: Flickr/Gage Skidmore.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "It seems the Republican establishment is launching a few primary challenges of its own.", "dcterms.title": "Is Justin Amash Doomed?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"url": "http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/justin-amash-9659", "type": "article", "site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "It seems the Republican establishment is launching a few primary challenges of its own.", "title": "Is Justin Amash Doomed?"}, "dcterms.subject": "Domestic Politics, United States,", "abstract": "It seems the Republican establishment is launching a few primary challenges of its own.", "description": "It seems the Republican establishment is launching a few primary challenges of its own.", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "W.
