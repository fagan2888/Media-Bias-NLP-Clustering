Where to isn\u2019t quite clear.\n\nAs expected, Yellen and the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee laid out new guidance for when the central bank\u2019s policymakers might start to raise key short-term interest rates. The FOMC statement released Wednesday specified that rates would be kept where they are \u201cfor a considerable time\u201d after the Fed\u2019s monthly bond-buying program ends, likely late this year. At her press conference, Yellen clarified what considerable means: \u201caround six months.\u201d\n\nIn a market eagerly listening for specifics it could latch onto, that was enough to send stocks tumbling and bond rates spiking on concern that the Fed's timetable had accelerated a bit.\n\nRelated: Highlights of Yellen's Remarks\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the full context of her comments, though. Yellen said that if the Fed\u2019s asset purchase program continues to wind down at its current rate \u2014 not a certainty in itself \u2014 it would end sometime in the fall of this year. The FOMC, she said, would hold rates steady for a \u201cconsiderable period\u201d after that.\n\nAsked what a considerable period would look like, she said:\n\nThis is the kind of term that\u2019s hard to define but probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing, but what the statement is saying is that it depends what conditions are like. We\u2019d need to see where the labor market is. How close are we to our full employment goal? That will be a complicated assessment not just based on a single statistic. And how rapidly are we moving toward it? Are we really close and moving fast? Or are we getting closer but moving very slowly? And then, what the statement emphasizes, and this is the same language we used in December and January, we used the language \u201cespecially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.\u201d Inflation matters here, too. Our general principle tries to capture that notion. If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below our 2 percent objective, that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for longer.\n\n\n\nPolicymakers had been linking future interest rate increases to specific thresholds for the unemployment rate and the outlook for inflation. They had said they\u2019d hold interest rates low \u201cwell past\u201d the point that unemployment dropped to 6.5 percent, so long as inflation looked to stay below 2.5 percent. But the unemployment rate fell faster than the Fed expected and, at its current 6.7 percent, could reach the Fed\u2019s target quickly. Yet the Fed doesn\u2019t plan on raising rates any time soon.\n\nIn short, the numerical target no longer holds meaning, so the Fed ditched it. At her press conference Wednesday afternoon, Yellen explained: \u201cMarkets want to know, the public wants to understand, beyond that threshold, how will we decide what to do?\u201d\n\nThe answer still isn\u2019t completely clear. The Fed did say it would look at more qualitative factors in determining when to start raising rates. The FOMC statement said that the committee would \u201ctake into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\u201d How\u2019s that for transparency?\n\nAt her press conference, Yellen did specifically cite a broader measure of unemployment and underemployment known as U-6, which includes people who have part-time work but would prefer full-time jobs. She also mentioned long-term unemployment among the indicators on her economic dashboard. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not close to full employment, not close to employment consistent with our mandate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s new approach is just the latest in a series of communication strategies. As part of a quest for transparency started under Yellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, the Fed has tried to more clearly signal its intentions for interest rates.\n\nAfter it dropped interest rates to near zero in 2008, the FOMC initially used only the vaguest of terms \u2014 \"some time\" or \"an extended period\" \u2014 to explain how long they would stay so low. Then, the Fed tied its rate forecasts to the calendar, saying it expected to keep rates exceptionally low \u201cat least through late 2014\u201d or \u201cat least through mid-2015.\u201d Those dates matched up with forecasted improvements in economic projections and the labor market, but they were imprecise at best. The dates didn\u2019t matter as much as the underlying economic conditions the Fed was targeting. So in December 2012, the Fed shifted its communication strategy and began explicitly linking monetary policy to those specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation.\n\nWith those specific guideposts now gone, Fed watchers are left to interpret the FOMC statement and Yellen\u2019s words \u2014 and many of them saw hawkish signs. The Fed statement, for example, signaled that the economic recovery is now strong enough \u201cto support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.\u201d Fed officials dropped their forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of this year to a range of 6.1 percent to 6.3 percent, down from 6.3 percent to 6.6 percent in the December forecasts. And 13 of 16 Fed officials now expect the central bank to raise rates in 2015, with a majority of officials now expecting the Fed funds rate to be above 1 percent at the end of 2015.\n\nAt her press conference Wednesday afternoon, Yellen tried to emphasize the leeway inherent in those forecasts. \u201cThe end of 2016 is a long way out,\u201d she said. \u201cMonetary policy will be evolved to reflect evolving conditions in the economy.\u201d\n\nWith the Fed now using qualitative measures that are less well defined, getting that message across might be more of a challenge.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Janet Yellen just moved the goalposts.
