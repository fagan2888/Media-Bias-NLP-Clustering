The University of Kansas and Wichita State University will be facing off in the third round of the NCAA tournament and apparel stores are making good business out of it.

Sports Time Fan Shop sells shirts and other school apparel and memorabilia. They ordered around 300 shirts that have designs that said "Shock the Hawks" and "Rock the Shocks."

"This is a showdown that has been waiting to happen for quite some time, so yes, everyone is excited, even us at the store are excited," said Valerie Becker, manager at Sports Time Fan Shop.

A line wrapped around Sports Time Fan Shop as fans waited for the store to open.

"I'm for sure going to get the gray, but I have yet to decide past that point," said Lauren Means, looking inside the store windows at the possible choices in shirts, "to be honest, I am probably going to get all three."

Sports Time Fan Shop sold out in less than two hours. The owner says that if Wichita State wins the game on Sunday, they will have 3000 shirts ordered and in-stock for Monday morning.
