In a floor speech Wednesday, Udall blasted Brennan and said the White House has shown \u201cno moral leadership\u201d on the issue.\n\nNo Surprise: Then again, it\u2019s not like anyone in the public wants him to: the New York Times, citing recent Associated Press polls, reports that when it comes to preventing or revealing terrorist activities, 50 percent of respondents are OK with using torture to make them safe.\n\nDrawn Conclusion:", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Early Education Boost, Torture Fallout, Ready For Elizabeth (or Hillary)", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A Democrat slams Obama for \"no moral leadership,\" while the left uses Warren draft to pressure Clinton.", "title": "Last Call: Early Education Boost, Torture Fallout, Ready For Elizabeth (or Hillary)", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/12/10/last-call-early-education-boost-torture-fallout-ready-for-elizabeth-or-hillary", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/26/01/9c19e6aa483983509eecaf917fd3/141210-obamas-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A Democrat slams Obama for \"no moral leadership,\" while the left uses Warren draft to pressure Clinton.", "card": "summary", "title": "Last Call: Early Education Boost, Torture Fallout, Ready For Elizabeth (or Hillary)"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
