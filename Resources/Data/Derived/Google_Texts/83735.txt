THE fifth developer approved by the Northern Marianas Housing Corp. for $1.66 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits for 10 years will build its project near Lower Base.

Variety learned that Saipan Comfort Homes will be building the project on two properties in As Mahetog.

According to Saipan Comfort Homes LLC’s declaration of extended rental housing commitment dated Dec. 24, 2014, the location of the development will be the 17,389 sq. m. and 1,132 sq. m. parcels of land in As Mahetog.

The project, which is estimated to cost about $18 million, will consist of 40 units “20 of which will be allocated for the elderly with supportive care”, according to Palacios in an earlier interview.

There are five developers approved by NMHC for LIHTC credits: Sandy Beach Homes, Blue Water Homes, Isa Villas, Tasi Homes LLC and Saipan Comfort Homes LLC.

Ironwood Saipan took over the Blue Water Homes project.

Currently, there are two projects with ongoing construction: Ironwood Saipan and Tasi Homes.

Ironwood is building its project on Middle Road next to the Shell station while Tasi Homes LLC is located near Sugar Dock.

Both housing projects are to complete construction late this year.

Of the five developers, Ironwood Saipan is the first to secure the investments from private financing.

It was able to get R4 Capital and Goldman Sachs to invest in the project.

The United States 1986 Tax Reform Act created the federal low-income housing tax credit program under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The LIHTC Program is an indirect federal subsidy used to finance the development of affordable rental housing for low-income households.
