The study is among the first to attempt to document the extent of this problem.\n\n\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t know if the results extrapolate to all emergency departments, my guess is they probably come pretty close,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Carpenter, chairman of the geriatric section of the American College of Emergency Physicians, who was not involved in the research.\n\nMalnutrition in older adults can lead to muscle wasting, fatigue, weakness, functional decline, an increased risk of infection, the exacerbation of chronic illnesses and death. Yet this treatable condition is often overlooked or ignored by medical providers.\n\nIn 2010, a large study that pooled research from five continents found high rates of malnutrition among adults ages 65 and older in hospitals (39 percent), nursing homes (14 percent), rehabilitation facilities (51 percent) and the community (6 percent). Emergency departments were not included.\n\nYet older adults account for about 20 million emergency room visits each year. \u201cIf this study\u2019s findings are confirmed, we should do nutritional screening for all these patients,\u201d Dr. Carpenter said.\n\nIn the new study, published online in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, 138 patients ages 65 and older (none with acute medical problems or dementia) were evaluated at a North Carolina hospital last summer with a six-item questionnaire that asked about food consumption, weight loss, body mass index and problems such as stress or depression.\n\nScores indicated that 22 patients were malnourished and an additional 61 patients were at risk of becoming so \u2014 in all, 60 percent of the entire sample.\n\n\u201cThat was an eye-opener,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Platts-Mills, an author of the study and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nFactors linked to poor nutritional status included depression (of 25 seniors with depression, 52 percent were malnourished); difficulty eating, often due to dental problems (38 percent); and problems affording or having transportation needed to buy groceries (33 percent).\n\nOther studies have suggested additional contributing factors: social isolation \u2014 who likes to eat alone? \u2014 cognitive difficulties, and medications that interfere with appetite or the absorption of nutrients.\n\nAlarmingly, none of the patients identified by researchers as being malnourished had notes in their medical charts indicating that doctors or nurses had identified this problem. \u201cThis is not where our training is,\u201d Dr. Platts-Mills said.\n\nMany families notice when an older relative is not eating well; this study, along with others, suggests that a referral to a doctor for an evaluation may be in order. \u201cMalnutrition is a really serious, common issue and just nagging Grandma to eat more might not be an effective solution,\u201d Dr. Platts-Mills said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140911143142, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 11, 2014", "org": "Annals of Emergency Medicine", "keywords": "Diet and Nutrition,Elderly,Emergency Medical Treatment,Malnutrition,Annals of Emergency Medicine,News & Research", "GBLC": "News & Research", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/In the Emergency Room, a Hidden Ailment ( 20140911 )", "description": "A small study found that many elderly patients turning up in one emergency room were malnourished.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Judith Graham", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Judith Graham", "byl": "Judith Graham", "twitter": {"description": "A small study found that many elderly patients turning up in one emergency room were malnourished.", "title": "In the Emergency Room, a Hidden Ailment", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/in-the-emergency-room-a-hidden-ailment/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003108397, "news_keywords": "Annals of Emergency Medicine,Emergency medicine,Malnutrition,Nutrition,Old age", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 11, 2014", "article": {"tag": "News & Research", "published_time": 1410460302, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-09-11T18:31:42-04:00"}, "utime": 20140911183142, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140911, "pdate": 20140911, "des": "Diet and Nutrition;Elderly;Emergency Medical Treatment;Malnutrition", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "A small study found that many elderly patients turning up in one emergency room were malnourished.", "title": "In the Emergency Room, a Hidden Ailment", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/in-the-emergency-room-a-hidden-ailment/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/in-the-emergency-room-a-hidden-ailment/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "In the Emergency Room, a Hidden Ailment", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMalnutrition is a really serious, common issue and just nagging Grandma to eat more might not be an effective solution,\u201d Dr. Platts-Mills said.\n\u201cIf this study\u2019s findings are confirmed, we should do nutritional screening for all these patients,\u201d Dr. Carpenter said.\nMany seniors who seek care in emergency departments may be malnourished, a small study by researchers at the University of North Carolina suggests.\nYet older adults account for about 20 million emergency room visits each year.\n\u201cThis is not where our training is,\u201d Dr. Platts-Mills said."}
