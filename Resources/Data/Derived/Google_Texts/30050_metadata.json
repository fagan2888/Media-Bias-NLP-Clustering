When it comes to health plans sold on the individual market, these days it\u2019s often less than people think. The lines that distinguish HMOs, PPOs, EPOs and POS plans from one another have blurred, making it hard to know what you\u2019re buying by name alone - assuming you're one of the few people who know what an EPO is in the first place.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s a lot of gray out there,\u201d says Sabrina Corlette, project director at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\nIdeally, plan type provides a shorthand way to determine what sort of access members have to providers outside a plan\u2019s network, including cost-sharing for such treatment, among other things. But since there are no industry-wide definitions of plan types and state standards vary, individual insurers often have leeway to market similar plans under different names. In general:\n\nHealth maintenance organizations (HMOs) cover only care provided by doctors and hospitals inside the HMO\u2019s network. HMOs often require members to get a referral from their primary care physician in order to see a specialist.\n\nPreferred provider organizations (PPOs) cover care provided both inside and outside the plan\u2019s provider network. Members typically pay a higher percentage of the cost for out-of-network care.\n\nExclusive provider organizations (EPOs) are a lot like HMOs: They generally don\u2019t cover care outside the plan\u2019s provider network. Members, however, may not need a referral to see a specialist.\n\nPoint of Service (POS) plans vary, but they\u2019re often a sort of hybrid HMO/PPO. Members may need a referral to see a specialist, but they may also have coverage for out-of-network care, though with higher cost sharing.\n\nAlthough insurers identify plans by type in the plan coverage summaries they're required to provide under the health law, one PPO may offer very different out-of-network coverage than another.\n\n\u201cYou have PPOs with really high cost sharing for out-of-network services, which from a consumer perspective seem a lot like HMOs,\u201d says Corlette. Some plans labeled as PPOs don\u2019t offer out-of-network services at all, experts say. On the other hand, some HMOs have an out-of-network option that makes them seem similar to PPOs.\n\nThen there are EPOs. \u201cPeople have no idea what an EPO is,\u201d says Jerry Flanagan, lead staff attorney at Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy organization that recently filed a class action lawsuit against Anthem Blue Cross in California. They claim, among other things, that the insurer enrolled people in EPO plans with no out-of-network coverage who believed they were being enrolled in PPO plans that provided such coverage.\n\n\u201cMaterials at the time of enrollment and in member\u2019s Explanation of Benefits have clearly stated that the plan was an EPO plan which may not have out-of-network benefits,\u201d said Darrel Ng, a spokesperson for Anthem Blue Cross, in a statement.\n\nThis year, HMOs and PPOs dominated the plans offered by insurers on the health insurance exchanges. According to an analysis of plans sold in the 36 states for which the federal government runs the online insurance marketplace as well as the plans sold on the California exchange, HMO offerings made up 40 percent and PPOs another 40 percent. POS plans made up 12 percent and EPO plans 7 percent.\n\nHigher premiums didn\u2019t necessarily correlate with better out-of-network coverage, says Caroline Pearson, vice president at Avalere Health, a research and consulting firm. HMO plan premiums, in fact, were slightly higher on average than those for PPOs, according to the Avalere analysis.\n\nPearson says the explanation may be that insurers anticipated that people who bought a PPO would probably want to use out-of-network providers. Since out-of-network spending doesn\u2019t count toward the out-of-pocket maximum that people are responsible for before insurance picks up the full tab, these people were likely to be cheaper to insure, she says. (Next year, the out-of-pocket maximum will be $6,600 for single coverage and $13,200 for a family plan.)\n\nBased on the 18 states that have released their proposed products and rates for next year, it doesn\u2019t appear that plan types are likely to change significantly, says Shubham Singhal, leader of the health care practice at management consultant McKinsey & Co.\n\n\u201cPerhaps a few more EPOs will emerge,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the health plans that might have introduced metal-level plans through the HMO are viewing the EPO as way to introduce a non-gatekeeper product.\u201d\n\nSince you can\u2019t rely on plan type to provide clear guidance on out-of-network coverage, there are three basic questions to investigate when evaluating a plan, says Pearson:\n\nIs there out-of-network coverage?\n\nDoes that out-of-network spending accrue toward the member\u2019s out-of-pocket maximum? Legally it doesn\u2019t have to, but some plans include it.\n\nDo members need a primary care physician gatekeeper?\n\nThat\u2019s only the beginning. Once you figure out whether a plan covers out-of-network care, it can be difficult to find out whether your doctor is even in that plan. You can check with you doctor\u2019s office, but sometimes they don\u2019t know. You can also look at provider directories to see who is and isn\u2019t in a plan\u2019s network, however, that information frequently proved inadequate or inaccurate last open enrollment period.\n\nBut understanding the alphabet soup of plan types is an important first step.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Consumer", "description": "What\u2019s in a name?
