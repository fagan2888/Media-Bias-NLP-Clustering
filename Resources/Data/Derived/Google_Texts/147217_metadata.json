The plan is based on the latest available figures from the parliamentary budget officer and the bank of Canada, he added, but also allows for a number of economic variables, such as low oil prices and a low Canadian dollar.\n\n\u201cThere are many countervailing forces in both directions that may make such forecasts higher or lower, and we would account for that,\u201d McCallum said. \u201cWe have already put in prudence that could offset a number of factors that could arise.\u201d\n\nThe promise of a balanced budget could easily be jeopardized if any of those measures should fail to bring in the revenue the Liberals are banking on \u2013 and there are still more spending promises to come.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau still has to announce about $7.5 billion in spending promises for the next four years that could touch on what the party plans to do for health care spending and climate change.\n\nThe NDP, meanwhile, dismissed the entire plan as based on little but \u201causterity, unfunded and broken promises\u201d and \u201cbad math.\u201d\n\nFocusing in on the Liberal pledge to hunt down savings in government spending, NDP candidate Andrew Thomson \u2013 a former Saskatchewan finance minister \u2013 said the Liberal plan would lead to \u201cdeep cuts in the services that Canadians rely on.\u201d\n\nThe plan calls for a deficit of just under $10 billion in the next two fiscal years, the result of a plan to add more than $33 billion in the next fiscal year and $36 billion the year after in new spending for infrastructure projects and a new monthly child benefit.\n\nThe deficit drops to $5.7 billion in year three, with the books creeping into balance by the fourth year.\n\nThe Liberals are hoping that infrastructure spending in particular helps prod economic growth in Canada to help increase tax revenues and pad government coffers just in time for their promised balanced budget.\n\nVeteran Saskatchewan Liberal Ralph Goodale, a former finance minister under Paul Martin, said it\u2019s important to note that the plan \u2013 while including \u201cmanageable, modest deficits\u201d \u2013 includes a constantly declining debt ratio and is designed to foster economic growth.\n\n\u201cOur major policy thrust is investing in growth,\u201d Goodale said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental thing that is so lacking in the Canadian economy today.\u201d\n\nThe party, however, has not counted any of the extra revenues from those investments \u2013 known as a multiplier effect \u2013 into their budget calculations. Nor has the party counted any tax revenue that the government could accrue from the legalization of marijuana.\n\nThe plan also exhausts an annual contingency fund of about $3 billion that the federal government keeps on the books for unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe Liberal plan wouldn\u2019t bring the contingency back into play until the fourth year of its mandate, at which point it would start at $1 billion -the amount the party is budgeting for its surplus.\n\nThe Liberals also say they would also expand the mandate of the parliamentary budget officer to allow it to check the costing of any promises parties make during federal elections.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "iPolitics", "description": "The federal Liberals say they can add almost $146.5 billion in new government spending over the next four years, and still bring the budget back to balance with a surplus of about $1 billion by the end of a four-year mandate.
