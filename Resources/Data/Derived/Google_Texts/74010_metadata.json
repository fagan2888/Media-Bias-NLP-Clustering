Monday night at AT&T Stadium, the seventh-seeded Huskies will be going for a Lone Star hat trick.\n\nRecovering from a horrid start, Connecticut (31-8) finished the first half with a stunning 21-6 run and there was no need to look over its shoulder in a 63-53 victory Saturday night over top-ranked Florida, the only No. 1 seed to reach the Final Four.\n\nFlorida rode a 30-game winning streak into the spacious home of the Dallas Cowboys and the Gators (36-3) had been billed as perhaps the nation\u2019s best defensive team. Connecticut had something to say about that.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to make them as uncomfortable as we could,\u201d said UConn junior guard Ryan Boatright.\n\nWhile getting 19 points from senior center Patric Young, Florida shot only 38.8 percent from the field and needed a late shooting spurt to finish that well. UConn players stayed in front of the Gators and got hands in passing lanes.\n\nFlorida finished with just three assists.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Florida senior guard Scottie Wilbekin, the SEC player of the year. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we usually do.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Final Four: Connecticut vs. Florida\n\nThe Gators took a 16-4 lead, but that was long forgotten by game\u2019s end.\n\nAlthough the underdog, Connecticut had been the last team to beat Florida (65-64 at UConn on Dec. 2) and took the court full of confidence. The Huskies didn\u2019t get rattled after scoring just two baskets in the first 11 minutes.\n\n\u201cI was happy with the way we stayed together and showed some true grit and toughness,\u201d said Huskies second-year coach Kevin Ollie, a former NBA point guard.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t point fingers when we were down,\u201d said UConn\u2019s All-America guard, Shabazz Napier. \u201cWe just talked about what we needed to do.\u201d\n\nWilbekin was billed as one of the nation\u2019s best on-ball defenders, but the Huskies made life miserable for Florida\u2019s backcourt. Smaller but quicker Napier and Ryan Boatright made the Gators work to even start their offense in motion.\n\n\u201cOnce Connecticut got their defense set, we struggled,\u201d Florida coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cThe difference was Scottie couldn\u2019t live in the lane like he had all season. He couldn\u2019t get off ball screens because their quickness wouldn\u2019t allow him to.\u201d\n\nDuring one telling sequence, with the spotlight shining squarely on two of the nation\u2019s best, Wilbekin tried to get past Napier above the key with a crossover move to his right. But with shifty hands, Napier stole the dribble and fed Boatright for an uncontested layup at the other end.\n\nThat made it 47-40 Huskies and reversed the momentum for good after Florida had pulled to within 41-38 two minutes earlier.\n\n\u201cWe keep our composure,\u201d Napier said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in so many dogfights before.\u201d\n\nFlorida guard Michael Frazier, hounded all night by Connecticut quick defenders, managed only three shots in 32 minutes and finished with three points.\n\n\u201cOn offense we couldn\u2019t really get anything going,\u201d Wilbekin said. \u201c(The Huskies) were really aggressive. And when we did get open shots, they wouldn\u2019t fall.\u201d\n\nUConn was led by DeAndre Daniels\u2019 20 points.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "UConn puts a stop to Florida\u2019s 30-game win streak", "title": "UConn puts a stop to Florida\u2019s 30-game win streak", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/05/uconn-puts-a-stop-to-floridas-30-game-win-streak/", "image": {"width": 494, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140405__BN20140406_C1_BNSP06BKCFINALFOUR11p2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140405__BN20140406_C1_BNSP06BKCFINALFOUR11p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T20:20:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:27:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf47d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe just wanted to make them as uncomfortable as we could,\u201d said UConn junior guard Ryan Boatright.\nFlorida rode a 30-game winning streak into the spacious home of the Dallas Cowboys and the Gators (36-3) had been billed as perhaps the nation\u2019s best defensive team.\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Florida senior guard Scottie Wilbekin, the SEC player of the year.\nMonday night at AT&T Stadium, the seventh-seeded Huskies will be going for a Lone Star hat trick.\nAlthough the underdog, Connecticut had been the last team to beat Florida (65-64 at UConn on Dec. 2) and took the court full of confidence."}
