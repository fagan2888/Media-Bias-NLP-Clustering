About 40 percent of the uninsured population in those two states are Lationos.\n\nThirty states, including the District of Columbia, so far have expanded Medicaid.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays the full cost of expanding Medicaid through 2016 in states that increase income eligibility to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). After 2016, the federal share phases down to 90 percent.\n\nIn Missouri, a parent in a low-income family can make no more than 18 percent of the FPL to be eligible for Medicaid. The comparable figure in Kansas is 33 percent.\n\nNearly 210,000 residents in Missouri and Kansas combined would gain coverage if those two states expanded Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nFounded in 1968, La Raza is the largest national Hispanic civil rights advocacy organization in the U.S. It has nearly 300 affiliated community-based organizations.\n\nNordlund said La Raza in Florida has developed a detailed campaign strategy focusing on key lawmakers to pressure them into voting in favor of Medicaid expansion. He said a key win this year was getting one of its three targets to vote for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cOur goal is that, if we can hopefully create enough action in the district, that they actually will hopefully vote our way,\u201d Nordlund said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, we can always hold them accountable in the upcoming election.\u201d\n\nHighlighting personal stories of people who fall in the Medicaid coverage gap is also critical, Guerra-Cardus said.\n\n\u201cThis is a very human issue and stories help bring this out,\u201d she said.\n\nSaturday was the opening day of the four-day annual conference, which drew approximately 5,000 registrants.\n\nAn accompanying family expo, which is free and open to the public, is expected to draw as many as 24,000 attendees during the conference. The expo includes health screenings and more than 100 exhibitors.\n\nMike Sherry is a reporter for KCPT television in Kansas City, Mo., a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Advocates for expanding Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans must refine their strategies to win over lawmakers in states such as Missouri and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/la-raza-outlines-strategies-expand-medicaid", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201507/LARAZA_HEALTH.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Advocates for expanding Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans must refine their strategies to win over lawmakers in states such as Missouri and", "title": "La Raza Outlines Strategies To Expand Medicaid"}, "story_id": 422166145, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mikesherrykcpt"}, "author": "Mike Sherry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "La Raza Outlines Strategies To Expand Medicaid"}, "nid": 75956, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "keywords": "Medicaid, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 553, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bca\"", "article_summary": "Founded in 1968, La Raza is the largest national Hispanic civil rights advocacy organization in the U.S.\nNordlund said La Raza in Florida has developed a detailed campaign strategy focusing on key lawmakers to pressure them into voting in favor of Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t, we can always hold them accountable in the upcoming election.\u201dHighlighting personal stories of people who fall in the Medicaid coverage gap is also critical, Guerra-Cardus said.\nThat was the message Saturday during a panel discussion at the National Council of La Raza annual conference, which is being held at the Kansas City Convention Center.\nAdvocates for expanding Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans must refine their strategies to win over lawmakers in states such as Missouri and Kansas, which have resisted efforts to loosen eligibility requirements."}
