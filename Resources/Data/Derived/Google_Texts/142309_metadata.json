Chris Christie\u2019s budget proposal doesn\u2019t include money for a permanent fix to the computer problems that have bedeviled applicants for social services for years.\n\nLegislators pushed for a solution after the state cancelled its contract for a new computer system. Contractor Hewlett-Packard repeatedly failed to deliver on the Consolidated Assistance Support System (CASS), which cost the state $15 million and the federal government tens of millions more.\n\nState officials came up with a \u201ctransition plan,\u201d using another contractor, Xerox, to handle human-services applications. In addition, the state hired auditing company KMPG for $850,000 to analyze what can be salvaged from CASS and to make recommendations for a future system. Xerox is budgeted to be paid $7 million.\n\nCASS was first envisioned in 2006 as a way to connect the state with county welfare offices, allowing applicant information to be shared instantaneously across different programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, and Medicaid, the primary health program for low-income residents.\n\nThe state signed a contract with Hewlett-Packard to build the system in 2009, but cancelled it after five years of delays.\n\nState Auditor Stephen M. Eels has questioned why state officials didn\u2019t act sooner to cancel the contract.\n\nState officials said yesterday that they paid for the stages of the contract that Hewlett-Packard completed, and stopped paying when the company stopped delivering. They haven\u2019t explained why it took five years for that to happen, although they have said that a series of corporate acquisitions contributed to delays.\n\nActing Human Services Commissioner Elizabeth Connolly said the state is looking to see what other states are doing with their social-services computer systems, and whether the state can \u201cpiggy-back\u201d onto another state\u2019s contract.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll have a better plan after we see what KPMG has,\u201d she said during an Assembly Budget Committee hearing yesterday on her agency\u2019s proposed budget. .\n\nUnlike many states that have more centralized systems, New Jersey relies on county welfare agencies to process social-services applications. The ability to process applications varies widely from county to county, a problem that CASS was intended to help fix.\n\nThe issue became more crucial in January 2014, when Medicaid eligibility was expanded under the federal Affordable Care Act. This led to a surge in applications to NJ FamilyCare \u2013 the state\u2019s primary Medicaid coverage program \u2013 and large backlogs of applications in some counties. FamilyCare has added 420,000 people since the expansion.\n\nIn addition to problems with the computer system, another factor contributing to delays is that counties don\u2019t have enough workers processing applications.\n\nThe ACA-fueled surge in applications actually offered county governments an opportunity to try to their handling of applications -- at the time, counties were paid a certain amount for each application they received and could have spent that money to hire more workers.\n\nBut counties didn\u2019t hire additional workers, noted state Medicaid director Valerie Harr.\n\nThe state changed that payment system in January, hoping to motivate counties to speed up their processing of social-services application. Instead of being paid for each application they receive, the counties are now paid based on the number actually completed.\n\nState officials are transferringthe remaining county backlogs of 9,000 to 12,000 applications to Xerox. They hope to eliminate the backlog by the end of May.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about the backlog, because we want people to have their Medicaid \u2013 the goal with the expansion is to get Medicaid to the people who need it,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nCommittee Chairman Assemblyman Gary S. Schaer (D-Bergen and Passaic) questioned why state officials can\u2019t provide a timeline for resolving problems with the computer system, beyond receiving the KPMG report in mid-May.\n\nHe and Assemblyman Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson) also expressed concerns over the fact that counties have been inconsistent in reporting backlog data, and that the state doesn\u2019t require them to submit the data.\n\nProcessing applications \u201cis being done without a system; we don\u2019t know when that system is going to be up and running; our counties are not cooperating with us in terms of providing data. Why am I getting a queasy feeling, commissioner?\u201d Schaer asked Connolly.\n\nConnolly responded that the state does have a system to process applications, even if it doesn\u2019t provide the coordination that CASS was supposed to provide. That system is based on a patchwork of different computer systems that have handled applications for different social services, including the Family Assistance Management Information System (FAMIS), which has been used for decades and doesn\u2019t allow the state to closely track applications as they are processed by counties.\n\nAssemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem) noted that state officials promised last year that CASS would be ready this year.\n\n\u201cAre there bad guys here? Did somebody do something wrong?\u201d he said, questioning whether it will be possible to fix the problem after seven years of failing to fix it.\n\nConnolly said the ACA made integrating social-service computer systems more complicated.\n\n\u201cThere will be solutions that come forward,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to not happen \u2013 we\u2019re working in the same way as other states to integrate very complex systems and merge them together.\u201d\n\nRaymond J. Castro, senior policy analyst for the nonprofit New Jersey Policy Perspective, said it\u2019s striking that the state hasn\u2019t included money for a permanent replacement for the CASS project in the 2015-2016 budget He said that the state could have speeded up the process of hiring a new contractor, particularly if the state based its system on one used in another state.\n\nCastro said \u201cit\u2019s going to require major reform\u201d to improve the process for determining whether residents are eligible for social-service benefits, although a new computer system would help.\n\nIn addition to the FamilyCare application backlog, the state has ranked next-to-last in the country in the efficient handling of food-stamp applications. It faces federal penalties for the delays, but state officials said improvements have put it on track to avoid the penalties.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/15/0421/0205"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "It\u2019s still unclear when state will have system to efficiently handle applications for food stamps and Medicaid", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "It faces federal penalties for the delays, but state officials said improvements have put it on track to avoid the penalties.\nState Auditor Stephen M.
