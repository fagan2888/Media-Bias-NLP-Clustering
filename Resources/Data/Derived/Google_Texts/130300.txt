LOS ANGELES (AP) — Retief Goosen made only two pars on the back nine and survived a day of wild shots at Riviera to take a two-shot lead into the final round of the Northern Trust Open.

Goosen wasn’t sure how his nerves would hold up because he had not been a 36-hole leader in more than four years. Those nerves were tested in his round of 2-under 69. Right when he looked to be struggling, Goosen chipped in for birdie on the 16th and two-putted the par-5 17th for birdie.

He was at 8-under 205 and had a two-shot lead over Graham DeLaet.

Among those three shots behind was Sergio Garcia, whose remarkable par on the 13th hole was set up by a 3-iron from a bunker behind the 10th green.
