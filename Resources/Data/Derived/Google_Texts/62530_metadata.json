He is portrayed as a man who lacks principles, unwilling to believe in or fight for anything that matters.\n\nBut the historical Burr was no less passionate about the Revolution than Hamilton. For courage under fire, Burr received a commendation from Congress. And Burr\u2019s New York wing of the Jeffersonian party were men of mixed class backgrounds, whereas the Schuyler-Hamilton Federalist faction was a top-down organization favoring elite interests. Falsely casting Burr as an aristocrat incorrectly shifts the blame for class prejudice onto him.\n\nBy taking sides in a mudslinging fight for power that goes back more than 200 years, \u201cHamilton\u201d misses Burr\u2019s actual contributions. He was a skilled innovator of democracy, working to make elections, financial services, and even the U.S Senate fairer. In New York, he was charged with \u201crevolutionizing the state,\u201d because he backed progressive policies for funding internal improvements, debtor relief, and democratizing the election of state senators. He founded the Manhattan Company, the first bank to extend financial services to ordinary merchants and mechanics outside the ruling elite.\n\nHip-hop \u201cHamilton\u201d unabashedly celebrates the American Dream, the U.S. as land of opportunity. Alexander Hamilton, born on the Caribbean island of St. Nevis, represents the immigrant made good. Left out of the story is that Hamilton \u2014 and the Federalist party he headed \u2014 were hostile to the idea that the United States should ever be led by newcomers. It was the Federalists who pressed for a constitutional amendment barring naturalized foreigners from elected offices, and it was Burr, in the New York Assembly at the time, who gave an eloquent speech defending the liberal promise of the young republic.\n\n\u201cAmerica stood with open arms and presented an asylum to the oppressed of every nation,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we deprive these persons of an important right derived from so sacred a source as our Constitution?\u201d\n\nAbsurdly, the musical puts feminist words in the mouth of Hamilton\u2019s wife, Elizabeth. In truth, Burr was far ahead of Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in advancing the ideas of English writer Mary Wollstonecraft, the leading Enlightenment advocate of women\u2019s rights. The idea that women were the intellectual equals of men was a radical one, and Hamilton attacked Burr for it, calling him a proponent of \u201cGodwinism.\u201d (William Godwin was Wollstonecraft\u2019s husband.)\n\nFinally, \u201cHamilton\u201d wrongly claims that the duel with Burr was over the election of 1800, and that Burr knowingly shot Hamilton after he saw him fire a bullet in the air. Wrong again. The real cause of the duel was that Hamilton attacked Burr\u2019s character when Burr ran for the New York governorship in 1804.\n\nConveniently missing is the fact that Hamilton supplied the pistols, and the one he used had a secret hair trigger. This gave him an unfair advantage and violated the gentlemanly code of conduct.\n\n\u201cHamilton\u201d may be delightful to watch, but let\u2019s not convince ourselves it\u2019s history. When he interviewed Lin-Manuel Miranda, \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert joked: \u201cI didn\u2019t have to read the Bible, because I saw \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar.\u2019 \u201d That pretty much says it all.\n\nNancy Isenberg, professor of American history at Louisiana State University, is author of \u201cFallen Founder: The Life of Aaron Burr.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Isenberg: \u201cHamilton\u201d musical is in no way history", "title": "Isenberg: \u201cHamilton\u201d musical is in no way history", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/18/isenberg-hamilton-musical-is-in-no-way-history/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160318__OP20ISENBERGp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160318__OP20ISENBERGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-18T11:04:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:56:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the historical Burr was no less passionate about the Revolution than Hamilton.\nFinally, \u201cHamilton\u201d wrongly claims that the duel with Burr was over the election of 1800, and that Burr knowingly shot Hamilton after he saw him fire a bullet in the air.\nBy taking sides in a mudslinging fight for power that goes back more than 200 years, \u201cHamilton\u201d misses Burr\u2019s actual contributions.\nThe real cause of the duel was that Hamilton attacked Burr\u2019s character when Burr ran for the New York governorship in 1804.\n\u201cHamilton\u201d may be delightful to watch, but let\u2019s not convince ourselves it\u2019s history."}
