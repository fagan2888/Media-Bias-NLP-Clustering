Authorities were unable to find two people in connection with a vehicle pursuit Wednesday from Santa Barbara County to Ventura, authorities said.

The chase began after the California Highway Patrol at 4:27 p.m. reported a vehicle traveling about 100 mph on southbound Highway 101 north of Highway 1 in Santa Barbara County. Officers tried to conduct a traffic stop, but the vehicle did not stop and used all lanes of the highway, the center divider and right shoulder to get away from authorities, the patrol reported.

The vehicle exited at La Cumbre Road, then went the wrong way on State Street in Santa Barbara, authorities said, with Santa Barbara police taking over the pursuit until the vehicle got back on Highway 101.

Once back on the highway, the vehicle headed south toward Ventura County, with a helicopter from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office joining the chase, the patrol reported.

Along the way, one of the vehicle's tires caught fire. The vehicle got off the freeway at the State Beaches exit in the Ventura area and burst into flames about 4:35 p.m. A man and woman were seen running away from it, authorities said.

The city of Ventura Fire Department knocked down the blaze just before 4:50 p.m., authorities said.

Helicopters with the Ventura and Santa Barbara County sheriff's offices, as well as police dogs, were looking for the man and woman in culverts near Highways 101 and 33, according to Capt. Mark Franke with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.

The man was described as wearing a black shirt with a red logo and blue jeans, authorities said. No description was given for the woman.

The search was called off by 8:45 p.m., Franke said.

Commuters experienced heavy traffic delays on southbound Highway 101 in Ventura near the Main Street exit during the search.
