Is this behavior the result of a cultural transformation or a genuine clinical issue manifested by a dependence best defined as an \u201caddiction?\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that it probably doesn\u2019t matter how it\u2019s categorized \u2014 the problem is real, and how it\u2019s addressed may vary.\n\nRecognition that technology \u201caddiction\u201d is often found to be a compensatory behavior for offline social or psychological difficulties should be an element in any approach to dealing with this type of dependence.\n\nGET OFF YOUR DUFF \u2014 DECREASE RISK OF SOME CANCERS\n\nIn recent years, a growing body of research has focused on sitting time in relation to health.\n\nThe medical literature is replete with evidence that a sedentary existence contributes to diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, obesity, some types of cancer and all-cause mortality.\n\nAccording to a recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, people who spend the majority of their day sitting, even if they exercised regularly, can be up to 66% more likely to develop certain types of cancer than those who do not.\n\nThese study findings suggest that episodic exercise, while certainly important, is not enough, and priority should be placed on refining interventions, independent of physical activity and obesity prevention, to reduce sedentary time \u2014 get up out of that chair or sofa \u2014 and lower cancer risk and overall mortality.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "aca subsidies,affordable care act,death from painkillers,legalization of marijuana,opiod abuse,physician ratings,pope francis,sitting and cancer risk,slider,technology addiction", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Health-Headlines-435-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "How do you really know if your physician, surgeon or hospital is good, bad or somewhere in between?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfa0\"", "article_summary": "Space Coast Daily Healthcare Headlines of the WeekBy Dr. James Palermo // June 24, 2014Topics Include How Good Is Your Doctor?, The Pope and Pot, Paying For Obamacare \u2013 and MoreBREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA \u2014 Welcome to SpaceCoastDaily\u2019s Healthcare Headlines.\nPOPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL DRUGSPublic opinion is rapidly changing toward more lenient policies related to recreational drug use, particularly marijuana.\nHow do you really know if your physician, surgeon or hospital is good, bad or somewhere in between?\nThat information may be available, but knowing how to navigate the system to find it is the key.\nGET OFF YOUR DUFF \u2014 DECREASE RISK OF SOME CANCERSIn recent years, a growing body of research has focused on sitting time in relation to health."}
