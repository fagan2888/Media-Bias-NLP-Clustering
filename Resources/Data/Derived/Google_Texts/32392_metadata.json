Cuomo) took away your rights, why don\u2019t you take away his job?\u201d was another suggestion popular with the gun show crowd.\n\nThe 46-year-old Westchester County executive is not a gun owner, he said, but he has fired guns in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe upcoming election season isn\u2019t going to be a walk in the park for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Astorino told reporters at the gun show, because he won\u2019t be able to avoid issues New Yorkers care about like jobs and taxes, and as far as Astorino is concerned, those are the areas the state needs to make up for.\n\nCuomo, who has roughly a formidable $33 million in his campaign coffers, has told other news outlets he is waiting until the legislative session ends in June to hit the campaign trail in full.\n\nAstorino won two terms in Westchester County, which has more registered Democrats than Republicans, and said that he succeeded as county executive by cutting taxes and spending, and that he plans \u201cto do that statewide.\u201d\n\nAstorino said Westchester County officials worked with nonprofits, the mental health community, law enforcement, educators and religious groups to address the \u201creal issues and root causes\u201d of gun violence, whereas, he asserts, the SAFE Act is partially unconstitutional and partially unenforceable.\n\nOn the subject of Saratoga Springs being home to a full-gaming casino, Astorino said he is \u201cvery much in favor of local control\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s one of the reasons I am absolutely opposed to Common Core.\u201d\n\nAstorino also said there is no way he would consider an Independence Party endorsement.\n\n\u201cThe Independence Party in Westchester is corrupt; they stand for nothing,\u201d Astorino said. \u201cIf it\u2019s like that in the rest of the state ... they should be put out of business.\u201d\n\nFirst-time candidate Elise Stefanik, who is running in the 21st Congressional District race, was also at the gun show touting her belief that the SAFE Act is unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the gun show, Stefanik took her booth to the Saratoga-Wilton Elks Lodge, which was packed with people attending an educational forum on the SAFE Act, hosted by NY2A Grassroots Coalition, that addressed questions about the impending April 15 SAFE Act firearm registration deadline.\n\nLisa Donovan, a NY2A co-founder, said they are informing people of their options and advising them to make decisions that meet their comfort levels, whether it be registering normally, modifying weapons so that they don\u2019t need to be registered or not registering at all.\n\nWhile the audience listened to rotating speakers, several attendees hovered over a barbecue outside the front doors of the lodge, preparing to burn registration forms for the event\u2019s highlight, aside from the rifle that was set to be raffled off to a lucky winner.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement from real estate developer Donald J. Trump that he is dropping out of the gubernatorial race had no impact on Astorino\u2019s campaign, he said, but added he planned to speak with Trump following the gun show and hopes he can count on him for support, since they both share a common goal \u2012 unseating Cuomo.\n\nAstorino lives in Mount Pleasant, N.Y., with his wife and three children. He was a radio host and producer for the SiriusXM satellite radio station, Catholic Channel, and helped start ESPN Radio in New York.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Local News, Local news, Saratoga Springs Local news, NY Local news, US Local news, world Local news.", "title": "Gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino appears at gun show", "og": {"url": "http://www.saratogian.com/article/ST/20140316/NEWS/140319321", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.saratogian.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/ST/20140316/NEWS/140319321/AR/0/AR-140319321.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino appears at gun show"}, "twitter": {"domain": "saratogian.com", "description": "SARATOGA SPRINGS >> When Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino visited the gun show at the City Center Sunday afternoon, he knew how to get the crowd\u2019s attention.", "title": "Gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino appears at gun show", "url": "http://www.saratogian.com/article/ST/20140316/NEWS/140319321", "image": {"src": "http://www.saratogian.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/ST/20140316/NEWS/140319321/AR/0/AR-140319321.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@saratogiannews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "/id551770229", "iphone": "/id520229775", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.saratogian"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Local News, Local news, Saratoga Springs Local news, NY Local news, US Local news, world Local news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "SARATOGA SPRINGS >> When Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino visited the gun show at the City Center Sunday afternoon, he knew how to get the crowd\u2019s attention."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb71\"", "article_summary": "Eric Jenks photos \u2012 The SaratogianSARATOGA SPRINGS >> When Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino visited the gun show at the City Center Sunday afternoon, he knew how to get the crowd\u2019s attention.\nThe 46-year-old Westchester County executive is not a gun owner, he said, but he has fired guns in the past.\nRepublican candidate for New York state governor Robert Astorino of Westchester County speaks with the press Sunday during his appearance at the Arms Fair held at the Saratoga Springs City Center.\nCuomo) took away your rights, why don\u2019t you take away his job?\u201d was another suggestion popular with the gun show crowd.\n\u201cIf I am elected governor, I will repeal the SAFE Act,\u201d Astorino boomed into the mic in his introduction, receiving a hearty response from the gun show visitors who had momentarily paused from browsing the show\u2019s booths to listen to his short speech."}
