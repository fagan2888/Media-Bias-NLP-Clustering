Ken Buck, R-Colo., is still angry about the omnibus spending bill that passed through Congress more than two months ago.\n\nBuck is frustrated\u2014not only by what Congress included in the massive $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, but also by what Congress intentionally left out. He wants the legislature to reassert its rule-making authority by passing several conservative policy riders designed to push back against executive overreach.\n\nThat\u2019s why the House freshman class president says he\u2019s introduced the Article I Consolidated Appropriations Amendment Act.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep fighting for the provisions in this bill, however long it takes,\u201d Buck told The Daily Signal. \u201cOur responsibility to reassert the constitutional power of Congress does not end simply because it is a new legislative year or even with a new president.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, initiatives, projects, and packages discussing Article I, the part of the Constitution that authorizes congressional power, have become increasingly popular among conservatives.\n\nBuck complained in a January letter to colleagues that Congress missed an opportunity with the must-pass omnibus spending bill \u201cto set funding priorities and direct the policies carried out with those funds.\u201d\n\nBuck says his bill attempts to re-establish legislative preeminence by pushing specific policies. It\u2019s \u201ca consolidated platform of many of the riders and defunds that were discussed but not enacted.\u201d\n\nAmong more than a dozen other provisions, Buck\u2019s bill would defund the EPA\u2019s Waters of the U.S. rule, which extends federal authority over smaller waterways, and President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. It would also prevent the IRS from funding the Affordable Care Act and halts grants to sanctuary cities flouting immigration law.\n\nThough the legislation has attracted 19 cosponsors, it has little legislative momentum. Unless it\u2019s attached to must-pass legislation, like the omnibus spending bill, it\u2019s unlikely Buck\u2019s package of riders could make it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nBuck\u2019s office said the congressman is trying to keep the riders relevant and further the overall conversation.\n\n\u201cArticle I is not a keyword, a trend, a brand, or a Facebook graphic,\u201d Buck wrote colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a principle that protects the Republic. But the Republic only benefits if members of Congress assert their constitutional mandate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cOur responsibility to reassert the constitutional power of Congress does not end simply because it is a new legislative year,\" said Rep.
