REUTERS/Randall Hill\n\n4646528\n\nTo Arthur C. Brooks, Ph.D., the president of the American Enterprise Institute, America is obviously exceptional \u201cfor what we reward\u201d as \u201cyou see it from all the people around the world desperate to get here.\u201d\n\nUntil cultural institutions and values were deconstructed by the left, America traditionally rewarded hard work and opportunity, a magnet for entrepreneurs everywhere.\n\nBrooks has just released his 11th book, \u201cThe Conservative Heart,\u201d for conservatives tired of losing arguments as liberals grow government dependency.\n\nBrooks suggests conservatives should stop insulting people and start emphasizing the joyful, optimistic side of conservativism by arguing for people, not against things. Using the example of Obamacare, he says in this 28-minute video interview with The Daily Caller, conservatives are not against the law and its regulations \u2014 they are against the awful consequences of rationing and costs on real people of this law.\n\nNaming three outrages many conservatives discuss, he says \u201cwe\u2019re outraged that we have schools serving adults, not kids. That poor people have gone backwards during this presidency, and that 48 million Americans need food stamps.\u201d\n\nConservatives \u201cneed to better connect their rhetoric with their hearts,\u201d Brooks says. The book helps people use happiness as a strategy in civic engagement and is \u201ca manual for helping people understand what is written on the conservative heart.\u201d\n\nBrooks says conservatives get so distracted pushing back against more liberal policies that they often forget to articulate why they care about free markets, limited government and a more traditional culture. Conservatives forget to articulate that they believe all people deserve innate respect.\n\nThe loss of human dignity that comes from increasing federal dependency and protection is worth the battle over ideas that Brooks is leading from his perch at AEI, where 73 scholars work.\n\nNaming freshman Republican Sens. Tom Cotton, Ben Sasse and James Langford as inherently joyful people who make him feel \u201cbetter about his country\u201d after talking with them, Brooks is optimistic that more Republicans are seeing the value of fighting for Americans left behind by liberal policies.\n\nHe believes the nature of American conservatism is that \u201ceveryone has an innate gift, if only they can be set free.\u201d Brooks sees too many workforce eligible adults being idle in Obama\u2019s economy, knowing that earned success and hard work gives people more self-worth than government checks. After all, he says, \u201cwe have policies that have pulled two billion people out of poverty.\u201d\n\nTo Brooks, the greatest threats to freedom are the erosion of our opportunity society, a warped culture and ignoring an increasingly dangerous world. He also discusses the troubling trend of the left trying to shut down, not engage in, the competition of ideas.\n\nBrooks had a non-traditional path for a conservative leader. He started in Seattle, Wash., where he grew up in a liberal home and culture, dropped out of college, and was a classical musician for 12 years. \u201cNothing could have been further from my mind\u201d he said than conservativism. And now, he says, \u201cnothing is dearer to my heart.\u201d\n\nFor more on Arthur Brooks, see here.
