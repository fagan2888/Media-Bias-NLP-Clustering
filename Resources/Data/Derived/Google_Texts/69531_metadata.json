And the huge, enthusiastic crowds he has been drawing and his solid standing in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire all suggest he is a formidable candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHowever, one of the raps on the socialist Democratic senator from Vermont was that he couldn\u2019t raise the kind of money needed to sustain a long, bruising battle with front-runner Hillary Clinton for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIn another surprising achievement, the campaign raked in $26 million of contributions during the third quarter of 2015, nearly matching the $28 million that Clinton\u2019s campaign announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe former Secretary of State once was viewed as a political juggernaut who could blow away any challenger with a sophisticated national campaign organization fueled by almost unlimited contributions. But it\u2019s not working out that way.\n\nRelated: OMG\u2014Could Bernie Sanders Be the Democratic Frontrunner?\n\nWhile Clinton\u2019s campaign organization and related super PACs hauled in millions of dollars from wealthy donors through nearly 60 fundraisers headlined by Clinton between July 1 and September 30, Sanders has largely shunned fundraising events, doing only seven events during the past three months. Instead, he has skillfully mined the Internet for hundreds of thousands of small contributions.\n\nIndeed, Sanders has received 1.3 million donations from about 650,000 different donors, according to The Washington Post. That performance put him ahead of President Obama\u2019s pace in attracting more than one million donors in 2008 and 2012. More than three-fourths of Sanders funds came from donations of $200 or less, with an average donation of about $25, while the bulk of Clinton\u2019s contributions had come from midsize donations in the range of $200 and $2,700, according to an analysis by the Campaign Finance Institute.\n\nRobby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said yesterday that \u201cWe are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country,\u201d noting that the campaign had raised $75 million in the first two quarters of the year. But Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who has been advising Sanders, told the Post \u201cit\u2019s remarkable that Bernie Sanders was able to raise almost as much money as Hillary Clinton,\u201d especially given the way that he raised it.\n\nSanders clearly is on a roll \u2013 and in fact raised $2 million of his $26 million on Wednesday alone as supporters made a last minute push to try to match or exceed Clinton\u2019s total. He appears on track to raise a total of $100 million by the end of the year. Clinton, meanwhile, is doing well on the fundraising front by most measures.\n\nRelated: Clinton Finally Catches a Break on Benghazi \u2014 from the Mis-speaker of the House\n\nHowever, she continues to struggle to energize her Democratic base and shake loose of the controversy over her mishandling of email during her four years as Obama\u2019s secretary of state by using a private server. Politico reported today that the number of her private emails that have now been deemed classified by the State Department has more than doubled, to over 400 messages.\n\nSanders\u2019 is notoriously stingy with his funds and reportedly has $25 million in cash on hand. That puts him in a strong position heading into the first nationally televised Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13. Clinton holds a 13-point lead over Sanders in the Real Clear Politics aggregated national polling data -- 40.8 percent to 27.6 percent, with 20 percent for Vice President Joseph Biden, who has yet to decide on whether to enter the race.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There was never any doubt that Bernie Sanders had the policy chops to mount a national", "title": "Bernie Sanders Is Raking In the Cash, $25 at a Time", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Bernie-Sanders-Raking-Cash-25-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/bernie_sanders_delivering_speech.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Bernie-Sanders-Raking-Cash-25-Time", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/bernie_sanders_delivering_speech.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There was never any doubt that Bernie Sanders had the policy chops to mount a national", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4a5\"", "article_summary": "That performance put him ahead of President Obama\u2019s pace in attracting more than one million donors in 2008 and 2012.\nSanders\u2019 is notoriously stingy with his funds and reportedly has $25 million in cash on hand.\nThere was never any doubt that Bernie Sanders had the policy chops to mount a national campaign.\nIn another surprising achievement, the campaign raked in $26 million of contributions during the third quarter of 2015, nearly matching the $28 million that Clinton\u2019s campaign announced on Wednesday.\nRelated: OMG\u2014Could Bernie Sanders Be the Democratic Frontrunner?"}
