Instead of celebrated a Roadrunners win on Friday night, it was Ahmed who was eating crow after the Sooners pulled away in the final minutes.\n\nIt was a valiant effort by Bakersfield, but Oklahoma proved to be too much down the stretch.\n\nThe Sooners narrowly led 69-65 with just over three minutes remaining in the game, but it was finally time for OU\u2019s experience advantage to kick into gear. Junior Jordan Woodard drained a transition 3-pointer to put the Sooners up seven points, but the best was yet to come for OU.\n\nAs the Roadrunners were searching for a response on their end, Hield soared out of nowhere to pin Jaylin Airington\u2019s layup attempt off the backboard to ignite the restless crowd inside of Chesapeake Energy Arena.\n\nIf the stifling block wasn\u2019t flashy enough, the back-to-back Big 12 player of the year wasn\u2019t done putting on a show. With the Sooners looking to expand on their seven-point lead, Hield dribbled left at the top of the key, stopped on a dime and stepped back behind the arc before swishing a 3-pointer to put his team up double-digits with 2:32 left in the game.\n\nAnd just to make sure there was still any doubt from the Roadrunners\u2019 side about the ability of the Sooners, Hield erased any chance of a Bakersfield comeback with yet another swat off the backboard.\n\nIn all, Oklahoma ended the game on a 13-to-3 run as they advance to play VCU in the second round on Sunday.\n\nThe Sooners were deadly from behind the arc in the second half as they hit eight of 11 attempts while the Roadrunners only made two in the same amount of tries.\n\nHield was the game\u2019s highest scorer with 27 points while Isaiah Cousins added 16 and Woodard contributed 15. It was good to see all three OU guards show up as they combined to shoot 18-for-31 from the field and 9-for-14 from three.\n\nAhmed led the Roadrunners in scoring with 16 points, but failed to score in the second half.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Buddy Hield scored 27 points total as the Sooners ended the game on a 13-to-3 run to take down Cal State Bakersfield in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.", "author": "Brett Coppenbarger", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31514370/sooners-survive-hield-scores-27-to-lead-ou-past-csu-bakersfield", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10140048_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Buddy Hield scored 27 points total as the Sooners ended the game on a 13-to-3 run to take down Cal State Bakersfield in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.", "title": "Sooners Survive: Hield Scores 27 To Lead OU Past CSU-Bakersfield"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10140048_G.jpg", "description": "Buddy Hield scored 27 points total as the Sooners ended the game on a 13-to-3 run to take down Cal State Bakersfield in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sooners Survive: Hield Scores 27 To Lead OU Past CSU-Bakersfield"}, "wnreadableurl": "sooners-survive-hield-scores-27-to-lead-ou-past-csu-bakersfield", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/18", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,buddy hield,march madness,sooners,ou,csu bakersfield,california,college basketball,big 12,ncaa,tournament", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS07", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,buddy hield,march madness,sooners,ou,csu bakersfield,california,college basketball,big 12,ncaa,tournament"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17c9\"", "article_summary": "Instead of celebrated a Roadrunners win on Friday night, it was Ahmed who was eating crow after the Sooners pulled away in the final minutes.\nIt was a valiant effort by Bakersfield, but Oklahoma proved to be too much down the stretch.\nHield was the game\u2019s highest scorer with 27 points while Isaiah Cousins added 16 and Woodard contributed 15.\nJunior Jordan Woodard drained a transition 3-pointer to put the Sooners up seven points, but the best was yet to come for OU.\nAhmed led the Roadrunners in scoring with 16 points, but failed to score in the second half."}
