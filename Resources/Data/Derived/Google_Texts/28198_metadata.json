REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n4137722\n\nOr: Babs blabs about Hobby Lobby.\n\nNoah Rothman, Mediaite:\n\nIn an appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday ahead of oral arguments before the Supreme Court in a case brought by the retailer Hobby Lobby against the government\u2019s directive in the Affordable Care Act to mandate covering certain forms of birth control, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said that the firm was being hypocritical by not objecting to insurance packages that also cover Viagra.\n\nSo, Barbara Boxer is saying that sex is only for procreation. That seems like a rather conservative, ahem, position to take, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nI don\u2019t know if insurance companies should or shouldn\u2019t cover Viagra. That decision is best made between insurers and the insured. As is coverage of certain forms of birth control. How is it hypocritical to agree upon one but not the other? Just because they both involve erections?\n\nDevout Christians follow Genesis 1:28, \u201cBe fruitful and multiply.\u201d Birth control contravenes that. Viagra doesn\u2019t. And?\n\nI submit to you, dear reader, that Barbara Boxer is a dunce.\n\nThat said, a note to all you teabaggers out there who are saying, \u201cThe best form of birth control is looking at Barbara Boxer\u201d: I won\u2019t abide that sort of ugly sexism. Shame on you.\n\nUpdate: Courtesy of Twitchy, here\u2019s Boxer saying these stupid things in real life.\n\nEven the MSNBC anchor pushed back on this nonsensical point. That\u2019s when you know it\u2019s time to sit down, Babs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jim Treacher", "description": "Or: Babs blabs about Hobby Lobby.
