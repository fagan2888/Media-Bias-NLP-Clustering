HOUSTON, Texas â€” A citizen of Iraq was caught, attempting to illegally enter the U.S., by Border Patrol agents in the state of Washington. The Iraqi already had a pending order of removal from the U.S. government and had seemingly left the U.S. for Canada and then attempted to sneak back into the U.S. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The issue denotes that U.S. authorities knew an Iraqi was in the U.S. illegally and simply ordered the individual removed previously without keeping knowledge of where the individual was.

In this instance, a U.S. resident notified Border Patrol and claimed that someone had been spotted crossing illegally into the U.S. and was asking for a ride to the nearest U.S. town.

The Iraqi was arrested by U.S. authorities on September 21, 2014.
