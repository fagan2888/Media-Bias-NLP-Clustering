Do you have a response to that?\n\nWell Jeb is a very low energy person. So he can sit around a table all day long with one general and talk and talk and you know. But I see that general as being grilled by you. And when I say I watch on television, I do, and I watch on TIME Magazine, and I watch in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, I read all of them a lot.\n\nAnd I get my views from the media. A lot of the views, and frankly other people do. And the views that you will see during those ten or fifteen minute segments or during reading the story are not a lot different than Jeb sitting around with a policy group, if he really has such a thing.\n\nPhotograph by Martin Schoeller\n\nBehind the cover: Donald Trump meets an American bald eagle.\n\nIt sounds good. I can say that too. You know I was an excellent student at the best school and I could also say, \u201cOh well, I have a great policy group, and we sit around.\u201d I mean I wonder whether or not Jeb actually has that. But I\u2019m being very honest. And I know when I say something like that, you can be criticized\u2026When I see certain generals sitting at the different shows, I mean I think it\u2019s a great way to learn about what\u2019s going on. When I see the leaders of countries sitting on shows and frankly, you don\u2019t have to go through the whole process. It\u2019s a shortened version.\n\nSo I\u2019m somebody that time is very important to me, and it saves time. But also you get really good views. You see some tremendous people.\n\nIn one of your books on leadership you actually said as advice to other people who want to be entrepreneurs, having a short attention span can be a benefit.\n\nWell I mean I have an attention span that\u2019s as long as it has to be. But I don\u2019t have to sit around with a group of generals to tell me about Iraq being a failure. Iraq was a total failure.\n\nSeveral of your rivals say that your experience in business doesn\u2019t translate. Chris Christie said, \u201cThis is not negotiating a real estate deal. This is international diplomacy.\u201d What do you say to that?\n\nWell, I have the right temperament. I have the right leadership. I\u2019ve built an incredible company. I went to a great school. I came out I built an incredible company. I wrote the number one selling business book of all time Trump: The Art of the Deal. I had tremendous success in show business\u2013star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was one of the most successful shows. And as you know NBC renewed it, I just said I\u2019m not doing it. They\u2019re not exactly thrilled with me at all. But I\u2019ve had a great career, and I know how to get along with people. I know how to deal with people.\n\nI mean, if I was the governor of New Jersey, the George Washington Bridge would not have been shut. You talk about temperament.\n\nYou know people are talking about diplomacy, or tone. You know Bush brings up tone all the time. Tone. We need strong tone. We\u2019re too far behind. We\u2019re behind. We\u2019re not winning. You know if we were winning we could sort of soften it up.\n\nBut you look at Putin can\u2019t stand Obama, and Obama can\u2019t stand him, in all fairness. But we don\u2019t get along with anybody anymore. Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of the country. The world came apart under her reign as Secretary of State.\n\nI want to ask you about the immigration plan you put out over the weekend. You had said in 2012 that Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cself-deportation\u201d comment was crazy and maniacal.\n\nWell I thought it was stupid. Who\u2019s going to self deport? It wasn\u2019t that it was a bad plan from any other standpoint. But you tell people, oh, self deport. To me that just means what, you\u2019re just going to walk across the border and say okay. They asked me to go. That\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nSo how does the deportation happen under \u2026\n\nWell what we\u2019re going to do\u2013we have a plan, and I think it\u2019s a really good plan. And by the way, it\u2019s been very well received and some of the candidates, my opponents I guess you could call them, but some of the candidates have said that\u2019s really what you want. I worked with a number of people on it including [Alabama] Senator [Jeff] Sessions, highly respected, and not known as a radical person at all. But we\u2019re going to have to \u2013 look, it\u2019s very simple. We either have a country or we don\u2019t.\n\nThe first thing I need is a wall, and I will build a wall. And you know that Hillary Clinton and almost everybody ten years ago wanted a wall built. Everybody wanted a wall built. But they couldn\u2019t do it because they don\u2019t know anything about building. They\u2019re throwing out numbers to build a wall. I\u2019ll build a far better wall, far higher, and just a much better\u2013that\u2019s what I do. I mean the thing I do best is build. Which is not bad to have as a president because our infrastructure in this country is also crumbling. But we\u2019ll build a great wall. It will be a very effective wall. And it will be done quickly and Mexico will pay for it.\n\nBut the next step, if I understand your plan correctly, is that even the hardworking good people who are here without papers \u2014\n\nThey\u2019re illegally here. They will leave, and they\u2019ll come back on an expedited basis if they\u2026And they will leave.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about 10% of California\u2019s workforce, maybe 13% \u2026\n\nDon\u2019t forget in the meantime we have a real unemployment rate that\u2019s probably 21%. It\u2019s not 6. I\u2019s not 5.2 and 5.5. Our real unemployment rate\u2013in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment\u2013because you have ninety million people that aren\u2019t working. Ninety-three million to be exact.\n\nIf you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%. We have a lot of room. We have a lot of people who want to work. But the good people I want them to come back. And I also want people of great talent to come to this country, to Silicon Valley for engineers. If you go to Harvard and you graduate number one in your class, and you\u2019re from China, they send you home, you can\u2019t get back into the country.\n\nSo you end up working for companies in China and fighting us. And they\u2019re competitors of us. They\u2019re trained in our schools. I want people like that to come into this country. And if they want, I want that path to citizenship for these people. So they go to our best schools, they\u2019re fabulous students, they do well, they\u2019re going to be great and we throw them out of the country. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nSo again, just talking about the hardworking peaceful undocumented immigrants here.\n\nIllegal immigrants, we\u2019re taking about the illegal. Do you know the word illegal? They go out \u2026\n\nBut do you forcibly remove them? I mean if they choose not to go, if they say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to go.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll all work out. It\u2019s called management. Politicians can\u2019t manage. All they can do is talk. It\u2019s called management. And we\u2019ll do an expedited system. Because I agree with you, there are some very, very good people here who they are here illegally.\n\nBut they are illegal. We have to strengthen our border. We have to have people come in legally. And we will work out an expedited system where the really good people can come back legally.\n\nIf you became president, what needs to change about about Super PACs and campaign financing? It\u2019s a system that you\u2019ve said is basically corrupt.\n\nWell I think this whole thing with PACs is nonsense. Because Jeb Bush puts his friend in charge of has PAC, and they don\u2019t talk\u2026.And he\u2019s going to work hard, as is Hillary Clinton. They all have their friends running the PACs. Now you\u2019re not supposed to talk, you\u2019re not supposed to \u2013 they go out and play golf, they get together, but they don\u2019t talk. Who believes that? So I want transparency. I don\u2019t mind the money coming in. Let it be transparent. Let them talk, but let there be total transparency.\n\nAre you willing to sign the \u201cNo New Taxes\u201d pledge of Grover Norquist?\n\nWell I\u2019m thinking about it but I have a problem because I may want to switch taxes around. I want to save the middle class. And I have hedge fund guys that are making a lot of money that aren\u2019t paying anything, okay. And I don\u2019t know how his pledge relates to that.\n\nBut I know a lot of bad people in this country that are making a hell of a lot of money and not paying taxes. And the tax law is totally screwed up. The complexity of it, the size of it. I mean I spent millions of dollars every year on lawyers and accountants just to do a tax return. And I want to put H&R Block out of business. I want to make it very simple. And we can leave the tax code the way it is and simplify it, or you could go to a form of a flat tax. You could go to a fair tax. There\u2019s a lot of things you could do.\n\nProbably the simplest is simplify the existing. Because we have other projects. We have to beat China. We have to beat Japan. We have to beat Mexico. We have to beat everybody that beating us, which is 100% of the countries that we do business with. We have a lot of other things to work on.\n\nAs president would you propose changes that increased the net amount of taxes?\n\nNo, because there\u2019s so much waste in Washington.\n\nYou\u2019ve written more on leadership than any of the other candidates. George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, who is a better leader?\n\nI wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Bush, as you know\u2026I thought he was lost. I thought he was not a great president\u2026He certainly wasn\u2019t a good president. He got us into Iraq which by itself was a disaster. He also caused toward the end of his thing a financial problem by allowing exploding mortgages and other things that I predicted. I said you\u2019re going to have a huge bubble here. We have another one coming up by the way. I predicted that. You have exploding mortgages. I understood. I made a lot of money because I went in and bought a lot of stuff at the low price after it exploded. But he really gave us Obama. Clinton had a lot of problems with the Monicas of the world and had he not had those problems he would have had a pretty good presidency. Not a great one but a pretty solid presidency. But that was a disaster and a tremendous distraction.\n\nAre there any of the current candidates who you would not consider as a vice presidential candidate?\n\nWell I don\u2019t want to say because \u2013 I will tell you when it\u2019s all over, win, lose or draw, I\u2019ll tell you who I respect, who I don\u2019t respect. I think the thing that I most \u2013 that I\u2019m very complimented by is that Rick Perry was doing really well, and then he decided he had to do better and he went after me and he went right down the tubes.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham was doing fine. Nobody got more publicity than this guy. He had zero. He\u2019s the only one that had zero. That means not one person in the whole country \u2013 he had zero. Like [former New York Gov. George] Pataki had zero but slightly more than that, right. He actually had a zero down today on the CNN.\n\nAnd these were the two guys that hit me very hard. And it was such a compliment to think \u2013 and now by the way Rand Paul\u2019s going down the tubes. Because all of a sudden he came out of nowhere and he hit me, and now he\u2019s \u2026 Now I hit back very hard. I think I hit back maybe sometimes harder than they hit me.\n\nBut I came out with a very strong statement about Rand Paul. First of all I think he\u2019s totally taking advantage of the people in Kentucky. Because one of these afterthought, if I don\u2019t win here I\u2019ll go back to you. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Somebody should primary him out. Because he can be beaten, believe me.\n\nSo he\u2019s done very poorly. And since he attacked me, he\u2019s gone down. And I\u2019m greatly honored by that, you know. I get attacked but somebody and they go down. I thought that a guy like Perry, he was getting so much publicity, he went to Washington, he read a speech, he did a whole big thing, it was all over the television. He went down. So that\u2019s a great honor.\n\nWhat happened with \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d?\n\n[NBC/Comcast Executives] came up to see me. And even after twelve years and fourteen seasons it was one of their most successful shows. It was a great success. And they tried to talk me into it and I just wouldn\u2019t do it. And I just wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t know this was going to happen, and they\u2019re impressed too. They probably didn\u2019t know this was going to happen either.\n\nDo you still retain an interest in the show?\n\nYeah I do. A big interest. So it\u2019s a very good question. When I say I\u2019m not doing another season, that\u2019s a lot of money. And even if you\u2019re a rich person, that\u2019s a lot of money to give up\u2026 They would have paid me whatever I wanted. So when I did this\u2026I turned down a deal last week in China, because I\u2019d have to go there. One of the biggest companies wanted me to do a deal in China. Guaranteed tens of millions of dollars. Turned it down because I can\u2019t go to China\u2026 I\u2019ve told my kids, this is going so wild. Let\u2019s see what happens.\n\nYou know I\u2019ve had great success. Even in golf I\u2019ve won many golf club championships. I don\u2019t know if you guys play golf. But to win a club championship is hard, literally hard. And you have to beat scratch players\u2026You got a lot of good players. I\u2019ve won many club championships. So my life has been about winning. My life has not been about losing. So I get a kick out of watching these guys who were not even successful people saying, \u201cOh, he\u2019s just having fun.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not having fun. Actually I could have more fun. I own here\u2019s a picture, I own Turnberry in Scotland that just hosted the Women\u2019s British Open. I wouldn\u2019t mind being at Turnberry. I may never see it again.\n\nAre you surprised by your position?\n\nSo I\u2019m a little surprised that it\u2019s gone with this speed. I don\u2019t expect to lose ever. But the speed is pretty rapid. You know. And unlike other people, I\u2019ve stayed in the position.\n\nWhy run for president this time? You\u2019ve decided against it in the past.\n\nSo it was really important that I do it, for myself\u2026I mean I really considered it strongly last time. Before that I thought about it. But I never even had any staff. My secretary was my staff. But the time I looked at it was less time. But I was very busy, I was doing tremendous developments which are now completed and very successful. Because we\u2019re all over the world. And I had a signed contract with \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d I would have had to break it. The other reason I wanted to do this for myself. I didn\u2019t want to look back in ten years and say I could have done that or I could have done that. My family would look at me and say, \u201cUgh, stop.\u201d I had to do it for myself.\n\nHow has this changed your life?\n\nSo I am enjoying it. And I think people see that\u2026I\u2019m watching my opponents. Certainly Hillary is not enjoying it, okay. She\u2019s going through something that for me, for me is Watergate. Her only hope is that because the prosecutors are Democrats she doesn\u2019t get prosecuted. That\u2019s the only hope she\u2019s got. Because what she did is wrong and what she did far worse than General Petraeus.\u2026And I saw her joke yesterday, it wasn\u2019t a joke \u2026 but it was sort of like you\u2019re laughing at people\u2019s faces when they say \u2013 and they automatically \u2013 you know by saying they were automatically deleted, right, you know she made that statement yesterday, by saying that you\u2019re almost saying that you deleted them on purpose\u2026.It was supposed to be a joke. It wasn\u2019t funny, but there was a lot into that if you think about it.\n\nA lot of your supporters are not wealthy. They can never imagine themselves in your shoes.\n\nAnd they like me.\n\nYou\u2019re not the average American in a way, you\u2019ve never been \u2013 but you connect with them. How do you explain that?\n\nActually, the funny thing is, I do worse with the wealthy people. Okay, it\u2019s funny in my opinion. Now, they\u2019ll all support me if I want them to, but I don\u2019t want them. If they want to send something, I don\u2019t care\u2026.I have a dot com. I had a woman send me $7 the other day. Another guy sent me $12. There was a long beautiful letter. I love that, because it\u2019s like they\u2019re investing. That\u2019s called a great thing. They\u2019re investing\u2026They\u2019re doing that because they\u2019re investing in the campaign and that I really do like. But somehow I related to exactly what you\u2019re saying, to the middle class, to the working person, and people don\u2019t understand.\n\nYou come in on a Boeing 757, then you get on a helicopter, and you go over to the fair, and you give the kids the rides, which the kids loved. But you land in this incredible Sikorsky, and people like it. I\u2019ve always felt that when Jimmy Carter would walk out of\u2014off Air Force One carrying his own suits and bags, I always said, that\u2019s not what the country wants\u2026 He would walk off Air Force One carrying his suit and his bag. He\u2019s the President of the United States, and he didn\u2019t want anybody to carry his stuff, because he thought, \u201cWhy should they? I can carry it myself.\u201d I always felt that\u2019s not what they want. They don\u2019t want that. They want someone who\u2019s going to beat China, beat Japan.\n\nI was in Los Angeles, I saw boats coming in with cars from Japan, the largest ships I\u2019ve ever seen, loaded to the gills, cars just pouring off, made in Japan. How does that help us, and we give them a fraction\u2014a tiny fraction\u2014and they don\u2019t even want it. Those days are gone. Those days will be gone. But we have to make ourselves wealthy again in order to save our country. We can\u2019t continuously lose money.\n\nHow do you view the state of the American banking system?\n\nWe\u2019re having a huge problem, again. You know you look at the junk. You know all the junk that\u2019s floating all over the place. You look at some of this Internet stuff that\u2019s floating all over. We\u2019re in a bubble again, okay. It\u2019s not \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you the problem with the banks, if you\u2019re really rich, like with me, if I want to borrow money I can buy all the money I want. But if there\u2019s a young Donald Trump that needs some money to do a couple of really good deals can\u2019t get it because the regulators are making it absolutely impossible for the banks to loan money.\n\nDo you want to repeal Dodd Frank and similar financial regulation reforms passed by President Obama?\n\nWell Dodd Frank is probably not a very good thing. There are aspects of it you could leave. But generally speaking Dodd Frank stifles business. It just totally stifles business.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you another subject that I\u2019m going to start talking about because nobody talks about it. Corporate inversion, where companies are going over to other places. You know it used to be they moved from New York to Florida, they moved from New Jersey to\u2026Pfizer is talking about moving to Ireland. Or someplace else. We\u2019re talking about Pfizer. Do you know how big that is? It would wipe out New Jersey. I mean that is a massive Merck.\n\nThey have $2.5 trillion sitting out of the country that they can\u2019t get back because they don\u2019t want to pay the tax. Nor would I. Everybody agrees that shouldn\u2019t happen. We should let them back in. Everybody. Even if you paid nothing it would be a good deal. Because they\u2019ll take that money then and use it for other things.\n\nBut they\u2019ll pay something. Ten percent, they\u2019ll pay something. Every Republican, every Democrat for years they have all agreed \u2026 They all agree. So now what\u2019s happening is companies are moving out to get their money. And they\u2019re moving out because they\u2019ll pay lower taxes. That\u2019s a huge problem.\n\nYou don\u2019t have any Cayman accounts?\n\nNo I don\u2019t. I could have.\n\nHave you ever, because you\u2019d benefit a lot I\u2019m sure.\n\nI could have and I said \u2013 I\u2019ve been thinking about doing this \u2013 that really hurt Romney in my book, when he set up these stupid accounts. In the end, when you do the Cayman accounts you don\u2019t gain that much.\n\nThe way you criticize the political process seems like the underlying theme of this campaign is that the people who are running stuff now are all phonies. That pretending it\u2019s something they can\u2019t actually do.\n\nThey can\u2019t do it.\n\nAnd they use pollsters to tell you what they think, that they\u2019re just not real. And then you\u2019re presenting yourself as the more authentic person. That\u2019s the underlying \u2014\n\nI\u2019m a person who\u2019s had great success in getting things done. They do use pollsters. I\u2019m much richer than all of them put together. I don\u2019t want to pay a pollster. They pay these pollsters a hundred thousand dollars a month for doing what?\n\nAnd then these guys come in and they want to be tough. Like Romney, but the time he got to the last debate he couldn\u2019t even talk. He was afraid to say anything.\n\nIn 2014, you had Republicans saying we\u2019re going to take back Congress, we need it. And they raised five hundred million dollars to do it. The first thing we\u2019re going to do is repeal Obamacare. And they haven\u2019t done it.\n\nThey joked. They couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nSo do you think that they\u2019re not honest?\n\nThey got elected on the basis. So they got in, something happened.\n\nAre they the real phonies though?\n\nLook, I was just as disappointed in the Republicans as I am the Democrats. I mean at least the Democrats you know where they\u2019re coming from. The Republicans \u2013 and many of them got elected on the basis of we\u2019re going to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like when they get to Washington, I will not let this happen to me. They\u2019re so enamored with the magnificence that they sort of say, \u201cOh, we can\u2019t do this. We can\u2019t do that.\u201d They become different. Does that make sense?\n\nIt\u2019s just so false and so phony and they can\u2019t move. It\u2019s moribund. They become weak and ineffective except at one thing: get themselves reelected\u2026I have friends who are in Congress and they run every two years. And good guys, I\u2019ve known then for a long time. As soon as that cycle is up, you know they win their election, then they take one day off and then the next day they start fundraising.\n\nAll they do it fundraise. They don\u2019t really govern. They just fundraise. Their whole life is raising money. And I say what percentage of the time you\u2019re raising money as opposed to legislating? \u2026I mean they\u2019re constantly \u2013 it\u2019s that time of year, you come in. I mean that\u2019s all they do is raise money.\n\nSo you say that they\u2019re puppets. You understand the game.\n\nThey\u2019re puppets. I\u2019m the only non-puppet in the group.\n\nWhat was the best example of something you got from a politician?\n\nWell I wasn\u2019t an asker. I would just give just in case. I would always be treated well. But I\u2019ll say this. If the Speaker of the House, somebody they come up to see you and they\u2019d like to know if you\u2019d make a contribution. It\u2019s not a lot of money.\n\nLet\u2019s say you say no. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t. I have great respect for you, I like you a lot. I will not make a contribution.\u201d \u201cOh, thank you Mr. Trump, thank you.\u201d Now let\u2019s say three years go by and I call, I need something from the Speaker of the House or I need something from somebody.\n\nWe\u2019re talking really human nature, okay. It\u2019s fairly hard. It\u2019s the rare politician that can do what\u2019s right in the face of massive contributions. And who can blame them. You could say you\u2019re disloyal. You can do whatever you want to say. But let\u2019s say you say no and then you call three years later. Nothing quid pro quo, none of that stuff. 100%.\n\nHillary\u2019s thing with the speeches is interesting because to me that\u2019s just as interesting as the emails. Because you look at the speeches and you look at the people who are paying all of that money for those speeches and then approvals of \u2026 going to be granted are granted. To me that\u2019s as big a deal. People have forgotten about that.\n\nWhat do you think of David Koch?\n\nYes, he\u2019s a member of my club. Well you saw my Tweets on David where all these guys \u2026 they\u2019re tying to get money and influence \u2026 He\u2019s a member of my club\u2026 Big guy. So is his brother, a big guy. And I think they\u2019re well meaning people too by the way. I think they\u2019re actually very well meaning people. But when I see all these guys running over to go get money \u2013 okay so when David calls and needs something do you think they\u2019re going to say no? Possible. It\u2019s just something that\u2019s pretty far out. It\u2019s pretty much impossible.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that you can\u2019t tear up an Iran deal on Day One.\n\nI\u2019m a deal maker, when a person makes a deal \u2026 But I\u2019ve taken on some really bad deals and made the other side suffer.\n\nDo your rivals who say they\u2019d tear up the deal understand how the world works?\n\nThey don\u2019t\u2026It\u2019s a terrible deal. But I would enforce that deal like they never saw \u2026 I\u2019d demand to go \u2013 and the twenty-four day thing is ridiculous. And the fact that we didn\u2019t get the prisoners back is ridiculous.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with it\u2026.I\u2019m a dealmaker\u2026There are things in the deal that I\u2019m sure Kerry doesn\u2019t even know about that I will find. And if they make a mistake they\u2019ve got big problems.\n\nWhat do your daughters give you a hard time about?\n\nI\u2019ve been very lucky, they\u2019re both smart and both went to the Wharton School. Tiffany goes to Penn and Ivanka went to the Wharton School, both very good students. Tiffany\u2019s got all A\u2019s, Ivanka the same, very good students.\n\nIvanka was interesting because I\u2019m very strong on women\u2019s health issues. And I couldn\u2019t believe what Bush said last week about he wouldn\u2019t fund, essentially wouldn\u2019t fund women\u2019s health issues. And I hit him hard. And she came back and she said I\u2019m so glad you did that Dad, because people don\u2019t know how you respect women, they don\u2019t know how you get it, and you have to get that word out.\n\nThere still seems to be a ceiling in the polls that there\u2019s a big chunk of the country who know you very well and don\u2019t want to see you in the Oval Office. How can you deal with that?\n\nWell they\u2019ve been saying the ceiling from the time I started in six. When I first got in it was six. Well that\u2019s the ceiling and he\u2019ll stay around there \u2026There was one poll that said thirty-two.\n\nPeople are surprised, it\u2019s the Tea Party but it\u2019s also straight across the board. It\u2019s men, it\u2019s women, it\u2019s a lot of Democrats. In fact \u2026 said you were better with the Democrats\u2026The states where they know me best there\u2019s a huge positive. In fact I had the biggest swing of anybody that they\u2019ve seen. You know what I mean, right?\n\nSo I think that\u2019s just a question of time. And I think that I will be the one to beat Hillary.\n\nYou\u2019d told people that Bill Clinton told you a third party ticket is possible.\n\nWell he\u2019d love that. I love a third party too. I think Bernie Sanders should run on the Green Party. I think that Bernie Sanders should run. I would love to see Bernie Sanders\u2026Now look, I\u2019m running as a Republican. I\u2019m running as a Republican \u2026 And honestly they\u2019ve been treating me fairly. I don\u2019t want nice or anything I just want fair. They\u2019ve been very fair.\n\nBoth parties approval ratings are falling even as yours have gone up. What\u2019s the problem?\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think the people running for office are real. Because Jeb Bush and others will come out against women\u2019s health issues because \u2013 and then he\u2019ll say he misspoke. You\u2019ll see that. He misspoke. Five hours late he comes in with the opposite\u2026I really think they have to throw a lot of their consultants away and just be themselves. I think it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s helped me. You know, I\u2019m a smart person. I don\u2019t have somebody telling me what I should say.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to go against myself either when I believe in something. Because that\u2019s false. I saw it today with \u2026 you saw it big league with [Wisconsin Gov. Scott] Walker today. When he made a statement based on my immigration plan and then his consultants said you\u2019ve got to change that. But I think they would do better if they were themselves.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s any chance watching what has happened with you, that here will be a wave of authenticity?\n\nI think that\u2019s what they need. There\u2019s so little authenticity in many of the people that I\u2019m watching. And that includes the other side. Hillary. I mean it certainly includes Hillary\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s the most significant learning experience in your life?\n\nLook, I do say this. Just in watching \u2013 I give speeches on success for friends and for charities. I put the money into charity. And they pay me a lot. I will say this, over my lifetime I\u2019ve seen a lot of very smart people who were quitters. They never made it. And I\u2019ve seen people that weren\u2019t as smart who never ever, ever gave up. And those were the people that made it. And I\u2019ve seen it to this day. I\u2019ve seen people that graduated \u2026 in school who were super geniuses. And they never made it. And I\u2019ve seen people that were not as smart as them and they\u2019re the biggest people out there. And the ones that are the biggest people are the people that never gave up. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve just observed over the years.\n\nSo I take it you\u2019re not giving up.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t give up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an interview with TIME, the leading Republican candidate talks about what's wrong with the Clintons, his opponents' weaknesses and what it takes to be great", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In an interview with TIME, the leading Republican candidate talks about what's wrong with the Clintons, his opponents' weaknesses and what it takes to be great", "title": "Donald Trump Explains All", "url": "http://time.com/4003734/donald-trump-interview-transcript/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/trump-cover-final.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/trump-cover-final.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "In an interview with TIME, the leading Republican candidate talks about what's wrong with the Clintons, his opponents' weaknesses and what it takes to be great", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump Explains All"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016, bill clinton, donald trump, hillary clinton, republicans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Republicans, presidential campaign, 2016"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ll tell you another subject that I\u2019m going to start talking about because nobody talks about it.\nBecause Jeb Bush puts his friend in charge of has PAC, and they don\u2019t talk\u2026.And he\u2019s going to work hard, as is Hillary Clinton.\nBut they couldn\u2019t do it because they don\u2019t know anything about building.\nAnd you know that Hillary Clinton and almost everybody ten years ago wanted a wall built.\nSo they go to our best schools, they\u2019re fabulous students, they do well, they\u2019re going to be great and we throw them out of the country."}
