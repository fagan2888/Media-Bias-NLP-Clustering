This could lead to higher costs and wasted medications, according to the pharmacies that signed the Oct. 24 letter. The practice also flies in the face of the Affordable Care Act's short-cycle dispensing program, they argue. They say a better system would be to pay pharmacies a \u201cflat, professional fee\u201d for each prescription that is filled.\n\n\u201cTying the professional fee to the amount of medication dispensed ignores the clinical oversight necessary to provide care under the unique CMS requirements for LTC pharmacies,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe letter was addressed to Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) and applauded the Medicare Efficient Drug Dispensing Act of 2013. Cardin and Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) introduced the bill last month. It would prohibit the reimbursement structure that the pharmacies oppose.\n\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, according to the Senior Care Pharmacy Alliance. The organization says it will work with committee members to advance the legislation.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Ben Cardin, Long-term Care Pharmacies, Medicare Efficient Drug Dispensing Act Of 2013, Short-Cycle Dispensing", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "Nearly 500 long-term care pharmacies signed a letter urging Congress to prohibit certain Medicare reimbursement practices, the Senior Care Pharmacy Alliance announced Thursday.", "title": "Long-term care pharmacy association presses Congress for flat-fee prescribing", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/long-term-care-pharmacy-association-presses-congress-for-flat-fee-prescribing/article/317870/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/08/18/mcklogo_818012.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly 500 long-term care pharmacies signed a letter urging Congress to prohibit certain Medicare reimbursement practices, the Senior Care Pharmacy Alliance announced Thursday.", "creator": "@@TimMullaneyLTC", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary", "title": "Long-term care pharmacy association presses Congress for flat-fee prescribing"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Short-Cycle Dispensing", "published_time": "2013-10-25T06:30:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T18:03:52"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Nearly 500 long-term care pharmacies signed a letter urging Congress to prohibit certain Medicare reimbursement practices, the Senior Care Pharmacy Alliance announced Thursday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb7a\"", "article_summary": "Long-term care pharmacy association presses Congress for flat-fee prescribingShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintNearly 500 long-term care pharmacies signed a letter urging Congress to prohibit certain Medicare reimbursement practices, the Senior Care Pharmacy Alliance announced Thursday.\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, according to the Senior Care Pharmacy Alliance.\nThis could lead to higher costs and wasted medications, according to the pharmacies that signed the Oct. 24 letter.\nThe practice also flies in the face of the Affordable Care Act's short-cycle dispensing program, they argue.\nThe letter was addressed to Sen.
