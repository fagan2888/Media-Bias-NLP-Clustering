A new study says it\u2019s not likely to ever attract even 15 million. Even for government work, that\u2019s a big miss.\n\nPresident Obama has been bragging about ObamaCare\u2019s great \u201csuccesses\u201d in the run-up to its sixth anniversary, including the claim that 20 million have gained coverage (highly dubious) and that health care inflation is low (which has little to do with the law).\n\nBut as the years progress, it\u2019s the failings of ObamaCare that have become more apparent.\n\nThe latest evidence of this is from a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2014 which has been supportive of the law \u2014 that says overall paid enrollment is likely to top out at 14.7 million.\n\nThat\u2019s almost 10 million shy of what the Congressional Budget Office had originally projected ObamaCare would enroll. And it means that ObamaCare will only sign up about half of the \u201cpotential market.\u201d\n\nAnd, to add further perspective, there were 15 million people who bought individual insurance plans before ObamaCare, a number that Obama himself once dismissed as an insignificant 5% of the insurance market.\n\nKaiser says one reason for the sharp drop in enrollment expectations is that employers aren\u2019t dumping as many people into the exchanges as the CBO had expected. But that\u2019s a marginal reason at best, since the CBO originally expected few to lose work-based coverage as a result of the law.\n\nMany also continue to buy plans outside the exchanges, the report says. That\u2019s another sign of ObamaCare\u2019s failure, since the exchanges were billed as a fantastic new service that would let consumers easily compare plans, a la Travelocity.\n\nKaiser does finally get around to the nut of the problem with ObamaCare: affordability.\n\nEven though the official name of the law is the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d Kaiser says that \u201cthe overwhelming reason why people who are uninsured say they are uncovered is cost.\u201d In fact, most of the uninsured said they tried to get a plan but found it too expensive.\n\nThat\u2019s backed up by a recent survey sponsored by National Public Radio and the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation. Among its startling findings, 34% say the cost of health care has gotten less affordable over the past two years, compared with just 9% who say it\u2019s more affordable. Forty-five percent say premiums have gone up, compared with 4% who said insurance is cheaper.\n\nThe kicker is the survey\u2019s finding that 25% of Americans say ObamaCare has \u201cdirectly hurt\u201d them, compared with 15% who say it\u2019s \u201cdirectly helped.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that if few sign up for ObamaCare plans, the markets will remain unstable and will be less attractive for private insurers.\n\nAdd to all this the billions wasted on failed insurance co-ops and failed state exchanges, the skyrocketing premiums, rising deductibles, access problems for those with ObamaCare plans, big insurance losses, and the fact that ObamaCare will still leave tens of million uninsured.\n\nNo wonder the administration has to make things up about ObamaCare to brag about.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By now, ObamaCare was supposed to have 21 million enrollees.
