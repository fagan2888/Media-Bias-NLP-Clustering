U.S. Ebola patients expected to return to the U.S. for treatment

Two American missionaries stricken with Ebola in Liberia are expected to be flown back to the U.S. Both patients — Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol — are in stable but grave condition. One will be treated at Emory University near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. They would be the first Ebola patients in the U.S.; CDC officials said the outbreak could worsen in West Africa but is unlikely to threaten the U.S.
