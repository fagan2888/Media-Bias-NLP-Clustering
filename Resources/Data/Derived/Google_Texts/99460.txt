Two new Hillary Clinton ads released Wednesday attack Sen. Bernie Sanders for his views, saying he wants to dismantle Obamacare, and framing him as an idealist.

“The American people can’t afford to wait for ideas that sound on paper but will never make it in the real world,” says Hillary in an ad titled “Real Progress Now.”

In another ad titled “Make a Difference” a voice-over says, “[Hillary] will build on Obamacare, not start over.” This has been a frequent attack by her campaign on Sanders, as he seeks to replace the Affordable Care Act with a single-payer universal healthcare system.

The ad continues to assault Sanders for calling Planned Parenthood “establishment,” and claims that Sanders protects “gun lobby.”
