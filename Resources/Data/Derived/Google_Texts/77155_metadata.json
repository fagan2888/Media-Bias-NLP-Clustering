It only applied to group practices of 100 or more eligible professionals last year, and to groups of 10 or more this year. Next year, it will apply to all physicians and physician groups.Under the VBM program, physician payments are adjusted up or down based on how they score on quality and cost-effectiveness measures. Providers' raises this year are based on 2014 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) data.Another 5,418 medical groups and their 131,084 physicians will incur a 2% pay cut for not submitting PQRS data. Finally, 59 groups composed of more than 10,000 physicians, will also see a pay decrease of 1% or 2% this year because their PQRS data didn't score high enough for a bump.The groups will start seeing the adjustments on their claims within the next six weeks, the CMS said.The remaining 8,208 U.S. medical groups, which comprise 314,546 physicians, will see their Medicare rates remain the same, since their quality data were neither good nor bad enough to warrant a reimbursement change.Last year, when VBM evaluation was optional, 127 groups submitted evaluation data. Of those, 106 met the requirements to calculate cost and quality information, according to the CMS. Ultimately, 81 practices received no additional adjustment, and 14 practices qualified for a raise.The fact that so few practices benefit from VBM could indicate an inherent flaw in the program's methodology, said Anders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs for the Medical Group Management Association.\u201cThese results show that getting a reimbursement increase is akin to winning the lottery,\u201d Gilberg said. \u201cThis just isn't a meaningful system.\u201dFor the American Medical Group Association, the results raise more questions than answers, said David Introcaso, senior director for regulatory and public policy with the trade group. He wondered why so many practices failed to submit the minimal PQRS data required for evaluation. He said he hoped the findings will serve as a wake-up call for those organizations.A CMS spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "For the second year in a row, few provider practices benefited from the CMS' value-based payment modifier program, according to agency data.", "title": "Medicare value-based purchasing bonuses go to handful of eligible practices", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "For the second year in a row, few provider practices benefited from the CMS' value-based payment modifier program, according to agency data.", "title": "Medicare value-based purchasing bonuses go to just 128 of 13,000 eligible practices", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160310/NEWS/160319986", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "For the second year in a row, few provider practices benefited from the CMS' value-based payment modifier program, according to agency data.", "title": "Medicare value-based purchasing bonuses go to just 128 of 13,000 eligible practices", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160310/NEWS/160319986", "published_at": "2016-03-10", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "He wondered why so many practices failed to submit the minimal PQRS data required for evaluation.\nIt only applied to group practices of 100 or more eligible professionals last year, and to groups of 10 or more this year.\nProviders' raises this year are based on 2014 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) data.Another 5,418 medical groups and their 131,084 physicians will incur a 2% pay cut for not submitting PQRS data.\nOf those, 106 met the requirements to calculate cost and quality information, according to the CMS.\nNext year, it will apply to all physicians and physician groups.Under the VBM program, physician payments are adjusted up or down based on how they score on quality and cost-effectiveness measures."}
