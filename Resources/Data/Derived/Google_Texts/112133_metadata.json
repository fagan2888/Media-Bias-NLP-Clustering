Because sleep apnea is associated with being overweight, the participants were matched for B.M.I., among many other characteristics. The study is in Arthritis & Rheumatology.\n\nAfter one year, compared with controls, people with sleep apnea were about 50 percent more likely to have had an attack of gout, and the increased risk was found without regard to sex, age or obesity.\n\nThe conclusion suggests that treating sleep apnea would reduce gout attacks, but the lead author, Yuqing Zhang, a professor of medicine at Boston University, is cautious.\n\n\u201cOur findings call for future studies to evaluate the effect of treating sleep apnea on serum uric acid levels and the risk of gout,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151022105545, "BN": "well", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/live", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 22, 2015", "keywords": "Apnea (Sleep Disorder),Arthritis,Gout,Sleep,Featured,Live,Mind,Sleep", "GBLC": "Featured;Live;Mind;Sleep", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Sleep Apnea Is Tied to Gout ( 20151022 )", "description": "People with sleep apnea were 50 percent more likely to have had a gout attack than those without the disease, independent of sex, age or obesity.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Nicholas Bakalar", "SCG": "well", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Nicholas Bakalar", "byl": "Nicholas Bakalar", "twitter": {"description": "People with sleep apnea were 50 percent more likely to have had a gout attack than those without the disease, independent of sex, age or obesity.", "title": "Sleep Apnea Is Tied to Gout", "url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/sleep-apnea-is-tied-to-gout/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-risks/well-risks-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "news_keywords": "Arthritis,Gout,Sleep,Sleep apnea", "CG": "Health", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 22, 2015", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "Sleep", "published_time": 1445525745, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T14:55:45-04:00"}, "utime": 20151022145545, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151022, "pdate": 20151022, "des": "Apnea (Sleep Disorder);Arthritis;Gout;Sleep", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-risks/well-risks-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Well", "description": "People with sleep apnea were 50 percent more likely to have had a gout attack than those without the disease, independent of sex, age or obesity.", "title": "Sleep Apnea Is Tied to Gout", "url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/sleep-apnea-is-tied-to-gout/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-risks/well-risks-superJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/sleep-apnea-is-tied-to-gout/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Sleep Apnea Is Tied to Gout", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-risks/well-risks-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c18\"", "article_summary": "Observational studies have shown that people with sleep apnea have a higher prevalence of excess uric acid, but until now it has been unclear whether sleep apnea is associated with gout, and how strongly.\nThe conclusion suggests that treating sleep apnea would reduce gout attacks, but the lead author, Yuqing Zhang, a professor of medicine at Boston University, is cautious.\n\u201cOur findings call for future studies to evaluate the effect of treating sleep apnea on serum uric acid levels and the risk of gout,\u201d he said.\nBecause sleep apnea is associated with being overweight, the participants were matched for B.M.I., among many other characteristics.\nUsing records in a British health database, researchers studied 9,865 people, average age 54, with sleep apnea and matched them to 43,598 controls without the disorder."}
