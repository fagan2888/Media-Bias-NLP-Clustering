He won re-election with increasing margins of victory.\n\nWhen Levin, now 80, announced last spring he would not seek a seventh term, Republicans saw it as an opportunity to gain a U.S. Senate seat, while Democrats strategized to ensure the seat stays blue.\n\nDemocrats choice: Gary Peters, a metro Detroit Congressman who had won highly competitive elections. The first Republican to announce was former Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, who had been elected twice to statewide office. Despite speculation about other candidates, no one else declared.\n\nNeither candidate faced a primary challenge, so for the past six months, the candidates have been making their pitches on why they should replace Levin as the next U.S. Senator from the Great Lakes state.\n\nAlso running for the U.S. Senate are third party candidates Jim Fulner (Libertarian), Chris Wahmhoff (Green) and Richard A. Matkin (U.S. Taxpayers).\n\nAttention on the election\n\nBoth Land and Peters have been in politics and government for the past 20 years and are known by members of their party.\n\nLand was Kent County Clerk before serving as Secretary of State for 8 years. The Byron Center Republican served as a Republican National Committeewoman.\n\nPeters served in the State Senate before running for Attorney General in 2002, losing to Mike Cox. In 2008, he ran for Congress and beat the Republican incumbent, Joel Knollenberg.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u2022 5 things you didn't know about Gary Peters\n\n\u2022 5 things you didn't know about Terri Lynn Land\n\nThe race started competitive, but recent polls have shown Peters with a lead. Still, the election is not a sure win for either candidate, as seen by the big names who have come out to campaign for the candidates: Mitt Romney stumped for Terri Lynn Land and First Lady Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton are campaigning for Peters.\n\nOutside spending and influence have been strong in the race. A television ad has run, on average, every two minutes in Michigan. Some $282.8 million has been spent on the ads, according to an analysis by the the Center for Public Integrity. Michigan has the third highest amount of money spent in any U.S. Senate race across the country.\n\nBut for voters, there have been no debates and few joint appearances where they can see how the candidates differ on the issues.\n\nApproving Supreme Court justices\n\nThe U.S. Senate is often called the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\u201d\n\nFirst, it\u2019s difficult to get elected: each state has just two members, compared to the 435 House representatives, which are divided by each state\u2019s population.\n\nThe U.S. Senate also has some unique powers, including confirming presidential appointees, such as Supreme Court Justices, members of the cabinet and ambassadors.\n\nThe Supreme Court could be one of the most important, since the 9-member body is the final interpreter of laws. Such landmark cases include striking down segregation laws, allowing abortion to be a legal right and, most recently, upholding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen asked last week if the current court is too liberal, too conservative or just right, Land said she will take it up when it comes around and does not have a litmus test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important someone understands the constitution and that it's a number one priority,\u201d Land said in a different interview with MLive.\n\nPeters said he has concerns with some of the recent rulings the court has made, including Citizens United, which allows corporations to spend unlimited money on campaigns. He'd like to have justices who understand \u201cmoney is not speech.\u201d\n\nLike Land, Peters said he does not have a litmus test when it comes to deciding who should approved for the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to speculate,\u201d Peters said, \u201cyou have to look at the nominees as they come up and evaluate their credentials.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act and health care\n\nAn issue that has been at the heart of several elections in the past few years has been the Affordable Care Act. As the exchange is entering its second year in Michigan, people still have questions about how the law could impact them.\n\nIf elected, Land said she would vote to repeal the law.\n\n\u201cObamacare has been a disaster,\u201d Land said on Michigan Radio\u2019s program Michigan Calling earlier this month, saying it has increased costs for some people and contributed to canceled plans.\n\n\u201cWe need to repeal and replace it, look at all the aspects of the healthcare plan,\u201d Land added.\n\nWhen asked about specific components of a replacement plan, Land said it should be up to the patient to have their own private healthcare or through their employer. She has also said people should be able to transfer plans between jobs and across state lines.\n\nLand said many people in Michigan have lost their plans because of the law, she said.\n\nSome health plans that did not meet essential service standards under the law will be phased out. In Michigan, an estimated 225,000 residents said they received discontinuation notices from their insurers late last year, but their plans were extended for a year to provide breathing room for the changes.\n\nOn these and others problems with the law, Peters said the government should work to correct those problems and not repeal the law.\n\n\u201cWe got to keep it in place and continue to move forward to make it better and to fix it,\u201d Peters said on the same Michigan Radio program in August.\n\nPeters said he would vote for the ACA again because it has given more people coverage in Michigan. As of Sept. 30, 406,000 people have enrolled in the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never voted for a perfect bill,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI never will vote for a perfect bill.\u201d\n\nISIS\n\nOne of the largest foreign policy issues of the year has been the growth of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The group has killed thousands and beheaded two American journalists.\n\nBefore going on recess before the election, Congress approved funding to arm Syrian rebels to fight against the Islamic State.\n\nPeters voted for the legislation, and said the U.S. needs to move forward with the plan, including airstrikes. Also, he said, the United States need to be aggressive in getting Sunni religious and government leaders to condemn ISIS and act against the group.\n\n\u201cBut it has to come from Sunni religious leaders,\u201d Peters said.\n\nLand said she would have voted for the request, but added that Obama needs to do more to combat the group.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to come up with a clear and concise plan,\u201d Land said.\n\nNeither Peters or Land think there should combat troops on the ground fighting against ISIS.\n\nWhat could happen in the next 4 weeks\n\nThe race was once seen as potentiality one of the most competitive in the country, with several election forecasting websites calling it a \u201ctoss up.\u201d But in the past two months, several have said it could be a likely win for Democrats.\n\nPeters has led most major polls since April, and the past 8 polls has Peters up an average of 7.8 percentage points, according to Real Clear Politics.\n\nMany Michigan political pundits have said Land will have a difficult time to win the race in the coming weeks, unless something happens to change the mood nationally.\n\nTJ Bucholz, a Democratic political consultant with Vanguard Public Affairs, has said the U.S. Senate is the most interesting and heated race in the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has disappointed voters,\u201d said Bucholz, who said the \u201cpublic is starting to accept Gary Peters\u2019 narrative more than they are Terri Lynn Land\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRecent polling shows that it will be hard for Land to make up ground.\n\nTom Shields, a Republican political consultant with the Marketing Resource Group, agreed it'll be difficult for Land to pull out a win.\n\nShe needs to find issues that resonate with voters, he said. So far, she has been \u201call over the map\u201d on issues and not effective.\n\n\u201cShe needs something to put a spark in the campaign that makes people give her a second look,\u201d said Shields.\n\nThere have been examples in the past, Shields said, where candidates have been able to make up ground, including John Engler who beat James Blanchard after being down in the polls.\n\nIn the Senate race, Shields said nothing prevents independent voters from switching support from Peters to Land, but she needs to come up with something that excites voters.\n\n\u201cYou can lose September and win October, and still win the game,\u201d Shields said, \u201cbut you have to be in the game.\u201d\n\nFritz Klug is a news buzz reporter for MLive.
