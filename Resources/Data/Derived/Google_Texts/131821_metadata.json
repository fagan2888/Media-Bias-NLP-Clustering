Wayne Lukas long ago reached the age where it\u2019s acceptable to sleep in, play a round of golf on a weekday afternoon or take a cruise to the Caribbean.\n\nNone of these activities appeal to the Hall of Fame trainer.\n\nLukas was sitting at the Pimlico Stakes Barn on Saturday morning, wearing his trademark boots and 10-gallon hat around nine hours before he was slated to saddle Mr. Z for the Preakness.\n\nLukas, 79, has absolutely no thought of riding into retirement.\n\n\u201cNot even remotely,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my sanctuary. This is my life. There\u2019s no reason for me not to do this.\n\n\u201cWhat the (heck) am I going to do? I\u2019m terrible at golf. I\u2019m not wired to sit around. My wife said, \u2018Well, maybe we should take a trip.\u2019 I said, \u2018Turn on the Discovery Channel.\u2019 It isn\u2019t in my makeup.\u201d\n\nThere once was a time when he did it all, but his responsibilities have changed over the years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a mental job in a lot of ways,\u201d he said. \u201cI have great help. If the straw comes in, I don\u2019t unload it. My expertise is in making executive decisions. If my health is good and my mind doesn\u2019t leave me, I should be getting better at it when I\u2019m 90.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that many of his peers put in more time at the track.\n\n\u201cI get up at 3:30 every single day of my life and I never miss going to the barn,\u201d he said. \u201cMy colleague and good friend Bob Baffert didn\u2019t even show up this morning. He\u2019s not even here at all. And he\u2019ll be the one to beat today. So there\u2019s a lot of ways to go about this. But for me, I\u2019m more comfortable right here.\u201d\n\nLukas was looking for his seventh Preakness win. He captured the first in 1980 with Codex and pulled off a surprise with Oxbow in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much about us or even the jockeys,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the owners. The big thing for me as a trainer is that I give them the opportunity to have a great day.\u201d\n\nINFIELD FRIENDLY\n\nThe Pimlico infield was all about drinking beer, listening to live music, flirting and making bets.\n\nThe rioting and looting that occurred in Baltimore weeks earlier apparently did not play into any of this.\n\n\u201cI was concerned, but not overly concerned,\u201d said John Cacciutti, 23, who came down from Philadelphia. \u201cI was coming down either way.\u201d\n\nCacciutti paid $80 in advance for a ticket and unlimited refills on his beer mug. It was his first Preakness.\n\nJoe Kimsal, 47, was pleasantly surprised at the environment in the city.\n\n\u201cI was downtown last night, and everyone was getting along,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was if nothing happened.\u201d\n\nKimsal, who also came down from Pennsylvania, bought his ticket in advance, but never considered staying home.\n\n\u201cWhen that stuff was going down I was a little worried,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cbut we were coming down even if we had to put helmets on.\u201d\n\nHECK WITH HISTORY\n\nAmerican Pharoah came into the Preakness looking to keep alive his bid to become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.\n\nFiring Line trainer Simon Callaghan planned to do his best to prevent American Pharoah from adding his name to an exclusive list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely hard thing to achieve, the Triple Crown, the way the races are structured so closely together,\u201d Callaghan said. \u201cYou need a lot of luck and a really good, tough, durable horse. We\u2019re certainly going to be trying our very best not to let that happen this year.\u201d\n\nUnlike Lukas, who\u2019s been coming to Baltimore for decades, this was Callaghan\u2019s first visit and first Preakness.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a young guy down here with Firing Line, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s in for,\u201d Lukas said. \u201cExperience is paramount here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "D.
