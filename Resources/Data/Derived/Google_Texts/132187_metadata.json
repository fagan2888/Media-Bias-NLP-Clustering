an April 2014 presidential memorandum that forced the Department of Labor to propose a rule requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to submit summary data on employee compensation by sex and race to advance pay equality; and most recently, an order that would require federal contractors to report past labor law violations.\n\nIndustry groups contend the proposed rule from the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council would blacklist companies from procuring federal contracts.\n\nWhile the groups have openly expressed support for some and raised major concerns about others, they said the executive orders overall have significantly increased the costs of doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cAs efforts continue across the administration, and within our member companies, to expand the broad diversity of firms willing and able to support the government and to bring real innovation to bear for our nation, these unique and costly government-unique regulations simply raise an already substantial barrier between the commercial and government marketplaces,\u201d the letter said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The groups say Obama has issued 12 executive orders pertaining to contracting.", "description": "The groups say Obama has issued 12 executive orders pertaining to contracting.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The groups say Obama has issued 12 executive orders pertaining to contracting.", "title": "Trade groups ask White House to stop creating regs for contractors", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/250946-trade-groups-ask-wh-to-hold-up-on-executive-orders", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/whitehouse_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-12T14:01:23-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-12T14:01-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/250946-trade-groups-ask-wh-to-hold-up-on-executive-orders", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-12T13:32-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Government, Politics, Private military contractors, Executive branch of the United States government, Executive Order, United States federal law, Government procurement in the United States,Valerie Jarrett, Denis McDonough,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-12T13:32:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T14:01:23-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/250946-trade-groups-ask-wh-to-hold-up-on-executive-orders", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The groups say Obama has issued 12 executive orders pertaining to contracting.", "card": "summary", "title": "Trade groups ask White House to stop creating regs for contractors"}, "dcterms.title": "Trade groups ask White House to stop creating regs for contractors"}, "article_summary": "Trade associations want the White House to stop issuing executive actions that take aim at federal contracting.\nIndustry groups contend the proposed rule from the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council would blacklist companies from procuring federal contracts.\nWhile the groups have openly expressed support for some and raised major concerns about others, they said the executive orders overall have significantly increased the costs of doing business with the government.\nIn a letter to senior White House officials, the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), the Aerospace Industries Association, the Professional Services Council and the Information Technology Industry Council asked that \u201cno further presidential directives primarily focused on government contractors be issued for the foreseeable future.\u201dADVERTISEMENTSince 2009, the groups said, President Obama has issued 12 executive orders pertaining to government contracting, which have resulted in 16 new regulations.\n\u201cAs efforts continue across the administration, and within our member companies, to expand the broad diversity of firms willing and able to support the government and to bring real innovation to bear for our nation, these unique and costly government-unique regulations simply raise an already substantial barrier between the commercial and government marketplaces,\u201d the letter said."}
