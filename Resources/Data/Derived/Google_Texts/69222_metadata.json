In the potential three-way race, Johnson garnered 11 percent of the vote, and, perhaps surprisingly, had a (slightly) more detrimental effect on Clinton than on Trump.\n\nMonmouth also tested a potential three-way race involving Clinton, Trump, and former GOP governor, now Libertarian, Gary Johnson. In this hypothetical contest, Clinton earns 42% of the vote \u2013 down 6 points from the two-person race \u2013 and Trump gets 34% \u2013 down 4 points from the two-person race. Johnson takes 11%. In this contest, Clinton maintains her swing state lead \u2013 44% to 37% for Trump and 9% for Johnson \u2013 while her leaning state lead narrows \u2013 43% to 34% for Trump and 9% for Johnson. Johnson gets his highest vote share \u2013 15% \u2013 in the red states. Johnson is largely an unknown commodity. Just 9% have a favorable opinion of him and 15% an unfavorable opinion, while 3-in-4 (76%) don\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\nInteresting. Obviously, while this is a single poll, it's still really interesting to see a Libertarian Party candidate poll so well. Johnson was well-received by the mostly conservative attendees at CPAC, yet only chipped away from Trump's numbers by four percent. Johnson had previously set a record for the number of votes received by a Libertarian Party candidate in 2012, and it's increasingly likely that he could duplicate that success in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interesting. .05/27/2016 8:11:41AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Interesting.", "title": "Gary Johnson Polling in Double-Digits Against Trump and Hillary", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/25/gary-johnson-polling-in-doubledigits-against-trump-and-hillary-n2138829", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/182/f6e9a0c3-b757-4398-9be6-00944e627272.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Interesting.", "title": "Gary Johnson Polling in Double-Digits Against Trump and Hillary", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/25/gary-johnson-polling-in-doubledigits-against-trump-and-hillary-n2138829", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/182/f6e9a0c3-b757-4398-9be6-00944e627272.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Gary Johnson Polling in Double-Digits Against Trump and Hillary, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, is polling in double digits against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a new Monmouth University poll.\nMonmouth also tested a potential three-way race involving Clinton, Trump, and former GOP governor, now Libertarian, Gary Johnson.\nObviously, while this is a single poll, it's still really interesting to see a Libertarian Party candidate poll so well.\nIn the potential three-way race, Johnson garnered 11 percent of the vote, and, perhaps surprisingly, had a (slightly) more detrimental effect on Clinton than on Trump.\nIn this hypothetical contest, Clinton earns 42% of the vote \u2013 down 6 points from the two-person race \u2013 and Trump gets 34% \u2013 down 4 points from the two-person race."}
