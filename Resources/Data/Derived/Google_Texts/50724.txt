The special effects may have been phenomenal — Oscar winning, even — but there are some serious scientific (and cinematic) flaws in the Academy Award winning movie “Gravity.”

The folks at Cinema Sins are no stranger to nit-picking films, but for “Gravity” they brought in none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson, as their space expert.

Back in October, Tyson let off a series of tweets critiquing the movie — everything from its title to the movie’s science. Now teamed up with Cinema Sins, those tweets have been brought to life and apparently narrated by Tyson himself. The video, which contains spoilers abound, can be viewed below:
