Instead, the state is pursuing a \u201cdual track,\u201d working to adapt software used in other states, while preparing to join the federal Healthcare.gov insurance marketplace in case that effort fails.\n\nThe \u201ccritical checkpoint\u201d with the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in July will start to clarify the most likely route. If state and federal officials conclude that the state-based website is progressing well, the Connector will continue on the dual track. If not, it will focus on preparing to join the federal marketplace for one year.\n\nMaydad Cohen, special adviser to the governor, told the Connector\u2019s board Thursday that the first version of the software, developed by the Virginia technology company hCentive, will be completed by June 30. Cohen has replaced Sarah Iselin, an insurance executive hired temporarily to oversee website repairs; Iselin returned to the private sector last month.\n\nJean Yang, the Connector\u2019s executive director, said federal officials this week approved extending through December the temporary programs: Commonwealth Care \u2014 a subsidized-insurance program that was supposed to shut down last year because it did not match the requirements of the Care Act \u2014 and Medicaid coverage for people whose eligibility for subsidized insurance could not be determined because of the Connector site\u2019s troubles. The programs were set to expire on June 30.\n\nThe temporary Medicaid program has enrolled 227,374 people whose eligibility could not be verified. Glen Shor, Connector board chairman and state secretary of administration and finance, estimated that 99 percent of those enrollees are in fact eligible for either subsidized insurance coverage or Medicaid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the board that despite the inability to enroll people in the expected programs, the aggregate spending \u201cclosely matches\u201d budget projections. Neither MassHealth (the state\u2019s Medicaid program) nor the Connector will need to ask the Legislature for additional money to cover care, Shor said.\n\nThe Connector has enrolled 296,686 new members since December, mostly using paper forms and other workarounds.\n\nWhile Connector officials expressed optimism about their progress with hCentive, preparations to join the federal marketplace are also moving along smoothly, Ashley Hague, deputy executive director, told the board. The only glitch with using Healthcare.gov is an inability, so far, to provide state subsidies along with federal subsidies, she said. The hCentive software is able to integrate the state subsidies.\n\nThe total cost of the \u201cdual track\u201d approach was estimated last month at $121 million. Since then, the Connector has identified $40 million in federal grants that could be \u201crepurposed\u201d to support this effort. It remains unclear what the total bill will be, nor how much of the cost will be borne by the federal government and how much by the state.\n\nLora Pellegrini, president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said that many of the people temporarily enrolled in Medicaid probably belong in private coverage, paying premiums. Additionally they are all in fee-for-service Medicaid, missing out on disease management programs that managed-care plans provide. \u201cThat\u2019s why we think it\u2019s important to get those folks into permanent coverage as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur plans need to very quickly have one path to pursue. . . . We were very committed to health care reform and we\u2019re very committed to seeing this through, but obviously it\u2019s not what we expected to be doing in 2014,\u201d Pelligrini said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.4227063352", "eomportal-id": 601351, "description": "An assessment of the new software for the Massachusetts Health Connector website, set for early July, will provide the first read on whether the state is likely to succeed at running its own health insurance marketplace in 2015 or will default to the federal system.
