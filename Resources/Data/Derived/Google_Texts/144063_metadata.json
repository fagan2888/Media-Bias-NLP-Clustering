Construction is expected to last until next year with an estimated opening of April 2017.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Crusader Clinic breaks ground on its $7.1 million location on North Alpine Road, which they say will open the door for more struggling families to receive healthcare and other important amenities.", "language": "english", "author": "Mike Buda", "og": {"description": "Crusader Clinic breaks ground on its $7.1 million location on North Alpine Road, which they say will open the door for more struggling families to receive healthcare and other important amenities.", "title": "Crusader Clinic Breaks Ground on $7.1M Facility", "url": "http://www.wifr.com/home/headlines/Crusader-Clinic-Breaks-Ground-on-71M-Facility-376621901.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/2A0/220/2A0220EA6C0D4561A9B7D5E999A49601", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A1C/B50/A1CB50285C2C4B45A6E0D495B69C3934.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wifr.com", "description": "Crusader Clinic breaks ground on its $7.1 million location on North Alpine Road, which they say will open the door for more struggling families to receive healthcare and other important amenities.", "title": "Crusader Clinic Breaks Ground on $7.1M Facility", "url": "http://www.wifr.com/home/headlines/Crusader-Clinic-Breaks-Ground-on-71M-Facility-376621901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Crusader+Community+Health1.JPG", "creator": "@23WIFR", "site": "@23WIFR", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Crusader Clinic Breaks Ground on $7.1M Facility", "google-site-verification": "JGUpmtEu_pe3aG6YoeMXTzNzARkSVCbSQ4gsvmILgBk", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Crusader Clinic Breaks Ground on"}, "article_summary": "More Video...ROCKFORD (WIFR) -- Crusader Clinic breaks ground on its $7.1 million location on North Alpine Road, which they say will open the door for more struggling families to receive healthcare and other important amenities.\nCrusader staff broke ground today at the former SwedishAmerican Brookside site where they will have 24 new exam rooms.\n\"You would see Rockford with a low socioeconomic group that would have a difficult time accessing care and then dealing with all of their socioeconomic needs and being connected.\"\n\"If Crusader was to be destabilized and not be here, I think you would see an implosion of ill health,\" said Eggers.\nCrusader says they will serve about 4,500 people in the first two years at the new site."}
