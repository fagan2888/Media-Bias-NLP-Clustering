Voters of all ages may view the voter guides at www.aarp.org/yourvote.\n\n\u201cAARP wants to make sure our members and all voters know what the candidates are saying \u2013 and not saying \u2013 about key issues that matter to them and their families,\u201d said AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond. \u201cOur nonpartisan voter guides help voters cut through the political clutter and pressure candidates to share their views on lifeline issues like Medicare and Social Security before Election Day.\n\nAARP\u2019s federal guide poses three questions on Social Security, Medicare, and Financial Security to candidates in all 471 federal races:\n\nHow would you protect Social Security for today\u2019s seniors and strengthen it for future generations?\n\nHow would you put Medicare on stronger financial ground and protect today\u2019s seniors and future retirees from the burden of rising health costs?\n\nHow would you help Americans save so they can secure their future and live independently as they age?\n\nThe responses, which appear alongside AARP principles on each issue, consist of publicly available information and excerpts from candidate campaign sources. Voters can enter their address to see responses from general election candidates in their specific races for seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Visitors to www.aarp.org/yourvote can also contact the campaigns with their comments or questions and find out where they can vote in their state.\n\nIn many of the states that have gubernatorial and other state races, questions asked of candidates vary and pertain to specific state issues that matter to older Americans including caregiving, financial security, and utilities. An index of all races across the nation in AARP\u2019s voter guides is located here. Additionally, this year AARP has taken election and issue surveys in Arkansas, Illinois, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe nonpartisan AARP does not support, oppose, or contribute to any candidates for elected office.\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
