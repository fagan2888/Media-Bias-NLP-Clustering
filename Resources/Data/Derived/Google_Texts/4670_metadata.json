Stacy Newman \u2013 had plenty to celebrate, as Clinton won a series of key states earlier in the night, including Ohio and Florida.\n\nLate returns from St. Louis County and city \u2013 both favored Clinton by 55 percent to Bernie Sanders\u2019 44 percent \u2013 finally won Missouri for Clinton by a whisker.\n\nStatewide, voter turnout set a new record for a presidential preference primary, with more than 1.5 million people (or 38.86 percent of registered Missouri voters) casting a vote. Since voter turnout was even higher in the city (42.17 percent) and county (46 percent), where the proportion of African Americans is higher than the statewide average, the black vote played a decisive role in Clinton\u2019s narrow victory.\n\nBlack support \u2013 indeed, love \u2013 for the candidate was evident several days before the election, on Saturday, March 12, when \u2013 in the words of 21st Ward Alderman Antonio French, who served as Clinton\u2019s deputy communications director for the Missouri primary \u2013 the campaign brought \u201cHillary to the \u2018hood.\u201d\n\nClinton was scheduled to speak that day in Affton \u2013 94 percent white in the 2010 census \u2013 but French worked with the campaign to sneak her into the O\u2019Fallon Park YMCA in his very black 21st Ward in a surprise visit just before.\n\nThe tone of the event was evident from the moment the candidate entered the small meeting room at the Y.\n\nReed, who was standing near the door, grabbed Clinton with a hug. State Senator Jamilah Nasheed, who was sitting near the door, jumped up and grabbed her for another hug. Then Clinton kept hugging. Next she hugged French\u2019s aunt, Katherine Bennet, who was sitting in the front row. Then veteran North St. Louis political operator Rodney Hubbard Sr., who was sitting next to Bennet, got his hug.\n\nAfter a 10-minute campaign speech \u2013 where she branded Donald Trump, the leader in the Republican primary, as a political arsonist and her Democrat rival as an angry but unrealistic dreamer \u2013 Clinton stepped into a selfie throng that outlasted her speech.\n\nAnyone who wanted a selfie with the candidate got one. Clinton many times grabbed the phone from her admirer and took the picture herself before handing it back. Once she got going, she began to point out elder citizens or especially young children and ask for the picture herself.\n\nSecret Service agents did their best to maintain a perimeter around the candidate, but it was hopeless. North St. Louis wanted to get their hands on Hillary Clinton and get their picture taken with her. And Clinton \u2013 often derided as cold by her opponents \u2013 seemed to want that intimacy just as much.\n\nThere was, of course, calculation behind the event. With Missouri\u2019s presidential preference primary just three days away, the campaign was trying to energize the base to canvass and get people to the polls on election day.\n\n\u201cPeople who come to events like this, we vote,\u201d French told the crowd before Clinton arrived. \u201cBut that\u2019s not where our responsibility ends. We need you to go out there and knock on doors.\u201d\n\nThe campaign continued with voter mobilization events in the days leading up to the primary.\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) visited in St. Louis on Sunday, March 13 to help kick off the St. Louis phone bank. He is that state\u2019s first African American U.S. senator and the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cOn the issues that matter when I was a mayor working on urban issues, issues facing communities struggling with high violence, with high unemployment, with many people who are playing by the rules that are struggling to get ahead, but yet aren\u2019t, she's clearly the best candidate for those communities. She has a better plan, and frankly she has the grit and the toughness to implement these things,\u201d Booker said in an interview with The St. Louis American.\n\n\u201cSo when it comes to struggling communities, the kind of changes that she can make are practical and may seem like incremental, but they make a big difference to those communities that are struggling to get into the middle class.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton made several local campaign stops for her mother on Monday, March 14. At Urban Sprouts Child Development Center in Olivette, she pointed out that Hillary has been working to increase health coverage and drive down the costs of health care since Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidency in the early 1990s. She did not mention Sanders or his proposal to push for a single-payer health plan that would undo the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Obama\u2019s health reform. But she said that Hillary will \u201cprotect the work of Barack Obama\u201d on health care.\n\nShe pointed to the considerable improvements in American health care under the ACA, saying that in 2015 more American women received \u201cthe full complement\u201d of prenatal medical services and delivered their children in medically approved environments than at any other time in history, thanks to the ACA.\n\nChelsea stressed that the next president will have to work with a Republican majority in one if not both houses of Congress, and Hillary has a better track record than her opponent of accomplishing things in that climate.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who has a record of finding common cause,\u201d Chelsea said. \u201cOur children can\u2019t wait for all the stars to align.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though Hillary Clinton would finally win the Missouri presidential preference primary by just over 1,500 votes, or 0.2 percent, in unofficial results, the campaign closed down the local watch party before all election returns were in without celebrating victory on Super Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "St. Louis American", "description": "Though Hillary Clinton would finally win the Missouri presidential preference primary by just over 1,500 votes, or 0.2 percent, in unofficial results, the campaign closed down the local watch party before all election returns were in without celebrating victory on Super Tuesday.", "title": "STL city and county win MO for Clinton, visits by Hillary, Chelsea and Senator Booker help mobilize narrow victory", "url": "http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/article_af433400-eb97-11e5-810f-cb3acf6c625e.html", "image": {"width": 915, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/stlamerican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/f1/bf18b0b0-eb99-11e5-9f41-579cb870e8d5/56e993eda4802.image.jpg?resize=915%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@stlouisamerican", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157786209183}, "keywords": "local_news,featured", "news_keywords": "local_news,featured"}, "article_summary": "Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) visited in St. Louis on Sunday, March 13 to help kick off the St. Louis phone bank.\nNorth St. Louis wanted to get their hands on Hillary Clinton and get their picture taken with her.\nThen veteran North St. Louis political operator Rodney Hubbard Sr., who was sitting next to Bennet, got his hug.\nLate returns from St. Louis County and city \u2013 both favored Clinton by 55 percent to Bernie Sanders\u2019 44 percent \u2013 finally won Missouri for Clinton by a whisker.\nShe has a better plan, and frankly she has the grit and the toughness to implement these things,\u201d Booker said in an interview with The St. Louis American."}
