Young surfers ages 10 to 18 brought their boards inside Saturday for the second annual ESA Indoor Surfing Championship.

The competition took place at Surfs Up, an indoor surfing facility in Nashua.

Surfer Lars Hamilton was thrilled to be catching waves late in November.

“It’s really awesome on a cold winter day to just get over here and get in the wave pool, and it's a great way to cross train for surfing,” Hamilton said.

The wave machine provided a unique challenge for the riders, who typically compete outside. Surfer Dylan Dye said everyone had fun.

“It doesn't feel like a completion at all. It just felt like we’re a bunch of friends, that we just met through just hanging and having fun,” Dye said.

Winners in each age group walked away with some hardware and points toward qualifying for the Northeast Regional contest back on the ocean in May 2016.
