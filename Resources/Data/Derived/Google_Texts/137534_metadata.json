Barbara Mikulski has not yet taken a side in the race to replace her among Maryland Democrats. But she made clear this week that the key to her heart will be pay equality.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a female Senator, either. Asked if she would like to see a woman take her seat, Mikulski was noncommittal.\n\n\u201cI would hope that Marylanders would pick someone who is a very strong advocate for them and their day-to-day needs, knows how to listen to them and convert [those needs] into national policy,\u201d she told TIME. \u201cAnd of course to be a big supporter of making sure that the rights guaranteed in the Constitution are lived out in the workplace.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe race for Mikulski\u2019s open seat in Democratic-leaning Maryland will be brutal. Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards have both announced runs for the Democratic nomination already. Other Deocratic heavy hitters such as Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Rep. Elijah Cummings, former state delegate Heather R. Mizeur and former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend are all considering a run.\n\nWhoever wins will have big shoes to fill. Mikulski, 78, is considered the \u201cdean\u201d of the 20 female senators. She holds \u201cpower workshops\u201d for freshmen \u2014 Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins still remembers her invitation and cram course in the appropriations process in 1997 \u2014 and organizes dinners every month or so.\n\n\u201cWe have relationships now today because she and [former North Carolina Sen.] Kay Hagan were so adamant about keeping that up,\u201d says Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell.\n\nDuring Mikulski\u2019s 1986 bid for Senate, President Reagan said the \u201cwily liberal\u201d would meet a similar fate as the hula hoop and the all-asparagus diet.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve never used a hula hoop; I did try the asparagus diet,\u201d she said. \u201cI turned out to not be a passing fad.\u201d\n\nMikulski reminisced about how much has changed for women in politics from when Mikulski first began as a Baltimore City Councilwoman in 1971.\n\n\u201cYou know, there was the central casting: the gray hair and the distinguished person,\u201d said Mikulski, who\u2019s 4\u201911\u2019\u2019 and believes her colleagues\u2019 \u201clittle general in pearls\u201d description is accurate, although that\u2019s not what she would call herself. Mikulski, who\u2019s middle name is Ann, is referred to as \u201cBAM\u201d by her staff.\n\n\u201cI just laughed when they said I didn\u2019t look the part, I just said this is what the part looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cI just squared my shoulders, put my lipstick on and kept on going door to door, kept on knocking on doors, kept on getting elected to open the doors for other women.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s done that both legislatively and in the Senate, a boy\u2019s club only surpassed in exclusivity by the one informally practiced by presidents.\n\nWhile in office, Mikulski pushed for years for equal pay for equal work, culminating in the 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was the first bill President Obama signed in office. She added expansive provisions in the Affordable Care Act related to women\u2019s preventative health and wrote a major bill helping spouses avert poverty while trying to pay for nursing home care. Her influence has been broad\u2014her office notes her fierce support of the Hubble space telescope, which is managed in Maryland\u2014and she has broke gender barriers, becoming the first female Democratic Senator elected in her own right in 1987 and the first Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee in 2012.\n\n\u201cI think of a fighter,\u201d said Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of his colleague. \u201cI can tell you of meetings in our caucus where the health care bill came up and didn\u2019t have strong provisions on women\u2019s health care. Sen. Mikulski got up and within a matter of an hour the health care bill was changed.\u201d\n\nCantwell and Collins, who talked to TIME while walking together in the underground tunnels of the Capitol, happily rattled off a number of decades-old Mikulski sayings, including \u201csquare my shoulders,\u201d the bipartisan group of female senators are a \u201cforce not a caucus,\u201d and that senators should talk \u201cnot only in macroeconomics but in macaroni.\u201d When asked if she was effective because \u201ceveryone\u2019s afraid of her\u201d\u2014as Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid once said\u2014Mikulski objected, recalling another oft-repeated phrase: \u201cinsistent and persistent.\u201d\n\nBut Mikulski\u2019s impact in the Senate is much larger among her female colleagues than inspirational tongue twisters, she also broke down sexist rules, including one that forbade walking on the Senate floor in 1993 with pants. She later told CNN it was such a \u201cseismographic event\u201d that she had to tell the West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, the Democratic leader.\n\n\u201cWhen Senator Mikulski decided that she was going to wear pants while casting her votes, it was the rule that had to change, not her,\u201d said Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray in a statement.\n\nFor now, Mikulski seems content to let the next stage of the fight play out without making waves publicly.\n\n\u201cI want Maryland to decide who they think is best to represent them now,\u201d she told TIME. \u201cI was the bridge that brought them over from the twentieth century into the twenty first, being the strong advocate for social justice, but certainly for jobs and promoting really the kind of jobs that would be a part of the innovation economy as we said goodbye to some of the others.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Longtime Democratic Sen.
