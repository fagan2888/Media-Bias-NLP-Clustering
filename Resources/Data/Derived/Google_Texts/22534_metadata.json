I used the ACA because I have my own business. Turn off Fox News. Turn off Rush Limbaugh. Stopping voting against your own best interests. Stop voting republican. Here\u2019s $5 to help you out. Good luck!\u201d\n\nLang said he always prided himself on paying for his own medical treatment, but he has already blown through his savings without insurance and faces surgery that could cost up to $30,000.\n\n\u201cYou tried to float by without paying for insurance for years, despite having diabetes, which you knew could blow up on you,\u201d said Joseph Johnson, who contributed $10. \u201cThen, your party dicked you over by not expanding Medicaid. And you still blame Obama? You are laughably ignorant. Get educated. (And get well. I wouldn\u2019t wish blindness on anybody. Thank the liberals, also, who are saving your eyesight.)\u201d\n\nNot every contributor scolded Lang, who admits he smokes and has not always properly managed his diabetes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of the ACA, which was intended to address situations precisely like yours,\u201d said Jim Portnoy, who gave $20. \u201cBut I won\u2019t lecture you about bad choices. We all make some. I\u2019ll just wish you well and hope that we learn a lesson from this. Good luck.\u201d\n\nMost of the donations were small, although Lang is approaching the halfway point toward the minimum $18,000 his surgery might cost.\n\n\u201cI am a leftist on a very limited income who is fighting for universal health care who doesn\u2019t want anybody to in this country to go without medical care, a basic human right,\u201d said Harvey Smith, who gave $5. \u201cI hope you will be able to get the help you need, you will be in my thoughts.\u201d\n\nThe most popular comment on the fundraising site was a bit more sarcastic, however.\n\n\u201cI want to donate enough to really help you out, but I can\u2019t figure out how to get GoFundMe to accept bootstraps,\u201d said Ed Gruberman.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Suited-man-with-money-bag-via-Shutterstock-e1458534905873-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Donations pour in from liberals to help Obamacare-hating conservative who\u2019s losing his eyesight"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95b0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI get my health insurance from a private provider through healthcare.gov.\nGood luck.\u201dMost of the donations were small, although Lang is approaching the halfway point toward the minimum $18,000 his surgery might cost.\nSuited man with money bag (Shutterstock)Donations have poured in \u2013 mostly from self-professed progressives \u2014 to help an Obamacare critic receive treatment that could save his eyesight.\nHe missed this year\u2019s deadline to sign up for Obamacare, and he said he\u2019s either too old or too young to get help from most charities \u2013 so he set up an online fundraiser to help pay for his medical care.\n\u201cI want to donate enough to really help you out, but I can\u2019t figure out how to get GoFundMe to accept bootstraps,\u201d said Ed Gruberman."}
