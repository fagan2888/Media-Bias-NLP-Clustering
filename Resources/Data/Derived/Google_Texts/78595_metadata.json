Mercer surveyed 86 Michigan employers, including 48 from metro Detroit.\n\nOnly 5 percent of Michigan employers said in the survey they are likely to terminate their medical plans within the next five years and send employees to the public health exchange to seek coverage.\n\nSeveral years ago, other surveys predicted more than half of employers would likely terminate their medical plans because of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Obamacare.\n\nHowever, Mercer reported in its 2011 survey that 10 percent of Michigan respondents said they are likely or very likely to terminate their health benefit plans. Nationally, some 9 percent of large employers and 19 percent of small employers say they are likely or very likely to terminate their plans, the previous Mercer survey found.\n\nOther findings this year for Michigan include the following:", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Total health care costs for Michigan employers are projected to grow 3.7 percent in 2016 after making plan changes, reflecting national averages and fears employers will pay a 40-percent excise tax on expensive health plans.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Total health care costs for Michigan employers are projected to grow 3.7 percent in 2016 after making plan changes, reflecting national averages and fears employers will pay a 40-percent excise tax on expensive health plans.", "title": "Mercer projects lower employer medical cost growth as companies prepare for 'Cadillac' tax in 2018", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20151121/NEWS/151129977/mercer-projects-lower-employer-medical-cost-growth-as-companies", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/Assets/rwd/C-Block_RWD.png?v=201503291736", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health care reform", "published_time": "2015-11-21T03:01:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T11:08:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "article_summary": "The projections come in lower than this year's 5.3-percent increase in total health benefit cost for active employees, or $11,123 per employee.\nFear over the 40 percent excise tax related to the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on expensive health benefit packages appears to have led to more aggressive cost cutting, Mercer officials said.\nMercer projects lower employer medical cost growth as companies prepare for 'Cadillac' tax in 2018Employer health benefit costs for active employees are projected to rise next year by 5.9 percent in Michigan, according to a new survey by Mercer, a human resource consulting firm based in New York.\nMercer surveyed 86 Michigan employers, including 48 from metro Detroit.\nHowever, Mercer reported in its 2011 survey that 10 percent of Michigan respondents said they are likely or very likely to terminate their health benefit plans."}
