Obamacare, has had a huge impact on the LGBT community\u2019s ability to access health insurance. According to a new report from the Center for American Progress, the uninsured rate among LGBT individuals who makes about $44,000 or less fell from 34 to 26 percent. This was actually a greater improvement than was found in the general population, where the uninsured rate dropped from 27 to 20 percent.\n\nObamacare particularly impacted those with lower incomes. Among LGBT individuals who make between $15,000 and $22,000, the uninsured rate declined by 18 percentage points, thanks to the insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansions provided by the law.\n\nNot all LGBT people benefited the same, however. People who identify as bisexual only saw a 2 percent dip in uninsured rates, from 29 to 27 percent. Transgender people saw a dramatic 24 percent drop, but the uninsured rate among that community remains quite high at 35 percent.\n\nAccording to the report, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is still a significant barrier to LGBT people obtaining health insurance coverage. Because no federal law exists to protect LGBT people from employment discrimination, many enter unemployment or take low-wage jobs that do not include insurance benefits. Marriage inequality also limits LGBT individuals\u2019 ability to access coverage through a spouse or partner. Only 38 percent of LGBT people in the studied income bracket had insurance through a partner benefit, compared to 58 percent of the general population.\n\nLGBT people also experience discrimination from insurance carriers themselves. The report found that 8 percent of gay respondents experienced discrimination through a carrier, and another 8 percent struggled to obtain coverage because of a pre-existing condition, including a significant number who were denied coverage because of their HIV status.\n\nThere is good news on the horizon, though. New provisions will soon take effect that will allow Obamacare to serve LGBT people even better. Starting January 1, the law requires that any insurance plan that provides spousal or family coverage be offered to same-sex spouses under identical conditions, including couples who married in any state where it\u2019s legal to do so, regardless of where they now live. State insurance commissioners are also increasingly issuing guidance prohibiting transgender exclusions in plans, helping increase access for that particularly vulnerable population.\n\nA group of LGBT organizations have also proposed a Healthcare Bill of Rights, helping the community identify discrimination when it happens and encouraging them to find services that meet all their unique medical needs.\n\nThe report concludes that the first year of Obamacare\u2019s implementation \u201cshows great promise, but much work remains to be done to ensure that the benefits of the health reform efforts reach all who need them, including LGBT people and their families.\u201d Read the full report for more insights about how the LGBT community has interacted with Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Uninsured rates in the LGBT community have plummeted at a rate faster than the general public thanks to Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Uninsured rates in the LGBT community have plummeted at a rate faster than the general public thanks to Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare Drastically Increased The Number Of LGBT Americans With Health Insurance", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/11/18/3593479/lgbt-obamacare-report/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LGBT-Insurance-Obamacare-Chart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Uninsured rates in the LGBT community have plummeted at a rate faster than the general public thanks to Obamacare.", "creator": "@ZackFord", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LGBT-Insurance-Obamacare-Chart-321x214.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Drastically Increased The Number Of LGBT Americans With Health Insurance", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LGBT-Insurance-Obamacare-Chart.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LGBT-Insurance-Obamacare-Chart.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-18T12:14:53+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zackford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd496f\"", "article_summary": "LGBT Obamacare Drastically Increased The Number Of LGBT Americans With Health Insurance CREDIT: Center for American ProgressThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a.\nObamacare, has had a huge impact on the LGBT community\u2019s ability to access health insurance.\nAccording to the report, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is still a significant barrier to LGBT people obtaining health insurance coverage.\nThis was actually a greater improvement than was found in the general population, where the uninsured rate dropped from 27 to 20 percent.\nTransgender people saw a dramatic 24 percent drop, but the uninsured rate among that community remains quite high at 35 percent."}
