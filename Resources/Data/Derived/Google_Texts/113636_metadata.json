Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) cannot challenge the Obamacare policy that lawmakers and their staff obtain health insurance through the exchanges.\n\nThe ruling could prove ominous for House Republicans as they prepare to file suit against the Obama administration, also against Obamacare. That suit would focus on a different issue, the president\u2019s delay of the employer mandate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nJudge William C. Griesbach, a George W. Bush appointee, said that Article III of the Constitution prevents Johnson\u2019s lawsuit from moving forward and suggests that any remedy must come from Congress. He said that the Wisconsin Republican cannot prove he is injured by the policy, which moved lawmakers and some of their staff from the usual federal employee health benefit plan and into the new Obamacare exchanges.\n\n\u201cUnder our constitutional design, in the absence of a concrete injury to a party that can be redressed by the courts, disputes between the executive and legislative branches over the exercise of their respective powers are to be resolved through the political process, not by decisions issued by federal judges,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJohnson argued that the Obama administration decision to allow the government to contribute to staffers\u2019 and members\u2019 health costs was not allowed under the Affordable Care Act. He said his injury was that the policy put him at an unfair disadvantage with his voters and required him to file a form distinguishing staff and non-staff. Griesbach said that was not enough.\n\nJohnson said he and his legal team will review his next steps, presumably whether to appeal to a higher court.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration violated its own signature health care law by giving special treatment to members of Congress and their staffs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI believe that this executive action by the Obama administration is unlawful and unfair, and that it is only one of many examples of this president\u2019s abuse of his constitutional duty.\u201d\n\nBut the judge did suggest that the basis of Johnson\u2019s suit \u2014 the administration\u2019s decision to allow the federal contributions to health plans \u2014 could be very problematic for the administration if it violated the law.\n\n\u201cIf proven, this would be a violation of Article I of the Constitution, which reposes the lawmaking power in the legislative branch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe violation alleged is not a mere technicality. It strikes at one of the most important safeguards against tyranny that the framers erected \u2014 the separation of powers.\u201c\n\nOral arguments were held in Wisconsin earlier this month.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It could prove ominous for House Republicans as they prepare to file suit against the White House.", "title": "Johnson's Obamacare suit tossed", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/ron-johnson-obamacare-lawsuit-109204.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/06/12/130515_ron_johnson_shinkle_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Ron Johnson,Health Care,Lawsuits,Courts", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "It could prove ominous for House Republicans as they prepare to file suit against the White House.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe182f\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO Johnson's Obamacare suit tossedA federal judge said Monday that Sen.
