After the Rockies traded for the former Atlanta all-star on July 2, Jurrjens became Colorado\u2019s 13th starting pitcher this season on July 4.\n\nThe move makes room for the return of Carlos Gonzalez on Friday. Gonzalez, who started Wednesday for the Sky Sox, will likely move to right field when he returns.\n\nBrett Anderson (broken finger) will start Sunday against the Twins in his return to the Rockies. But he\u2019s taking the spot left open by Yohan Flande, who was optioned to Triple-A on Tuesday. The Rockies won\u2019t need to decide on a pitching replacement for Jurrjens until after the all-star break next week, when they go to Pittsburgh. But the spot could go to Eddie Butler.\n\nIn two games, Jurrjens threw a combined 9 1/3 innings, with 20 hits, 11 runs, nine strikeouts, three walks and a 10.61 ERA.\n\nOn Wednesday against San Diego, Jurrjens threw 4 2/3 innings with six strikeouts. But he was not efficient, throwing 96 pitches.\n\n\u201cI felt better than last time,\u201d said Jurrjens, who left his start on July 4 and went to the hospital because of breathing problems. \u201cThe fifth inning, I was a little bit tired. I just needed to get used to it.\u201d\n\nHe was packing his bags right after talking to reporters about the Rockies\u2019 6-3 victory over San Diego.\n\nJurrjens allowed two home runs, to Jake Goebbert in the fourth and Seth Smith in the fifth, both solo shots.\n\n\u201cI felt improvement in my command and I kept the ball down. Just two pitches cost me two runs,\u201d Jurrjens said. \u201cI felt really happy with my command, especially against all those lefties. I was able to keep making the same pitch over and over again and keeping them off-balance.\u201d\n\nHe also very nearly gave up a bomb of a home run to Yasmani Grandal, who pulled a hit to the second deck in right field. But umpires, on first glance and on video replay, ruled the hit foul.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s baseball,\u201d Jurrjens said. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of inches. I came back and struck him out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jair Jurrjens", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Jair Jurrjens was sent down to Triple-A Colorado Springs less than a week before making his debut with the Colorado Rockies.", "title": "Jair Jurrjens sent down to Triple-A Colorado Springs after Rockies win", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/09/jair-jurrjens-sent-triple-colorado-springs-rockies-win/18153/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/jair-jurrjens.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Jair Jurrjens was sent down to Triple-A Colorado Springs less than a week before making his debut with the Colorado Rockies.", "creator": "@nickgroke", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/09/jair-jurrjens-sent-triple-colorado-springs-rockies-win/18153/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/jair-jurrjens.jpg", "title": "Jair Jurrjens sent down to Triple-A Colorado Springs after Rockies win", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Jair Jurrjens was sent down to Triple-A Colorado Springs less than a week before making his debut with the Colorado Rockies."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dca\"", "article_summary": "Jurrjens was sent down to Triple-A Colorado Springs less than a week before making his debut with the team.\nAfter a short but fiery outing Wednesday against the Padres, Jair Jurrjens\u2019 stint with the Rockies turned into a short one.\nJust two pitches cost me two runs,\u201d Jurrjens said.\nIn two games, Jurrjens threw a combined 9 1/3 innings, with 20 hits, 11 runs, nine strikeouts, three walks and a 10.61 ERA.\nOn Wednesday against San Diego, Jurrjens threw 4 2/3 innings with six strikeouts."}
