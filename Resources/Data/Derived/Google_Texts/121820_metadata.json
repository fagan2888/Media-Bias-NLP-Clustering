It alleges that in 2009-2010, Rowland did paid work for a congressional candidate in Connecticut\u2019s 5th District without informing either his radio show audience or the FEC. It also alleges that in 2011-2012, Rowland pulled a similar move, this time receiving money for pretending to do work at a nursing home owned by the husband of candidate Lisa Wilson-Foley.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Wilson-Foley wanted Rowland\u2019s help but worried that, given his previous incidents with the law (for which he served 10 months in prison), associating him with her campaign would bring negative repercussions. For his part, Rowland wrote in an email that he \u201cwant[ed] to stay under the radar as much as possible.\u201d Rowland is alleged to have ultimately received $35,000 from the campaign, money he did not disclose to the FEC.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After once having to resign as guv over a corruption scandal, Rowland's in trouble with the law yet again", "title": "Former GOP Gov.
