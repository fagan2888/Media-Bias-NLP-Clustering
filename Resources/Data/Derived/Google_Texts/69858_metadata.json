(Photo: Provided) Story Highlights Nonprofit created in 2010 under the Affordable Care Act\n\nTuesday's grants nationally total $120 million\n\nOhio institutions have received 13 of these grants, $30.9 million.\n\nTuesday was large-dollar day for two Cincinnati medical researchers doing patient-centered studies of obese young people with bipolar disorder and juvenile arthritis.\n\nThe grants were part of the $120 million that the nonprofit Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute handed out Tuesday to 34 research projects around the country. The institute was created in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. Its mandate is to fund research that focuses more closely on patients.\n\nDr. Melissa DelBello of the University of Cincinnati will get a $12.9 million award to assess whether overweight and obese youth with bipolar disorders would be helped with a regimen of healthy lifestyle interventions plus the diabetes drug metformin, as opposed to lifestyle interventions alone. DelBello is Dr. Stanley and Mickey Kaplan Professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at UC.\n\nBin Huang, Ph.D., of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center will get a $1.4 million award to develop methods to make it easier and more efficient for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, their families, and their clinicians to determine which treatment to use next if a first-line therapy does not produce the desired response.\n\nWith these new awards, Ohio institutions have received 13 research grants totaling nearly $30.9 million.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1GfObdm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The grants, $14.3 million in total, will help researchers study obesity and arthritis", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "The grants, $14.3 million in total, will help researchers study obesity and arthritis", "title": "Bipolar disorder, arthritis in kids get fresh look", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2015/04/21/patient-centered-grants-come/26138811/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The grants, $14.3 million in total, will help researchers study obesity and arthritis", "title": "Bipolar disorder, arthritis in kids get fresh look", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40ca3afaf97e1558e165456b0f614b0ddc00672f/c=0-300-1500-1800&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Obesity", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Obesity", "title": "Bipolar disorder, arthritis in kids get fresh look", "author": "Anne Saker", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9c76406e2cc255455f8a784eb318461f02bba3b/c=0-50-1500-2050/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2caf8bbae9d6776f293c7e99fada12d4f6574b76/c=0-300-1500-1800/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/998711010a1328f0a1e6b7393b48272d6608ca28/c=0-488-1500-1613/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b71dcf9629c82e51d42e06be23147550efcda2/c=0-628-1500-1472&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-22T10:59:26.873000-04:00", "shorthed": "2 patient-centered grants come in", "articleid": 26138811, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b66f3ae7cf61a6e71f968274336d31a8d268a2f/c=0-628-1500-1472/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a92d3fe39ba3e08354111f84f0fbaeff11fa9ff1/c=160-0-1341-2100/local/-/media/Cincinnati/2015/04/21/B9317066759Z.1_20150421163132_000_GOKAIOJGJ.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Dr. Melissa DelBello at the University of Cincinnati received a $12.9 million grant from the nonprofit Patient-Centered Outcome Research Institute.\nTuesday was large-dollar day for two Cincinnati medical researchers doing patient-centered studies of obese young people with bipolar disorder and juvenile arthritis.\nWith these new awards, Ohio institutions have received 13 research grants totaling nearly $30.9 million.\nThe grants were part of the $120 million that the nonprofit Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute handed out Tuesday to 34 research projects around the country.\n(Photo: Provided) Story Highlights Nonprofit created in 2010 under the Affordable Care ActTuesday's grants nationally total $120 millionOhio institutions have received 13 of these grants, $30.9 million."}
