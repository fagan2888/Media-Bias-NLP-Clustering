The rumor mill was spot on, and timely, too.\n\nGlenn Rufrano\n\nWell, that didn\u2019t take long. The rumor mill was spot on, and timely, too, and indeed former Cushman & Wakefield president/CEO Glenn Rufrano\u2019s appointment as the new CEO at troubled REIT American Realty Capital Properties, effective April 1, was announced on Tuesday. Only a day earlier, Commercial Property Executive had reported on Rufrano\u2019s status as the apparent front-runner for the job vacated in December by Nicholas Schorsch.\n\nMeanwhile, a brand-new report points toward a lively year for the net-lease sector; more on that in a moment.\n\nAt ARCP, Rufrano, 64, will take over from independent director William Stanley, ARCP\u2019s interim CEO. Rufrano will be leaving his slot as chairman & CEO of O\u2019Connor Capital Partners, which he had co-founded in 1983 and to which he returned not long after his sudden departure from Cushman in June 2013.\n\n\u201cARCP is a young company, grown rapidly, which now requires a sound business path,\u201d Rufrano said in a release. \u201cI look forward to meeting the management team, thoroughly analyzing the assets and reviewing the details of the balance sheet while at the same time seeking thoughts from the institutional investor community. Once complete, we will organize a strategic plan and begin execution to maximize the value of the core REIT assets, Cole Capital and the enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cRufrano\u2019s initial focus will be to analyze and understand the business and then formulate a strategy that will ensure financial stability and return the company to growth,\u201d an ARCP spokesperson told Commercial Property Executive. \u201cWith that in mind, it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the company\u2019s future direction until he has time to get acclimated.\u201d\n\nThe other change at ARCP will be the replacement of two board members, Leslie Michelson and Gov. Edward Rendell, who will step down on April 1. The spokesperson told CPE that the ACRP board \u201cremains focused on announcing a new non-executive chairman in the near term. They are working with Korn Ferry on the search for candidates.\u201d\n\nOn the broader front, a first-half 2015 outlook on the net-lease sector by Marcus & Millichap predicts that a \u201cpump dividend\u201d from lower gasoline prices will boost retail sales, particularly among lower-income families. These households are thus expected to spend more at retailers like Walmart and Target.\n\nMore discretionary income in the middle-income population is expected to swell traffic for restaurants and fast-food locations, while increased penalties for the uninsured under the Affordable Care Act will help drive business at drug stores and at their growing number of retail clinics, according to M&M.\n\nOverall retail growth is expected to be in \u201cthe mid- to high-3 percent range,\u201d the outlook predicted.\n\nFinally, the M&M report noted that investors seeking loans on net-leased assets continue to find a wide range of options, as the activity of national banks, local banks and CMBS \u201chas kept rates below 4 percent for best-in-class assets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "arcp,glenn-rufrano,net-lease,headlines,industry-announcements,cpe-news,topnewsoftheweek", "og": {"url": "https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/rufrano-joins-arcp-at-auspicious-time/", "image": "https://media.atre.yardi.com/2/30939/images/Rufrano.jpg", "description": "Well, that didn\u2019t take long.
