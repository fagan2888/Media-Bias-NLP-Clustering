Manion blasted the accommodation as a \u201clong and winding extension cord the government uses to power its contraceptive mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court is wrong: A thorough examination reveals that the accommodation\u2019s tangled mess is hiding the fact that the extension cord gets its power from the nonprofits\u2019 health plans and must be plugged in before it will work,\u201d he wrote in a 36-page dissent.\n\nThe 2-1 decision overturns an injunction issued by the district court in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Grace Schools, et al. and Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend Inc., v. Burwell, which sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, are among dozens of religious nonprofits to object to the ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n\nOver 40 cases in which nonprofits claim the ACA\u2019s accommodation is insufficient are making their way through the courts, according to Laurie Sobel and Alina Salganicoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn fact, the 7th Circuit issued a similar decision in May in University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, and in July in Wheaton College v. Burwell.\n\nOther appeals courts in New York, Philadelphia, D.C., Cincinnati, New Orleans and Denver have found in favor of the ACA\u2019s accommodation clause.\n\nLegal challenges to the ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate come from two groups, for-profit corporations and nonprofit organizations.\n\nIn the landmark Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., a private employer in Oklahoma City, the Supreme Court last year pronounced the accommodation a \u201cless restrictive means\u201d to provide contraceptive coverage, but did not decide whether the accommodation is lawful, according to Sobel and Salganicoff.\n\nThe two authors, however, write that the issue over the legality of the contraceptive mandate under the ACA may well end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal appeals court again upholds the accommodation giving workers of religious nonprofits the right to contraception coverage under the ACA.", "og": {"site_name": "InsuranceNewsNet", "description": "A federal appeals court again upholds the \"accommodation\" giving workers of religious nonprofits the right to contraception coverage under the ACA.", "title": "Appeals Court Again Upholds Obamacare\u2019s Contraceptive Mandate - InsuranceNewsNet", "url": "http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/appeals-court-again-upholds-obamacares-contraceptive-mandate", "image": {"width": 3872, "identifier": "http://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ThinkstockPhotos-92374311.jpg", "height": 2592}, "updated_time": "2015-09-15T14:01:44+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ThinkstockPhotos-92374311.jpg", "description": "A federal appeals court again upholds the \"accommodation\" giving workers of religious nonprofits the right to contraception coverage under the ACA.", "site": "@insnewsnet", "card": "summary", "title": "Appeals Court Again Upholds Obamacare\u2019s Contraceptive Mandate - InsuranceNewsNet"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-09-15T11:15:38-04:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insnewsnet", "published_time": "2015-09-15T11:15:38+00:00", "author": "http://insurancenewsnet.com/author/cyril-tuohyinnfeedback-com", "section": "Health/Employee Benefits", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T14:01:44+00:00", "tag": "top stories"}, "keywords": "insurance news, life and health, annuity news, financial news, health/employee benefits, law & regulation, top stories", "google-site-verification": "tjN7Q5WvF9Qfl-Gnlk5Dtbk78wjlFGdQX6Ab6EbzPFw", "'yandex-verification'": "'4b822c768d77b153'", "yandex-verification": "4b822c768d77b153"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca83\"", "article_summary": "The 2-1 ruling is the latest in a series of circuit court decisions around the country upholding the ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\nLegal challenges to the ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate come from two groups, for-profit corporations and nonprofit organizations.\nThe contraceptive mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the free exercise of religion, a three-judge federal appeals court ruled earlier this month.\nOther appeals courts in New York, Philadelphia, D.C., Cincinnati, New Orleans and Denver have found in favor of the ACA\u2019s accommodation clause.\nThe two authors, however, write that the issue over the legality of the contraceptive mandate under the ACA may well end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court."}
