It was a very lively scene.\n\nThe justices were hearing oral arguments in Zubik v. Burwell, a case challenging aspects of the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Some religious non-profits, such as colleges and nursing homes, don\u2019t want to tolerate the presence of birth control in student and employee health-care plans, even though they don\u2019t have to pay for it. The government has given them an opt-out, but they object to it because it requires them to fill out a short form or write a letter to the government.\n\nAdvocates on both sides rallied at the high court yesterday. A large contingent from Americans United was there along with our allies in groups like Catholics for Choice, the National Woman\u2019s Law Center and the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. (AU Executive Director Barry W. Lynn addressed the throng, and Erin Hagen, our field associate, led some spirited chants.)\n\nYou could feel the energy moving through the crowd on this warm, early spring day. Our side was diverse \u2013 young and old, believers and non-believers, men and women, straight and gay, black, brown and white.\n\nI walked over to check out the folks on the other side. Their crowd consisted mostly of priests, nuns and a contingent of kids brought in from local Catholic schools. I was struck by a sign several of them were carrying. It depicted a picture of birth control pills with the words, \u201cThe PILL KILLS.\u201d\n\nAnti-birth control activists protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nSee, we have been told for months now that this court battle is really about \u201creligious freedom.\u201d But every now and then, someone slips up and exposes what\u2019s really going on here \u2013 as the wavers of that sign did.\n\nThese people don\u2019t want anyone to have birth control. No one. For no reason. Why? Because, in their view, it interferes with God\u2019s plan for the size of your family and is somehow \u201cimmoral.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a ridiculous argument and because it\u2019s so foolish it can only be propped up with lies. The pill kills? Hardly. Safe and affordable birth control has saved countless lives.\n\nIf you doubt that, ask women in the Third World who have smaller families that they can actually support thanks to birth control. Talk to the women who were able to get an education and professional jobs because birth control made it possible for them to plan their families and, subsequently, their lives. Discuss it with the women who suffer from irregular or absent menstrual periods, severe menstrual cramps, endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome who get relief from these ailments thanks to birth control.\n\nAs I watched the priests and nuns and their followers hoist their signs and cry about \u201creligious freedom,\u201d I had to wonder what\u2019s really going on here. A request that someone fill out a short form didn\u2019t cause all of this fuss and angst.\n\nWe must go deeper. What\u2019s really bothering these folks?\n\nI believe it\u2019s something as simple as this: Fewer and fewer people are listening to them these days. When it comes to human sexuality, Americans have decided to take control. Most want the ability to plan their families, and birth control makes that possible.\n\nAffordable and reliable birth control \u2013 and by this I refer specifically to progestin, a form of contraceptive so ubiquitous it is universally known as \u201cthe pill\u201d \u2013 revolutionized American society. If you can control a woman\u2019s reproductive life, you can control that woman. The theocrats suffered a serious blow when they lost that power. After all, they had it for something like, oh, 2,000 years.\n\nWomen and their partners secured the ability to decide when and if to have children and how many to have. Suddenly, far-right religious leaders found that they could no longer compel women to live under dogmatic rules found in the ancient religious texts that they believe should form the basis of public policy.\n\nBottom line: Religious zealots used to be able to force us all to live under the rules of their religion. They can\u2019t anymore, and that smarts. They\u2019re not above using fear and lies to get some of that power back. They\u2019re only too happy to try to clothe their naked power grab in the noble garment of religious liberty.\n\nThe sign on that message \u2013 The PILL KILLS \u2013 is short. But it ends up saying quite a lot.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0394\"", "article_summary": "The sign on that message \u2013 The PILL KILLS \u2013 is short.\nA request that someone fill out a short form didn\u2019t cause all of this fuss and angst.\nMost want the ability to plan their families, and birth control makes that possible.\nThe government has given them an opt-out, but they object to it because it requires them to fill out a short form or write a letter to the government.\nThese people don\u2019t want anyone to have birth control."}
