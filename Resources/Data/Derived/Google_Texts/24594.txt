It goes without saying, but if left-wing zealot Michael Moore has harsh things to say about the president, then ABC was right, Obama does have “real popularity problems.”

Moore spoke with The Hollywood Reporter at the Toronto Film Festival and he wasn’t shy about bashing Obama, as he has in the past, saying “he’s been a huge disappointment.”

Contesting the president’s claim that he saved Detroit, Michigan native Moore said, “Detroit at this point, would stand a better chance if they were an Iraqi or Syrian city.”

Moore had a message for Obama that could be considered the ultimate insult to the narcissist in chief. And he addressed him personally to deliver it:

“When the history is written of this era, this is how you’ll be remembered: ‘He was the first black president.’ Okay, not a bad accomplishment, but that’s it. That’s it, Mr. Obama. A hundred years from now, ‘he was the first black American that got elected president.’ And that’s it. Eight years of your life and that’s what people are gonna remember. Boy, I got a feeling, know you, that you probably wish you were remembered for a few other things, a few other things you could’ve done.”

Considering what Obama has done to the country’s economy with Obamacare, it’s legal and political system with a renegade Justice Department and ideological abuses of the IRS, and even the Constitution itself with executive orders replacing democracy, he’ll be lucky if that’s all he’s remembered for.
