It happened to Bill Van Tassel a couple of weeks ago, as he was steering his Mazda Miata around a turn on an Interstate onramp.\n\n\u201cThis type of thing could happen at any time. It\u2019s going to be completely unexpected,\u201d he says.\n\nVan Tassel\u2019s problem had nothing to do with his ignition. His engine quit because it ran out of gas; he says a broken fuel sensor had fooled him. And he was better prepared than most folks: He\u2019s in charge of driver training programs for AAA.\n\nHere are his tips for what to do if your car\u2019s engine suddenly quits, making it harder to steer and leaving you at the mercy of other traffic.\n\n___\n\nSTEP BY STEP\n\nIf your engine quits:\n\n\u2014Look for the safest way off the road. That usually means heading for the right shoulder, but on a divided freeway you may be closer to the left.\n\n\u2014Use your turn indicator to signal where you\u2019re going. Emergency flashers, if you can turn them on easily.\n\n\u2014Don\u2019t panic if it feels like the steering isn\u2019t working. Pull harder. And be ready to push extra hard on the brakes if necessary.\n\n\u2014But if cars are buzzing past on a freeway, you don\u2019t want to stomp on the brakes. Let the car\u2019s momentum help you navigate through high-speed traffic toward the shoulder.\n\n\u2014Try to stop your car as far off the road as possible. In most cases, it\u2019s safer to move well away from the car before calling for help. Never stand behind or in front of your vehicle, because it may be struck by another car.\n\n\u2014If your car stops in the middle of a busy road, you may be safer staying inside, with seat belt on.\n\n___\n\nFOR EXPERIENCED DRIVERS\n\nOther moves may help, if you feel comfortable using them:\n\n\u2014To help slow the car: Shift into low gear. But many drivers of automatic transmissions aren\u2019t in the habit of using the low gears.\n\n\u2014To avoid slowing down too suddenly, shift into neutral to maximize your momentum. But nervous drivers could be at risk of shifting into reverse by mistake.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Help!
