One complicating factor is the use of so-called cost-sharing tiers for covered medications. Tiers break up covered drugs into different categories, with patients responsible for lower co-payments and co-insurance costs in the lower tiers, and higher costs in the higher tiers.



But knowing which drug falls into which tier is difficult, and it makes it difficult for most shoppers to figure out which plan will cost you more. And that is assuming you have a good sense of what your needs will be. In some cases, it may be literally "impossible," a recent analysis found.

Julie Huppert, vice president of health-care reform at Express Scripts, said the insurance terms such as co-payment, co-insurance and deductible "will be foreign" to many new Obamacare enrollees, who may not have had insurance in the past.

And those terms "will cause some surprises for them," Huppert said, because they will in some cases lead to people owing much more in out-of-pocket costs than they would have imagined when they signed up for their new insurance plan.

Huppert said that in addition to confusion about what is legitimately owned by patients for medications, there will be errors in cost calculations and determinations of what drugs are covered in the new Obamacare exchange-sold plans.

That means that "in this first year, we'll probably have a lot more stories about what went wrong than what went right," Huppert said.
