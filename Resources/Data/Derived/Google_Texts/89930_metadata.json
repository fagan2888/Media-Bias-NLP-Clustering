To explain these to the lay reader would be unproductive, as I have very little idea what an algorithm is.\n\nIn any case, in the interest of touching off some healthy Thanksgiving dinner-table debates, here, in random order, are the top ten:\n\n\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\"\n\nThe writer Annie Dillard once told me, very seriously, that she considered this tune to be the \u201cprettiest song ever written.\u201d And, by golly, when you set aside the slightly cloying lyrics (which initially were misunderstood by Catholic Church leaders, who believed that it described an adulterous encounter -- this is true -- and ordered the record banned some cities), it really is a very lovely tune.\n\nFor the record, it was written by a British songwriter named Tommie Connor, whose only other accomplishment of note was to provide the English lyrics to the great WWII love ballad, \u201cLili Marlene.\u201d\n\n\"Blue Christmas\"\n\nElvis made it a hit in 1957 and forever after, but the song had been written nearly a decade earlier (by Bill Hayes/Jay Johnson, the latter of whom for a time lived in Connecticut), and back in 1949 had actually been a decent sized hit for the country legend Ernest Tubb.\n\nThe distinctive woman\u2019s backup voice on Elvis\u2019s version, soaring high above the Jordanaires\u2019 standard male harmonizing, belongs to legendary session singer Millie Kirkham, who, for the record, is still alive and performing nearly 60 years later.\n\n\"Sleigh Ride\"\n\nI\u2019ve made this observation before, but it\u2019s worth reinforcing here: I believe that this hardy perennial, composed by Connecticut\u2019s own Leroy Anderson in 1948 for the Boston Pops (lyrics were added later by Mitchell Parish), has been recorded and performed by a wider stylistic array of musical artists than any composition in the history of Western music.\n\nA partial list: the New York Philharmonic, Johnny Mathis, the Ronettes, Canadian Brass, Ella Fitzgerald, the Ventures, Kenny G, Dolly Parton, Fun., Placido Domingo, Bootsy Collins, Captain Kangaroo and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\n\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don\u2019t Be Late)\"\n\nAlthough none of the standard sources see fit to make mention of it, this 1958 record -- in its original incarnation by David Seville and the Chipmunks -- was the first 45 record I ever owned, thanks to a generous relative who gave it to me and my brother as a joint Christmas present.\n\nDavid Seville was the nom de vinyl of one Ross Bagdasarian, who had previously co-composed the 1952 hit \u201cCome On-a My House,\u201d sung by a reluctant, though subsequently very rich, Rosemary Clooney. His co-composer on that tune was his cousin and fellow Armenian-American, the Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright William Saroyan. Bagdasarian, incidentally, can be seen, from a distance, as the boisterous piano-playing bon vivant in Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cRear Window.\u201d\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas is You\"\n\nUnless I am overlooking some newer entry, Mariah Carey\u2019s 1994 (!) giga-hit is the most recent pop specimen to become a true, authentic, undisputed, genre-crossing, multi-generational, stand-around-a-piano-and-sing-and-know-at-least-most-of-the-lyrics Christmas hit standard.\n\nAnd a worthy addition it is.\n\n\"Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\"\n\nThe incomparable Frank Loesser composed this clever, breathtakingly sexist duet in 1944; it was inserted into an Esther Williams movie a few years later, and wound up winning an Oscar for Best Song.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of versions, but none finer than the 1961 pairing of Ray Charles and jazz singer Betty Carter. Some people find the lyrics uncomfortably suggestive of sexual predatoriness, but you get the feeling that Betty can sure enough take care of herself.\n\n\"Winter Wonderland\"\n\nMy son-in-law, the noted song-lyric scholar and critic Yoni Berkovits, has pointed out that the snowman-cum-clergyman Parson Brown, referred to in the song\u2019s middle section, seems suspiciously and inappropriately inquisitive of the civil status of the couple singing the song: \u201cHe\u2019ll say are you married? We\u2019ll say no, man\u2026.\u201d\n\nRev. Brown would hardly seem to have any compelling reason for asking this intrusive question, and I think Yoni is correct in raising \u2013 forthrightly and unflinchingly -- the suggestion that there might be more than a slight whiff of prurience here.\n\n\"Little Saint Nick\"\n\nProving once again that Brian Wilson, even when the lyrics were pretty stupid (\u201che\u2019s gotta wear his goggles cause the snow really flies\u201d), as they so often were, could create a musical statement that somehow feels fresh and irresistible across the decades.\n\nThe song, even with a substantial rideout at the end, clocks in at 2\u201903,\u201d just missing membership in that tiny but culturally significant club of sub-two minute hits.\n\n\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\"\n\nThis is the rare Christmas song that simultaneously warms your heart and makes you reach for the nearest prescription anti-depressant. The original lyrics (the song is by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin, created for the 1944 film \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis\u201d) were even bleaker than the ones we know today: \"have yourself a merry little Christmas; it could be your last....\"\n\nFrank Sinatra gets credit for lightening the mood a bit further; for his 1957 version, he succeeded in getting Martin to change the borderline nihilism of \u201cuntil then, we\u2019ll have to muddle through somehow\u2026\u201d to the more existentially neutral, \u201chang a shining star upon the highest bough.\u201d\n\n\"Silver Bells\"\n\nEvery songwriter, for obvious reasons, yearns to write a Christmas standard. I once interviewed Jay Livingston, the composer half of the duo (Ray Evans was the lyricist) that wrote many enduring Hollywood hits, including \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d \u201cQue, Sera, Sera\u201d and \u201cSilver Bells.\u201d\n\nI had the temerity -- not to say bad taste -- to ask Mr. Livingston if he would reveal what the annual composer royalties were from that one song, written in haste 40 years earlier. He declined, but he did allow as how he and Evans spoke of it as their \u201cannuity\u201d and went on to say that his winter home in (I think) Florida was named Silver Bells because it had been purchased with proceeds from that one three-minute tune.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\n\"Run Rudolph Run\"\n\nChuck Berry\u2019s genial holiday bid; in the spirit of the season we will overlook the fact that the chord changes are pretty much identical of those of \u201cCarol.\u201d\n\n\"Please Come Home for Christmas\"\n\nCharles Brown please, not the overproduced Eagles cover.\n\n\"Santa Baby\"\n\nSurprisingly risqu\u00e9 for 1953, especially as delivered by the earthy Eartha Kitt.\n\n\"I\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas\"\n\nOnce again Elvis owns, if not the definitive interpretation, certainly one of the top two or three.\n\n\"White Christmas\"\n\nI suppose this has to be included, although the sorry truth is I am not much of a Bing Crosby fan. So I will simply encourage you to check out alternate readings by, among many others, the Drifters and Darlene Love.\n\nSteve Metcalf was The Hartford Courant\u2019s fulltime classical music critic and reporter for over 20 years, beginning in 1982.
