A proposal to put slot machines in the old Wichita Greyhound Park is being floated again in the Kansas legislature.

The track's owner, Phil Ruffin Sr. said he would be interested in reopening a refurbished facility if he's allowed to add slots.

In 2007 Sedgwick County voters turned down a gaming option for the park and owner Phil Ruffin Sr. closed Wichita Greyhound Park. It's been empty ever since.

However, with the success of Kansas Star Casino in Mulvane Ruffin's son, Phil Ruffin Jr., said Sedgwick County should reap the economic rewards of gaming at WGP. "It would stay right here, said Ruffin. "It's Wichita Greyhound Park, even though we're closer to Park City. It would be a great thing for state coffers, county coffers and city coffers."

Ruffin said $50 to $100 million would be spent to re-open the park. He also said 500 to 600 jobs would be created generating $1.8 million in gaming revenue each year for Sedgwick County.

Opponents in the past have pointed to gambling addiction, crime and other reasons for not allowing slots at the track.
