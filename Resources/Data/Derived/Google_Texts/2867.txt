× BBB: Watch Out for ‘Government Grant’ Scam

CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Cleveland Better Business Bureau is warning residents about a new “government grant scam.”

According to the BBB, a Cleveland woman reported losing several hundred dollars to the scam this week.

She said she received a call from someone claiming to be with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and was told she was eligible for a $10,000 government grant given to families in need.

The caller told her all she had to do was pay $730 using Green Dot MoneyPak cards to cover processing fees.

After getting the cards and providing the serial numbers, she was asked for an additional $370 to cover state taxes. When she refused to pay, she was told her $10,000 was frozen.

BBB says other consumers have reported receiving similar calls, and emphasized the government does not award grants in such a manner.

The BBB says consumers should avoid involvement in offers or purchases that require you to wire money in advance or provide payment using Green Dot MoneyPak or similar debit cards.
