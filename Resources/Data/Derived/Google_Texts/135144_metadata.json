LARRY STEAGALL / KITSAP SUN\n\nBy Tad Sooter of the Kitsap Sun\n\nPOULSBO \u2014 A food bank doubled as a doctor\u2019s office Wednesday as North Kitsap Fishline hosted the first of what will become a monthly free clinic.\n\nClients had their blood pressure taken by a nurse in a lobby outside the Fishline food market, while others talked with doctors in private consultation rooms. A Kitsap Public Health District nurse offered flu shots to anyone who walked through the door.\n\nFishline Executive Director Mary Nader said a free clinic fits naturally with the food bank\u2019s expanding mission. Medical care represents a huge expense for families struggling to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the reason why our clients face economic instability,\u201d Nader said.\n\nOffering free primary care in a familiar setting can help address the need, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is how we\u2019re going to create long-term change,\u201d Nader said. \u201cGetting at the root of the problem.\u201d\n\nFishline is working with the nonprofit West Sound Free Clinic to provide no-cost care at its campus off Viking Avenue on the first Wednesday of each month. Fishline is the fourth location for the free clinic, and the first outside Bremerton. The mobile clinic served 307 patients in the past year.\n\nWest Sound Free Clinic co-director and nurse Carrie Bivens said she hasn\u2019t seen the need for free care diminish in the county, even since the rollout of the Affordable Care Act extended health insurance to more residents. More than 20,000 people in Kitsap have obtained coverage through Washington\u2019s health exchange, either by purchasing qualified health plans or signing up for the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program.\n\nBut there still is a portion of the county\u2019s population that isn\u2019t insured, including about 30 percent of Fishline clients. Bivens said some people who have coverage can\u2019t afford the out-of-pocket fees required when they use their plans.\n\n\u201cThey flat out can\u2019t afford insurance even if they have it,\u201d Bivens said.\n\nFor those residents, West Sound Free Clinic is one of the few options for receiving primary care locally. Bivens said many of the patients the program helps are homeless. A significant number are immigrants.\n\nFounded in 2012, the clinic is staffed by a small team of volunteer doctors and nurse practitioners. The providers offer health screenings and treat a wide range of common maladies, like colds, infections, aches and pains. The clinic works with other organizations to provide free medications, lab tests, medical imaging and specialty care as needed.\n\nBivens said she finds the volunteer work particularly rewarding. Since the services are free, there\u2019s no insurance paperwork to worry about. Providers take their time getting to know patients.\n\n\u201cYou get to practice medicine in its purest form,\u201d Bivens said. \u201cThis is really why we all got into this in the first place.\u201d\n\nGood as that might sound, recruiting providers remains the free clinic\u2019s biggest challenge. Host organizations like Fishline have been eager to partner with the clinic, but Medical Director Dr. Patrick Casy said the group can\u2019t expand into more areas of the county unless additional physicians and nurse practitioners volunteer.\n\n\u201cIf we could find more providers, we could open more clinics,\u201d he said.\n\nFREE CLINIC West Sound Free Clinic provides no-cost care on four days each month: 4-7 p.m. first Wednesday each month at North Kitsap Fishline, 787 NW Liberty Lane, Poulsbo.\n\n5-7 p.m. second Monday each month at St. Vincent de Paul, 1117 N.
