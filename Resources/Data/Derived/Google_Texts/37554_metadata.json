The south Georgia city is a few miles from the Florida line and only about 80 miles from Mayo\u2019s Florida campus in Jacksonville.\n\nAt the time the deal was reached, Robert Trimm, president and CEO of Satilla, cited the economic vulnerability of standalone hospitals at a time when health care is rapidly evolving.\n\nSteering a lone community hospital through those dizzying changes would be \u2018\u2018challenging if not impossible,\u2019\u2019 Trimm said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all need a big brother.\u201d\n\nJimmy Lewis, CEO of HomeTown Health, an organization of rural hospitals in Georgia, said Monday that the Mayo pullout \u201cclearly means [Satilla] has an uncertain future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis came out of the blue,\u2019\u2019 Lewis said. \u201cIt would appear that the hospital has been losing increasing amounts of money since the Mayo takeover.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a large hospital and a vital hospital for that area,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe hospital facilities are still owned by the Ware County Hospital Authority, and board member Bill Parham told the Florida Times-Union newspaper that he heard of Mayo\u2019s pullout after the fact.\n\n\u201cThe board has been told nothing,\u201d Parham told the newspaper. \u201cI was a little flabbergasted.\u201d\n\nParham, who directs emergency medical services for Ware County, said he is disappointed to see Mayo leave.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a tragic loss\u2019\n\n\u201cThey had brought in a lot of physicians,\u201d were increasing the types of specialty care available and had raised the level of health care overall, Parham said.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s a tragic loss. I sure am disappointed,\u201d Parham said, according to the Times-Union.\n\nOwen Herrin, past chairman of Satilla Health Services, said in a statement Friday, \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the positive relationship we\u2019ve had over the past three-and-a half years with leadership, physicians and staff at Mayo Clinic in Florida.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, Mayo Clinic has helped the hospital achieve advancements in quality of care, and improved hospital facilities by bringing in the latest technology to assist patients,\u2019\u2019 Herrin said. \u201cAlong with Mayo Clinic, we are deeply committed to a smooth transition and moving forward to meet the needs of our patients, staff and the region.\u201d\n\nMayo spokesman Kevin Punsky said Monday in an email to GHN that Mayo Florida\u2019s decision \u201chas absolutely no impact on the ownership of the Satilla assets, which remain as they were prior to Mayo Florida\u2019s involvement.\u201d\n\nThe transition will not be immediate, he added.\n\nAsked about the hospital\u2019s future, Punsky said, \u201cThe Waycross hospital was viable before Mayo Clinic\u2019s involvement and will continue to be viable after the transition is made back to the community board of directors.\u2019\u2019\n\nKane, the health care consultant, said Mayo \u201coperates in a rarefied segment of the health care industry. With the Cleveland Clinic [in Ohio], Johns Hopkins [in Maryland] and a few others, Mayo competes for patients and talent worldwide.\u201d\n\nOperating and sustaining community hospitals, he said, \u201care not the highest and best use of Mayo\u2019s time and capital.\u201d\n\nBeyond its famed medical complex in Rochester, Minn., and campuses in Arizona and Jacksonville, Mayo has a network of clinics and hospitals serving communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa.\n\n\u201cMayo Clinic\u2019s Florida campus has been privileged to work with hospital staff in Waycross, and we are honored to have been a part of the Waycross community,\u201d Dr. Gianrico Farrugia, CEO of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Florida campus, said in a statement Friday.\n\nEva Byrd, executive director of the Waycross-Ware County Chamber of Commerce, sounded an optimistic note about Satilla\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cHaving the Mayo name was a big deal,\u2019\u2019 Byrd said Monday. But she added, \u201cI think the biggest thing is that it\u2019s the people that made our hospital great. And the people are still here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/widetile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/smalltile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/largetile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc31b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLong-term success as an independent hospital is increasingly difficult,\u2019\u2019 said Chris Kane, a health care consultant with DHG Healthcare in Atlanta.\n\u201cThis may have been a factor in Mayo\u2019s decision.\u201dThree years ago, Mayo Clinic, a renowned Minnesota-based health system, struck an agreement with Satilla Health Services \u2014 featuring a 231-bed hospital and two nursing homes \u2014 and renamed it Mayo Clinic Health System in Waycross.\n\u201cDuring this time, Mayo Clinic has helped the hospital achieve advancements in quality of care, and improved hospital facilities by bringing in the latest technology to assist patients,\u2019\u2019 Herrin said.\nThe south Georgia city is a few miles from the Florida line and only about 80 miles from Mayo\u2019s Florida campus in Jacksonville.\nMayo Clinic\u2019s startling decision to pull out of its \u201cintegration agreement\u2019\u2019 with Satilla Health Services has left the South Georgia hospital with an uncertain future."}
