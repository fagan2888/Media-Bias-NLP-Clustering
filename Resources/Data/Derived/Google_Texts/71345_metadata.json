Seattle\u2019s Chris Matthews made the biggest catch by an unknown player since David Tyree\u2019s helmet grab. The undrafted wide receiver from Kentucky \u2014 via the CFL \u2014 made the first catch of his NFL career an acrobatic 44-yard gain. And he tied the score near halftime with an 11-yard TD reception.\n\nButler did it. Rookie defensive back Malcolm Butler rebounded from Jermaine Kearse\u2019s breathtaking catch to sneak in front of Ricardo Lockette for the title-clinching pick.\n\nLook at Lynch go. Tailback Marshawn Lynch caffeinated the Seattle team with his relentless style. He wore down the Pats in the second half, but was a spectator on Seattle\u2019s final offensive play.\n\nWorst\n\nPass fail. Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell called one of the worst plays in Super Bowl history. With Seattle at the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line, clock to crunch and Marshawn Lynch frothing, Russell Wilson fired a pick to rookie DB Malcolm Butler.\n\nLane change. Jeremy Lane boasted that the Seahawks would stop Rob Gronkowski. The cornerback intercepted Tom Brady \u2014 the quarterback\u2019s first red-zone pick in the playoffs since 2007 \u2014 but never returned. Lane broke his left arm when he was tackled.\n\nBad Bruce. Seattle\u2019s Bruce Irvin was ejected after starting a brawl as the Pats attempted to run out the clock.\n\nGame balls\n\nTom Brady\n\nHe overcame two poor decisions on picks to stage a legacy-defining fourth-quarter drive. Picking on the injury-ravaged Seahawks secondary, Brady eluded pressure, stepping up in the pocket to find Julian Edelman and Shane Vereen. Brady set a Super Bowl record for completions with 37. None was bigger than his last. He found Edelman for a go-ahead touchdown in a fourth quarter that was as impressive as it was convincing.\n\nMalcolm Butler\n\nThe undrafted rookie from West Alabama made a play that will provide him free dinners for life in the greater Boston area. After wide receiver Jermaine Kearse pulled off a David Tyree moment with a bobbling, falling catch against Butler, the cornerback responded moments later. With the Seahawks inexplicably passing from the 1-yard line, Butler jumped a slant to Ricardo Lockette. He picked off the pass, sealing an improbable fourth-quarter comeback.\n\nChris Matthews\n\nThe undrafted wide receiver from Kentucky delivered the best game of his life on the biggest stage. He entered the game with no NFL receptions. As in zero. He caught a 44-yard pass that set up a score, then hauled in an 11-yard touchdown. He eclipsed 100 yards but missed out on a trip to Disneyland when the Seahawks failed on their final drive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NFL,Patriots,Super Bowl,Tom Brady", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The best and worst from the Patriots\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd stunning 28-24 win over the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX.", "title": "Patriots vs. Seahawks: Best, worst from Super Bowl XLIX", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/02/01/patriots-vs-seahawks-best-worst-super-bowl-xlix/32493/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/02/fbn-gronk.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The best and worst from the Patriots\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd stunning 28-24 win over the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX.", "creator": "@troyrenck", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/02/01/patriots-vs-seahawks-best-worst-super-bowl-xlix/32493/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/02/fbn-gronk.jpg", "title": "Patriots vs. Seahawks: Best, worst from Super Bowl XLIX", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The best and worst from the Patriots\u2019 stunning 28-24 win over the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf123\"", "article_summary": "The best and worst from the Patriots\u2019 stunning 28-24 win over the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX.\nChris MatthewsThe undrafted wide receiver from Kentucky delivered the best game of his life on the biggest stage.\nThe undrafted wide receiver from Kentucky \u2014 via the CFL \u2014 made the first catch of his NFL career an acrobatic 44-yard gain.\nSeahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell called one of the worst plays in Super Bowl history.\nMalcolm ButlerThe undrafted rookie from West Alabama made a play that will provide him free dinners for life in the greater Boston area."}
