As we mentioned in the Sochi live blog, following Dario Cologna's gold medal win in the 30-kilometer skiathlon this morning, tennis great and fellow Olympian Roger Federer sent his fellow Swiss countryman a nod of congratulations on Twitter.

Seeing an athlete of Federer's stature acknowledge fellow athletes is always heartening. Federer also showed some love for the Dufour-Lapointe sisters, two of whom struck gold and silver respectively in the ladies' moguls yesterday.

Some of the Federer-themed Twitter accounts were happy about that.

But one response to Federer's tweet about Cologna was too incredible to go unmentioned.
