PATH train service from Midtown to Jersey City and Hoboken is suspended through Tuesday evening’s rush hour, extending a closure that began on Sunday afternoon after a fire at the 23rd Street station in Manhattan, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials.

Service was also shut down to Midtown on Sunday evening and Monday and Tuesday mornings, forcing riders to take trains from the World Trade Center PATH station to Jersey City. Officials didn’t release a time frame for when full service would return for the system’s more than 250,000 daily riders.

The fire, which a Port Authority spokesman said occurred near the 9th Street PATH stop, shut down service between New Jersey and the PATH’s 33rd Street station but service was restored by Monday’s rush hour. On Tuesday morning, officials said, a smoky condition had returned in the same area as the fire. A preliminary review found that a repair splice between an old cable and a replacement cable was the cause, officials said.

Port Authority officials said much of the cabling in the Manhattan tunnel is decades old. The authority was exploring ways to accelerate upgrades to miles of old wiring, “while minimizing the reductions in service that will be needed to make the upgrades,” according to a news release.

NJ Transit was cross-honoring all PATH tickets, and free ferry service was being offered to stranded riders. Passengers reported large crowds on the World Trade Center line on Tuesday morning.
