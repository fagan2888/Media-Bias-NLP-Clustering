What is more interesting is Murdock\u2019s rationale for calling Carson a \u201creal black president.\u201d Carson, presumably, would bridge the racial divide, says Murdoch, and that means he\u2019d be the true unifier the country needs. There\u2019s really no need to recite the long and steadily growing litany of Carson\u2019s idiocies on everything from taxes \u201csimply tithe,\u201d to comparing Obamacare to slavery, claiming that arming kindergarten teachers is the way to stop a mass killer, and his equating homosexuality with bestiality. Or even his reach back a millennium to chastise the citizens of Pompeii for not running away from the lava to save their lives when Vesuvius erupted.\n\nCarson is on an incredible roll. He knows that his nutty quips will be spread eagled over every media outlet and roil legions on Facebook and social media. He\u2019s at or near the top of heap in some polls as a top GOP presidential candidate and that show him even more implausibly actually beating Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical head to head showdown. But beyond his endless milking of his rags-to-successful-neurosurgeon story and the inane quips about President Obama and Democrats before packs of ultraconservative fawners and groupies, what makes him real political timber, let alone presidential stuff?\n\nCarson initially got and keeps currency because he\u2019s black and can be relied on to make the most ridiculous, media grabbing quips on anything that crosses his mind. But as Murdoch hints in his \u201creal black president\u201d tout of Carson, he can say what GOP ultraconservatives and unreconstructed bigots want to say about Obama, but it just sounds better coming out of Carson\u2019s mouth. The GOP has turned this tactic into a studied art with black conservatives such as Clarence Thomas. But Carson makes far better copy than Thomas, because, unlike Thomas, Carson actually speaks, and when he does, he\u2019ll say something just ludicrous enough to get attention.\n\nIn the Obama era the GOP has worked overtime to tout, cultivate, prop up, and showcase a motley collection of black GOP candidates for a scattering of offices. The aim is two-fold: to find that someone who can have just enough luster and media appeal to be a counterbalance to Obama while at the same time allowing the party to thump its chest and claim it\u2019s not racist.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume that Carson has a real chance to bag the GOP nomination and even the presidency. How would this \u201creal black president\u201d actually govern? Carson has so far not put pen to paper and laid out a comprehensive program and position on the budget, government spending, civil rights enforcement, the environment, crime control, the military, and foreign policy.\n\n\u201cPresident \u201c Carson\u2019s position\u2019s on the issues must be pieced together from his statements in debates and interviews and speeches He will spend big on and radically expand the size of the military. In the process, he will not tie the military\u2019s hands. He backs the use of torture in fighting terrorism He will boost trade and eliminate deficits by imposing \u201cstiff tariffs\u201d on all imported goods. On civil rights and civil liberties, he sees no pattern of racial profiling in the disproportionate number of minority arrests. He touts stand your ground laws. And on his signature worry, gay rights, he will accept gay marriage because it\u2019s the law, but would do nothing to expand protections and rights for gays.\n\nHe would covertly spy on government workers to make sure they are not slacking off. And while he\u2019s at it, he would unilaterally cut the budget by 10 percent for every government agency. Public education would go the same way. He called it a \u201cpropaganda system.\u201d He would ignite a stampede by the government to back vouchers, charter schools, and any and every type of private school to take up the slack.\n\nSince he has relentlessly attacked the Affordable Care Act, branding it tantamount to slavery, he would cheer yet another effort to gut, if not outright eliminate it altogether. The climate change argument will get nowhere with Carson. He has called it \u201cdistracting and irrelevant.\u201d Being the loud outspoken man of the faith he purports to be, he\u2019s declared creationists, not evolutionists, have \u201cgod\u2019s ethics.\u201d He will give a fresh nod to creationism in the schools. Likewise, given his staunch pro-life, anti-abortion view, he will ban all abortions soon after fertilization and absolutely oppose any abortion for \u201cconvenience\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s fervent backers see all of this as the prescription for a new type of White House, and better still a change in the substance and style of governance. It will, of course, be nothing short of a colossal disaster and turn government into a laughingstock. But then again that\u2019s how Murdoch\u2019s \u201creal black president\u201d will govern.\n\nEarl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.
