If liberalism is to succeed, Obama and de Blasio need to make the case for it to the American people and execute it effectively.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday this past weekend, conservative icon George Will said he hopes there is a resurgence of liberalism in America, as \u201cthere is nothing better for American conservatism than periodic examples of untrammeled liberalism.\u201d\n\nObama and de Blasio serve as these examples. If Will is right, Americans will be appalled by the effects of both leaders, and flock to the Right for alternatives. And Republicans need to be ready with, and united behind, effective solutions to America\u2019s problems on all levels of government.\n\nAs Will explained, after 1964, Lyndon Johnson \u201chad huge majorities in Congress\u201d and \u201chad his way.\u201d Then, \u201cRepublicans won five of the next six and seven of the next nine presidential elections.\u201d Will said he gives de Blasio \u201cthree years and people will be begging to return to something else.\u201d\n\nIf Will is wrong about the long-term benefits of short-term liberalism for conservatives, and the President and NYC Mayor pass the test, they will gain Americans\u2019 favor, thereby causing an increase in elected liberals.\n\nSo far, however, both leaders are struggling. Within one week of assuming office, de Blasio has already moved to crush small businesses and raise taxes.\n\nHe vowed to ban horse-drawn carriages from New York City, claiming the industry abuses horses. Regardless of the reason, such a decision is an unusual and strange first move for a newly elected official.\n\nCritics charge that one possible explanation behind the mayor\u2019s decision is corruption. One of de Blasio\u2019s major campaign donors is a real estate executive who has ties to city property and crusaded against carriage horses even before the most recent mayoral election, the American Spectator noted. This has prompted an outcry from those whose livelihood is threatened by de Blasio\u2019s decision.\n\nDe Blasio also promised New York City that he would raise taxes on the rich in the already over-taxed city. People \u2014 and their money \u2014 have been fleeing New York City\u2019s oppressive taxes, according to How Money Walks, which uses IRS data. De Blasio\u2019s policies will likely increase this exodus.\n\nLiberalism is also failing its other test. Obama\u2019s policies have led to a terrible economy, and his signature law is crumbling, hurting Americans in the process. Obamacare has \u2018uninsured\u2018 more people than it has insured, raised the price of health insurance and care, and caused an exodus of doctors, all while wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Americans are not convinced Obamacare is working.\n\nThe American people, who bear the burden of these policies\u2019 negative effects, have little reason to keep faith in the parent ideology, liberalism. Ideology is proven effective when its resulting policies benefit Americans, and ineffective when they don\u2019t. Under Obama and de Blasio, prospects are looking bleak for the far-left movement.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Liberalism is now being tested in America, as two of America\u2019s most spotlighted and powerful politicians -- President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio -- implement their liberal agendas.
