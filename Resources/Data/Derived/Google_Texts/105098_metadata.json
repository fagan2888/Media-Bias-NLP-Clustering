The opt-out for religious nonprofits doesn't qualify, she said.\n\nThe contraceptive mandate requires employer-sponsored health insurance plans to cover certain FDA-approved contraception without any cost-sharing, Corbin explained.\n\nCertain religious institutions\u2014\u201clike churches, synagogues, and mosques\u2014are completely exempt\u201d from the contraception mandate, she said.\n\nReligiously affiliated nonprofits\u2014like religious universities and charities\u2014\u201cdo not have to pay for contraception or even include it in their health care plans,\u201d Corbin said.\n\n\u201cInstead, once a religiously affiliated nonprofit declares its religious opposition to contraception, the responsibility for contraception coverage passes to its insurance carrier,\u201d Corbin explained.\n\n\u201cA nonprofit may obtain its exemption in two ways,\u201d she said: a \u201cself-certification declaring that it is a religious nonprofit that \u2018oppose[s] providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered' and mail the form to its health insurance company,\u201d or \u201cthe nonprofit may provide a similar notice, along with the name and contact information of its insurer\u201d directly to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIf filing such paperwork is considered a substantial burden, \u201cthen almost anything would amount to a substantial religious burden,\u201d she said.\n\nNo Exemption\n\nThe idea that religious nonprofits are just being hypersensitive is one of the most offensive responses to the lawsuits in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Gregory S. Baylor of Alliance Defending Freedom, Washington, said at a March 10 symposium.\n\nBaylor represents several of the religious nonprofits at the Supreme Court.\n\nReligious nonprofits aren't asking to force their views on others, just to be able to live out their faith, Baylor said.\n\nInstead, the federal government is taking over the religious nonprofits' health plans to provide contraceptives that violate the groups' religious beliefs, Baylor said. In their view, they are being forced to \u201cfacilitate evil,\u201d he said.\n\nOne way to avoid that is to give religious nonprofits the same exemption that is available to houses of worship, Baylor said.\n\nBut it is factually incorrect that religious nonprofits are getting any kind of exemption to the contraception mandate, Baylor said.\n\nThe Obama administration provides two ways of complying with the contraception mandate: providing the contraceptive coverage or filing a self-certification via the so-called accommodation, he said.\n\nBut that accommodation is a method of compliance, not an opt-out, Baylor said. The nonprofits are necessary and active participants in the provision of these contraceptives, he said.\n\nWrong on Religion\n\nMoreover, Baylor said regardless of whether others view the accommodation as a substantial burden on the nonprofit's religious exercise, that is a question left exclusively to the nonprofit itself.\n\nSecond guessing nonprofits' religious analysis is \u201ctotally out of bounds,\u201d Baylor said.\n\nThe government doesn't dispute that the nonprofits \u201csincerely object to being forced to facilitate access to contraceptives and abortifacients through their own plans,\u201d a Supreme Court brief filed by Baylor on behalf of several religious universities said.\n\nA long line of Supreme Court cases, including Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 82 U.S.L.W. 4636, 2014 BL 180313 (U.S. June 30, 2014) , \u201cconfirms beyond cavil that courts have neither the authority nor the competence to second-guess the reasonableness of those sincere beliefs,\u201d the brief said.\n\nWrong on Law\n\nCorbin acknowledges that \u201ccourts cannot and should not rule on theological questions.\u201d But \u201cclaims of substantial religious burden often depend on purely secular factual and legal assumptions,\u201d she said.\n\nCourts \u201ccan and should resolve\u201d those disputes, Corbin said.\n\n\u201cAt the most basic level, the objecting nonprofits misunderstand how the contraception mandate works,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTheir belief that they are complicit in the sin of contraception use rests on the assumption that their written refusal triggers the provision of contraception,\u201d Corbin explained.\n\nBut, as \u201ca matter of law, they are wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is the Affordable Care Act, not the paperwork, that requires contraceptive coverage, Corbin said. \u201cAll the paperwork does is extricate the nonprofit organizations from the coverage.\u201d\n\nWill the Supreme Court decide to decide the substantial burden question, or leave it to the nonprofits themselves? Court watchers will get their first hint March 23, when the court holds 90 minute oral arguments in seven consolidated cases.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kimberly Robinson in Washington at krobinson@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jessie Kokrda Kamens at jkamens@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/aca-accommodationslight-burden-n57982068634/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration's work-around for religious nonprofits from the Affordable Care Act's so-called contraception mandate is either a slight burden on the groups' religious beliefs or a method...", "title": "ACA Accommodation:Slight Burden or Evil Means?"}, "csrf-token": "rIVJzqhf6yHvS4CVF4sCmckP0GAmWKXfaYsufWGG00IO44_Ng9Qc-LV1ej_LLiBgivRvoyoiDrbaj0YXwFRnARqKsRj0-rEBPUO4SjFyAzc1:NZFLX_JmHFeKvuhKC0_zp9t-oWqlhpJZfvuJOX_ngsCEVbdxEPzLV7pSOloiAO2wfKR2biczkcjSyxRzuZEpyVq-jCWmo3u7JBR4OnFj63U1", "description": "The Obama administration's work-around for religious nonprofits from the Affordable Care Act's so-called contraception mandate is either a slight burden on the groups' religious beliefs or a method", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fb6\"", "article_summary": "If filing such paperwork is considered a substantial burden, \u201cthen almost anything would amount to a substantial religious burden,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFiling paperwork to obtain a religious exemption does not constitute a substantial burden,\u201d Caroline Mala Corbin, wrote in an ACS March issue brief.\nWrong on LawCorbin acknowledges that \u201ccourts cannot and should not rule on theological questions.\u201d But \u201cclaims of substantial religious burden often depend on purely secular factual and legal assumptions,\u201d she said.\nA long line of Supreme Court cases, including Burwell v.
