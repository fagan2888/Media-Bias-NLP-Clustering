It's not a merger and both will remain independent.\n\nIn California and nationwide, many hospitals and physician groups are joining forces to improve their negotiating clout with employers and insurers. In particular, insurance companies have been narrowing their provider networks to hold down costs and big health systems don't want to be left out.\n\nDoctors and hospitals are also looking to collaborate more in response to changes under the federal Affordable Care Act that reward coordinated care.\n\nFull coverage: Obamacare rolls out\n\n\"This affiliation demonstrates a steadfast commitment to integrated delivery of patient care, which is essential to providing excellent quality care while reducing costs,\" said Barry Arbuckle, chief executive of MemorialCare Health System.\n\nUC Irvine and MemorialCare said their partnership will start with opening new primary-care health centers. They said these centers will be staffed by UC Irvine primary-care physicians and aim to serve communities that are lacking in medical services.\n\nUC Irvine Medical Center is a 412-bed hospital and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the UC Irvine School of Medicine.\n\nMemorialCare, a nonprofit health system, has six hospitals and about 3,000 affiliated physicians. It includes Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and Miller Children's Hospital.\n\nALSO:\n\nObamacare Q&A: Explaining your options\n\nOfficials race to explain healthcare law to Californians\n\nInsurers limiting doctors, hospitals in new exchange market", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "UC Irvine and MemorialCare Health System agree to partner, not merge", "date": "2013-10-02", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Amid growing healthcare consolidation as Obamacare rolls out, UC Irvine and MemorialCare Health System have agreed to a partnership deal.", "title": "UC Irvine and MemorialCare Health System agree to partner, not merge", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-uc-irvine-memorialcare-partner-20131002-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-524c56df/turbine/la-fi-mo-uc-irvine-memorialcare-partner-20131002", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, uc irvine, memorialcare health system", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/77635389", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, uc irvine, memorialcare health system", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "UC Irvine and MemorialCare Health System have agreed to a partnership deal."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd74b2\"", "article_summary": "Amid growing healthcare consolidation as Obamacare rolls out, UC Irvine and MemorialCare Health System have agreed to a partnership deal.\nUC Irvine Medical Center is a 412-bed hospital and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the UC Irvine School of Medicine.\nThe UC Board of Regents said Wednesday it has approved an affiliation between UC Irvine Health and MemorialCare, two major hospital systems in Southern California.\nUC Irvine and MemorialCare said their partnership will start with opening new primary-care health centers.\nIn particular, insurance companies have been narrowing their provider networks to hold down costs and big health systems don't want to be left out."}
