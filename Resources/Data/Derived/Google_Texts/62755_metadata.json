That\u2019s according to Sen. Joe Negron (R-Stuart), who says he wants to set the record straight.\n\nLast month, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement finished a final assessment surveying law enforcement crime labs. They found that there are more than 13,000 untested rape kits across the state\u20149,400 of which should be tested.\n\nNegron says according to FDLE\u2019s report, there are legitimate reasons other kits were not tested.\n\n\u201c41 percent, there was a decision by the victim not to proceed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were cases where the State Attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute, 20 percent the person pled guilty. So, it was not tested\u2014maybe it should be\u2014because it was deemed not necessary. And, then there are a significant number of cases that there are non-reporting victims who would like to have a kit collected, but make a decision that maybe any of us would disagree with, but they do make a decision on their own as adults that they do not wish to report the name of the person who may have perpetrated this crime.\u201d\n\nSen. Lizbeth Benacquisto (R-Fort Myers) is hoping to address the rape kits backlog, and her bill helps set guidelines for crime labs to follow.\n\n\u201cNationally, and in our state, there\u2019s an epidemic of sexual assault kits going untested,\u201d she said. \u201cFlorida took the first steps towards fixing this problem in our state last fiscal year, where\u2014under the leadership of Chair Negron, we funded an audit of law enforcement agencies statewide. And, the data collected shows that we have the opportunity in Florida to help thousands of victims. Testing those kits will provide valuable evidence that will help law enforcement and State\u2019s Attorneys lock up these predators.\u201d\n\nRep. Janet Adkins (R-Fernandina Beach) is carrying the measure in the House.\n\n\u201cHouse Bill 179 requires the timely submission and testing of DNA evidence collected in association with sexual assault investigations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bill requires FDLE and each laboratory within the statewide criminal analysis laboratory system in coordination with the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence to adopt and disseminate guidelines and procedures for the collection, submission, and testing of DNA evidence that is obtained in connection with an alleged sexual offense.\u201d\n\nThe bill states collected DNA evidence must be submitted to a crime lab within 30 days. The kit must also be tested within 4 months of submission. And, the guidelines must be adopted by the beginning of next year.\n\nRep. Julio Gonzalez (R-Venice) questioned why this isn\u2019t being done now.\n\n\u201cWhy is this not being done,\u201d he asked. \u201dIt would sound like the collection of evidence should be almost automatically turned over to the appropriate authorities. Why isn\u2019t it done at this time?\u201d\n\nAnd, Adkins says that\u2019s a good question.\n\n\u201cSo, I think that\u2019s the question a lot of survivors are asking,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhen we began looking into this issue, we realized there is no statewide standard whereby once the evidence is collected, that it\u2019s submitted to the laboratories for testing. So, that\u2019s the purpose of this bill. Obviously, we need to deal with the backlog, but we also need to establish the policy moving forward that survivors of these crimes know and they can expect how they\u2019re going to receive justice.\u201d\n\nAnd, her bill passed the House Judiciary Committee unanimously. Benacquisto\u2019s measure also passed the Senate Appropriations committee Thursday with a unanimous vote\u2014sending both bills to their respective floors.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Bills creating statewide standards to help in the processing of Florida\u2019s thousands of untested rape kits as well as future kits are now heading to the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/bills-help-address-floridas-untested-rape-kits-backlog-head-house-senate-floors", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/467263905.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Bills creating statewide standards to help in the processing of Florida\u2019s thousands of untested rape kits as well as future kits are now heading to the", "title": "Bills To Help Address Florida's Untested Rape Kits Backlog Head To House, Senate Floors"}, "story_id": 467263868, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Bills To Help Address Florida&#039;s Untested Rape Kits Backlog Head To House, Senate Floors"}, "nid": 13678, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "keywords": "rape kits, sexual assault kits", "wordCount": 780, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s an implication that the state\u2019s backlog of untested rape kits is due to inattention or lack of compassion for victims.\nThey found that there are more than 13,000 untested rape kits across the state\u20149,400 of which should be tested.\nBills creating statewide standards to help in the processing of Florida\u2019s thousands of untested rape kits as well as future kits are now heading to the floors of the House and Senate, after passing their last committees Thursday.\n\u201cHouse Bill 179 requires the timely submission and testing of DNA evidence collected in association with sexual assault investigations,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNationally, and in our state, there\u2019s an epidemic of sexual assault kits going untested,\u201d she said."}
