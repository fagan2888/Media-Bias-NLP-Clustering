The study found that a one-year increase in RNs' average tenure on a hospital unit was associated with a 1.3 percent decrease in length of stay, according to the announcement.\n\nResearchers found paying staff RNs overtime to work more hours on a unit is more cost-effective than relying on temporary staffing agencies to fill RN vacancies. Staffing RNs, as opposed to unlicensed assistive personnel, also shortened lengths of stay, but those numbers increased when a member of the nursing team left or the team got a new member, according to the announcement.\n\n\"Reducing length of stay is the holy grail of hospital management because it means patients are getting higher quality, more cost-effective care,\" senior study author Patricia Stone, Ph.D., R.N., centennial professor of health policy at Columbia Nursing, said in the announcement. \"When the same team of nurses works together over the years, the nurses develop a rhythm and routines that lead to more efficient care. Hospitals need to keep this in mind when making staffing decisions--disrupting the balance of a team can make quality go down and costs go up.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy: Involving patients in nurses' shift change improves outcomes, prevents errors\n\nGive nurses the power to make care decisions to improve patient outcomes\n\nICU staffing levels affect high-risk patient outcomes\n\nNurse mindfulness can decrease patient pain, stress during procedures", "article_metadata": {"description": "More experienced nurses deliver better\u00a0patient care\u00a0and shorten\u00a0length of stay, according to an\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Economic Journal: Applied Economics.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "More experienced nurses deliver better\u00a0patient care\u00a0and shorten\u00a0length of stay, according to an\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Economic Journal: Applied Economics.", "title": "Experienced nurses shorten length of stay, improve patient outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/experienced-nurses-shorten-length-stay-improve-patient-outcomes/2014-04-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Columbia University School of Nursing,HR & Workforce Management,length of stay,Nursing,overtime,patient care & outcomes,Patricia Stone,Veterans Administration Healthcare System", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddda6\"", "article_summary": "More experienced nurses deliver better patient care and shorten length of stay, according to a study published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics.\n\"When the same team of nurses works together over the years, the nurses develop a rhythm and routines that lead to more efficient care.\nTo learn more:- here's the study abstract- read the announcementRelated Articles:Study: Involving patients in nurses' shift change improves outcomes, prevents errorsGive nurses the power to make care decisions to improve patient outcomesICU staffing levels affect high-risk patient outcomesNurse mindfulness can decrease patient pain, stress during procedures\nThe study found that a one-year increase in RNs' average tenure on a hospital unit was associated with a 1.3 percent decrease in length of stay, according to the announcement.\nPatients get the best care when treated in units staffed with nurses who have extensive experience in their current job, according to a study announcement."}
