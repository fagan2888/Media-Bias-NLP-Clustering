Expansion was originally required by the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d But the U.S. Supreme Court made it optional for the states. Nebraska is one of 19 states that have so far refused to do so.\n\nThis year, supporters of expansion like Sen. John McCollister are arguing it would be good for the state\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThe financial incentives to adopt programs like transitional healthcare insurance are compelling. Expansion will bring an estimated $2 billion into our state over five years, and create 10,000 jobs either directly or indirectly,\u201d McCollister said.\n\nUnder the proposal, Nebraska would use federal dollars to buy private insurance for people with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line \u2013 that\u2019s about $22,000 for a single parent with one child. Sen. Kathy Campbell says one new wrinkle in this year\u2019s proposal is the idea of making job training or education available to recipients.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important is the new component, and that is to provide a workforce education, training, pathway to help people move beyond public assistance,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nSen. Heath Mello says the combination of Medicaid coverage and job training will be more effective lifting people out of poverty than cutting taxes.\n\n\u201cCutting taxes does not give people higher-wage jobs when they\u2019re working an $11 an hour job at a restaurant. This is going to help them get the skills they need to move from an $11 an hour job without health insurance to an $18 an hour job with health insurance. They then can pay their premium and transition off of this private program,\u201d Mello said.\n\nThe proposal is modeled after the Medicaid expansion proposal passed in Arkansas. (For a study of the program in Arkansas, click here). In a news conference immediately after the senators spoke, Jim Vokal of the Platte Institute, which opposes expansion, criticized that model.\n\n\u201cThe Arkansas approach to Medicaid expansion is an example of a government program that leaves recipients of aid worse off. It crowds out support for traditional Medicaid from state budgets, and at the same time it traps recipients of (a) private insurance entitlement by creating disincentives for earning more income,\u201d Vokal said.\n\nVokal noted the Arkansas Legislature has voted to scrap that state\u2019s program at the end of this year. (To see the Arkansas legislation repealing that state's expanded Medicaid program, click here). The scheduled end of the program in Arkansas is not new -- it was a \"sunset \"included in the legislation creating the program in 2013, and was reaffirmed by a vote last year. A task force and Gov. Asa Hutchinson are pursuing changes they want in order to continue the program.\n\nOpponents have also argued if the federal government falls short of its promise to fund 90 percent of the cost of expanded Medicaid, the state will have to make up the difference.\n\nSupporters say if the feds fall short, the state program will terminate automatically. But McCollister said he doesn\u2019t think the risks of that happening are very high. Referring to his commute from Omaha to Lincoln on a wintry morning, McCollister said, \u201cLife is full of risks. As I drove down here this morning, there\u2019s probably a pretty good chance that I\u2019d end up in the ditch. As we look at the situation with this particular bill, and expansion in general, it\u2019s a risk we can accept.\u201d\n\nMello, a registered Democrat in the nonpartisan Unicameral, praised the support of Republicans like McCollister and Campbell.\n\n\u201cThis is a commonsense, bipartisan, third-way approach to address a lingering issue that that we have not seen leadership from our executive branch or the opposition to provide an alternative plan to provide health insurance to working Nebraskans. And I\u2019m confident the more our colleagues learn about it, the more they will see this is a conservative approach to addressing a lingering issue facing the state economically and fiscally in years to come,\u201d Mello said.\n\nGov. Pete Ricketts has maintained his opposition to the proposal, and at the opposition news conference, Sen. Bill Kintner predicted a unified front among opponents.\n\n\u201cI think the key there\u2019s not a single conservative in this body who supports Medicaid expansion. If you watch the body over the last year you know that we\u2019re usually splintered; there\u2019s always a couple that peel off and go this way or that way,\u201d Kinter said. However, he added, \u201cNot this time. Every single conservative in the Legislature opposes Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nFifteen senators attended the opposition press conference. It takes only 17 to block legislation using a filibuster, and opponents said there were five more senators opposed to expansion who wanted to attend but weren\u2019t able to. If that\u2019s true, the push for Medicaid expansion could be frustrated once again this year.\n\nAnd on another subject, lawmakers decided not to spend any more time this year debating legislation that would have authorized counties to collect co-payments from jail inmates for medical treatment. The decision means that proposal will not pass this year.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been expanded to clarify the status of Medicaid expansion in Arkansas.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://netnebraska.org//sites/all/modules/custom/netvideo/images/net_logo_black.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7140\"", "article_summary": "The proposal is modeled after the Medicaid expansion proposal passed in Arkansas.\nIf that\u2019s true, the push for Medicaid expansion could be frustrated once again this year.\n\u201cI think the key there\u2019s not a single conservative in this body who supports Medicaid expansion.\nEditor's note: This story has been expanded to clarify the status of Medicaid expansion in Arkansas.\n\u201cThe Arkansas approach to Medicaid expansion is an example of a government program that leaves recipients of aid worse off."}
