In South Carolina, for example, collective bargaining agreements apply to all of a company\u2019s eligible workers, not just those who are dues-paying members of a union.\n\nSuch laws have led to declining union membership, particularly in the South.\n\nUnion membership in South Carolina hit a peak of 5.1 percent in 2001 and \u2014 apart from a slight increase during the Great Recession \u2014 has fallen since then.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s biggest union battles is expected to heat up again this year as the International Association of Machinists attempts to organize workers at Boeing Co.\u2019s production facilities in North Charleston, including the 787 Dreamliner campus.\n\nA union vote last year was canceled days before it was to take place. The IAM has said it plans to call for another election as early as this year.\n\nThe Charleston region has had one of the state\u2019s biggest drops in union membership, according to separate data compiled by Georgia State University. In 2014, the latest data available at the metro level, union members in the three-county Charleston region made up 0.8 percent of the workforce. That compares with 4.7 percent in 2000.\n\nNationally, 11.1 percent of workers were members of a union in 2015, unchanged from the previous year, according to the federal report.\n\nRoughly half of the 14.8 million union members in the U.S. lived in just seven states \u2014 California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and New Jersey \u2014 although those states accounted for only about one-third of employment nationally.\n\nThe federal statistics show union members in 2015 had higher median weekly earnings than workers who were not union members \u2014 $980 per week compared to $776 per week.\n\nMen had slightly higher rates of union membership \u2014 11.5 percent \u2014 than women, at 10.6 percent.\n\nReach David Wren at 843-937-5550 or on Twitter at @David_Wren_", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "S.C. union membership falls in \u201915, now lowest rate in the nation, Boeing/Aerospace, \r\nBoeing/AerospaceBusiness-Local, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Bureau of Labor Statistics,Labor unions,Machinists union,North Carolina,South Carolina,Unions", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The percentage of South Carolina workers who were members of a labor union in 2015 dropped to its lowest level in at least a decade, and the Palmetto State now ranks last in the nation for employees represented by organized labor.", "title": "S.C. union membership falls in \u201915, now lowest rate in the nation", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160128/160129351/sc-union-membership-falls-in-x2019-15-now-lowest-rate-in-the-nation", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160128/PC05/160129351/AR/0/AR-160129351.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160128/PC05/160129351/AR/0/AR-160129351.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The percentage of South Carolina workers who were members of a labor union in 2015 dropped to its lowest level in at least a decade, and the Palmetto State now ranks last in the nation for employees represented by organized labor.", "title": "S.C. union membership falls in \u201915, now lowest rate in the nation", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160128/PC05/160129351/AR/0/AR-160129351.jpg?201601282140", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160129351}}, "keywords": "S.C. union membership falls in \u201915, now lowest rate in the nation , Boeing/Aerospace, \r\nBoeing/AerospaceBusiness-Local, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Bureau of Labor Statistics,Labor unions,Machinists union,North Carolina,South Carolina,Unions", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-28T17:44:45Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T21:40:00Z", "author": "David Wren"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The percentage of South Carolina workers who were members of a labor union in 2015 dropped to its lowest level in at least a decade, and the Palmetto State now ranks last in the nation for employees represented by organized labor."}, "article_summary": "Men had slightly higher rates of union membership \u2014 11.5 percent \u2014 than women, at 10.6 percent.\nUnion membership in North Carolina \u2014 which, at 1.9 percent, had the lowest total in 2014 \u2014 grew last year to 3 percent, now the second-lowest in the nation.\nThere were 41,000 union members in South Carolina last year.\nUnion membership in South Carolina hit a peak of 5.1 percent in 2001 and \u2014 apart from a slight increase during the Great Recession \u2014 has fallen since then.\nThe federal statistics show union members in 2015 had higher median weekly earnings than workers who were not union members \u2014 $980 per week compared to $776 per week."}
