The Congressional Budget Office, though, already has warned of \u201cdramatic\u201d debt trouble ahead.\n\nThe Department of Treasury last week released the numbers for fiscal year 2015, announcing a $44-billion drop in the deficit from the year before. The deficit stands at $439 billion, which is 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nShaun Donovan, director of the Office of Management and Budget, heralded the numbers as the lowest deficit since President Obama took office.\n\n\u201cThe deficit has been reduced by nearly three-fourths as a share of the economy since 2009,\u201d Donovan said in a written statement, adding that the figures represent \u201cthe most sustained deficit reduction since just after World War II.\u201d\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, in the aftermath of the recession, federal deficits exceeded a trillion dollars each year.\n\nRomina Boccia, a senior budget analyst at The Heritage Foundation, said the deficit has shrunk despite, not because of Obama.\n\n\u201cThe administration is wrongfully claiming credit for the reduction in the deficit,\u201d said Boccia, the think tank\u2019s Grover M. Hermann fellow.\n\nThe real credit, she said, belongs to an economy that recovered from the 2008 recession and \u201cexcessive stimulus spending that finally dried up.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal 2015, the government spent more than it brought in from taxpayers, but at a lower rate. Government outlays totaled $3.69 trillion\u2014up 5 percent from the year before, according to the report. But federal revenue increased by 8 percent to $3.25 trillion.\n\nPointing to these numbers, Donovan called for a reversal of \u201cthe harmful cuts\u201d of sequestration and passage of the White House\u2019s proposed fiscal 2016 budget.\n\nA mechanism of the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration mandates automatic and immediate across-the-board cuts to both defense and domestic programs if spending exceeds specific caps.\n\nStill, the narrowed budget deficit pales in comparison to an already ballooning federal government debt, Boccia said.\n\nThe administration has placed the nation \u201con a fiscal collision course,\u201d Boccia said, \u201cwith Obamacare, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid driving more than half of the projected increase in spending over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office continues to warn of mounting debt, noting that \u201cthe long-term outlook for the federal budget has worsened dramatically over the past several years.\u201d\n\nReduced now, the deficit soon will grow, according to CBO. Citing increased health care and retirement entitlements in addition to mounting debt payments, the agency predicts that budget deficits \u201cwill rise substantially, to $1 trillion in 2025.\u201d\n\nIn June, CBO reported that without budget reform, \u201cthe federal debt held by the public would exceed 100 percent of GDP [gross domestic product].\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan group Campaign to Fix the Debt warns that dropping deficits won\u2019t mean it becomes easier to confront the debt.\n\n\u201cCongress should not use this temporary decline in the deficit as an excuse to pass budget-busting, deficit financed legislation,\u201d the organization said. \u201cInstead we should reform our unsustainable fiscal trajectory when times are relatively good.\n\n\u201cThe task will only get harder with time,\u201d the group warned.\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s announcement comes as a new budget battle looms in Congress.\n\nLawmakers have until Nov. 3 to increase the federal debt limit so the government can keep up with current expenditures, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced earlier this month.\n\nIn an open letter earlier this week to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Lew warned authorized funds would be exhausted by then unless Congress raises the debt ceiling.\n\nLegislators have until Dec. 11 to hammer out a budget deal to fund the government for the following year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the administration trumpets a shrunken budget deficit to justify more spending, the Congressional Budget Office warns of \u201cdramatic\u201d debt trouble ahead.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As the administration trumpets a shrunken budget deficit to justify more spending, the Congressional Budget Office warns of \u201cdramatic\u201d debt trouble ahead.", "title": "Obama Celebrates Drop in Deficit as Debt Balloons", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151019_DeficitShrink.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-26T11:37:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1XipCVD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As the administration trumpets a shrunken budget deficit to justify more spending, the Congressional Budget Office warns of \u201cdramatic\u201d debt trouble ahead.", "title": "Obama Celebrates Drop in Deficit as Debt Balloons", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151019_DeficitShrink.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-10-22T19:21:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-26T11:37:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama debt, Obama deficit, Budget Deficit, national Debt, Treasury Department, Congressional Budget Office, sequestration, Jack Lew"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce56d\"", "article_summary": "Still, the narrowed budget deficit pales in comparison to an already ballooning federal government debt, Boccia said.\nThe Obama administration is trumpeting a shrunken federal deficit as new justification for more spending and an end to mandatory budget cuts.\nShaun Donovan, director of the Office of Management and Budget, heralded the numbers as the lowest deficit since President Obama took office.\nThe Congressional Budget Office, though, already has warned of \u201cdramatic\u201d debt trouble ahead.\nThe Department of Treasury last week released the numbers for fiscal year 2015, announcing a $44-billion drop in the deficit from the year before."}
