Alito\u2019s latest financial disclosure shows that he also owns stock in Johnson Controls worth $15,000 or less.\n\nFederal law prohibits judges from hearing a case if they have a financial interest, however small, in a participating company. That includes the financial holdings of spouses and minor children. The statute does not provide any penalty for violations.\n\nThe case illustrates the pitfalls justices and their close family members face by owning stocks in individual companies that could have legal disputes before the high court. In 2009, Alito took part in a case about curse words on television involving ABC Inc. and other networks, even though he owned stock in ABC\u2019s parent, Walt Disney Co., at the time. Alito later said his participation was an oversight.\n\nHarris said Breyer will continue participating in the latest case, which considers whether the federal government can offer financial incentives to large electric customers that save energy during times of peak demand. Power companies say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission overstepped its authority in approving the program.\n\nJohnson Controls is listed on one of the petitions in the case as owning EnergyConnect, Inc., a party supporting the government\u2019s energy conservation rule. EnergyConnect helps electricity customers reduce their energy consumption and stands to benefit if the regulation is upheld.\n\nEach justice follows his or her own procedures for checking possible conflicts of interest, said court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.\n\nBreyer\u2019s wife sold her shares a day after the court heard oral arguments, Harris said. He noted that Breyer has already devoted \u201csubstantial time\u201d to the case.\n\n\u201cHe has no reason to believe that the financial interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case,\u201d Harris said.\n\nStock ownership and the need for recusal has influenced past cases where one justice must sit out. It sets up the undesirable possibility of the court dividing 4-4, leaving the lower court ruling in place and setting no precedent to guide other courts.\n\nIn 2008, Chief Justice John Roberts took no part in a product liability case against Pfizer Inc. because he owned less than $15,000 of the company\u2019s stock. The justices split 4-4, which allowed lawsuits against the company to proceed.\n\nRoberts later sold his shares of Pfizer, which allowed him to participate in other cases involving the pharmaceutical maker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer had a conflict of interest under federal law when he heard arguments in a case this week despite his wife's ownership of stock in a company involved in the dispute.", "pubdate": 20151016, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer had a conflict of interest under federal law when he heard arguments in a case this week despite his wife's ownership of stock in a company involved in the dispute.", "title": "Supreme Court justice took part in case despite wife's stock ownership", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RTXT6Z3.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/conflict-interest-supreme-court-justices-stocks/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer had a conflict of interest under federal law when he heard arguments in a case this week despite his wife's ownership of stock in a company involved in the dispute.", "title": "Supreme Court justice took part in case despite wife's stock ownership", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RTXT6Z3.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Supreme Court"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Business, Making Sen$e, stocks, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer had a conflict of interest under federal law when he heard arguments in a case this week despite his wife\u2019s ownership of stock in a company involved in the dispute.\nFederal law prohibits judges from hearing a case if they have a financial interest, however small, in a participating company.\n\u201cHe has no reason to believe that the financial interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of the case,\u201d Harris said.\nEach justice follows his or her own procedures for checking possible conflicts of interest, said court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.\nIn 2008, Chief Justice John Roberts took no part in a product liability case against Pfizer Inc. because he owned less than $15,000 of the company\u2019s stock."}
