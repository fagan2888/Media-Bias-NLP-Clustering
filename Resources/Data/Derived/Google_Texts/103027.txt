Issa Rae may be an awkward girl but nothing about her business moves are awkward.

According to Deadline, the filmmaker is working on a new project titled Insecure with HBO. The project will focus on the experiences of an African American woman in today’s day and age. The series was originally set to premiere in 2013. However, it never came to light.

Now, Issa is set to bring it back with Larry Wilmore. Wilmore co-created and wrote the project with Issa. As of right now, no debut date has been released but Deadline is reporting it will be a part of HBO’s 2015 comedy pilot slate.

Congratulations to Issa! We hope Insecure receives a green light confirmation.
