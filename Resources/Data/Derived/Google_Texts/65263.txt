The East Heights United Methodist Church had an estimated $300 in damage after vandals smashed multiple pumpkins in the church's pumpkin patch.

The vandalism happened sometime Friday night according to church leaders.

The east-side church says 10 pumpkins, valued at $300 were destroyed.

"It's kind of disappointing because it's money that is lost and you know that the people who did it weren't thinking about," said Skyler Sprecker.

Sprecker is a teenager in the church's youth program.

The money raised by the pumpkin patch goes toward youth programs at the church, such as youth missions and community projects.

"All the money that we raise...goes to these important trips for these kids," said Director of Youth Ministries Paige Nelson.

Nelson says this is not the first time that vandals have done damage to the church's pumpkin patch and she hopes it is the last time she has to deal with it.

"Just stop doing it," she said. "There are other things you can do, that you can have fun without destroying other people's property."
