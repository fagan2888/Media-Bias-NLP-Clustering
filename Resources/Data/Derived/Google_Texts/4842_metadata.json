(OTCQB:HEWA), the only VIPPS accredited online and mail-order pharmacy licensed in all 50 states, today made public letters sent to Senator John McCain (R-Az.), Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Senator Paul Rand (R-Ky.), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Congressman John Boehner (R-Oh.). The letters address the re-introduction of legislation that would allow Americans to purchase prescription drugs from Canada. The bill known as the \u201cSafe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act\u201d has been advocated by Senators John McCain and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nIn the letters Mr. Lalit Dhadphale, President and CEO of HealthWarehouse.com, stated, \u201cWe understand the intent of the bill is to help Americans who cannot afford their medications. We would also ask for your support in promoting home grown, legitimate American options that clearly address lack of affordability when it comes to prescription drugs. I believe we have made a small contribution in this area, but there are countless Americans we have not yet reached who need our service. We would appreciate your help in reaching these people as well.\u201d\n\nA HealthWarehouse.com customer, Steven T, commented, \u201cI was skeptical of healthwarehouse.com after dealing with Canadian pharmacies for years. I feel I have now found the pharmacy I am going to use for the rest of my life. I received a package from Kentucky! For the first time it did not come from India. I'm still in shock.\u201d\n\nYou can read more of these stories at http://www.healthwarehouse.com/reviews.\n\nWith the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, HealthWarehouse.com has seen a dramatic change in customer demographics. Today, nearly 90% of its customers have some form of health insurance, but are forced to pay out of pocket for their prescription medications in contrast to 10% when the company started in 2007. The company continues to provides American\u2019s with a legitimate option to affordably purchase medications in United States, therefore the reintroduction of the \u201cSafe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act\u201d is increasingly unnecessary.\n\nThe letters goes on to state that with more than $200 billion worth of brand name medications coming off patent and becoming generic over the past five years, there is \u201cNo excuse for Americans being unable to purchase their medication due to lack of affordability.\u201d\n\nCopies of the letters are available at https://www.healthwarehouse.com/news\n\nAbout HealthWarehouse.com\n\nHealthWarehouse.com, Inc.
