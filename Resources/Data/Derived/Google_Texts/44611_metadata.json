Jeb Bush, businessman and reality TV host Donald Trump, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nThe group discussed issues ranging from the Iran deal to abortion, touting resumes and rattling off proposed policy plans to sell their presidential qualifications.\n\nHere are some of the most notable stances of the night.\n\nImmigration\n\nBush discussed his plan to provide a path to \u201cearned legal status\u201d for illegal immigrants already in the county.\n\nHe said he would support E-Verify to address those who move to the U.S. with a legal Visa and overstay, but took an empathetic approach to illegal immigration, calling it \u201can act of love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe the people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family, but we need to control our border,\u201d Bush said.\n\nRubio took a similar stance, bypassing Republican criticism of his 2013 leadership in drafting a comprehensive immigration plan that included a path to citizenship.\n\n\u201cThis is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they\u2019ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\nTrump veered in the opposite direction, advocating a wall that \u201chas to be built quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need\u2026to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out.\u201d\n\nObamacare\n\nDespite the recent Supreme Court decision, repealing and replacing Obamacare remained a key selling point for the Republican hopefuls as the candidates repeatedly vowed to take on the healthcare law if they were to arrive at the White House.\n\nThough Trump called Obamacare a \u201ccomplete disaster,\u201d he touted the success of a nationalized single-payer healthcare system in other countries.\n\n\u201cAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about his Medicaid expansion in Ohio, Kasich noted he funneled the money into rehabilitation programs and treatment for mentally ill prisoners. He connected healthcare to criminal justice, saying it costs his state $22,500 a year to keep mentally ill prisoners behind bars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather get them their medication so they can lead a decent life,\u201d he said, adding that 80 percent of those in Ohio prisons are addicted to drugs. \u201cWe now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent.\u201d\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy overwhelmingly remains the top issue priority for voters, but the subject was only briefly touched on during the debate.\n\nRubio ran through a concise checklist of his policy proposals, including a 25 percent tax rate for businesses, a regulatory budget and a repeal of Dodd-Frank, which he said is \u201ceviscerating\u201d small businesses.\n\nPaul, Walker and Huckabee advocated tax cuts while Christie briefly outlined a plan to raise the Social Security retirement age by two years to reduce entitlement spending.\n\nBush focused on reforming \u201cjob killing\u201d regulations, using energy policy\u2014such as the XL Pipeline\u2014to create \u201chigh, sustained\u201d economic growth, and \u201cfixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well.\u201d\n\nCarson, meanwhile, pushed a flat tax, contending it would get rid of \u201cdeductions\u201d and \u201cloopholes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don\u2019t seem to ever think that they get a fair deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don\u2019t have a chance to move up.\u201d\n\nIran Deal\n\nAs Congress enters its August recess to weigh President Obama\u2019s Iran deal, the Republican candidates remained uniform in their hardline opposition.\n\nWalker said he would \u201cterminate\u201d the accord the first day he took office and reinstate U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\nHuckabee, meanwhile, said the U.S. \u201cgot nothing\u201d while Iran got \u201ceverything they want,\u201d contending the Obama administration conceded on \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d inspections and \u201cgave up\u201d on blocking Tehran from maintaining a nuclear capacity.\n\n\u201cWhen someone points a gun at your head and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nISIS\n\nModerator Megyn Kelly asked Cruz how he would destroy ISIS in 90 days, echoing a question the senator posed to General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in February.\n\nCruz called Dempsey\u2019s claim that a military solution would not destroy the terrorist group \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need is a commander in chief that makes clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul, who has blamed ISIS\u2019s rise on Republican foreign policy hawks, said the U.S. needs to stop sending arms to ISIS\u2019s allies, referring to the U.S.\u2019s plan to arm the Syrian rebels.\n\n\u201cISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create ISIS\u2014ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them.\u201d\n\nAbortion\n\nNoting the five undercover videos showing top Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetal tissue for research (Planned Parenthood has denied wrongdoing), Walker touted his record for defunding the organization more than four years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been pro-life. I\u2019ve got a position that\u2019s consistent with many Americans out there, in that I believe that that is an unborn child that\u2019s in need of protection out there,\u201d he said.\n\nHuckabee also referenced the videos, vowing to invoke the Fifth and 14th amendments to legally recognize personhood beginning at conception.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they\u2019re parts to a Buick,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio pushed a pro-life position, but his stance on a rape and incest exception remained hazy following questioning on his support. He denied ever \u201cadvocating\u201d the exceptions, but did not clarify his stance.\n\nHe noted that he believes \u201call human life\u201d is entitled to legal protection.\n\n\u201cFuture generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live,\u201d he said.\n\nGay Marriage\n\nOn the heels of a Supreme Court loss for advocates of traditional marriage, the candidates said little on the subject.\n\nKasich said he would accept the decision even though it contradicted his \u201ctraditional\u201d marriage views.\n\n\u201cIf one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That\u2019s what we\u2019re taught when we have strong faith,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul addressed the issue as one of religious liberty, echoing his campaign mantra, \u201cI don\u2019t want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The key quotes from the debate.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The key quotes from the debate.", "title": "GOP Candidates Said About Immigration, Abortion and the Economy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150807_2016Debate_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MWx8li"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The key quotes from the debate.", "title": "GOP Candidates Said About Immigration, Abortion and the Economy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150807_2016Debate_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-08-08T16:48:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Republican debate, presidential debate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32ed\"", "article_summary": "The top 10 Republican candidates hoping to call the White House home in 2016 duked it out Thursday night for the first presidential debate of election season.\nRubio took a similar stance, bypassing Republican criticism of his 2013 leadership in drafting a comprehensive immigration plan that included a path to citizenship.\nGay MarriageOn the heels of a Supreme Court loss for advocates of traditional marriage, the candidates said little on the subject.\nThe group discussed issues ranging from the Iran deal to abortion, touting resumes and rattling off proposed policy plans to sell their presidential qualifications.\nThe candidates who made Fox News\u2019 final cut included former Florida Gov."}
