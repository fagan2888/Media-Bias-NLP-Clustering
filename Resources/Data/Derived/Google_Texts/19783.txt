Since its debut in 1989, business news network CNBC has been a business news powerhouse on cable. But this year, the news leader had its worst ratings ever.

Despite appearing in almost 85 percent of homes, the network has recently been struggling in the ratings. CNBC, for instance, appears in 96.242 million households. Its next closest competition, the 7-year-old Fox Business Network, appears only in 75.501 million but is a close competitor in the ratings game.
