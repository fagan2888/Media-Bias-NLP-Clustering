He currently serves on the boards of directors of Care Management Technologies, Caregiver Services, HealthEdge Software and OmniGuide.\n\nIn 2015, the consumer will really be in the driver\u2019s seat, and this is especially true in the healthcare world. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, is here to stay. Now health insurers today have little choice but to dramatically revise their 50-year old business models that focused on employer-sponsored group products and focus on the consumers who have so much power going forward.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy for the insurers. They aren\u2019t well-liked by consumers. In Forrester\u2019s 2014 Customer Experience Index, health insurers earned a rating of \u201cpoor,\u201d which was lower than that of airlines and cable companies. So what should they do? It is a paradox, but in 2015, health insurers will need to start behaving like auto insurers do now.\n\nI love GEICO. Using the gecko as a brand image was outstanding, but then getting Ickey Woods some cold cuts \u2014 that was even better. Humor sells. GEICO was the among the first to address the consumer, but today most auto insurers now recognize the power of the consumer, and have tailored core operations to be consumer-focused.\n\nThese businesses embrace branding and marketing, price transparency, call center performance metrics, roadside claim adjudication and accelerated claim payments, all designed to drive customer loyalty and satisfaction for a product everyone hopes they\u2019ll never have to use. Sounds like a good model for health insurers to follow, right?\n\nHealth insurers have to think like consumers do in 2015, and this focus on the consumer is a seismic strategic shift. Fortunately for investors like me, such change drives enormous investment opportunity.\n\nImmediately after the ACA was passed in 2010, insurers reacted quickly to the emerging opportunity for accountable care organizations (ACOs), making significant investments to get access to clinical data and get closer to providers, with purchases of companies like Medicity and Axolotl.\n\nI predict a similar surge in acquisitions in 2015 as the insurers add technologies, products and services that deliver a differentiated consumer experience on price, quality and service. Significant investment will be required throughout the health insurers\u2019 value chains, from research to product development, to operations and to marketing and sales.\n\nValuations will rise, as well; just as we continue to see valuations of venture-backed companies in other industries soar (Uber raising capital at $40 billion), it\u2019s easy to foresee billion-dollar valuations for innovative health technology companies.\n\nI expect to see heavy emphasis in 2015 on technology solutions in the following areas:\n\nAutomated claims adjudication and payment software that drive administrative cost savings for payers while simultaneously promoting price transparency and easily understood claims payments for consumers;\n\nPopulation health management tools that identify the at-risk consumers and provide incentives to promote their engagement with health and wellness initiatives;\n\nMobile and telecommunication strategies with the potential to reach consumers on their own terms, including technologies that permit online appointment scheduling, prescription ordering and direct payments to providers; and\n\nSoftware that enables 24/7 customer service that is accessible via multiple platforms.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine a scenario where clever Super Bowl commercials in the coming years are no longer about GEICO\u2019s lizard and Flo from Progressive, but rather are delivered by the likes of Aetna, United and Humana.\n\nHowever, health insurers will have to put technological infrastructure in place to service their customers in the new world of consumer health insurance if they want to survive.\n\nFeatured Image: Adam Vilimek/Shutterstock (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/contributor/joe-riley/\" title=\"Posts by Joe Riley\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Joe Riley</a>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "In 2015, the consumer will really be in the driver\u2019s seat, and this is especially true in the healthcare world.
