As a former member of the party\u2019s all-power Politburo Standing Committee, he would be the highest-ranking Chinese official, sitting or retired, to go before a court since the 1980-1981 treason trial of Mao Zedong\u2019s wife and other members of the \u201cGang of Four\u201d who persecuted political opponents during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\n\nMany other purged officials have been pushed out without trial, sometimes with fatal consequences.\n\n___\n\nLIU SHAOQI __ Once considered the anointed successor to communist leader Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi was swept from power at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Formerly upheld as the model of a proper communist, Liu was vilified as a traitor and the party\u2019s chief enemy, leading to his death in detention in 1969 following years of physical mistreatment, medical neglect and constant interrogation. He was later formally vindicated.\n\nLIN BIAO __ Another putative heir-apparent to Mao, former star general Lin Biao died in a plane crash following his last-minute flight from China in 1971 after allegedly plotting a coup against the party leadership. Lin emerged after Liu\u2019s downfall, but fell out of favor amid the constant infighting and swirling intrigues of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nJIANG QING __ Mao\u2019s third wife and leader of the radical Gang of Four that guided the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing was arrested after attempting to seize power in the inner-party struggle that followed Mao\u2019s death in 1976. Jiang was accused of persecuting political enemies and causing the suffering of millions, but claimed at her 1980 trial that she had only been doing Mao\u2019s bidding. Sentenced to life in prison, she committed suicide while on medical release in 1991.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Zhou Yongkang indictment latest in China\u2019s political purges", "title": "Zhou Yongkang indictment latest in China\u2019s political purges", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Zhou Yongkang indictment latest in China\u2019s political purges", "title": "Zhou Yongkang indictment latest in China\u2019s political purges", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/03/zhou_yongkang_indictment_latest_in_chinas_political_purges/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/china-political-purges.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Zhou Yongkang indictment latest in China\u2019s political purges", "title": "Zhou Yongkang indictment latest in China\u2019s political purges", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/china-political-purges.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Christopher Bodeen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd400c\"", "article_summary": "Lin emerged after Liu\u2019s downfall, but fell out of favor amid the constant infighting and swirling intrigues of the Cultural Revolution.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsBEIJING (AP) \u2014 The indictment of China\u2019s former security boss Zhou Yongkang marks the latest chapter in the Communist Party\u2019s history of purging itself of leaders who\u2019ve fallen out of favor politically or whose alleged crimes appear too serious to go unnoticed.\n___LIU SHAOQI __ Once considered the anointed successor to communist leader Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi was swept from power at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.\nJiang was accused of persecuting political enemies and causing the suffering of millions, but claimed at her 1980 trial that she had only been doing Mao\u2019s bidding.\nZhou is charged with corruption and the leaking of state secrets."}
