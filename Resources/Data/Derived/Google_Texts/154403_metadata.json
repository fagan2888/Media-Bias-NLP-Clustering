The screen pivots to a mash-up of the comment from Trump as well as former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) and Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.).\n\nTrump has made a number of controversial statements about Hispanics since he jumped into the race. He\u2019s been quoted referring to Mexican immigrants as \u201cbringing drugs, they are bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists,\u201d as well as his defense of using the term \u201canchor babies.\u201d\n\nBush is also shown defending himself after using \u201canchor babies\u201d on a radio spot and later saying didn't regret using the term. The ad includes video of Walker agreeing with the call to end birthright citizenship of illegal immigrants.\n\nWalker has since walked back that support on two separate occasions, while Bush has said he meant the term in relation to organized immigration fraud schemes \u201cmore related to Asian people,\u201d not as a demeaning comment.\n\nClinton and Bush battled on Twitter last week over Bush\u2019s use of the term.\n\nThe move by the super-PAC is the latest in Democratic efforts to tie Trump\u2019s comments to the party writ large. The Democratic National Committee has repeatedly chided the party as the \u201cRetrumplican Party\u201d in press releases and some Republicans are worried his conduct may hurt the party\u2019s effort to maintain control of the Senate in 2016.\n\nTrump\u2019s net favorability rating with Hispanics has fallen to negative 50 percentage points, according to a Gallup poll released this week. But a July Univision poll of Hispanics suggested that the unfavorable perception hasn\u2019t had an impact on the party in general, as only 14 percent of Hispanics said they believed his rhetoric was indicative of the party.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Priorities USA hit the Republican Party over comments on immigration.", "description": "Priorities USA hit the Republican Party over comments on immigration.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Priorities USA hit the Republican Party over comments on immigration.", "title": "Clinton super-PAC links GOP to Trump", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252092-clinton-super-pac-links-gop-to-trump", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/hillaryclinton081015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T11:49:34-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-27T11:49-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252092-clinton-super-pac-links-gop-to-trump", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-27T10:32-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cheryl Segal", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Illegal immigration,Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-27T10:32:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T11:49:34-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252092-clinton-super-pac-links-gop-to-trump", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Priorities USA hit the Republican Party over comments on immigration.", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinton super-PAC links GOP to Trump"}, "dcterms.title": "Clinton super-PAC links GOP to Trump"}, "article_summary": "The move by the super-PAC is the latest in Democratic efforts to tie Trump\u2019s comments to the party writ large.\nClinton and Bush battled on Twitter last week over Bush\u2019s use of the term.\nThe screen pivots to a mash-up of the comment from Trump as well as former Gov.\nTrump has made a number of controversial statements about Hispanics since he jumped into the race.\nTrump\u2019s net favorability rating with Hispanics has fallen to negative 50 percentage points, according to a Gallup poll released this week."}
