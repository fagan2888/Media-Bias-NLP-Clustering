Instead, longevity and rank will be considered, he said.\n\nThe union has until June 18 to vote on the new contract. If passed, it will be forwarded to the City Council for final approval.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty creative proposal,\u201d Finnin said, without offering any specifics on the contract, which will probably be for two years.\n\nCouncilman Bob LeGare did not know whether a deal had been reached. However, he said, if both sides have reached an agreement, the upturn in the economy is probably a factor.\n\n\u201cIt took quite a bit of effort and work between the two parties,\u201d LeGare said. \u201cThe economy is way better than it was two years ago, and I think that has lot do with bringing both sides together.\u201d\n\nThere are other factors besides the better financial situation the city is in that may have played a role reaching an agreement quickly.\n\nThe council considered but scrapped a plan to ask voters to repeal a police-hiring mandate based on population growth. Also, the council is looking to place a property-tax increase on the November ballot dedicated to public safety.\n\nIn 2010, the City Council wanted to cut pay 5 percent for police and fire, and that drew the ire of the rank-and-file and led to contentious negotiations. The council backed off on those cuts, even though the city was in a rocky financial position.\n\nThis time around, councilwoman Barb Cleland, who is the chair of the Public Safety Committee, said better times means the city will be able to offer raises in the new contract.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good contract for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some raises. I had realized and other council members had realized we needed to pay our police officers a little more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora, police union reach tentative deal on new contract", "title": "Aurora, police union reach tentative deal on new contract", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/11/aurora-police-union-reach-tentative-deal-on-new-contract/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140611__COP_RJ23702p1.jpg", "height": 406}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140611__COP_RJ23702p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-11T15:06:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:34:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf8c\"", "article_summary": "The city of Aurora and the police union have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract.\nIf passed, it will be forwarded to the City Council for final approval.\nWhile the specifics of the contract are not known, Mark Finnin, president of the Aurora Police Association, said there aren\u2019t across-the-board raises.\nIn 2010, the City Council wanted to cut pay 5 percent for police and fire, and that drew the ire of the rank-and-file and led to contentious negotiations.\nHowever, he said, if both sides have reached an agreement, the upturn in the economy is probably a factor."}
