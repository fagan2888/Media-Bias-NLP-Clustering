William Barber at a Martin Luther King Day celebration at Riverside Church in New York City last month. We publish it today as we both reflect on the violence inflicted upon the people of Flint, Michigan, by the state\u2019s leadership and as we look toward weeks of voting in the presidential primaries. What values must guide our elected officials? What kinds of violence truly threaten our nation and our communities? Rev. Barber\u2019s moving speech offers a progressive moral compass for our political process. \u2014The Editors Ad Policy\n\nFor the past few weeks, we have been exposed to a flood of images of death and killing, with commentators of all stripes calling it terrorism, violence, and injustice out in California. The evil of taking a life is vile and vicious, by ISIS or any other thug\u2014by anybody that\u2019s just wanting to destroy life. We must pray for the families.\n\nBut as we look at these images, and listen to the diagnoses of the commentators, I hear a call from Dr. King and our ancestors to speak truth in the midst of terror, violence and injustice, to challenge a fundamental misdiagnosis against the opportunistic misdiagnoses of those who try to pimp and prostitute the deaths in California for their own vicious political agenda.

Barber II\n\nSome, like hosts on a certain sly-as-a-Fox television station, use the death of these innocent people to push their accusations\u2014their racist, fear-mongering agenda against the president, against immigrants, and against Muslims. One of these flaky Fox fellas said the greatest threat to national security ever is a president who is incapable, psychologically and politically, and who is not in the business of protecting America but protecting Muslims.\n\nIn the tradition of Dr. King, we do not agree with everything our president or any politician has said. [But] that statement is ridiculous. Muslims are Americans. Muslims are soldiers in our military. What is really going on here is what Cornel West might call the \u201cniggerization\u201d or the \u201cothering\u201d of certain people.\n\nYou know what that is. The definition of the N-word is not simply the dishonoring and devaluing of black people and the economic exploitation and political disenfranchisement of black people. \u201cNiggerization\u201d is the wholesale attempt to impede democratization, to turn potential citizens into intimidated, fearful, and helpless subjects. They use the attacks on Muslims the same way racists in the past and present use fear-mongering against blacks.\n\nAs my friend Phyllis Bennett and I discussed the other night, America does not have a \u201cMuslim problem\u201d or even a \u201cterrorism problem\u201d as much as we have a race problem\u2026a xenophobia problem.
