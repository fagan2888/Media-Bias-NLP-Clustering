Some are already negotiating with unions over benefits that could spill into 2018.\n\n\u201cThis is going to have a life of its own as the clock ticks closer to 2018,\u201d said Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.), a critic of the tax.\n\nThough the nickname suggests it will apply to a select few, experts say a majority of employers could eventually face the prospect of imposing what will be the first-ever tax on health care benefits.\n\nThe IRS began last month spelling out the nitty-gritty of how exactly the tax will work, though it left out many of the details employers say they need.\n\nAt issue is a 40 percent excise tax on the health benefits companies provide their workers above a certain threshold. In 2018, the tax will hit insurance and related perks valued at more than $10,200 for singles and $27,500 for families. So for family benefits worth $30,000, the tax would apply to the $2,500 that\u2019s above the limit.\n\nTaxing those benefits represents a major shift in generations-old tax policy.\n\nThe government has encouraged companies to offer health insurance by letting them write off from their taxes the cost of providing workers with coverage for more than a half-century, a byproduct of World War II-era wage controls.\n\nEager to attract workers and unable to increase pay, companies turned to expanding fringe benefits such as health insurance. But economists of all stripes have long complained the open-ended tax break companies get for providing that coverage drives up health care costs while disproportionately benefiting the affluent.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a major reason why millions of Americans get coverage through their jobs. So for lawmakers, it\u2019s long been all-but-politically untouchable. Ironically, Barack Obama as a presidential candidate attacked Sen. John McCain in 2008 for proposing to tax health benefits.\n\nUnions, which often have generous health benefits and have opposed the tax since the law\u2019s inception, say the looming levy is already becoming a factor in their contract negotiations.\n\n\u201cEmployers are coming to the table asking for cuts in benefits based on their preliminary projections around the tax,\u201d said Shaun O\u2019Brien, assistant policy director for health and retirement at the AFL-CIO, which backs repeal.\n\nThe National Education Association, which is also demanding the tax be rescinded, issued a report Thursday complaining it would disproportionately hit women and older workers.\n\n\u201cWe continue to support the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Kim Anderson, senior director of the group\u2019s Center for Advocacy and Outreach. But \u201cthe excise tax on high-cost plans can randomly and unfairly cause hardship to American workers and their families\u201d and \u201cCongress must repeal the excise tax.\u201d\n\nThe administration has long argued it is a modest step to get health care costs under control. It \u201cwill affect only a small portion of the very highest-cost health plans \u2014 a total of 3 percent of premiums in 2013,\u201d Obama economic adviser Jason Furman wrote in a 2009 White House blog post.\n\nThe threshold at which the tax kicks in is higher than current average premium rates, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The typical family plan cost $16,834 last year, according to Kaiser, while the average individual plan cost $6,025.\n\nBut the tax is more onerous than it appears, experts say, in part because it hits more than just traditional health insurance.\n\nIt also applies to health savings and flexible spending accounts, including money workers now sock away tax-free for medical expenses. Supplemental insurance plans will also be included and, potentially, on-site clinics companies set up for their workers, the IRS said last month.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even if a company ducks the tax in 2018 \u2014 and many have been trying to wring savings out of their plans in anticipation of the new rules \u2014 they may only get a temporary reprieve.\n\nThat\u2019s because Congress pegged the tax threshold to a relatively slow measure of inflation.\n\nIt\u2019s linked to the consumer price index plus 1 percent, even though medical costs typically grow much faster. Private health care spending per enrollee will grow by an average of 5.6 percent annually over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while inflation will increase by 2 percent per year.\n\nThat means the tax will ensnare more companies over time, with some likening it to the alternative minimum tax, originally aimed at the very wealthy but which trickled to those further down the income ladder.\n\nAbout one-third of employers will be hit by the tax in 2018 if they do nothing to change their plans, according to a March survey by Mercer, a benefits consulting firm. By 2022, almost 60 percent will be facing the levy.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 is really a misnomer,\u201d said Beth Umland, Mercer\u2019s director of research for health and benefits. \u201cPotentially any employer could be hit by this tax.\u201d\n\nFormer Obamacare adviser Jonathan Gruber, in one of the now-infamous videos that emerged late last year, said rising medical costs ensure the Cadillac tax will eventually all but eliminate the break companies get for providing health insurance.\n\nEconomists in both parties have been pushing the idea for decades as a way to slow health care costs, because it amounts to a cap on benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing, many say, because overly generous insurance shields beneficiaries from costs, which encourages them to use more services, driving up prices for everyone else. It\u2019s also a matter of fairness, some say, because forgoing taxes on health care benefits amounts to a major break for those with jobs offering coverage.\n\n\u201cCapping the tax benefit for employer-sponsored health insurance, I think, is a great idea,\u201d said Len Burman, head of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \u201cProviding an open-ended subsidy for health insurance, which encourages people to get plans that do less to restrain spending, contributes to rising health care costs. Most economists who\u2019ve looked at health care spending have concluded that.\u201d\n\nThe tax could eventually hit all health plans, \u201calthough you probably wouldn\u2019t get policymakers to admit to that,\u201d Burman siad. He added he doubts Congress will allow that to happen, saying lawmakers will come under substantial pressure to ease the tax.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason why Congress\u2019 independent budget scorekeepers have said Obamacare won\u2019t add to the deficit, and why the tax will be tough to repeal. The levy, which is projected to generate $87 billion over a decade, ramps up slowly, but is estimated to eventually produce so much money that it alone will cover the cost of providing insurance subsidies through the program\u2019s exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis provision is one of several in the ACA designed to promote fiscal responsibility and slow the growth of health care costs,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo.\n\nBut as the tax begins to loom larger, the criticism is getting louder.\n\nSome say it will punish companies that have been trying to rein in costs.\n\nBusinesses have been pushing their workers out of high-cost plans and into ones with bigger deductibles while simultaneously offering them health savings accounts to help them cope with the increased costs. That may be for naught, because both would be subject to the levy.\n\n\u201cIf employees participate in HSAs and FSAs through payroll deductions, which employers have been encouraging them to do \u2014 now it\u2019s going to hurt the employers,\u201d said Rick Grafmeyer, a tax lobbyist and former Republican tax aide. \u201cSo now they\u2019re putting the employers in the position of having to say, \u2018No, no, no, we don\u2019t want you to participate as much in these things because it will likely cause us to pay the Cadillac tax.\u2019 It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nOthers complain the tax discriminates against those in the Northeast and West Coast, because health costs tend to be higher there than in the South or Midwest.\n\n\u201cYou could have parts of the country where [they] have the most lavish coverage and not be subject to the tax,\u201d while in other areas \u201cpeople will get hammered and forced into some pretty bad choices,\u201d said Courtney, the Connecticut lawmaker.\n\nRepublicans grouse about parts in the law providing higher thresholds for when the tax kicks in for those in high-risk professions, such as law enforcement and fire-fighting, which they call a sop to unions.\n\nLast month, Rep. Frank Guinta (R-N.H.) introduced legislation to cancel the tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to undermine the employer-sponsored system, and it\u2019s going to do the exact opposite of what anyone\u2019s vision of health reform would have done, which is to provide greater access to health care coverage,\u201d said Katie Mahoney, director of health care policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThis is something that we are really trying to educate folks about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Experts say a majority of employers could eventually face the tax on health care benefits.", "title": "Next big Obamacare battle: 'Cadillac tax'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/obamacare-health-care-cadillac-tax-116659.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/03/150403_cadillac_tax_surgery_gett_1160y.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Cadillac Tax,Money,Democrats,Republicans,Health Care,Employment,Finance,Employee Benefits,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Experts say a majority of employers could eventually face the tax on health care benefits.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca190\"", "article_summary": "Ironically, Barack Obama as a presidential candidate attacked Sen.
