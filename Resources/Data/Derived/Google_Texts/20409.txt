Officials are investigating a collapsed roof at the Forest Park Medical Clinic.

The Panama City Fire Department and Panama City Police Department responded to the call Saturday afternoon to the building located on 23rd Street.

Fire officials said they believe the cause of the collapse may be from the recent heavy rain.

Authorities don't believe anyone was inside of the building during the time the roof caved-in.

Gulf Power is working with the Panama City Fire Department to shut off the power inside of the building.

The investigation is still ongoing.
