In some respects, TAA has been everyone’s second-favorite option for some time. Many conservatives see the program as wasteful spending that they’d rather cut out altogether. To the extent they have supported TAA, they’ve largely done so as a political gesture to secure cover for those who support trade but also face pressure from labor unions and other trade critics.

Liberals, on the other hand, would prefer a much broader suite of job retraining and unemployment safety nets for all workers. But they’ve only been able to secure it for one subset of workers—those deemed to have lost out under free-trade deals—and so they’ve fought to keep this program, even if they don’t support the trade agreements that have been the vehicles for it.

Four years ago, Republicans brought three bilateral trade agreements to a near-halt over concerns TAA doled out too much money for too little gain.

Last week, House Democrats pulled their support of TAA, a program they have heavily supported in the past, once it became clear that enough lawmakers in both parties were prepared to vote in favor of fast-track authority, which House Democrats oppose in large numbers.
