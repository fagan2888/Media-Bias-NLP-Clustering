Angus King, a Democrat-aligned Senator from Maine, to get a less-than-pleasant phone call from Team Hillary over this remark on CNN. Time to add Sen. King to the enemies list?\n\n\"There\u2019s no question the State Department screwed up here,\" King said. \u201cThere should be accountability, in my opinion. Who did make that decision in light of all that information, and why, and I think that\u2019s a very fair question. I\u2019m surprised and disappointed. I know some people have been shifted around, but if accountability means anything, it means somebody paying a price for having made a disastrous decision....I haven\u2019t seen any real accountability, and I think that\u2019s been a failure in this whole process,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe's plainly correct about the lack of accountability. Several State Department staffers were shuffled around, but no one was fired. Prominent figures who helped mislead the public about the nature of the attacks were promoted. And 16 months after the fact, none of the the terrorists responsible for the killings have been brought to justice -- a quest that's currently \"stalled,\" according to the Washington Post. Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State when the Benghazi massacre took place on the highly symbolic anniversary of 9/11. She was informed in real time that the raid was a coordinated terrorist attack, yet allowed the administration to distort that fact for public consumption. Her chief of staff and assistant secretary dressed down and demoted Gregory Hicks for questioning the White House's talking points, and for cooperating with a Congressional investigation. The US' security chief in Libya testified that Clinton \"absolutely\" would have been aware of repeated requests for an increased security presence in the increasingly perilous city; these requests were ignored and denied. A recent bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report slammed the State Department's actions before and after the deadly raid. The Clinton State Department renewed its lease on its acting consulate in Benghazi just months before Amb. Stevens was assassinated. The lease included an effective waiver, allowing the facility to operate below minimum security standards. This decision was made despite two previous attempted attacks, including a bombing in July of 2012. Meanwhile, Hillary's political team has started fretting that an unhelpful narrative is beginning to take root:\n\nDems in Clinton's orbit growing alarmed that conventional wisdom of \"minimal accomplishments\" is taking hold http://t.co/N2y3MYNZu5 \u2014 Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) January 20, 2014\n\nHugh Hewitt memorably stumped a Politico reporter recently by asking the simple question of what Hillary Clinton has actually accomplished. Not reputational stuff, not miles she's traveled, not name recognition metrics -- tangible accomplishments. As Americans assess Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, they'll remember America's incoherent posture on Syria (which eventually blew up in our faces), a messy, hands-off war in Libya (which blew up in our faces), and massive tumult in Egypt -- during which America appeared to have zero influence. And there was the embarrassing Russian 'reset' gaffe, plus the far more damaging failed reset itself. There is one major Obama-era accomplishment for which Hillary does deserve considerable credit, however. Obamacare, with all its various betrayals promises, was her plan:\n\n\n\nI'll leave you with this. \"We don't really know...\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dereliction..05/26/2016 18:30:45PM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Dereliction.", "title": "Guy Benson - Dem Senator: The State Department Really 'Screwed Up' in Benghazi", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/01/21/dem-senator-yep-the-state-department-screwed-up-in-benghazi-n1781598", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/267/b83466a3-8baa-455b-94b1-5d8dc21b8d6e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Dereliction.", "title": "Guy Benson - Dem Senator: The State Department Really 'Screwed Up' in Benghazi", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/01/21/dem-senator-yep-the-state-department-screwed-up-in-benghazi-n1781598", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/267/b83466a3-8baa-455b-94b1-5d8dc21b8d6e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Dem Senator: The State Department Really 'Screwed Up' in Benghazi, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Clinton State Department renewed its lease on its acting consulate in Benghazi just months before Amb.\n\"There\u2019s no question the State Department screwed up here,\" King said.\nHillary Clinton was the Secretary of State when the Benghazi massacre took place on the highly symbolic anniversary of 9/11.\nSeveral State Department staffers were shuffled around, but no one was fired.\nWho did make that decision in light of all that information, and why, and I think that\u2019s a very fair question."}
