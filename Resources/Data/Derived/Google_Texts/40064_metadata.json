John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost federal taxpayers more than $4 billion.\n\nKasich underestimated the cost of the first 18 months of his Obamacare expansion by roughly $1.5 billion. Enrollment was almost 600,000 at the end of June, compared to Kasich\u2019s projection of 366,000.\n\nOhio\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost far more than expected because enrollment and per-member costs have both rocketed past expectations.\n\nBenefit costs have exceeded $325 million each of the past three months, and $300 million for seven months straight \u2014 setting a course for a total cost of $5 billion before the end of the year.\n\nObamacare provides 100 percent federal funding for Medicaid expansion through December 2016. States will have to pay five percent of the expansion\u2019s benefit costs starting in 2017, and ten percent starting in 2020.\n\nWith the federal government $18 trillion in debt, Congress is likely to make changes to Obamacare expansion\u2019s federal match rate, further increasing the burden on participating states.\n\nFACT SHEET: Ohio Obamacare Expansion\n\nJonathan Ingram, research director at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said Ohioans should be concerned about who will be \u201cput on the chopping block\u201d to pay for Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion.\n\n\u201cIn just a year and a half, Kasich has put more able-bodied adults on Medicaid welfare than his administration thought would ever enroll,\u201d Ingram said.\n\nHe noted that in Kasich\u2019s last two budgets, the governor \u201chas proposed slashing funding to pediatric hospitals and kicking pregnant women off of the program.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point, one thing is clear: Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion costs are rapidly spiraling out of control,\u201d Ingram said.\n\n\u201cInstead of traveling the country lobbying other states to expand ObamaCare, maybe Gov. Kasich should stay in Ohio and figure out a way to roll back his disastrous Medicaid expansion, before it\u2019s too late,\u201d he concluded.\n\nKasich contends his Obamacare expansion is paid for with \u201cOhio money\u201d and has been a rousing success. He has bashed the policy\u2019s critics during unofficial presidential campaign trips to South Dakota, Montana, Georgia, North Carolina and elsewhere.\n\nRELATED: Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Roadshow hits Iowa\n\nOn Thursday when the Ohio Department of Medicaid released its June spending report, Kasich was in Tennessee telling Gov. Bill Haslam to keep up the fight for Obamacare expansion.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is people develop an ideological opposition and then don\u2019t want to be confused by the facts,\u201d Kasich told Obamacare supporters at a campaign stop in Nashville.\n\nUnlike Kasich, who expanded Medicaid unilaterally after Ohio lawmakers voted against it, Haslam \u2014 a fellow Republican \u2014 has been thwarted repeatedly by his state\u2019s legislature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Obamacare expansion that gives Medicaid to working-age Ohioans with no kids or disabilities was supposed to cost $2.6 billion in the first 18 months.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "An Obamacare expansion that gives Medicaid to working-age Ohioans with no kids or disabilities was supposed to cost $2.6 billion in the first 18 months.", "title": "At $4 billion, Ohio Obamacare expansion blows past projected costs - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/ohio-ocare-expansion-cost-2015-06.png", "updated_time": "2016-01-21T10:07:40+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/228330/ohio-obamacare-expansion-4billion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "An Obamacare expansion that gives Medicaid to working-age Ohioans with no kids or disabilities was supposed to cost $2.6 billion in the first 18 months.", "title": "At $4 billion, Ohio Obamacare expansion blows past projected costs - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/ohio-ocare-expansion-cost-2015-06.png"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-07-10T08:19:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-21T10:07:40+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "ohio medicaid, medicaid expansion, obamacare expansion, john kasich, kasich obamacare, kasich medicaid, kasich obamacare expansion, kasich medicaid expansion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafbf\"", "article_summary": "John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost federal taxpayers more than $4 billion.\nOhio\u2019s Obamacare expansion has cost far more than expected because enrollment and per-member costs have both rocketed past expectations.\nAfter just 18 months, Ohio Gov.\nFACT SHEET: Ohio Obamacare ExpansionJonathan Ingram, research director at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said Ohioans should be concerned about who will be \u201cput on the chopping block\u201d to pay for Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion.\nKasich underestimated the cost of the first 18 months of his Obamacare expansion by roughly $1.5 billion."}
