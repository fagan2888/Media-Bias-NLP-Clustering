The Inspector General tells this committee they have referred multiple cases of improper audit selection to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution in 2014 alone,\u201d Roskam said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing hypothetical about that.\u201d\n\nRoskam noted that the GAO report identified multiple examples where the IRS did not adhere to its own internal controls and failed to document decisions concerning which organizations or individuals were audited.\n\nAccording to Roskam, this is a serious concern because without proper documentation, it is challenging to determine whether an audit was requested \u201cbased on merit or bias.\u201d Ultimately, Roskam said the lack of documentation hinders accountability.\n\nAt the hearing, several leaders of organizations who were audited by the IRS testified, including Michelle Easton, president of the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute (CBLPI), and Joseph Metzger, vice president of finance at the Leadership Institute. Both organizations are 501(c)3, conservative non-profits.\n\nEaston said that as president and a former attorney, she had always been cautious to adhere to the IRS\u2019 rules for tax exempt organizations. She said she was aware of the \u201chorrors\u201d several other conservative organizations had endured as a result of an IRS audit.\n\n\u201cI was confident I had done everything I was supposed to do,\u201d Easton said.\n\nEven so, in January of 2011, CBLPI was contacted by the IRS and was \u201cselected for examination\u201d for fiscal year 2008. The IRS agent never informed Easton why CBLPI was selected\u2014the only explanation given was the IRS wanted to verify CBLPI was following the necessary requirements as a tax exempt organization.\n\nBecause of this, Easton said she never believed the IRS randomly selected CBLPI due to the lack of information provided by the IRS.\n\n\u201cIf the great majority of IRS audits are truly random, as the IRS claims, the IRS should publish on Jan. 1 a list of all the groups and individuals that they plan to do these random audits on through the year,\u201d Easton said. \u201cThen, we could see if the audits are truly random, or whether they are focused on those nonprofits which oppose the policies of the incumbent administration.\u201d\n\nMetzger also shared the Leadership Institute\u2019s story. In June 2011, the Leadership Institute was notified that it was being audited for fiscal year 2008 as a result of a referral the IRS received. According to the agent, the IRS wanted to investigate if the Leadership Institute truly was non-partisan.\n\nMetzger noted that had the IRS given the Leadership Institute an \u201cadverse ruling,\u201d the organization would likely have lost their tax exempt status. He said this would have dramatically impacted the future of the organization.\n\n\u201cFor a non-profit organization, this destroys any possibility of future funding from foundations, and it significantly discourages donations from individuals who would no longer enjoy tax deductibility of their contributions,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cIn many ways, that is equivalent to a death sentence.\u201d\n\nMetzger outlined the various costs that the audit had imposed on the Leadership Institute, including the legal expenses, which totalled nearly $50,000, and the time staff members devoted to responding to the IRS. But the audit placed an even greater, intangible cost on the organization as well.\n\n\u201cFinally, there\u2019s the most insidious cost\u2014the cost of sheer terror,\u201d Metzger said.\n\n\u201cWondering whether or not you said something you weren\u2019t supposed to is pretty scary, especially when the consequence of an error of speech is the potential death of the organization,\u201d he added.\n\nRoskam said the IRS must make appropriate changes to ensure biased auditing does not occur in the future.\n\n\u201cThe IRS must acknowledge these problems and take concrete action to ensure a Lois Lerner 2.0 situation cannot happen,\u201d Roskam said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A report released on Thursday morning by the Government Accountability Office unveiled that the IRS specifically audited organizations in a biased manner.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A report released on Thursday morning by the Government Accountability Office unveiled that the IRS specifically audited organizations in a biased manner.", "title": "Study Finds IRS Targeted Organizations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IRS222.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GIaFB9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A report released on Thursday morning by the Government Accountability Office unveiled that the IRS specifically audited organizations in a biased manner.", "title": "Study Finds IRS Targeted Organizations", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IRS222.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-07-24T11:27:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "IRS, Government Accountability Office, John Koskinen, Peter Roskam"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e0d\"", "article_summary": "She said she was aware of the \u201chorrors\u201d several other conservative organizations had endured as a result of an IRS audit.\nEaston said that as president and a former attorney, she had always been cautious to adhere to the IRS\u2019 rules for tax exempt organizations.\nDespite these findings, the IRS has denied organizations were targeted.\n\u201cThe control deficiencies GAO found increase the risk that [the Exempt Organizations unit] could select organizations for examination in an unfair manner\u2014for example, based on an organization\u2019s religious, educational, political, or other views,\u201d the GAO report stated.\nAllegations surrounding this issue surfaced in 2013 when it was revealed the IRS was targeting conservative organizations applying for tax-exempt status."}
