The Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on Wednesday asking all people with a peanut allergy or peanut sensitivity to avoid any products that may contain ground cumin or cumin powder. Cumin may be sold as a spice, a spice mix, or a minor ingredient in packaged foods, such as soups and chilies.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is continuing to identify companies that received shipments of the ground cumin that contained undeclared peanuts and work with them to remove these products from the market,\u201d the FDA said in a statement. \u201cWhile this investigation is underway, the FDA wants consumers who are highly allergic or sensitive to peanuts to consider taking precautions with any product \u2014 not just those that have been recalled \u2014 that contains ground cumin. The FDA will continue to update the list of recalled products.\u201d\n\nRecalls started back on Dec. 26 when Texas-based Adams Foods recalled several cumin products that were potentially contaminated with peanut residue. Whole Foods recalled over 100 peanut-contaminated cumin products on Feb. 9, and Goya Foods recalled certain brands of black beans and black bean soup seasoned with cumin this past Friday. Consumers at risk to a life-threatening allergic reaction should be extra vigilant considering some products may list cumin as \u201cspices.\u201d\n\nA list of recalled products include ground cumin, seasoning mixes, and variety of cooking \u201ckits\u201d that include \u201cTex-Mex\u201d and Indian dishes. While the FDA has currently received seven reports of \u201cadverse events\u201d related to undeclared peanut allergens, the agency does not know how many have had an allergic reaction to products containing cumin. Anyone who experiences a symptom of an allergic reaction, such as shortness of breath, swelling of the lips, tongue or throat, or hives, should contact the FDA after seeing their physician.\n\nThe FDA explained that some packaged foods may not have enough cumin to trigger a reaction, but consumers highly sensitive to peanuts and people preparing food for people with peanut allergies should still be wary. Products made before 2014 are unlikely to contain peanut-contaminated cumin.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, cumin, recall, peanut, allergy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA has asked all people with a peanut allergy and those who cook for people with a peanut allergy to avoid all products containing potentially contaminated cumin.", "title": "Everyone With A Peanut Allergy Should Avoid Cumin: FDA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cumin-recall-fda-asks-everyone-peanut-allergy-avoid-cumin-322754", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/19/cumin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA has asked all people with a peanut allergy and those who cook for people with a peanut allergy to avoid all products containing potentially contaminated cumin.", "title": "Everyone With A Peanut Allergy Should Avoid Cumin: FDA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cumin-recall-fda-asks-everyone-peanut-allergy-avoid-cumin-322754", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/19/cumin.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/19/cumin.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-19T10:44:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T10:44:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA has asked all people with a peanut allergy and those who cook for people with a peanut allergy to avoid all products containing potentially contaminated cumin."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34b0\"", "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on Wednesday asking all people with a peanut allergy or peanut sensitivity to avoid any products that may contain ground cumin or cumin powder.\nWhole Foods recalled over 100 peanut-contaminated cumin products on Feb. 9, and Goya Foods recalled certain brands of black beans and black bean soup seasoned with cumin this past Friday.\nThe FDA will continue to update the list of recalled products.\u201dRecalls started back on Dec. 26 when Texas-based Adams Foods recalled several cumin products that were potentially contaminated with peanut residue.\nWhile the FDA has currently received seven reports of \u201cadverse events\u201d related to undeclared peanut allergens, the agency does not know how many have had an allergic reaction to products containing cumin.\n\u201cThe FDA is continuing to identify companies that received shipments of the ground cumin that contained undeclared peanuts and work with them to remove these products from the market,\u201d the FDA said in a statement."}
