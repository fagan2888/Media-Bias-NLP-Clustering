There are supposed to be some limits on how much snooping the NSA and its minions can do on Americans, but a new analysis by two Harvard researchers suggests that with clever technical work-arounds combined with creative legal interpretations the agency can brush aside even those paltry restrictions. In its \"Americans as 'vulnerable' to NSA surveillance as foreigners, despite the Fourth Amendment\" article, ZDNet reports:\n\n\"The loopholes in current surveillance laws and today's internet technology may leave American communications as vulnerable to surveillance, and as unprotected, as the internet traffic of foreigners,\" [Axel] Arnbak [co-author of the new paper] said. Although Americans are afforded constitutional protections against the US government from unwarranted searches of their emails, documents, social networking data, and other cloud-stored data while it's stored or in-transit on US soil, the researchers suggest these protections do not exist when American data leaves the country. By manipulating internet traffic to push American data outside of the country, the NSA can vacuum up vast amounts of US citizen data for intelligence purposes, thus \"circumventing constitutional and statutory safeguards seeking to protect the privacy of Americans,\" they warned.\n\nZDNet reports that an NSA spokesperson denied via email that the agency \"targets\" U.S. persons by intentionally routing their emails outside the U.S. Perhaps. But the NSA's lexicon is more than a bit artful, as American Civil Liberties Union analysts Jameel Jaffer and Brett Max Kaufman pointed out in Slate last July. Words like surveillance, collect, relevant, incidental, inadvertant, minimize and targeted don't mean what most of us think that they mean. Jaffer and Kaufman point out that targeted surveillance outside the U.S. is not limited to just foreigners:\n\nThe government\u2019s foreign targets aren\u2019t necessarily criminals or terrorists\u2014they may be journalists, lawyers, academics, or human rights advocates. And even if one is indifferent to the NSA\u2019s invasion of foreigners\u2019 privacy, the surveillance of those foreigners involves the acquisition of Americans\u2019 communications with those foreigners. The spying may be \u201ctargeted\u201d at foreigners, but it vacuums up thousands of Americans\u2019 phone calls and emails.\n\nIn fact, the Harvard researchers observe:\n\nA network owned by a single organization (even an organization that is nominally \u201cbased\u201d in the U.S. such as Yahoo! or Google) can be physically located in multiple jurisdictions. The revealed MUSCULAR/TURMOIL program illustrates how the N.S.A. exploited this by presuming authority under E[xecutive] O[rder] 12333 to acquire traffic between Google and Yahoo! servers located on foreign territory, collecting up to 180 million user records per month, regardless of nationality.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation reported last fall just how broadly Executive Order 12333 is being interpreted by the NSA when it comes to spying on Americans whose internet traffic is incidentally routed outside the country.\n\nGiven the past record of the NSA's leadership with regard to truthtelling, it's reasonable to assume that the agency is engaging in technical hanky-panky as a way to get around the pesky Fourth Amendment rights of Americans. Because there is no way to correct its abuses and corruptions, it remains the case that \"Secret Government is the Chief Threat to Liberty.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\u201cThe NSA has turned the Internet into a giant surveillance platform,\u201d declared renowned tech guru and Harvard Berkman Center fellow Bruce Schneier", "title": "If You're Connected to the Internet, the NSA Always Has Ways of Spying On You", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/01/if-youre-connected-to-the-internet-the-n", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14042350422608.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14042350422608.jpg", "title": "If You're Connected to the Internet, the NSA Always Has Ways of Spying On You", "description": "\u201cThe NSA has turned the Internet into a giant\nsurveillance platform,\u201d declared renowned tech guru and Harvard\nBerkman Center fellow Bruce Schneier at the \nCato Institute's conference on NSA domestic spying last fall.\nThere are supposed to be some limits on how much snooping the NSA\nand its minions can do on Americans, but a new\nanalysis by two Harvard researc", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2014-07-01T18:32:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2518\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe NSA has turned the Internet into a giant surveillance platform,\u201d declared renowned tech guru and Harvard Berkman Center fellow Bruce Schneier at the Cato Institute's conference on NSA domestic spying last fall.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation reported last fall just how broadly Executive Order 12333 is being interpreted by the NSA when it comes to spying on Americans whose internet traffic is incidentally routed outside the country.\nThe spying may be \u201ctargeted\u201d at foreigners, but it vacuums up thousands of Americans\u2019 phone calls and emails.\nJaffer and Kaufman point out that targeted surveillance outside the U.S. is not limited to just foreigners:The government\u2019s foreign targets aren\u2019t necessarily criminals or terrorists\u2014they may be journalists, lawyers, academics, or human rights advocates.\nBy manipulating internet traffic to push American data outside of the country, the NSA can vacuum up vast amounts of US citizen data for intelligence purposes, thus \"circumventing constitutional and statutory safeguards seeking to protect the privacy of Americans,\" they warned."}
