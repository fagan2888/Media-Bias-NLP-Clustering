Syracuse, N.Y. â€” Obamacare is bringing 65 more jobs to POMCO Group, the health insurance administrator based in Syracuse's Eastwood section.

The company, one of the nation's largest independent benefits administrators, said it will add 65 employees to its corporate headquarters on James Street by the end of July to accommodate the rapid growth in business created by the Affordable Care Act.

That will bring to 157 the number of employees POMCO has hired since the beginning of 2013, mainly due to the health care law. The company said it is the largest period of growth in its 36-year history and will bring its total workforce to 610.

The employment growth is being driven by POMCO's contract with Health Republic Insurance of New York,

a not-for-profit program created by the the New York City-based Freelancers Union.

Health Republic operates New York's Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan, a private, member-governed health insurance company. It is one of 23 formed across the country to offer health benefit plans on the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplace. It offers health insurance for individuals and small businesses.

Health Republic hired POMCO to be its claims administrator, customer service call center and medical management provider. Many of POMCO's new employees are highly trained customer service and claims specialists, the company said.

"Our partnership with Health Republic Insurance of New York has not only allowed us to assist underserved members across the state of New York with their health coverage needs, it has also given us an opportunity to bring more employment opportunities to Syracuse," POMCO President and CEO Robert Pomfrey said in a statement.

Founded in 1978 by Pomfrey, POMCO recently expanded its headquarters on James Street to accommodate its growth. However, the company said it is exploring new options for both training and future worksite locations.
