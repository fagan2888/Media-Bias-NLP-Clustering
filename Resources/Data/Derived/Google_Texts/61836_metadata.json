It\u2019s as though the other side wants to pass an air of amnesia over America,\u201d she said.\n\nTickets for the luncheon ranged in price from $500 per person to $32,400 per couple and included a performance by singer-songwriter Carole King, who led the audience in singing her 1967 song,\u201d (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.\u201d\n\nClinton was scheduled to appear on Monday night at a $32,400-per-person fundraiser in Los Angeles benefiting the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nThe event is hosted by several prominent players in the entertainment industry, including Dreamworks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, who backed Obama in the 2008 president election, and director Steven Spielberg, who endorsed Clinton six years ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Democratic voters not to be complacent about the November midterm elections, saying Monday that working women and their families will lose out on a better future if Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Democratic voters not to be complacent about the November midterm elections, saying Monday that working women and their families will lose out on a better future if Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress.", "title": "Clinton: Midterm elections should motivate women", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/20/hillary-clinton-to-headline-democratic-fundraiser/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/20/03bd0b13470d1629630f6a7067003cac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/20/03bd0b13470d1629630f6a7067003cac.jpg", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Democratic voters not to be complacent about the November midterm elections, saying Monday that working women and their families will lose out on a better future if Republ", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinton: Midterm elections should motivate women"}, "Author": "LISA LEFF", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6d9\"", "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Democratic voters not to be complacent about the November midterm elections, saying Monday that working women and their families will lose out on a better future if Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress.\nThe former secretary of state made the remarks during a sold-out women\u2019s luncheon in San Francisco that raised $1.4 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nIt\u2019s as though the other side wants to pass an air of amnesia over America,\u201d she said.\nThe event is hosted by several prominent players in the entertainment industry, including Dreamworks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, who backed Obama in the 2008 president election, and director Steven Spielberg, who endorsed Clinton six years ago.\n\u201cIf Hillary Clinton, mother and grandmother, decides to run for president she will win, and like I have said before she will be one of the best-prepared leaders to preside in the Oval Office,\u201d Pelosi said in her introduction to Clinton\u2019s speech."}
