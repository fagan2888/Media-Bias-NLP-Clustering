But at this year\u2019s edition of the event, Waters wasn\u2019t just on hand to show face and moderate the annual Filmmaker on the Edge Award discussion (this year\u2019s recipient was David Cronenberg) as he does every year. He was also there to promote his latest new book, \u201cCarsick: John Waters Hitchhikes Across America.\u201d\n\nThe book, out now, finds the cult icon hitchhiking across America from his hometown of Baltimore to San Francisco, with a credit card and a cardboard sign. Waters divided the book into three sections. In the first, he imagines the best that could happen on his journey. In the second, he dreams up the worst. And in the final section, he reveals what actually went down.\n\nIndiewire caught up with Waters in Provincetown to discuss the crazy journey.\n\nI\u2019m a bit slow. It wasn\u2019t until a few chapters in that I realized what I reading was fiction.\n\nIt says two novellas quite obviously in the prologue.\n\nI\u2019m a very attentive reader.\n\nYou\u2019re not the first person to say that. But then after a while if you believe it, you\u2019re really gullible.\n\nMore from Indiewire: \u201c\u2018Penny Dreadful\u2019 Costume Designer Gabriella Pescucci on Her Dreadfully Delicious Designs\u201d\n\nWhen the magical anus made an appearance, I knew.\n\nYeah. Even before then [laughs].\n\nWhat inspired the structure?\n\nI thought hitchhiking was about fantasy. It\u2019s about danger. So I thought that imagining before I went. Everyone would say, \u201cWhat do you think it will be like?\u201d And I had no idea. So I had to write that before I left. I wanted to get all my fears out. I also loved writing the fiction. It was like writing a movie in a way. All of these characters would fit into my movies.\n\nSo it was the form I always knew I was going to do. I could have never written the sections if I had come home from the trp and done it. I had to write it first. If I had done the trip and come back and written it, I couldn\u2019t have done it because it would have been so colored by the tedium of what really took place.\n\nDid it terrify you to dream up the worst that could happen scenarios before embarking on the real deal?\n\nNo, it made me less scared to do it, because I didn\u2019t think it could be that bad! I couldn\u2019t have that bad of luck. Every single ride was a horror, you know. So I think it made it less scary for me in a way.\n\nWas it a hoot to write the fictional parts?\n\nBooks are never fun. Fun is drinking on Friday night when you\u2019ve written all week. If it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s bad.\n\nBut the scenarios are so wild! Did you crack yourself up?\n\nIt\u2019s satisfying work, but it\u2019s work. Fun is when you\u2019re off work celebrating the fruits of your work \u2013 to me. I enjoy my work, but fun sounds\u2026 you\u2019re a writer! You know that\u2019s too frivolous a word for how you have to discipline yourself to do it everyday. To write a book\u2026it took three years! I wanted to write for the fun of others.\n\nHow did you go about disciplining yourself to pen this thing? Judging by what you say in the book, you\u2019re doing just fine financially.\n\nI\u2019m disciplined. I\u2019m overly disciplined. I write every day, five days a week in the morning I write something. That\u2019s how I make my living. I\u2019m writing new speeches, journalism, books or something. Every morning, Monday to Friday, eight to 12. And in the afternoon I do my business. Everybody knows I don\u2019t take any phone calls in the morning. I\u2019ve been doing that for three years. That\u2019s just the way it works. Some people write at night. I get dumber as the day goes on. I have to get up early.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The author and director on his semi-retirement from the film industry and his new book about hitchhiking", "title": "John Waters: \u201cI like writing books just as much as making movies\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The author and director on his semi-retirement from the film industry and his new book about hitchhiking", "title": "John Waters: \u201cI like writing books just as much as making movies\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/04/john_waters_its_not_just_me_david_lynch_hasnt_made_a_film_in_years_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/john_waters.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The author and director on his semi-retirement from the film industry and his new book about hitchhiking", "title": "John Waters: \u201cI like writing books just as much as making movies\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/john_waters.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nigel M.
