The trustee winding down Lehman\u2019s brokerage, James W. Giddens, has held funds in reserve in the event he didn\u2019t prevail in the battle with Barclays.\n\n\u201cWe are studying the decision closely,\u201d Mr. Giddens said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cOur focus remains on winding-down the estate, making distributions from the general estate as promptly as possible and protecting claimants\u2019 interests and due process rights.\u201d\n\nA Barclays representative wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment.\n\nLehman, once a major investment bank, collapsed into bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15, 2008, and its brokerage, while legally barred from filing for bankruptcy, also entered wind-down proceedings. The day after the bankruptcy filing, Lehman and Barclays struck a deal regarding the brokerage\u2019s sale, which a bankruptcy judge quickly approved, allowing the sale to close on Sept. 22.\n\nAccording to U.S. Circuit Judge Ralph K. Winter, who wrote the appeals court opinion for a three-judge panel, the \u201cscramble\u201d to close the deal produced a dispute over two major asset groups: about $1.9 billion in securities and about $4 billion held to secure the brokerage\u2019s exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nCourt papers show the bankruptcy court held a 34-day trial on the dispute, after which it concluded that the Lehman brokerage was entitled to the approximately $4 billion in so-called margin assets but that Barclays should get the $1.9 billion in so-called clearance box assets.\n\nBoth sides appealed, and the district court ruled that Barclays was entitled to both groups of assets. Mr. Giddens appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe appeals court didn\u2019t take up a dispute between Mr. Giddens and Barclays over another group of assets, money in customer reserve accounts, which the two sides have since settled. Court papers filed last year show that Mr. Giddens agreed to pay Barclays $769 million in customer reserve account assets once all the claims of the brokerage\u2019s customers have been paid in full (or money has been reserved to pay them in full).\n\nAs of July 30, Mr. Giddens said he has distributed more than $105 billion to 111,000 former brokerage customers. He has begun distributing another $240 million to secured creditors and those holding priority claims, mostly former employees, and he recently secured bankruptcy-court approval to begin making the first set of payments to general unsecured creditors.\n\nMore than $3 billion is available for such a creditor distribution, the trustee said at the end of July, though it isn\u2019t currently known exactly how much of that he will pay out. He has said he expects to begin making payments in early September.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed Barclays Capital Inc.'s right to several billions of dollars of assets in a dispute that arose in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers' brokerage after Lehman's 2008 collapse.", "title": "Court Affirms Barclays\u2019s Right to Lehman Brokerage Assets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/05/court-affirms-barclayss-right-to-lehman-brokerage-assets/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CE147_FXPROB_P_20140723181249.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Court Affirms Barclays\u2019s Right to Lehman Brokerage Assets", "description": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed Barclays Capital Inc.'s right to several billions of dollars of assets in a dispute that arose in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers' brokerage after Lehman's 2008 collapse.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Jacqueline Palank", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed Barclays Capital Inc.'s right to several billions of dollars of assets in a dispute that arose in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers' brokerage after Lehman's 2008 collapse.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-05T16:55:07-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/05/court-affirms-barclayss-right-to-lehman-brokerage-assets/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-25132", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed Barclays Capital Inc.'s right to several billions of dollars of assets in a dispute that arose in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers' brokerage after Lehman's 2008 collapse.", "title": "Court Affirms Barclays\u2019s Right to Lehman Brokerage Assets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/05/court-affirms-barclayss-right-to-lehman-brokerage-assets/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CE147_FXPROB_P_20140723181249.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-25132", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-05T17:14:57-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1afd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are studying the decision closely,\u201d Mr. Giddens said Tuesday in a statement.\nAs of July 30, Mr. Giddens said he has distributed more than $105 billion to 111,000 former brokerage customers.\nMr. Giddens appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling.\nA federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed Barclays Capital Inc.\u2019s right to several billions of dollars of assets in a dispute that arose in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers\u2019 brokerage after Lehman\u2019s 2008 collapse.\nBoth sides appealed, and the district court ruled that Barclays was entitled to both groups of assets."}
