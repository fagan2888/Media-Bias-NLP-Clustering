I don\u2019t think there is such a thing. It takes six months to win it. How do you back into something that takes six months to win? But he\u2019s had a great, great year. It would be the icing on the cake.\u201d\n\nAfter going 1-for-3 with a two-run home run on Friday night, Morneau boosted his average to .319. Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Harrison went 1-for-4 in the Pirates\u2019 10-6 loss at Cincinnati Saturday afternoon. Harrison is hitting .318. Pirates teammate Andrew McCutchen went 1-for-3, maintaining a .314 average.\n\nWeiss also said that sitting Morneau also was based on his desire to get call-up Kyle Parker a start before the season ends. Parker starts in right field Saturday night, while Michael Cuddyer mans first base.\n\n\u201cI have been looking for a chance to start Kyle and I haven\u2019t been able to do that,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get some guys out there who haven\u2019t gotten a lot of playing time down the stretch.\u201d\n\nLeMahieu scheduled for MRI: Second baseman DJ LeMahieu, who sprained the medial collateral ligament of his left knee in the sixth inning of Friday night\u2019s game, will miss the final two games of the season. He will undergo and MRI on Monday to make sure there is no major damage.\n\n\u201cIt still hurts. It hurts to walk,\u201d LeMahieu said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything serious, and neither does Doogie (trainer Keith Dugger), but we need to check it out.\u201d\n\nDugger said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious, but when you take a player out of the middle of the game and he\u2019s still hurt the next day, you have to make sure you check it out. Right now, we think it\u2019s a sprained ligament.\u201d\n\nDugger added that he didn\u2019t think LeMahiue will need surgery, but said the MRI will confirm that.\n\nCuddy power: During batting practice before Saturday\u2019s game, Cuddyer hit a home run that bounced off roof above the left-field bleachers and out of the ballpark. Cuddyer got fist-bumps all around for his mammoth blow.\n\nAs Ken Gurnick, the Dodgers beat writer for MLB.com said, \u201cThat never happens!\u201d\n\nPress box wonks were guessing the ball traveled 470-480 feet.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "DJ Lemahieu,Justin Morneau,Kyle Parker,Michael Cuddyer,Walt Weiss", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Justin Morneau's slim lead in the National League batting title is safe for now, which is a reason why the Rockies first baseman is not in the lineup.", "title": "Justin Morneau out of Rockies lineup for NL batting title chase", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/09/27/nl-batting-leader-justin-morneau-rockies-lineup-vs-dodgers/18745/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/03/justin-morneau.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Justin Morneau's slim lead in the National League batting title is safe for now, which is a reason why the Rockies first baseman is not in the lineup.", "title": "NL batting leader Justin Morneau out of Rockies lineup vs. Dodgers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/09/27/nl-batting-leader-justin-morneau-rockies-lineup-vs-dodgers/18745/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/03/justin-morneau.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Justin Morneau's slim lead in the National League batting title is safe for now, which is a reason why the Rockies first baseman is not in the lineup."}, "article_summary": "Cuddy power: During batting practice before Saturday\u2019s game, Cuddyer hit a home run that bounced off roof above the left-field bleachers and out of the ballpark.\nI don\u2019t think there is such a thing.\n\u201cI mean, people talk about backing into a batting title and all of that stuff.\nAsked if he would consider sitting Morneau in Sunday\u2019s season finale should Morneau enter that game with a lead, manager Walt Weiss answered: \u201cWe\u2019ll see where he stands at that point.\nWeiss also said that sitting Morneau also was based on his desire to get call-up Kyle Parker a start before the season ends."}
