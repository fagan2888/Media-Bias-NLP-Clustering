New York City Hall Bloomberg

A former aide to Mayor Michael Bloomberg was fined $2,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for interacting improperly with current Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration after she left City Hall, the board said Wednesday.

Julia Wood, who goes by Julie and who served as Mr. Bloomberg’s first deputy press secretary, violated a provision of the City Charter that prohibits public servants from appearing before the city agency they served within one year after leaving government, according to a board disposition signed by Ms. Wood.

Ms. Wood joined the communications team at Kickstarter, a New York City-based company, in November 2013, a month before Mr. Bloomberg left office.

In April 2014, on behalf of her new company, Ms. Wood attended a meeting regarding the city’s technology sector at City Hall, an event hosted by Alicia Glen, deputy mayor for housing and economic development, and the city’s Economic Development Corp. In June, Ms. Wood gave Ms. Glen and economic development officials a tour of her company’s offices.

“While I did not intend to violate any provision of the City Charter, I now acknowledge that, by communicating with the deputy mayor, and thereby the mayor’s office, on behalf of the firm within one year of the termination of my employment with the mayor’s office, I violated” a section of the charter, Ms. Wood affirmed in the disposition.

In the disposition, Ms. Wood noted that her company is not engaged in business dealings with the city. But “I now understand that whether a firm is engaged in business dealings with the city is not relevant to whether a communication on behalf of the firm is prohibited by City Charter,” she affirmed in the disposition.

Ms. Wood declined to comment on the resolution of the case.
