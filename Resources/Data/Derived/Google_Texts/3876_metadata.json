That is untrue. The video was taken by Kyle Bodgen, who was an attendee at the event. I regret the error.\n\nAfter a Donald Trump rally in Cleveland late last week, a supporter carrying a Trump campaign sign was caught on video yelling, \"Go back to Auschwitz! Go Back to F****** Auschwitz!\" Kyle Bogden, who was outside of the event, took the video.\n\nPresidential candidates aren't responsible for every supporter or person who attends their rallies however, growing anti-Semitism expressed at Trump events and in Trump supporter circles online is becoming increasingly alarming.\n\nAs Bethany Mandel recently asked, why won't Trump stand up to them? It's the easy, right thing to do.\n\nOn social media, it seems that while not all Donald Trump supporters are anti-Semites, many of the vocal and vicious anti-Semites seem to be Donald Trump supporters.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist and writer often accused of climbing into the pockets of \u201cThe Jews,\u201d told me recently.\n\n\n\nThe widespread anti-Semitism of Trump\u2019s fans hit the news after the September 16 Republican debate, thanks to one of his biggest supporters, Ann Coulter, who tweeted, \u201cHow many f\u2014king Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\u201d when several candidates affirmed support for Israel during their closing remarks. Coulter\u2019s comments, coupled with the anti-Semitism on display from her supporters \u2014 who immediately started the Twitter hashtag #IStandWithAnn \u2014 are becoming typical of Trump\u2019s fan base.\n\n\n\nThe widespread anti-Semitism of Trump\u2019s fans hit the news after the September 16 Republican debate, thanks to one of his biggest supporters, Ann Coulter, who tweeted, \u201cHow many f\u2014king Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\u201d when several candidates affirmed support for Israel during their closing remarks.

Trump is known for many things, but keeping his lips sealed is certainly not one of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Awful. .05/27/2016 6:32:42AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Awful.", "title": "Trump Supporter Leaving Trump Rally: \"Go Back to Auschwitz!
