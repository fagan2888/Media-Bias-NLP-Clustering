Congress has banned new ones from opening.\n\nBut an independent study released Wednesday argues physician-owned hospitals have gotten a bad rap. The study, published online by the British medical journal The BMJ, concluded that overall, physician-owned hospitals are not cherry-picking patients or limiting themselves to the most lucrative types of procedures and operations.\n\nSome of these hospitals specialized in a narrow set of procedures, but they treated only 20 percent of patients who went to physician-owned hospitals, the study found. The rest sought care at doctor-owned hospitals that offered a range of services similar to those at community hospitals.\n\n\u201cBy and large, physician-owned hospitals have virtually identical proportions of Medicaid patients and racial minorities and perform very similar to other hospitals in terms of quality of care,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Blumenthal, the lead author and a clinical fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nThe 2010 federal health care law not only banned new doctor-owned hospitals, but also limited growth of existing ones. Legislation introduced in May in Congress that proposes to lift these restrictions is opposed by the main industry group, the American Hospital Association (AHA).\n\nThe study disputes more than a decade of previous research into the topic. In 2005, Congress\u2019s independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, examined 48 specialty physician-owned hospitals and found evidence that they took the easier and better-paying cases. The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2008 that specialty hospitals owned by doctors often lacked emergency rooms and around-the-clock staff who could respond to medical emergencies. Hospitals with emergency rooms tend to take care of more low-income patients and people with chronic ailments, like heart failure, which aren\u2019t as profitable as elective surgeries.\n\nThomas Nickels, an executive at the hospital association, called the BMJ study \u201cincomplete and somewhat flawed.\u201d He noted that the researchers had not examined whether physicians were more likely to refer patients to their own hospitals. Such self-referrals are one of the main reasons the AHA has cited in asking Congress to retain the health law\u2019s restrictions.\n\n\u201cThey refer patients to their hospital that they want and they don\u2019t take others,\u201d Nickels said. \u201cThese institutions are enormously profitable, and they\u2019re profitable because they\u2019re choosing what kind of patients to take.\u201d\n\nBut the new study concludes that it was a mistake to judge physician-owned hospitals by just looking at those that specialize in narrow types of services. Of the doctor-owned hospitals the researchers identified from data provided by the Physician Hospitals of America, a trade group, 99 were specialty hospitals, but the majority, 120, were general acute hospitals. Those hospitals had sicker patients and more low-income and minority patients than did the specialty hospitals, even though both types were owned by doctors. Together, patients at physician-owned hospitals were slightly healthier than those at hospitals doctors did not own, but patients had similar death rates and faced the same numbers of chronic diseases.\n\n\u201cOverall, the differences, if they exist at all, are tiny,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, the study\u2019s senior author and a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cThere are much bigger differences between public hospitals and nonprofit hospitals, but we don\u2019t go around banning all nonprofit hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe study found that 6 percent of Medicare hospital admissions in the areas studied were at doctor-owned hospitals, suggesting that those facilities are not having a \u201cmeaningful impact\u201d on the finances of other hospitals. \u201cOur work suggests that some of the major criticisms of [physician-owned hospitals], including that they select more profitable patients, provide lower value care, and threaten the financial viability of surrounding hospitals, may no longer be valid,\u201d the study said.\n\nDr. R. Blake Curd, president of Physician Hospitals of America, applauded the study, saying it backs up what they have been arguing for years. \u201cThis is a great look at the physician-owned hospital industry as a whole,\u201d said Curd, a hand surgeon in South Dakota. \u201cYou can\u2019t paint us with one broad brush stroke, which is what the American Hospital Association is always trying to do.\u201d\n\nThe legislation to lift the ban on new physician-owned hospitals is in the House, but Nickels said no companion bill has been introduced in the Senate. \u201cThere seems to be very little interest in the Senate to pursue it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Curd said he expected that a Senate bill would be introduced and said lawmakers were receptive. \u201cIt\u2019s fine for Congress to reevaluate the policy decision they made in 2010,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginally published in Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study argues that physician-owned hospitals have gotten a bad rap.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new study argues that physician-owned hospitals have gotten a bad rap.", "title": "New Study: Physician-Owned Hospitals Serve Poorer Patients At Average Rates", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/904doc.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NQjuSe"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new study argues that physician-owned hospitals have gotten a bad rap.", "title": "New Study: Physician-Owned Hospitals Serve Poorer Patients At Average Rates", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/904doc.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "public health", "published_time": "2015-09-04T12:06:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "hospitals,health care,obamacare,patient protection and affordable care act,doctors,emergency room"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3119\"", "article_summary": "Together, patients at physician-owned hospitals were slightly healthier than those at hospitals doctors did not own, but patients had similar death rates and faced the same numbers of chronic diseases.\nOf the doctor-owned hospitals the researchers identified from data provided by the Physician Hospitals of America, a trade group, 99 were specialty hospitals, but the majority, 120, were general acute hospitals.\nSome of these hospitals specialized in a narrow set of procedures, but they treated only 20 percent of patients who went to physician-owned hospitals, the study found.\nThose hospitals had sicker patients and more low-income and minority patients than did the specialty hospitals, even though both types were owned by doctors.\nThe rest sought care at doctor-owned hospitals that offered a range of services similar to those at community hospitals."}
