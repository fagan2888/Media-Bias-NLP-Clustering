However, the Seattle Seahawks will get the first crack at Smith; he was on his way to Seattle Wednesday night with a full visit scheduled for Thursday.\n\nSmith was drafted by the Houston Texans in 2011, when Gary Kubiak was coach, and is familiar with the zone-blocking scheme the Broncos will employ in 2015.\n\nTamme, Unrein return? The Broncos opened discussions with tight end Jacob Tamme and defensive tackle Mitch Unrein with hopes of re-signing the veterans.\n\nIf Tamme returns, the Broncos would not be signing free-agent James Casey, who visited the team last week. Unrein could be well suited to play for new defensive line coach Bill Kollar at defensive end.\n\nElway also mentioned trying to sign a free-agent defensive tackle to join Sylvester Williams and Marvin Austin. Broncos\u2019 free-agent defensive tackle Terrance Knighton visited Washington on Wednesday.\n\nDraft picks. The Broncos expect to receive three or four compensatory picks on top of the six they already have for the 2015 draft that will be held April 30-May 2.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have 10 draft picks. And we only have 53 spots,\u201d Elway said.\n\nAnd the Broncos still have a backlog of draft picks they\u2019ve had trouble getting on the field.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former CSU guard Shelley Smith to visit with Broncos", "title": "Former CSU guard Shelley Smith to visit with Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/11/former-csu-guard-shelley-smith-to-visit-with-broncos/", "image": {"width": 562, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150311__453910988p1-1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150311__453910988p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T17:46:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:09:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Elway also mentioned trying to sign a free-agent defensive tackle to join Sylvester Williams and Marvin Austin.\nBroncos\u2019 free-agent defensive tackle Terrance Knighton visited Washington on Wednesday.\nDraft picks.\nAnd the Broncos still have a backlog of draft picks they\u2019ve had trouble getting on the field.\nThe Broncos opened discussions with tight end Jacob Tamme and defensive tackle Mitch Unrein with hopes of re-signing the veterans."}
