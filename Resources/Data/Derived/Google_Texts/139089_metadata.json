And he seems not to know that his solution, health savings accounts, have been in existence since 2003.\n\nTrump appeared on the Hannity show last night for a 16+ minute lapdog interview (the one below is 10:31 and the second part was 5:42). That's in advance of the one-hour special Hannity will have with Trump tomorrow as a warm-up to a Trump campaign rally to be held in the same venue.\n\nClearly, Hannity wanted to promote Trump\u2019s viability as a conservative candidate to those who might \u201cpick up their toys and go home if their guy doesn\u2019t win,\u201d as Hannity described some conservatives last night.\n\nHANNITY: I want to ask you this question because it\u2019s the question I\u2019m most frequently asked about you and as I go on social media, it seems to be a very strong \u2026 the single most named criticism or question I get, \"Tell me where Donald Trump is conservative. Explain how he\u2019ll be conservative.\" And I want to give you that opportunity to explain to people because no one ever asks you that. TRUMP: Sure I\u2019d like to do that\u2026 but at the same time I don\u2019t like labels necessarily because a label doesn\u2019t mean very much.\n\nTrump went on to say he\u2019s \u201cvery very strong on energy independence\u201d and \u201cvery, very conservative\u201d on the military and \u201cnobody is more conservative when it comes to trade than I am.\u201d\n\nThen he got to health care.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m certainly [conservative] when it comes to health care. We want to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We\u2019re going to repeal it. ObamaCare is a total disaster for this country. A total and complete disaster. We\u2019re going to come up with plans and there are lots of alternatives. We\u2019re gonna come up with plans that are far less expensive. Better for the people and better for the country.\n\nHannity gave Trump a helping hand with that vagueness: \u201cYou also said when you gave your specifics that you support health care savings accounts. That\u2019s on your website right now.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: A hundred percent. A hundred percent. It\u2019s so simple, so good, it\u2019s so much less expensive. It\u2019s much better. You can have your plan, you really have an asset, you can go anywhere with it, beyond state lines, you can do whatever you want with it, you know, it\u2019s just so much better. And you know what? It gives people the incentive to negotiate because it\u2019s theirs. You\u2019re not dealing with government bureaucrats, it\u2019s theirs. It\u2019s their money, they want to spend as little as possible. Right now, they walk in and they say give me everything under the kitchen sink. I mean, the people have an incentive to spend wisely, So the health care savings accounts are such a good thing. It\u2019s such a good idea and it\u2019s time for it. \u2026It was always amazing to me that politicians didn\u2019t \u2013 they hardly even considered it when they were talking about ObamaCare.\n\nMemo to Trump: Maybe the reason politicians didn\u2019t consider HSAs when ObamaCare was being drafted was because health savings accounts already existed. They were established in 2003, under President George W. Bush.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that patients are going to be negotiating the costs of health care when they\u2019re the kind of seriously sick that runs up astronomical medical bills. The Economic Policy Institute explains:\n\nForcing Americans to pay a higher share of health costs will not induce them to shop around and compare prices when they are experiencing chest pains or their child is suffering from an asthma attack. Further, consumers of health care are in no position to second-guess their doctor when she tells them an MRI is better than an X-ray (and hence worth the higher price) to diagnose a condition. Lastly, unlike other markets, prices of health care services faced by consumers bear very little relation to providers\u2019 cost to supply these services. Hence, these prices provide little to no information for consumers looking to judge the relative efficacy of various health care interventions. In addition, increased health cost sharing is unlikely to make American health care more affordable to those currently unable to afford it, and will instead likely place the largest burdens on those who need care the most.\n\nBut most of all, there is something really repugnant about a guy like Trump suggesting that Americans are gorging on medical care because it\u2019s (supposedly) free. Especially when Trump is wealthy enough to splurge on his own medical care as much as he\u2019d like. Especially when Trump pretends to be looking out for the little guy who can\u2019t. And most especially when Trump claims to be qualified for president and he doesn\u2019t even know that the plan he\u2019s touting has already been in effect for more than a decade.\n\nOf course, Hannity did not question a word of Trump's \"policy proposal.\"\n\nBy the way, Forbes noted on March 3 that neither Trump nor his anonymous staffer who posted the HSA proposal on the Trump website knows that HSAs are already the law of the land. But, apparently, neither Trump, his staff nor Hannity know or care.\n\nWatch this disgraceful example of what Fox promotes as news below, from the March 7 Hannity.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "CBwpl/hNQM2yKt/C9KvF6sGLWlfkwXyMdM4Vb5Qsr10=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/donald_trump_thinks_americans_go_to_the_doctor_and_say_give_me_everything_under_the_kitchen_sink_030816", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump Thinks Americans Go To The Doctor And \u2018Say Give Me Everything Under The Kitchen Sink\u2019"}, "Title": "Donald Trump Thinks Americans Go To The Doctor And \u2018Say Give Me Everything Under The Kitchen Sink\u2019"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump thinks Americans get too much health care and don\u2019t pay enough for it.\nI mean, the people have an incentive to spend wisely, So the health care savings accounts are such a good thing.\nHannity gave Trump a helping hand with that vagueness: \u201cYou also said when you gave your specifics that you support health care savings accounts.\nMemo to Trump: Maybe the reason politicians didn\u2019t consider HSAs when ObamaCare was being drafted was because health savings accounts already existed.\nAnd he seems not to know that his solution, health savings accounts, have been in existence since 2003."}
