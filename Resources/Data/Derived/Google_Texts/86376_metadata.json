REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are weighing in on the Puerto Rican debt crisis following a public plea by Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla. Former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley was the first to do so in a detailed statement; that was followed by a cryptic tweet from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. As we wrote last week, Puerto Rico doesn\u2019t have any electoral votes, but outmigration has pushed millions of Boricuas into Florida, a key battleground state. Garc\u00eda hasn\u2019t hidden this fact; he has publically called on Puerto Ricans to pressure presidential hopefuls into supporting concrete measure that would help the island swim out of it\u2019s ocean of debt. His chief demand: Let Puerto Rico file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.\n\n\"While Governor Garcia Padilla has taken the courageous first steps to steer Puerto Rico through this crisis, we must act now to avoid Puerto Rico's economic collapse,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in a statement. \u201cFirst, Puerto Rico should be able to negotiate with its creditors just as states can under the U.S. Bankruptcy code. Congress should approve Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi's legislation that would allow for this to happen.\u201d\n\nThat legislation, the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act, corrects what one expert called \u201ca typographical error in bankruptcy code.\u201d That error might have been a significant factor for investors who currently own the debt that Puerto Rico is trying to dump. Critics of the bill argue that those who invested will lose out. Presidential candidates, however, have little to lose. Bill sponsor Pedro Pierluisi (Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting congressional) wants to pass the bill by September, so it\u2019s not a bill that candidates will ever actually sign. It\u2019s also not a bill that HIllary Clinton or Martin O\u2019Malley would have to vote for: Neither of them currently hold public office.\n\nPuerto Rico's debt crisis is not theirs alone. For PR's economy to grow & their people to thrive, they need real tools & real support. -H \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 1, 2015\n\nDespite the low stakes, Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t come out with anything more specific than that vague tweet. What does \u201creal support\u201d mean? Clinton won\u2019t answer the question, to the chagrin of every Latino journalist everywhere (Julio Ricardo Varela, author of the response to Hillary below, is founder of Latino Rebels, who\u2019ve been a great resource for Puerto Rico news during the crisis).\n\n@HillaryClinton any specific details? Do you support current @pedropierluisi bill in congress? Do you not agree with @WhiteHouse position? \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Julio Ricardo Varela (@julito77) July 3, 2015\n\nIn a rare feat for Republican politicians weighing in on issues important to Latinos, Jeb Bush has actually been way ahead of the Democrats on this one. Last April, Jeb Bush told a crowd in Puerto Rico that he supported Chapter 9 protection for Puerto Rican institutions saying \u201cPuerto Rico should be given the same rights as the states,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nO\u2019Malley did up the ante, saying that in addition to bankruptcy protection, the island deserves health care subsidies and protections equal to those of the states.\n\n\u201cSecond, as I've stated before, the Department of Health and Human Services must end the inequitable treatment of Puerto Rico under Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. High costs and low reimbursement rates are a huge burden to Puerto Rico's budget and millions of U.S. citizens are at risk of losing care,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in his statement.\n\nThe former Governor has been on an all-out offensive to capture the Latino vote. O\u2019Malley supporters point to his strong record in Maryland, where he supports in-state tuition for Dreamers; contrast that to Clinton, whose murky 2008 position on driver's licenses got her in hot water with immigration activists. (O\u2019Malley also flip-flopped on that issue, but ultimately signed a bill supporting them). Even if Clinton is merely a recent convert to pro-immigrant politics, she\u2019s outmaneuvered her opponents to become the most visible candidate for Latinos.\n\nSo far, the 2016 election has been like an auction for Latino support, with candidates on both sides of the aisle anxiously bidding. Bold moves like those of O\u2019Malley\u2019s might force inertia candidates like Clinton to stake out a position.\n\nUpdate: Bernie Sanders Also Supports Puerto Rico Bankruptcy Protection\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), who is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, came out in support of bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, joing O'Malley's call for Puerto Rico to have the same debt restructruting options as the states. The candidate told the Washington Post \u201crestructure its debt in a rational way that does not harm its people, ordinary investors or pension funds in the United States.\u201d In comments issued on Tuesday, he said that Puerto Rico's debt crisis was due to \u201cthe policies of austerity and the greed of large financial institutions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "clinton, hillary clinton, ready for hillary martin o'malley, jeb bush, elections 2016, puerto rico debt crisis, bernie sanders, bernie sanders 2016, bernie sanders for president, bernie sanders immigration, bernie sanders latino, sanders puerto rico", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Times", "description": "Hillary is hedging on Puerto Rico bankruptcy, but another democratic presidential candidate has upped the ante.", "title": "Can Bernie Sanders & Martin O'Malley Push Clinton To Position On P.R.?", "url": "http://www.latintimes.com/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-hillary-hedges-omalley-and-sanders-support-bankruptcy-option-327081", "image": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2015/07/06/martin-omalley.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary is hedging on Puerto Rico bankruptcy, but another democratic presidential candidate has upped the ante.", "title": "Can Bernie Sanders & Martin O'Malley Push Clinton To Position On P.R.?", "url": "http://www.latintimes.com/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-hillary-hedges-omalley-and-sanders-support-bankruptcy-option-327081", "image": {"src": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2015/07/06/martin-omalley.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2015/07/06/martin-omalley.jpg"}, "site": "@thelatintimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#143241", "fb": {"app_id": 229373533940657, "pages": 492371650790156}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thelatintimes", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-07-06T16:19:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T10:36:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hillary is hedging on Puerto Rico bankruptcy, but another democratic presidential candidate has upped the ante."}, "article_summary": "Last April, Jeb Bush told a crowd in Puerto Rico that he supported Chapter 9 protection for Puerto Rican institutions saying \u201cPuerto Rico should be given the same rights as the states,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\u201cFirst, Puerto Rico should be able to negotiate with its creditors just as states can under the U.S. Bankruptcy code.\nAs we wrote last week, Puerto Rico doesn\u2019t have any electoral votes, but outmigration has pushed millions of Boricuas into Florida, a key battleground state.\nPuerto Rico's debt crisis is not theirs alone.\nREUTERS/Brian SnyderDemocratic presidential candidates are weighing in on the Puerto Rican debt crisis following a public plea by Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla."}
