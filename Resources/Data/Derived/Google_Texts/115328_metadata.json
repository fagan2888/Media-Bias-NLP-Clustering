We stopped by and took a few pictures, and may do a more complete story on it soon.\n\nLast week we were at City Fish Market as a guest of Barry Epstein at his Tiger Bay Club group lunch. The speaker was local orthodontist Larry Kawa, who has become a minor national figure because of his lawsuit over Obamacare. He gave an excellent speech, discussing the legal issues in depth. While we see Kawa as a notably partisan Republican, the talk was not delivered in that manner and he made an effort to show why Democrats should support what he\u2019s doing.\n\nAnd the salmon salad was also very good.\n\nWe also attended the \u201cGrand Opening\u201d event at Gyro Room in Mission Bay. It was not what we expected. There was a large crowd and the food came out slowly. We only tried a couple small things before we left. It was festive though.\n\nWe liked the food when we were there in September, though we were concerned that it might be too pricey for the format. There are better lunch deals nearby. Still you get a lot of food for your money and it\u2019s quality stuff.\n\nThe biggest news is the soon-to-open Sweet Dewey\u2019s BBQ on Glades just west of Lyons. We\u2019re told they will be open on Thursday\n\nChef Dwayne Hooper is a popular guy. We were invited to a \u201cmedia dinner\u201d that ended up with a large number of guests who were not media. It was a packed house overflowing not just onto the sidewalk in front, but they actually set up tables on the grassy areas in the parking lot. Hooper used to be at the Polo Club and a lot of the residents are apparently fans and came out to see his new place.\n\nIf you look closely in the photo above you can see it\u2019s in the plaza with Bamboo Wok and Stallone\u2019s.\n\nWe tried a number of dishes and everything was excellent. Brisket, ribs, chicken wings, cornbread, potato salad, cole slaw, baked beans, various desserts, some kind of bisque soup, etc. There was not a bad bite in the bunch.\n\nIt was too crowded though, so we\u2019re going to go back soon for a real review. Okay, really we\u2019re going back because we love good barbecue and this is it. Expect a positive review soon.\n\nLast up, again thanks to Barry Epstein we were invited to Bruce\u2019s of Great Neck in Boca Greens this morning. We\u2019ve never reviewed Bruce\u2019s before but we have eaten there several times, ordered their catering once, and noticed that they do well on their inspections. We tried the Babka French toast, above, and liked it very much.\n\nOne of the impressive dishes we tasted was a special turkey panini with pear slices, spinach, and a horseradish sauce that all went together extremely well:\n\nWe also tried the shrimp salad and lobster salad. The shrimp were noticeably larger than what you might typically see in this kind of dish.\n\nLast but not least, Rachel brought us out a plate of cookies:\n\nDisclosure: We were offered free food in relation to all the above events. We haven\u2019t tried Bilotti\u2019s pizza yet because that offer came after we visited. We don\u2019t believe the free food affected our judgment or reporting in any way, but feel our readers should know about it.\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "West Boca News", "description": "It might seem odd that we\u2019re starting our restaurant news with a gas station convenience store, but we\u2019ve heard a lot of people talking about Bilotti\u2019s Pizza in the Loggers\u2019\u2026", "title": "Restaurant News: Sweet Dewey\u2019s BBQ Opens Thursday, and more", "url": "http://westbocanews.com/2014/12/16/restaurant-news-sweet-deweys-bbq-opens-thursday-and-more/7450", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://westbocanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dewey-side-angle.jpg", "height": 599}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WestBocaNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WestBocaNews"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002831916238, "pages": 347983295231002}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://westbocanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-wbn-icon-270x270.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-16T22:37:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T22:37:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "kO4yyILNBkcEQX9mlxD6ngYAjsHwqiBoQoED6udwL30"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd318a\"", "article_summary": "There was a large crowd and the food came out slowly.\nThe biggest news is the soon-to-open Sweet Dewey\u2019s BBQ on Glades just west of Lyons.\nThe speaker was local orthodontist Larry Kawa, who has become a minor national figure because of his lawsuit over Obamacare.\nOne of the impressive dishes we tasted was a special turkey panini with pear slices, spinach, and a horseradish sauce that all went together extremely well:We also tried the shrimp salad and lobster salad.\nLast week we were at City Fish Market as a guest of Barry Epstein at his Tiger Bay Club group lunch."}
