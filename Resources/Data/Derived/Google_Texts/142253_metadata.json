McCrory:\n\n\u201cNow that the Supreme Court has ruled \u2014 again \u2014 that the structure of the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, it is time to move forward with making the law work better in our state. The first, and most important, step is accepting federal funds to extend the benefits of affordable health insurance coverage to 500,000 more people in our state. Gov. McCrory said last year that his staff was assembling options to expand coverage and that he would make an announcement about his recommendation after the Supreme Court ruled in King v. Burwell. The ruling has arrived.\u201d\n\nThis morning, major newspapers around the state are echoing this sentiment.\n\nFrom the Durham Herald-Sun:\n\n\u201cWith the question of the act\u2019s validity answered by the court, it\u2019s time for North Carolina to reverse its unfortunate decision to not extend Medicaid coverage to an estimated 500,000 individuals and families too poor to qualify for the ACA subsidies.\u201d\n\nFrom the Greensboro News & Record:\n\n\u201cThis was an enormous victory for President Obama. Most importantly, it avoids the human toll that would have resulted from an adverse ruling. Next, North Carolina should expand Medicaid coverage for thousands of residents who still fall between the coverage cracks. State leaders should have expanded Medicaid in the first place, but seemed more intent on thumbing their noses at the president than doing what\u2019s right. Not only is most of its cost paid for by the federal government, but also it would create as many as many as 43,000 jobs. Gov. Pat McCrory had said he wanted to wait for the Affordable Care decision first before considering that step. Now that the high court has ruled, it\u2019s time for him to act.\u201d\n\nFrom Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer:", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Next, North Carolina should expand Medicaid coverage for thousands of residents who still fall between the coverage cracks.\nPat McCrory had said he wanted to wait for the Affordable Care decision first before considering that step.\nMcCrory said last year that his staff was assembling options to expand coverage and that he would make an announcement about his recommendation after the Supreme Court ruled in King v.
