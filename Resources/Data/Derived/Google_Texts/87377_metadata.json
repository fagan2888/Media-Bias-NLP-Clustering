On Friday, President Obama announced the appointment of a former senior Pentagon lawyer who infamously defended the administration\u2019s unmanned drone targeted strike program to head the DHS, indicating that the department\u2019s primary agenda may segue from immigration and border control toward national defense.\n\nJeh C. Johnson, a long-time Democratic appointee \u2014 including postings as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, general counsel for the U.S. Air Force and general counsel for the Department of Defense under President Obama \u2014 has served as an administration frontman on the overturning of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d on the government\u2019s challenge on the Wikileaks disclosures and on the administration\u2019s continued involvement in the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d Should the Senate confirm him, he will be the fourth permanent secretary of Homeland Security. The grandson of Charles S. Johnson \u2014 the first Black president of Fisk University and noted advocate for civil rights and racial equality for all ethnic minorities \u2014 Jeh Johnson offers a mixture of military pragmatism and hopefulness in the nature of humanity.\n\n\u201cThe president is selecting Johnson because he is one the most highly qualified and respected national security leaders, having served as the senior lawyer for the largest government agency in the world,\u201d a senior administration official told ABC News. \u201cDuring his tenure at the Department of Defense he was known for his sound judgment and counsel.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nA changing agenda\n\nNapolitano, the former governor of Arizona, came into the DHS championing immigration reform. During her primary confirmation hearing in the Senate and throughout her history of primary policy while as head of the DHS, terrorism was rarely raised as a directionable issue. Johnson\u2019s experience \u2014 including cracking down on unauthorized leaks coming from the Department of Defense, stopping former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette from publishing secrets about the assassination of Osama bin Laden and the investigation of retired Gen. John Allen and socialite Jill Kelley \u2014 suggests that Johnson\u2019s DHS leadership will be indicative of the administration\u2019s hardened posture toward using legal force to \u2018slay all of the dragons\u2019 still challenging the White House: cybersecurity, restoring public trust in the government\u2019s pursuit of national security, immigration reform and refining and leak-proofing National Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who appreciates that you can\u2019t secure the country from inside the Beltway,\u201d said Tom Ridge, the first secretary of Homeland Security, who has been critical of some of the president\u2019s national security strategies. Ridge feels that the department\u2019s secretary should be an expert in some of the department\u2019s missions \u2014 but not necessarily all of them \u2014 and should have an understanding of national security.\n\nAs reported by ABC News:\n\nWhile Johnson has been outspoken in his views on fighting terrorism overseas, he has remained largely silent on other DHS responsibilities, including countering homegrown radicalization, enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws, responding to natural disasters, and effectively sharing threat information with local law enforcement. Nevertheless, Johnson \u2018was a key decision maker on various legal questions regarding different points of overlap between the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security,\u2019 the senior administration official said. \u2018During disaster responses, the Department of Defense oftentimes coordinates with DHS to provide personnel, equipment, money and other resources. Whether it was Hurricane Sandy or the Deepwater Oil Spill, DoD was working with its partner, DHS, to support the government\u2019s efforts to quickly respond effectively.\u2019\n\nForcing change\n\nIn two key areas, Johnson\u2019s policies and views will be questioned and tested. First, Johnson\u2019s 2010 report on the long-term effect of the repealing of the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d (DADT) policy \u2014 which prohibited officials from ordering a military members to disclose his or her sexuality but freed the military to respond if the officer\u2019s sexuality was disclosed voluntarily \u2014 concluded with the understanding that repealing the law would cause short-run limited disruptions in unit cohesion and retention, which could easily be remedied with strong leadership. This report formed the justification for the administration\u2019s repealing of DADT.\n\n\u201cWe are both convinced that our military can do this, even during this time of war,\u201d Johnson and General Carter F. Ham, commander of the U.S. Army in Europe and co-author of the report, wrote. \u201cWe do not underestimate the challenges in implementing a change in the law, but neither should we underestimate the ability of our extraordinarily dedicated service men and women to adapt to such change and continue to provide our nation with the military capability to accomplish any mission.\u201d\n\nJohnson was led by strong moral convictions in his determination on this issue. While Johnson does not see sexual orientation as a \u201cself-identifier,\u201d he does see discrimination in any form as inherently unfair. Johnson\u2019s uncle, Robert B. Johnson, was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen \u2014 the highly-decorated all-Black bomber escort squadron known for having one of the best service records in World War II. The older Johnson was involved in the 1945 Freeman Field Mutiny, in which a group of the Tuskegee Airmen was arrested for entering an all-White officers\u2019 club at Freeman Field, Ind. and held for ten days \u2014 with one court martial conviction and fifteen letters of reprimand \u2014 before Gen. George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff, called an end to the fiasco. Under President Bill Clinton, the court martial and letters of reprimands were removed and the fines were returned.\n\nThe event is commonly seen as the trigger for racial integration of the American military. The opposition to integrating the armed forces in the 1940s, Johnson said, was as high as 80 percent, compared to the 60 percent of Marines that opposed the repeal of DADT. \u201cThe lesson to be drawn from that,\u201d he said, \u201cis that very often the predictions about what is going to happen overestimate the negative consequences and underestimate the military\u2019s ability to adapt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s man\u201d\n\nCarrying with the theme that popular sentiment should not dictate policy, Johnson\u2019s second challenge comes with his support of the administration\u2019s use of unmanned aerial vehicles for targeted killings. During a March 18 keynote address at Fordham Law School, Johnson defended the administration\u2019s disclosure of the \u201ctargeted killing\u201d program:\n\n\u201cIn the absence of an official picture of what our government is doing, and by what authority, many in the public fill the void by envisioning the worst. They see dark images of civilian and military national security personnel in the basement of the White House \u2014 acting, as Senator Angus King put it, as \u2018prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner\u2019 \u2014 going down a list of Americans, deciding for themselves who shall live and who shall die, pursuant to a process and by standards no one understands. \u201cOur government, in speeches given by the Attorney General, John Brennan, Harold Koh, and myself, makes official disclosures of large amounts of information about its efforts, and the legal basis for those efforts, but it is never enough, because the public doesn\u2019t know what it doesn\u2019t know, but knows there are things their government is still withholding from them.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s stance as \u201cthe president\u2019s man\u201d puts Johnson in an awkward position. He has defended the American mission in Iraq and Afghanistan as something the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. would have supported \u2014 which earned Johnson the scorn of Jeremy Scahill and Salon.com \u2014 defended the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d as a finite war nearing its tipping point and defended targetted killings, saying in 2012 at Yale Law School: \u201cUnder well-settled legal principles, lethal force against a valid military objective, in an armed conflict, is consistent with the law of war and does not, by definition, constitute an \u2018assassination.'\u201d In dealing with difficult questions on drone use, such as the targeting and killing of Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, he punts, insisting that it was the CIA and not the military that conducted that assassination, and that he is not empowered to speculate on that.\n\nFor example, Johnson criticized the notion of obtaining judicial oversight to targeted killings. \u201cThe idea is motivated by a desire to rein in the president\u2019s constitutional authority to engage in armed conflict and protect the nation, which is the very reason it has constitutional problems,\u201d Johnson said at the Fordham University School of Law.\n\n\u201cArticle II of the Constitution states that the President \u2018shall\u2019 be the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. That is his burden and responsibility. He may delegate his war-fighting authority within his chain of command, but he cannot assign part of it away to another branch of government, nor have it taken away by an act of Congress. The Article III problems are just as serious: the judiciary does not exist to issue advisory opinions or offer legal advice to the President; they exist to resolve live cases or controversies.\u201d\n\nChallenges such as these, taken in consideration with Johnson\u2019s stance on civil rights and the fact that Johnson was one of the few that called on the White House to take a softer military stance against Libya during America\u2019s intervention and to get congressional approval first in accordance with the War Powers Act, make it difficult to draw a clear distinction on who Johnson is and how he will manage the DHS, and maybe that\u2019s for the best. The 240,000-employee, 22-agency department, which answers to more than 100 different congressional committees and subcommittees, will need someone flexible and principled enough to roll with the punches, especially in light of the department\u2019s numerous senior vacancies.\n\nIt\u2019s now up to the Senate to decide if a \u201cpresident\u2019s man\u201d deserves to be in charge of the nation\u2019s security. Considering that Johnson was not even on the shortlist of possible nominees for the job, per national security insiders, there may be much to discuss.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a history of battling discrimination in the military, Johnson remains \u201cthe president\u2019s man\u201d on a slew of issues. , Department of Homeland Security, Drones, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, national security,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Frederick Reese", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Despite a history of battling discrimination in the military, Johnson remains \u201cthe president\u2019s man\u201d on a slew of issues. , Department of Homeland Security, Drones, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, national security,", "title": "Nomination Of Jeh Johnson As Homeland Security Secretary Offers A Mixed Bag", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/nomination-of-jeh-johnson-as-homeland-security-secretary-offers-a-mixed-bag/170893/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101813_Jeh_16x91.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-22T11:43:42-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite a history of battling discrimination in the military, Johnson remains \u201cthe president\u2019s man\u201d on a slew of issues. , Department of Homeland Security, Drones, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, national security,", "title": "Nomination Of Jeh Johnson As Homeland Security Secretary Offers A Mixed Bag", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101813_Jeh_4x31.jpg", "creator": "@FrederickReese", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "national security", "published_time": "2013-10-19T05:00:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T11:43:42-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5645\"", "article_summary": "Nomination Of Jeh Johnson As Homeland Security Secretary Offers A Mixed BagDespite a history of battling discrimination in the military, Johnson remains \u201cthe president\u2019s man\u201d on a slew of issues.\n\u201cWe need someone who appreciates that you can\u2019t secure the country from inside the Beltway,\u201d said Tom Ridge, the first secretary of Homeland Security, who has been critical of some of the president\u2019s national security strategies.\nRidge feels that the department\u2019s secretary should be an expert in some of the department\u2019s missions \u2014 but not necessarily all of them \u2014 and should have an understanding of national security.\nConsidering that Johnson was not even on the shortlist of possible nominees for the job, per national security insiders, there may be much to discuss.\nIt\u2019s now up to the Senate to decide if a \u201cpresident\u2019s man\u201d deserves to be in charge of the nation\u2019s security."}
