As many other critics have noted, its sex scenes are as lengthy as they are explicit; the author of the graphic novel upon which Blue is based has dismissed them as inaccurate pornography . Some have accused the film of being an advanced exercise in the male gaze ; a queer romance filtered through straight people\u2019s imaginations of what that should look like. Co-stars Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux say they\u2019ll never work with Kechiche again because of his on-set bullying, and it\u2019s hard to ignore the film\u2019s voyeuristic tendencies considering how much screen time it devotes to watching Exarchopoulos\u2019s character (also named Ad\u00e8le) fall fast asleep, mouth agape, lost in dreamland (not unlike how she looks when awake).\n\nWatching Blue is the Warmest Color is an awfully carnal affair. French director Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s controversial, three-hour coming-of-age love story jumps from close-up to close-up of characters eating, kissing, touching, tonguing, crying, and butt-slapping, all passionately and voraciously, often with little else in the frame.\n\nSo is Blue is the Warmest Color indulgent? Absolutely, but in fact, the ways in which it's most indulgent aren\u2019t all that titillating. Despite all the buzz about its sexual content and off-screen squabbles, the seemingly most gratuitous parts of Kechiche\u2019s film, which took the top honor at Cannes, are the least sexy. Kechiche\u2019s affinity for extreme and often uneventful close-ups may demand a lot of patience at the surface level, but those scenes also help connect the audience to the characters in ways that are all the more rewarding.\n\nThe movie cozies up to Ad\u00e8le quickly and doesn't let go, watching as she rides the bus and longingly stares out the window over and over again. It\u2019s fitting that Ad\u00e8le\u2019s first date with the older, out art student Emma (Seydoux) finds her studying Ad\u00e8le\u2019s features for a portrait: The first act of the film largely does the same. The camera pauses on her blank stare in school, too, where she logs plenty of hours throughout the film\u2019s six-year window, first as a student, then as a teacher herself, organizing nap time and administering dictation tests to first-graders\u2014thrilling stuff. And while one of the film\u2019s love scenes lasts a long seven minutes\u2014or 10, 15, or 20, depending on whom you ask\u2014it\u2019s nothing compared to the film\u2019s drawn-out displays of everyday monotony.\n\nMany of these scenes are as beautifully shot as they are, frankly, boring. But they also serve an important purpose, establishing an emotional baseline that\u2019s necessary to appreciate the film\u2019s most affecting character developments. All that time spent getting inside Ad\u00e8le\u2019s head is the price of admission for one the year\u2019s best performances.\n\nBefore she meets Emma and all her blue-haired bravado, there\u2019s a naive uncertainty about Ad\u00e8le, a wistful teen who wanders through life looking like it takes all her concentration to remember to keep breathing. Once their worlds collide, that look is replaced by in-the-moment vivacity that might have gone unnoticed had Blue skipped its \u201cbefore\u201d and focused only on \u201cafter.\u201d Just as the sex scenes will likely elicit visceral reactions among the audience\u2014the scenes are as sexy (attractive women convincingly getting turned on) as they are unsexy (so much saliva, so many noises typically left out of Hollywood love scenes)\u2014they detonate a physical transformation in Ad\u00e8le, too. Viewers can\u2019t fully comprehend what Emma brings out of Ad\u00e8le until they\u2019ve seen her go from totally disengaged (at school) to orgasmically ecstatic (in the bedroom) to completely empty (whenever they're apart).\n\nAll of these moments would feel more worth sitting through if they added up to something more devastating.\n\nThese evolutions are crucial. Many months later, when Emma hosts a dinner party for her artist friends, Ad\u00e8le puts on makeup, makes an elaborate meal, and ditches her usual sloppy-teenager bun. This is Ad\u00e8le trying on her grown-up costume\u2014a change viewers might not notice if they hadn\u2019t watched unadorned, babyfaced teenage Ad\u00e8le messily eat meal after meal under a floppy up-do. It\u2019s also a point worth lingering on: At the party, Ad\u00e8le seems out of place among Emma\u2019s hip, intellectual posse, a perception that\u2019s confirmed as it becomes one of many factors driving a wedge between her and Emma. By contrast, the shots of Ad\u00e8le teaching get more and more tedious as the film drags on, but it\u2019s in the classroom, when she\u2019s working with young kids, that Ad\u00e8le seems most at ease, most confident, and most grown up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They&#39;re also the most frustrating.
