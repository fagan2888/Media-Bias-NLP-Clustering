This market entry builds on AXA S.A.\u2019s expertise as a leading employee benefits insurer around the world, where it protects more than a million employees. AXA S.A. will apply this knowledge and experience as it develops its U.S. offering \u2013 a suite of benefits products scheduled to begin rollout in mid-2015, including group life insurance, dental and vision, short- and long-term disability, gap medical and hospital indemnity, and critical illness.\n\nThe company has assembled a highly experienced leadership team led by Herv\u00e9 Balzano, a 15-year veteran of AXA S.A. and AXA France, who has a proven track record of founding and growing employee benefits businesses in markets around the world. Balzano was previously head of AXA S.A.\u2019s International Employee Benefits business and president of the MAXIS Global Benefits Network.\n\nAXA extensively researched the U.S. market opportunity and found that one segment \u2013 small- to medium-sized businesses with 20 to 500 employees \u2013 remains underserved. These businesses and their employees comprise roughly half of the expanding U.S. employee benefits market, which is undergoing transformation following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAXA is entering the U.S. employee benefits market at a time of great opportunity to help business owners navigate new regulations and obtain affordable and flexible coverage for their employees,\u201d said Balzano. \u201cWhile competitors struggle to adapt their legacy services and technology to the present, we have the advantage of building, from the ground up, a seamless platform that is unencumbered by the past and ready for the future.\u201d\n\nWatch this video interview in which Balzano further discusses the Employee Benefits business.\n\nLeadership Team\n\nBalzano is joined on the AXA Employee Benefits leadership team by:\n\nJames Long, Head of Distribution.
