Superheroes and villains took over Gulf Coast State College Saturday for the sixth annual CreativeCon.

The convention was filled with costume contests, games, panels, musical performances, and special guests like Michael Papajohn; an actor from the Sam Raimi "Spiderman" movie series.

CreativeCon's director says Saturday was the largest turnout for the event yet.
