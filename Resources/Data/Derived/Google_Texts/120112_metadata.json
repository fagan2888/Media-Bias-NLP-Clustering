That\u2019s essentially unchanged from a year ago.\n\nSheerin said that since Gov. Nathan Deal opted not to expand Medicaid eligibility in Georgia, the hospital hasn\u2019t seen the positive impact from the Affordable Care Act that hospitals in other states have seen.\n\n\u201cThe other thing is, the penalties that are out there for folks not to join up through the exchanges are only $95, so really there is no incentive for folks to go out and sign up,\u201d Sheerin said.\n\nRedmond Regional Medical Center Chief Financial Officer Ken Metteauer said there\u2019s been no significant change at Redmond regarding what he called \u201cself-pay,\u201d or uninsured, patients.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the dollars that roll up in those buckets, I haven\u2019t seen much of a decline (in unreimbursed care),\u201d Metteauer said.\n\nWhen Metteauer looks at the actual number of patient visits, he said Redmond has experienced a decline of about 50 self-pay and charity patients through the end of June as compared to the same six-month period a year ago.\n\nHe called that statistically insignificant, but added that the numbers do correlate to the number of patients who are using exchange plans.\n\nIn a blog for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Aug. 8, deputy administrator Cindy Mann reported that over the last year, nationally, 10.3 million previously uninsured Americans now have some form of coverage.\n\nDr. Joseph Biuso, vice president and chief medical officer at FMC, believes the idea behind Obamacare is sound. He said the more people who have health insurance, the more people who can seek healthcare in traditional ways instead of through hospital emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cBut we have not seen it medically, and we haven\u2019t seen it financially change things in Georgia,\u201d Biuso said.\n\nOne Obamacare impact Sheerin said he has seen is an increase in higher-deductible plans for people who have insurance through their employers, or perhaps bought policies on their own.\n\nBig hit expected next year\n\nSheerin said the big hits for safety net hospitals like FMC are likely to come in 2016 and 2017. That\u2019s when large cuts in Disproportionate Share payments will occur.\n\nMedicare makes extra, Disproportionate Share, payments to hospitals that serve a high number of indigent and Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cThe monies that are used to make those payments to the hospitals are being drastically cut \u2014 because the expectation was the exchanges would be working pretty well and there would be Medicaid expansion all over,\u201d Sheerin said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n\nSheerin estimates that reduction to FMC will be in the neighborhood of $8 million to $9 million on an annual basis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of years to prepare for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Congress continues to delay it, that would help us out.\u201d\n\nBiuso said it\u2019s hard to recognize patients who are indigent or must come up with out-of-pocket payments for treatment at the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt might surprise you who doesn\u2019t have health insurance and doesn\u2019t seek medical care in ways that keep you out of the emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s isn\u2019t a stereotype person. We treat every person the same.\u201d\n\nMetteauer said Redmond does its best to track its self-pay or uninsured patients and said his best information is that many of them are chronically unemployed people.\n\nAs far as the exchanges go, Sheerin said he\u2019s hearing that folks with more frequent medical problems are the ones signing up for policies, not the younger, healthier people.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a healthy person and you\u2019re not going to need health insurance or health care, why pay $3,000 to $5,000 for something when, if you don\u2019t get it, the penalty is just $95,\u201d he said.\n\nThe $95 figure is the lowest rate for an individual. The penalty for 2014 is capped at 1 percent of a household\u2019s annual income. Under the ACA, the cap rises each year. In 2015 it will be 2 percent of income or $325 per person.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "local", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Six months into the year and neither of the local hospitals have seen much of an indication that more Northwest Georgians have availed themselves of health insurance.", "title": "Local hospitals assess Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/local-hospitals-assess-affordable-care-act/article_1a8b0598-205c-11e4-9ce8-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 889, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ed/3edeea86-205c-11e4-8343-001a4bcf6878/53e7190bc10ef.image.jpg?resize=889%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "local", "description": "Six months into the year and neither of the local hospitals have seen much of an indication that more Northwest Georgians have availed themselves of health insurance."}, "article_summary": "Nathan Deal opted not to expand Medicaid eligibility in Georgia, the hospital hasn\u2019t seen the positive impact from the Affordable Care Act that hospitals in other states have seen.\n\u201cIt might surprise you who doesn\u2019t have health insurance and doesn\u2019t seek medical care in ways that keep you out of the emergency room,\u201d he said.\nSix months into the year and neither of the local hospitals have seen much of an indication that more Northwest Georgians have availed themselves of health insurance.\nMedicare makes extra, Disproportionate Share, payments to hospitals that serve a high number of indigent and Medicaid patients.\n\u201cWhen I look at the dollars that roll up in those buckets, I haven\u2019t seen much of a decline (in unreimbursed care),\u201d Metteauer said."}
