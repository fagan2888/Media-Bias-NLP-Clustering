Chris Christie in the George Washington Bridge and Hoboken Sandy aid scandals.\n\n\u201cAssisting in its internal review\u201d is the phrase placed into the letter. And it means that Mastro and his New York-based collection of lawyers are helping Christie\u2019s office pick apart its inner workings to \u201cfigure out what really happened here\u201d before the scandals erupted, according to a Christie spokesman.\n\nIt is also a phrase \u00ad\u2014 and a mandate \u2014 that has some lawyers and state legislators questioning Mastro\u2019s \u201ctrue goals\u201d as private counsel to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nIs the aggressive litigator using the internal review process as a cloak, they ask, as he takes investigative steps aimed more directly at protecting Christie personally in the scandals?\n\nThe lawyers and Democratic legislators cite Mastro\u2019s recent tactic of sending out letters asking for handwritten notes and other information from key figures such as a former Christie staff member, along with outsiders who have fired accusations at Christie\u2019s office, including Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer. It appears, they argue, that Mastro could be trying to learn whether there is any evidence that might implicate Christie in the scandals.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, say the lawyers, then New Jersey\u2019s taxpayers, who are footing the bill for Mastro\u2019s services, are in effect paying for Christie\u2019s personal attorney.\n\n\u201cSo what were they (Mastro\u2019s team of lawyers) going to do with the unredacted journal notes from Zimmer they asked for?\u201d says Stanley Brand, a nationally known political corruption lawyer. \u201cWhy do they need them, to make a defense case for the governor?\u201d\n\nBrand, who was a lawyer to White House press secretary George Stephanopoulos in the Whitewater scandal of the 1990s, also says, \u201cBill Clinton had to pay for his own lawyer in Whitewater,\u201d ultimately spending millions of dollars.\n\nSome legal experts and legislators also question whether Mastro is trying to intimidate central witnesses by requesting detailed personal documents and sit-down interviews.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an intimidating position to be put in for Zimmer because she could be made to look as uncooperative if she doesn\u2019t hand over the information Mastro is looking for,\u201d says John Wisniewski, a Democratic state legislator and outspoken Christie critic, who serves as a co-chair of a bipartisan state legislative committee investigating the scandals.\n\nAnd still others say they have doubts about whether the billing rate of $650 an hour for Mastro and his legal team amounts to an overall \u201cdiscount,\u201d as Mastro has said.\n\nState Sen. Raymond Lesniak (D-Union), who is not on the investigative committee, says simply that he views the internal review by the governor\u2019s office as \u201ca waste of time, effort and money\u201d because it will have \u201can inherent credibility problem because those involved include very close associates of the governor himself.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office stands firmly behind its hiring of Mastro\u2019s legal team, which is based out of the Park Avenue office of his prominent law firm, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. The team has been retained to do important work on behalf of New Jerseyans, the office says, such as conduct the internal review and respond to sweeping subpoenas issued by state legislators and by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, who is leading a separate inquiry into the scandals.\n\n\u201cJust as the outside counsel hired by the Assembly Democrats (to help the investigative committee) is being compensated by the public, so too is the team hired by the administration,\u201d said Colin Reed, a Christie spokesman.\n\n\u201cGibson Dunn\u2019s role is to conduct an internal review so we can figure out what really happened here. It\u2019s in the public\u2019s interests to gather all the facts and prevent something like this from ever happening again \u2026 and once the review is complete and the facts are known, the governor intends to make the findings public.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s office has also said Gibson Dunn would \u201cbring an outside, third-party perspective to the situation\u201d and \u201ctake an independent look\u201d at what happened.\n\nStill, asks Brand, \u201cWho is Gibson Dunn\u2019s client? Because some of the types of things they (Gibson Dunn lawyers) are doing seem to me to spill over into personal representation\u201d of the governor. And some New Jersey lawyers contend that even the \u201coptics\u201d of Christie\u2019s office using Mastro do not look good: They point out that Mastro was deputy mayor and chief of staff to former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a close and powerful confidant of Christie\u2019s who has repeatedly appeared on national talk shows in recent months to defend Christie.\n\nMastro did not return telephone calls seeking his comment for this story.\n\nTHE SCANDALS\n\nThe George Washington Bridge scandal burst onto the national stage on Jan. 8, after emails emerged showing that Bridget Anne Kelly, a Christie deputy chief of staff, and David Wildstein, a Christie ally who held a high-ranking position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, had orchestrated the closure of access lanes to the bridge, triggering traffic jams in Fort Lee. It is believed that the closures may have been political payback directed at Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, after he declined to endorse the Republican governor for re-election.\n\nTen days after that scandal broke, Zimmer accused Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and other Christie officials of threatening last spring to withhold Hurricane Sandy relief funds from her city unless she backed a real-estate development project tied to Christie ally, Port Authority chairman David Samson.\n\nMastro was hired by Christie\u2019s office in January, and by early February, he began sending letters to Sokolich, Zimmer, Kelly, Wildstein and others, seeking interviews with them and important documents. (To date, Sokolich\u2019s office has turned over some information to Mastro but several others, such as Zimmer, have declined.)\n\nFor instance, in a Feb. 4 letter sent to Zimmer\u2019s lawyer, Mastro asked for \u201ccomplete, unredacted copies of all documents that Mayor Zimmer has provided to others such as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the press, including any handwritten notes or correspondence, relating to her allegations, and other documents relating to Hoboken\u2019s requests for Sandy-related aid.\u201d\n\nThose letters from Mastro have raised questions about the motivations and tactics being used by Gibson Dunn as it assists the governor\u2019s office in its \u201cinternal review.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you were to do an internal investigation, and be true to your words, you talk to the people on your staff, under your control,\u201d Wisniewski says, adding, \u201cAt its best, the retention of Mastro and his team is a defensive move by the governor. At its worst, it\u2019s a move that will delay and confound the other investigations into the scandals that are taking place.\u201d\n\nHe also says, \u201cIf a true internal investigation was desired, then why on the day that Bridget Kelly was told that she was terminated for ordering the lane closures at the bridge, did no one in the governor\u2019s office sit down with her and do an exit interview, and ask a real simple question: \u2018Bridget, why did you do it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nCOST TO TAXPAYERS\n\nGibson Dunn\u2019s plush New York lobby rests on the 47th floor of the MetLife Building, towering above Park Avenue. Regal artwork hangs from the walls, and awards for excellent legal services sit on polished tables. Nearby, immense windows offer an awe-inspiring view: The vastness of Manhattan sweeping uptown, into the Bronx.\n\nRecently, as some legal experts have questioned Mastro\u2019s goals and tactics, others have questioned how much the taxpayers of New Jersey should be paying for Gibson Dunn\u2019s hourly work. Some argue the \u201cgrunt work\u201d of producing subpoenaed documents to investigators could be handled by state government lawyers for two or three times less than the rate being charged by Mastro.\n\nIn addition, even though Mastro has said Gibson Dunn\u2019s professionals assigned to the scandals are each using the one-size-fits-all, \u201cdiscounted\u201d rate of $650 an hour, other experts say they question whether the rate is a discount.\n\nCalled a \u201cblended rate\u201d in law-firm speak, the rate presumably means that younger associates at the firm have ratcheted up their normal rates, which experts say are likely hundreds of dollars less than $650.\n\nJust which \u2014 and how many \u2014 Gibson Dunn lawyers and professionals are \u201cbilling out\u201d each day is unclear. Requests made to both Mastro\u2019s office and the governor\u2019s office asking for a list of the Gibson Dunn professionals working the scandals \u2014 along with their titles and typical billing rates \u2014 have gone unanswered. A similar open public records request made with Christie\u2019s office has been denied.\n\nIN WHOSE INTERESTS?\n\nBrand and other lawyers acknowledge that Christie is not a named target in the investigations, an important point, they say, while noting that if Christie were a named target he would have to retain a personal attorney. They also note that the governor has repeatedly denied any involvement in \u2014 or awareness of \u2014 wrongdoing.\n\nIn addition, some attorneys say they see \u201cnothing improper\u201d about the actions Mastro has taken on behalf of the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cMastro has the perfect right to interview any potential witnesses on behalf of his client,\u201d says Joseph Hayden, a defense lawyer and former state prosecutor. \u201cThe individuals involved here are represented by skilled lawyers who can make appropriate decisions. They can talk to him or not.\u201d\n\nStill, Brand claims Mastro\u2019s private-lawyer role in representing the office of the governor at least raises potential issues of conflict.\n\nFor instance, he says, \u201cWhat if Mastro interviews a witness who incriminates the governor. What does he do then? Or incriminates a higher-up. What does he do?\u201d\n\nAt that point, say some experts, Gibson Dunn would likely be obligated to reiterate to Christie\u2019s office that its duty, in representing the office of the governor, is to the public \u2014 and thus it might be obligated to disclose what it has learned to the public or investigators.\n\nYet some lawyers also point out that disclosing such information could involve Christie\u2019s office having to waive its attorney-client privilege or government-process privilege with Gibson Dunn, which could place it in a powerful but conflicted position.\n\nWhat is more, says Michael P. Ambrosio, an ethics professor at Seton Hall law school, Christie might also be able exert \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d on behalf of the office, to keep information learned by Gibson Dunn from coming out.\n\n\u201cIt may be in the governor\u2019s interest to disclose the full scope of what the review found,\u201d Ambrosio says. \u201cOr there may be some legitimate reasons for asserting the executive privilege, because of the injury that could rebound to the office itself, not only now but in the future.\n\n\u201cPolitically, he might be better off \u2026 letting it all come out,\u201d Ambrosio added. \u201cAll privileges are a hindrance to the truth.\n\n\u201cBut it might boil down to a prudential judgment by Christie: What is reasonable under the circumstances?\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@bergen-county','@river','@starledger','chris-christie','fort-lee','gwb-closure','hoboken','hudson-county','port-authority-ny-nj'", "title": "'True goals' of Christie office's pricey, taxpayer-funded lawyer are questioned by critics", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"\\u0027True goals\\u0027 of Christie office\\u0027s pricey, taxpayer-funded lawyer are questioned by critics\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/in_scandals_maneuvers_by_lawyer_for_christies_office_raise_questions_about_his_end-game.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/14546535-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12494864\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-23T04:05:48Z\", \"author\": \"Jason Grant/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@bergen-county\",\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"chris-christie\",\"fort-lee\",\"gwb-closure\",\"hoboken\",\"hudson-county\",\"port-authority-ny-nj\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/14546535-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@JasonGrantSL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Some are questioning whether the lawyer for the governor's office, Randy Mastro, might be taking steps aimed more directly at protecting Chris Christie personally, in the scandals"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, March 26, 2014,  6:28 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/mastro-3jpg-074df35df99b58bd.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jgstarledger\", \"author_nickname\": \"Jason Grant/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"9472885\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Some are questioning whether the lawyer for the governor's office, Randy Mastro, might be taking steps aimed more directly at protecting Chris Christie personally, in the scandals", "title": "'True goals' of Christie office's pricey, taxpayer-funded lawyer are questioned by critics", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/in_scandals_maneuvers_by_lawyer_for_christies_office_raise_questions_about_his_end-game.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, March 23, 2014,  6:03 AM", "article_author": "Jason Grant/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Some are questioning whether the lawyer for the governor's office, Randy Mastro, might be taking steps aimed more directly at protecting Chris Christie personally, in the scandals"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9de\"", "article_summary": "Just which \u2014 and how many \u2014 Gibson Dunn lawyers and professionals are \u201cbilling out\u201d each day is unclear.\nA similar open public records request made with Christie\u2019s office has been denied.\nBecause some of the types of things they (Gibson Dunn lawyers) are doing seem to me to spill over into personal representation\u201d of the governor.\nIt is also a phrase \u00ad\u2014 and a mandate \u2014 that has some lawyers and state legislators questioning Mastro\u2019s \u201ctrue goals\u201d as private counsel to the governor\u2019s office.\nIt appears, they argue, that Mastro could be trying to learn whether there is any evidence that might implicate Christie in the scandals."}
