Sarasota Memorial Hospital will continue to be “in-network” for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage and employer-based policyholders under a new contract, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports.

In recent years, the insurer has been dropping providers from its Medicare Advantage network, and that was the sticking point on negotiations with Sarasota Memorial. The agreement on the contract with the hospital came late Tuesday night, just days before the annual open enrollment for Medicare ends, the Herald-Tribune reports.
