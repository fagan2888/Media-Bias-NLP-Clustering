Scott Walker is considering using public funds to finance a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team.\n\nAccording to Fox Business, Walker, a Republican, initially proposed using $220 million in state bonds to finance part of the $500 million arena. The current and previous owners of the team have pledged a combined $250 million as part of the terms of the sale of the team, leaving the city and county to finance the remaining $30 million.\n\nRepublicans in the state legislature have said that they don\u2019t want to finance more than $150 million of the project, and the city has said they will provide $18 million.\n\nFox Business also reports that the new stadium is part of \u201ca larger $1 billion entertainment district\u201d and that without a replacement for BMO Harris Bradley Center by 2017, \u201cthe NBA has said it will buy back the team and relocate it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in January Walker called his \u201cPay Their Way\u201d proposal a \u201ccommon-sense, fiscally conservative approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolute security for the taxpayers,\u201d Walker said. \u201cNo new taxes, no drawing on existing revenues, no exposure to the future \u2026 My primary purpose for doing this is to protect an existing revenue stream and not add a new state liability for state government.\u201d\n\nWalker argued that should the Bucks leave Wisconsin, the responsibility of the current stadium\u2019s maintenance falls to the state government, and as a \u201cgood steward\u201d of the state\u2019s resources \u201cit is incumbent upon me to find a plan\u201d to keep the Bucks in Milwaukee.\n\nTerms of a deal have yet to be finalized.\n\nThe owners of the Bucks along with city and state officials have yet to come to terms on the specifics of a deal, but those involved expressed optimism that the deal is only a matter of time.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the meeting was \u201cproductive,\u201d and that \u201cany financing plan will remain a part of the state budget.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee Bucks president Peter Feigin told the AP the meeting was \u201cpositive and collaborative,\u201d and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett told them that \u201ceveryone in the meeting was operating in good faith.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the governor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for a comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The stadium would be for the Milwaukee Bucks.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The stadium would be for the Milwaukee Bucks.", "title": "Scott Walker Wants to Finance New Stadium With State Bonds", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal498625.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1EoFsq0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The stadium would be for the Milwaukee Bucks.", "title": "Scott Walker Wants to Finance New Stadium With State Bonds", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal498625.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-04-26T15:08:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Milwaukee Bucks, NBA, Scott Walker, Hillary Clinton"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc50c\"", "article_summary": "Scott Walker is considering using public funds to finance a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team.\nAccording to Fox Business, Walker, a Republican, initially proposed using $220 million in state bonds to finance part of the $500 million arena.\nRepublicans in the state legislature have said that they don\u2019t want to finance more than $150 million of the project, and the city has said they will provide $18 million.\nWisconsin Gov.\nThe current and previous owners of the team have pledged a combined $250 million as part of the terms of the sale of the team, leaving the city and county to finance the remaining $30 million."}
