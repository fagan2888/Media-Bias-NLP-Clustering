A lawmaker's proposal aimed at protecting clergy and churches from being forced to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies will advance to the full Louisiana House for debate.

Rep. Mike Johnson, a Bossier City Republican, says the "Pastor Protection Act" is limited in scope, meant to protect clergy, churches and religious organizations from violating a "sincerely held religious belief" in ceremonies they perform or host.

Johnson says no other groups could deny services under his bill. He says he'll oppose any attempt to widen its reach.

The House civil law committee voted 7-3 Tuesday to send the measure to the House floor.

Opponents say the proposal is discriminatory, unnecessary and may harm Louisiana's economy.

Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, supports the bill in its current form.

Mississippi has enacted a similar but more far reaching law that includes ministers but also those who provide wedding-related services,

caterers, bakeries, florists and those who own venues that might be used for weddings.
