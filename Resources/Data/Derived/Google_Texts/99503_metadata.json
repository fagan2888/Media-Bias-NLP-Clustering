But more than anything else, it was a hungry one.\n\nThe frail Blackmon had no food or water in his home, and no immediate family or friends to be able to procure groceries for him. Desperate, Blackmon called for help from the only place he could think of, 911. And heartwarmingly, they came immediately to the rescue.\n\nAmid busy ringing phones, Marilyn Hinson, a 911 dispatcher, took pity on Blackmon, and with the blessing of her supervisor and the assistance of Fayetteville officers, personally went to Blackmon\u2019s home to deliver him groceries. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to see someone going hungry,\u201d Hinson told ABC11. She even made him several ham sandwiches to keep his energy up.\n\nThanks to the veteran Blackmon\u2019s sad tale going viral, he\u2019s now finally receiving the care he needs, with a home nurse scheduled to regularly check in on him. And two days later, Blackmon\u2019s phone and the 911 center has been constantly ringing with offers of food and help. Despite his own plight, he\u2019s asked that the extra donations be sent to the Salvation Army. \"I want everyone that goes hungry, or lives under a bridge, at least they can go to the Salvation Army. They can get some good food,\" Blackmon told ABC11.\n\nCases such as Blackmon are likely to only become more common as our citizens become older. Last year, the Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies and the AARP Foundation released a report that claims that the number of people in the United States aged 50 and over is expected to grow to 133 million by 2030. But these numbers, as it stands, won\u2019t be met by the affordable and accessible housing they\u2019ll need.\n\n\u201cRecognizing the impli\u00adcations of this profound demographic shift and taking immediate steps to address these issues is vital to our national standard of living,\u201d said Chris Herbert, acting managing director of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in a press release. \u201cWhile it is ultimately up to individuals and their families to plan for future housing needs, it is also incumbent upon policymakers at all levels of government to see that affordable, appropriate housing, as well as supports for long-term aging in the community, are available for older adults across the income spectrum.\u201d\n\nWhile these acts of charity are nothing if not incredible to see, ultimately it will take much more to prevent people like Clarence Blackmon from falling through the cracks.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "it, was, little, miracle, ringing, my, ears, 81, year, old, clarence, blackmon, saved, going", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "81-year-old Clarence Blackmon now won't have to go hungry, thanks to the help of a 911 dispatcher.", "title": "911 Dispatcher Saves 81-Year-Old Cancer Patient From Going Hungry [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/it-was-little-miracle-ringing-my-ears-81-year-old-clarence-blackmon-saved-going-333506", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/14/it-was-little-miracle-ringing-my-ears-81-year-old-clarence-blackmon-saved-going.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "81-year-old Clarence Blackmon now won't have to go hungry, thanks to the help of a 911 dispatcher.", "title": "911 Dispatcher Saves 81-Year-Old Cancer Patient From Going Hungry [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/it-was-little-miracle-ringing-my-ears-81-year-old-clarence-blackmon-saved-going-333506", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/14/it-was-little-miracle-ringing-my-ears-81-year-old-clarence-blackmon-saved-going.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/14/it-was-little-miracle-ringing-my-ears-81-year-old-clarence-blackmon-saved-going.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-14T19:09:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-14T19:10:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "81-year-old Clarence Blackmon now won't have to go hungry, thanks to the help of a 911 dispatcher."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bbc\"", "article_summary": "They can get some good food,\" Blackmon told ABC11.\nAnd two days later, Blackmon\u2019s phone and the 911 center has been constantly ringing with offers of food and help.\nThe frail Blackmon had no food or water in his home, and no immediate family or friends to be able to procure groceries for him.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand to see someone going hungry,\u201d Hinson told ABC11.\nDesperate, Blackmon called for help from the only place he could think of, 911."}
