President Obama spent another day hard at work fundraising for the Democratic National Committee in Manhattan Monday, and some of his comments have people talking.

During the fundraiser, Obama reportedly said that an apparent “congenital disease” keeps Democrats from voting in the midterm elections. CBS News White House Correspondent, Mark Knoller tweeted these out:

Pres Obama laments “congenital disease” that keeps Dems from voting in the midterms and helps GOP to win. Says too much at stake for that. — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) October 7, 2014

At DNC fundraiser, Pres Obama tells donors that the press and Washington feed voter cynicism that could cost Dems the midterm elections. — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) October 7, 2014

Traditionally, both parties experience low voter turnout in midterm elections, but Democrats are desperately trying to change the dynamic.

Obama may just be infuriating his own base by insulting them. Evidently, he hasn’t considered the possibility that his failed policies are keeping them out of the voting booth.

Either way, conservatives on Twitter had the last laugh. They seem to completely agree with the president’s assessment. Democrats do have a “congenital disease.”

@markknoller Lol, but not six years of his policies? Incredible, staggering narcism. — Sum Ting Wong (@WoodwardSteve) October 7, 2014

@markknoller Did he go off-teleprompter again? — Renee on the Right (@jrwensel) October 7, 2014

@markknoller @HarrietBaldwin Haha! “It’s not because I’m a horribly inept leader, it’s that mean old press.” — MrsBossyBritches (@LBroussard3) October 7, 2014

@mikedelta10 @TwitchyTeam Well stupidity could be a congenital disease, since Obama voters were stupid, or dead…. — Donna AlphaBitchTeer (@izzyjsmom) October 8, 2014
