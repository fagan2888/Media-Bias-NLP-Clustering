New York is requiring health insurers providing individual coverage through the state health exchange to allow victims of domestic violence or abandonment to enroll at any time.

The Department of Financial Services says those enrollments should be available starting Friday for coverage outside the state-operated exchange.

Standard enrollments through the exchange, established under the Affordable Care Act, are limited to between Nov. 1 to Jan. 31.

The department says the approach is consistent with federal policy and coverage will be available to any member of a household who is a victim, including those who are unmarried and dependents.

Insurers are Affinity, CDPHP HMO, Emblem HIP, Empire HMO, Excellus, Fidelis, HealthFirst, HealthNow, Independent IHBC, Metro Plus, MVP Health Plan, North Shore LIJ, Oscar, Oxford OHP, United and Wellcare.
