Alex Ovechkin tied Sergey Fedorov for the most goals scored by a Russian-born player and scored in the fourth round of the shootout to lift the Washington Capitals to a 3-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night.

Ovechkin made a quick move to the right on Toronto goalie James Reimer and flipped a shot past him for the first score of the tiebreaker. Washington goalie Braden Holtby then secured the win when he stopped Nazem Kadriâ€™s attempt with his right skate.

Nicklas Backstrom tied it with less than a second left in regulation for the Capitals, who have won two straight. Holtby had 23 saves through overtime.

Daniel Winnik and James van Riemsdyk scored in regulation for Toronto, and Reimer finished with 30 saves.

Ovechkin now has 483 career goals, tying Fedorov, whose 18-year NHL career ended with two seasons in Washington.
