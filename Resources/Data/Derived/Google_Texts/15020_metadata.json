Ted Cruz (R-TX) took a moment during his \u201cfilibuster\u201d of the Affordable Care Act to read the Dr. Seuss story Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters, seemingly against their wishes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get to read it that often because I tell them, \u2018Go pick the books you want to read and I read it to them,'\u201d Cruz said on the Senate floor Tuesday night. \u201cBut since tonight, girls, you aren\u2019t here, you don\u2019t get to pick the book, so I get to pick Green Eggs and Ham.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Cruz recited the entirety of Seuss\u2019 story, though as PolicyMic noted, it can be argued that he unintentionally made a case for supporting the new law, since the unnamed protagonist eventually comes around to enjoying the titular food, and Cruz has been denounced \u2014 even by fellow Republicans \u2014 for calling for a government shutdown to avoid implementing the law.\n\n\u201cI want to say to Caroline and Catherine, my angels, I love you with all my heart,\u201d Cruz said after finishing the story. \u201cIt\u2019s bedtime. Give mommy a hug and a kiss, brush your teeth, say your prayers. And daddy\u2019s going to be home soon.\u201d\n\nThe junior senator from Texas continued speaking through Wednesday morning, joined at times by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY) and Mike Lee (R-UT).\n\nCruz\u2019s speech cannot be considered a filibuster until it officially impedes further Senate business, and a vote has already been locked in for Wednesday morning by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) unless 41 senators object.\n\nWatch Cruz recite Dr. Seuss\u2019 famous story, posted on Tuesday by YouTube user \u201cHD NEWS,\u201d below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ted-Cruz-reads-Green-Eggs-and-Ham-during-filibuster-YouTube-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Ted Cruz reads \u2018Green Eggs and Ham\u2019 during Obamacare \u2018filibuster\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca159\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz reads 'Green Eggs and Ham' during 'filibuster' [YouTube]Sen.
