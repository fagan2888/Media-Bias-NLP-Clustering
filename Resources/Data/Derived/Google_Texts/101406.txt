DETROIT (AP) - The state reports that three gray wolves were killed in the first day of Michigan's wolf hunt.

Friday was the start of the wolf hunt, which is the first in the state since the animal was placed on the endangered species list nearly 40 years ago. A total of 1,200 people are licensed to participate in the hunt taking place in three Upper Peninsula zones.

Michigan is the sixth state to authorize wolf hunting following the removal of federal protections in recent years, a testament to the strong comeback of a species that was close to eradication in the lower 48 states. The season runs through December, unless the maximum kill of 43 is reached beforehand.

The Department of Natural Resources estimates the state's wolf population at 658.
