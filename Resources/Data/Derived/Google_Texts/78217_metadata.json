Colorado's insurance office has posted all rate changes for the coming year, to make sure residents know whether their premiums are going up--and why. But actually finding that information can take hours, and may not turn up results at all.\n\nCatherine Lutz is a freelance journalist based in Aspen. When Obamacare went into effect this year, she bought health insurance for her family of four through the Colorado health exchange. Right now, the monthly premiums are very low. The provider is Anthem, also called HMO Colorado or Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical Service, Inc.\n\n\u201cAt first it was $150, and I was ecstatic. And then when it dropped down to $90 a month, I was in a little bit of disbelief, but I wasn\u2019t going to question it.\"\n\nThose affordable prices are because the Lutz\u2019s family income is low enough, that they qualify for a sizable tax subsidy. When Colorado officials announced this summer that Anthem's prices for next year were available for public review, Catherine gave Aspen Public Radio the go ahead to look up her plan.\n\nWe knew Catherine\u2019s premiums could go down, since insurance officials tried this year to make health insurance cheaper in resort towns. And if her monthly bill might go up a lot, she could submit a comment on her plan, to help state officials prevent unfair rate hikes.\n\nBut what started as a quest to find out just how much Catherine might be spending on her health insurance next year, turned into a nearly two month long saga. In the end, we found confusion between state insurance officials, and one of Colorado's biggest insurance companies. Here's what happened.\n\nAspen Public Radio first tried searching the database available at the Colorado Division of Insurance. There are instructions posted but, they did little to help. This is a confusing search website. It is not user friendly. So, we asked for help.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is on \u201ccompany name,\u201d you\u2019re going to type in \u201crocky,\u201d and you can type in \u201cmounts\u201d or \u201cmountains,\u201d whatever you want. And then put an asterisk.\u201d\n\nReporter: Susan Buth is a Rate and Financial Analyst Intern with the Division. She might also be one of the most genuinely helpful people on the planet. Buth explained how to navigate: what words and dates to put into the search. Nothing about this site is intuitive.\n\nThe site is also often really, really slow. It\u2019s called SERFF, an acronym for System for Electric Rate and Form Filing. It handles all kinds of insurance for thirty one states. Buth explains it this way.\n\n\u201cAnd all of the federal plans are coming in, so they\u2019ve actually been swamped. And so that is slowing everything down.\u201d\n\nSometimes our search wouldn\u2019t even load. But when it did, we spent five and a half hours painstakingly reviewing hundreds of pages, and we couldn't find Catherine's plan. Remember all of this is was with the tips we learned from Susan Buth.\n\nWhich brings us to another hiccup. In the interest of transparency, Colorado posts every single document related to a health care plan. And, there\u2019s no way to know which documents are actually someone\u2019s health care plan\u2026 or simply explanatory paperwork about the plan.\n\nSusan Buth: \u201cAnthem Bronze Direct Access...\u201d\n\nOnce again, we called up Susan Buth.\n\n\u201cI had to go do some other looking, and it looks it appears that Anthem is not renewing that particular plan.\u201d\n\nWe call Catherine for a progress report and say, hey-- you\u2019re going to have to get a different health insurance plan for next year. Can we call Anthem to make sure. And, Catherine agrees.\n\nJoyzelle Davis, a spokeswoman for Anthem's Colorado plans, gave this explanation.\n\n\u201cThe simple answer is Mrs. Lutz\u2019s plan is not being canceled. Anthem is not planning on cancelling the policy and has not request the Division's approval to do so. Instead Anthem has filed, and the Division of Insurance has approved Anthem\u2019s request to renew this plan with certain benefit modifications in 2015.\"\n\nIn other words, after searching through detailed health documents for five and a half hours... not only was the insurance plan missing from a statewide database, the agency in charge of policing health insurance disagreed with the carrier about whether that plan should even be there.\n\nNow, let\u2019s pause for a moment: technically Colorado isn\u2019t required to post all this information during the summer. According to federal law, premium increases of ten percent or more have to be displayed by November 15th. So, in fact Colorado officials are trying to go the extra mile by posting information early. But they\u2019re failing to do it effectively.\n\nBack at Catherine\u2019s place we asked what it was like getting mixed messages about her policy.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not entirely surprised. I think they\u2019re probably making the best effort they can, but it sounds like a very, very complicated thing, unfortunately the consumer is kind of paying for it, in terms of having to spend a lot of time dealing with misinformation and changed information.\u201d\n\nVince Plymell is the spokesman for the Division of Insurance.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s less than ideal, it\u2019s what we\u2019re living with. That kind of hours upon hours isn\u2019t what we want people to have to go through, and it\u2019s why we want to look to have something better for consumers next year.\u201d\n\nThe agency started really digging around for Catherine\u2019s plan, after we passed on the message that Anthem is keeping it next year. Now it appears the cause of our confusing and ultimately fruitless search may be that Anthem didn\u2019t upload the right paperwork to the database.\n\nWe began our journey with one question: will Catherine Lutz\u2019s health care plan cost more next year? Nearly two months later, we still don\u2019t know the answer. If the monthly premiums for that plan are scheduled to go up by 10% or more in 2015, the Colorado Division of Insurance has until Novmeber 15th to make sure that plan is clearly posted. That's in order to be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The health care tax subsidy is another key factor for Catherine Lutz and many other Roaring Fork Valley residents. In the coming months, we'll take a look at whether subsidies might change for 2015.", "article_metadata": {"category": "APR Local News", "description": "If you have health insurance, you can now look up how much it might cost you next year.
