Tom Cole is a member worth chasing down a hall.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what he might say. Just this year, he said certain factions in the House GOP were acting like drunk \u201cUncle Joe\u201d ruining the family Christmas party, called the coup to unseat Speaker John A. Boehner \u201camateur night at the Bijou,\u201d and said shutting down the government was the \u201cpolitical equivalent of throwing a temper tantrum.\u201d But what makes Cole the must-have voice in any story about House Republicans is this: He brings the plainspoken, down-home Oklahoma truth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit old to not say what I think,\u201d he told CQ Roll Call over the phone after the House adjourned for the year. \u201cYou only got so many years left \u2014 and I intend to make them count.\u201d\n\nThe 64-year-old \u2014 whom Roll Call gave the \u201cOracle at Norman Award\u201d\u2014 made this year count. His quirky quotes and willingness to speak honestly about his party\u2019s shortcomings raised his national profile, and after Florida Republican C.W. Bill Young died in November, Cole was handed an Appropriations subcommittee gavel \u2014 a distinction that he said he began the year thinking, \u201cWell, maybe in four years.\u201d\n\nWhile 2013 might have been a good to him, the Oklahoma Republican called it a \u201crough year\u201d for Republicans.\n\n\u201cBut the movement\u2019s been broadly in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an extended sports metaphor, Cole said Republicans were like a team that had \u201clost a few games,\u201d but one you could look at and think, \u201cWell, maybe next season these guys can compete for the title.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough year,\u201d Cole repeated, \u201cbut we ended it a lot stronger than we began it.\u201d\n\nWhere Republicans began it, according to the six-term congressman, was in a fractured place. House Republicans came off the 2012 elections \u201ca bit sour,\u201d and started the year by swallowing the Senate\u2019s deal on the fiscal cliff after Boehner\u2019s infamous \u201cplan B\u201d fell apart and House Republicans decided they didn\u2019t have the votes to amend what the Senate sent over.\n\nShortly following the fiscal cliff, where no one seemed to go home quite happy, there was the failed effort to unseat Boehner, which, despite falling apart, still sent a clear message rippling through the conference and up to the speaker: this is a divided conference.\n\nWhen Republicans went on their February retreat to a golf resort in Williamsburg, Va., Cole said leadership really tried to unite Republicans. Particularly important in that effort was Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, who spent the year \u201ctrying to move us from bitter confrontation to how we can make the others' life better.\u201d\n\nCole floated a couple potential awards for leadership \u2014 and he didn\u2019t go for brownie points.\n\nHe gave Boehner \u201cThe Comeback Kid\u201d and Cantor \u201cMost Improved.\u201d\n\nCole noted that he thought Cantor was \u201cpretty good before.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think strategically, he\u2019s got better,\u201d Cole said.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember: All of these guys were learning their jobs. Our conference and our leadership had a rocky start but a really strong finish,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for Boehner, Cole called him the \u201cArchie Manning of politics; he\u2019s a hell of a lot better than any team he\u2019s playing on.\u201d That\u2019s high praise from a man who was born within three weeks of Manning, who amassed more than 2,000 completions, nearly 24,000 passing yards, and never once, in 13 years in the National Football League, played in a playoff game.\n\nCole said when you reflect on Boehner, you have to see someone who has \"made Washington work.\" While Cole had heaps of praise for House Budget Chairman Paul D. Ryan, he said Boehner\u2019s role in getting a budget deal shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\n\n\u201cLook: no Boehner, no deal,\u201d said Cole, who was a member of the budget conference. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nCole understands this was a small deal compared to the \"grand bargain\" fantasies many members had dancing in their heads \u2014 noting, in another extended sports metaphor, that Republicans ought to \u201caccept the first down when we couldn\u2019t get the touchdown\u201d \u2014 but he emphasized that this deal takes the \u201cpolitical threat of a shutdown off the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Boehner just gave the Senate Republicans the biggest Christmas present they ever had, because a budget means no shutdowns,\u201d he said.\n\nCole was highly critical of the shutdown strategy. He said George Pickett, the Confederate major general who led an unsuccessful attack at Gettysburg, had a better chance of success than Republicans did of actually defunding Obamacare through the continuing resolution.\n\nBut once the speaker decided to go down that road, Cole supported him.\n\nMany believe that Cole is an unofficial speaker for the speaker. Indeed, when Tom Cole is mentioned in the press, the words \u201cclose Boehner ally\u201d usually follow.\n\nCole told CQ Roll Call earlier this year, however, that \u201cthere was a time when Boehner and I were considered oil and water.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Cole threatened to resign as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee after Boehner asked him to fire the committee's top two staffers.\n\nBoehner quickly acquiesced, and they are now, once again, tight. But Cole rejects the notion that he\u2019s any sort of surrogate for Boehner.\n\n\u201cI never pretend to speak for the speaker,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Cole knows Boehner, and he offered an interesting perspective on the members who are often thorns in the speaker's side.\n\nCole said those members who are constantly standing up to Boehner remind him of the Ohio Republican. (Cole would \"neither criticize nor flatter\u201d any particular member by naming names.)\n\nBut even among those thorns in the side, Cole indicated that Boehner solidified his job this year with the conference, calling him the comeback kid \u2014 for what it's worth, Boehner is less than seven months younger than Cole \u2014 because \u201cfrom where we started to where we ended, we have a speaker that is stronger.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown may not have helped Republicans in the polls, but conservatives who demanded the defund-Obamacare-through-the-CR strategy seemed to appreciate Boehner\u2019s willingness to listen.\n\nFor instance, on the same day the House voted to reopen the government, Idaho Republican Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, a reliable critic of GOP leadership, was praising Boehner more than ever.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of speaker that I have been looking for for the last 2 1/2 years,\u201d Labrador said.\n\nWhile the budget deal was perhaps Congress\u2019 greatest legislative achievement this year, it split many House Republicans \u2014 62 of them voted against the deal. Cole, nevertheless, seemed to think the deal was about as strong as Republicans were going to get.\n\nIf Republicans had a stronger hand to play, Cole said, the deal would have been farther to the right. It just wasn\u2019t in the cards.\n\nThe budget deal now gives appropriators more money to play with \u2014 and the ability to get bills passed.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the ability to pass bills across the floor at 967,\u201d Cole said, referring to the overall sequester spending level, in billions, for fiscal 2014 discretionary accounts.\n\nHouse Republicans, as part of that \u201crough year,\u201d displayed that inability to pass appropriations bills on the floor repeatedly.\n\nWith the budget deal, Cole said Republicans finally had the ability to return to regular order, and Ryan had moved \u201cfrom big thinker to dealmaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the ability to lead in the House,\u201d Cole said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of options.\u201d\n\nHow those options \u2014 the speakership? the White House? \u2014 play out remains to be seen. But Cole said a fitting superlative for Ryan this year would be \u201cMost Likely to Succeed.\u201d\n\nThe first stop for Ryan, in the 114th Congress, is probably at the top of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nAs for the current chairman, Michigan Republican Dave Camp, Cole compared him and his effort to achieve tax reform to Moses and his 40 year struggle to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land \u2014 a place that Moses, according to the Bible, never got to himself.\n\nCole said he told Cantor that Dave-Camp-is-Moses anecdote recently, and Cantor said it was a Christianity reference that even he, a Jewish member of Congress, could understand.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next for Cole, he seems content with his new status as an Appropriations cardinal and as the Republican who will tell it \u2014 to the press and his fellow House Republicans \u2014 like it is.\n\n\u201cYour friends are the ones who tell you what you need to know, not what you want to hear,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The consensus among Capitol Hill reporters these days is that Rep.
