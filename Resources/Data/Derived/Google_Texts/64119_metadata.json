Also at issue is a program that rewards concessionaires for being top performers and allows them to win contract extensions that block others from entering the market.\n\nIn the run-up to the City Council\u2019s vote this past Tuesday night expanding the city\u2019s minority-contracting program, African-American, Latino and female business leaders lobbied council members for passage.\n\nUnion officials also pressed their issues, arguing that some of those firms benefiting from the minority-contracting program were actually fronts for rich, white businessmen whom they allege have a history of violating city wage laws.\n\n\u201cThis issue is pretty big,\u201d said Nghia Nguyen of Local 857 International Iron Workers Union. \u201cWhat kind of program does the city want to run? Does the city even care? The city seems to think that if it meets its minority-contracting goals, it can rub itself on the back, but if you peel the layers back, the city actually fails this test of promoting minority contractors.\u201d\n\nHis union already convinced city officials to kick out one firm from the minority-contracting program. It is gearing up to file a complaint to try to disqualify another firm with ties to prominent Latino business leaders. The union contends white businessmen run that firm, as well.\n\nChris Martinez, director of Denver\u2019s Division of Small Business Opportunity, said the city\u2019s minority- and female-contracting program struggled to keep pace last year with all the applicants seeking to participate in the minority contracting program. Since 2011, three firms have been investigated for participating in the program on allegations they weren\u2019t really minority owned. He said two of those firms were barred from continuing to participate.\n\nMartinez said the city plans this year to bolster training of the workers who do those investigations and to hire an additional worker, bringing the total number of those who investigate complaints and certify businesses up to five. No plans are in place to randomly investigate participating firms for compliance. Firms will be investigated only when formal, written and signed complaints are filed, Martinez said.\n\n\u201cWe have started looking at strengthening our rules and regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe iron workers union in 2012 filed a complaint alleging that the wife of a top executive of a national construction firm should not be eligible for continued participation in the city\u2019s minority- and women-contracting programs.\n\nIn November, the city agreed and removed Stephanie Johnson and her firm, Sandoval Reinforcing LLC, from the programs. Martinez found that Sandoval Reinforcing was not an \u201cindependent business enterprise\u201d and actually was controlled by her husband, Rick Johnson, an executive with Great Western Erector LLC, and his associates.\n\nBy that time, Sandoval Reinforcing already had snagged more than $3.8 million in contracts from the Regional Transportation District, which relies on Denver\u2019s list of certified minority firms.\n\nSandoval Reinforcing \u201cperformed the work and was paid accordingly,\u201d said RTD spokeswoman Pauletta Tonilas, who added that the firm received the contracts under RTD\u2019s disadvantaged business enterprise program. \u201cWe are not in any position to pursue repayment from them.\u201d\n\nPrior to bidding on the RTD projects, Sandoval Reinforcing had scant work in the construction industry, according to the city\u2019s findings. The firm had done only two other projects for which it was paid a total of nearly $600, the city found.\n\nStephanie and Rick Johnson denied they misled city officials when she applied to become certified as a minority and woman contractor.\n\nRick Johnson said they produced tax records showing he had done extensive work in the construction industry. He said he also told city officials that Stephanie Johnson was his wife.\n\n\u201cTheir requests were astronomical,\u201d Rick Johnson said. \u201cWe were going to have to pay $500 an hour to an attorney or drop our appeal. We dropped the appeal.\u201d\n\nBut the city\u2019s investigation found that Stephanie Johnson on her application did not disclose her husband\u2019s extensive construction industry ties and did not disclose that the address for Sandoval Reinforcing was the same address as steel and construction businesses her husband owns. The city also found that at least 11 former or current employees of Great Western Erectors worked on Sandoval\u2019s RTD projects.\n\n\u201cThey were just rapped on the knuckles,\u201d Nguyen said of the firm. \u201cSandoval still got millions of dollars. Our industry is small. Everyone sees this stuff. Any of the big dogs can say, \u2018Well, Great Western Erectors got away with it, and we might be caught eventually if we\u2019re as stupid as they were, but in the meantime we\u2019ll make millions of dollars.\u2019 \u201c\n\nChristopher N.
