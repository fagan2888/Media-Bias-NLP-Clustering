Yesterday, she woke up to piles of emails from strangers asking her if she was aware that her picture was being used in a bizarre anti-Obamacare meme, and spreading across the internet like wildfire.\n\nIn reality, Helene says she is very happy with her Obamacare situation and never thought it was going to be free, because she\u2019s not an idiot.\n\nVia Helene In Between:\n\nHere\u2019s what really gets me: I don\u2019t talk politics on this blog, because, honestly, I\u2019m not as informed as I\u2019d like to be. But if anyone asked me I\u2019d tell them that I voted for Obama, twice. Not only that, I actually HAVE Obamacare. Yep. I went to healthcare.gov and got insurance. Despite all the negative publicity, I have to say it was easy. I had no problems. And, unlike what the picture would have you believe, I never expected it to be free. So, not only did someone take my picture without my consent, they used it to profess the opposite of what I stand for. \u2026. Well, I do. Several of the comments on the fake political poster using my face, criticized \u201cyoung people who just think they have it so tough. God I hate them.\u201d One told the girl in the picture to \u201cGrow the fuck up.\u201d Meaning me. Most of the comments were basically just anti-Obama for the sake of being anti-Obama. We see images like this everyday. We laugh, we share, we move on. But when it twists the truth just to confuse and misinform, it makes you realize that much of what is out there isn\u2019t true. No matter what side you\u2019re on. What\u2019s more disturbing is when your face or name is associated with something you don\u2019t believe in, and there\u2019s really not a whole lot you can do about it.\n\nThe sad part about this is that it\u2019s neither truthful nor funny. I mean, Obama never claimed that the AHA was Single Payer. As someone who is ardently for Single Payer, I can attest to that. Even if that were true, which it\u2019s not, it still wouldn\u2019t be funny. I\u2019m more frightened by the fact that 15,000 people thought this was fabulously clever enough to share, and 20,000 people \u201cliked\u201d it. Not even noticing that the word \u201cconspiracy\u201d was spelled incorrectly. That actually scares me.\n\nI looked at some of the other memes posted on the Right Wing News Facebook page, and they are all equally painfully devoid of humor. And yet, the people commenting on them seem to think they are just the wittiest thing they\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s truly, truly bizarre.\n\nPersonally, I really don\u2019t like the idea of using real, non-famous people in memes to begin with. It gives me the creeps and I find it dehumanizing and mean-spirited. Even in the case of \u201cpositive\u201d memes like \u201cGood Guy Steve\u201d and what have you. It just must really suck to have people using your face to make their own point or push their own agenda. I mean, yes, things we put on the internet are \u201cpublic\u201d\u2013but that doesn\u2019t mean that we have to be assholes and not exhibit basic human dignity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ironically, said blogger is actually happy with her Affordable Healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Ironically, said blogger is actually happy with her Affordable Healthcare.", "title": "Conservatives steal blogger\u2019s pic for poorly spelled anti-Obamacare meme", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/217635/conservatives-steal-bloggers-pic-for-poorly-spelled-anti-obamacare-meme/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2014/03/aca.jpg", "height": 378}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ironically, said blogger is actually happy with her Affordable Healthcare.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "helene in between,memes,my face is a meme,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-26T16:16:18Z", "modified_time": "2014-03-26T16:16:18Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s truly, truly bizarre.\nPersonally, I really don\u2019t like the idea of using real, non-famous people in memes to begin with.\nIt just must really suck to have people using your face to make their own point or push their own agenda.\nBack in 2012, blogger \u201cHelene In Between\u201d posted a picture of herself looking distraught over a bad dye job.\nSeveral of the comments on the fake political poster using my face, criticized \u201cyoung people who just think they have it so tough."}
