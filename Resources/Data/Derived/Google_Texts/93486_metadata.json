Eight players told SI they received cash, while 29 others were named by teammates as taking money. The transgressions cited stretched from 2001 until at least 2011, the magazine said.\n\nOklahoma State said it has notified the NCAA about the report and launched its own investigation.\n\nSports Illustrated said its five-part series included interviews with more than 60 former players who played for Oklahoma State from 2001-10. Among the allegations of misconduct and potential NCAA violations are:\n\n\u2014 An Oklahoma State assistant coach, Joe DeForest, paid cash bonuses to players of up to $500 for performance.\n\n\u2014 Boosters and assistant coaches funneled money to players and provided sham jobs for which players were paid.\n\n\u2014 Tutors and school personnel completed school work for players and professors gave passing grades for little or no work.\n\n\u2014 The program\u2019s drug policy was selectively enforced, allowing some players to go unpunished for repeated positive tests.\n\n\u2014 Some members of a hostess program used by the football coaching staff had sex with recruits.\n\nNCAA rules bar boosters from providing cash or other benefits based on athletic performance. NCAA spokeswoman Emily Potter declined comment when asked about Oklahoma State, citing the organization\u2019s longstanding policy.\n\nSI reported that eight former Cowboys told the magazine they had received cash payments and 29 others were named by teammates as having also taken money.\n\nFormer player Calvin Mickens said he was handed cash in the locker room by a stranger after Oklahoma State\u2019s 2005 season-opening victory, a game in which he played well.\n\n\u201cI was like, Wow, this is the life!\u201d Mickens told SI. \u201cI\u2019m 18, playing football and I just got $200.\u201d\n\nHe said he got money at other times, including $800 later that season after the game at Texas A&M, and saw teammates getting similar handouts. Former defensive tackle Brad Girtman said he saw some star players get \u201cmonster payments,\u201d while he once received $500 from a member of the football staff.\n\nGirtman said the rates were told to him by Joe DeForest, who ran special teams and the secondary under Miles and then was an associate head coach under Gundy, the current head coach, from 2005-11.\n\nGirtman also said he recalled DeForest handing him a debit card in 2003 with $5,000 on it and that it was periodically refilled. DeForest and assistant Larry Porter, the running backs coach from 2002-04, also made payments directly to players, SI reported.\n\nDeForest is now an assistant at West Virginia, which has launched an internal review.\n\n\u201cWhile our assistant football coach has denied the allegations, it is the right thing to do to look into the matter and review practices here,\u201d athletic director Oliver Luck said.\n\nTexas men\u2019s athletics director DeLoss Dodds said Porter, now a running backs coach with the Longhorns, was questioned and \u201cwe do not have any issues with him at this time.\u201d\n\nMiles has said he didn\u2019t know of any improprieties while he was the Oklahoma State coach.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this: We have always done things right,\u201d he said after LSU\u2019s game Saturday night in Baton Rouge, La.\n\nEnergy tycoon T. Boone Pickens, the biggest booster of his alma mater, said he was disappointed the expose focused on Oklahoma State \u201ca decade ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been wholesale changes at the school in recent years in leadership and facilities,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring that time, I have given more than $500 million to OSU, for athletics and academics. Have I gotten my money\u2019s worth? You bet. We have a football program that has a commitment to principled sportsmanship.\u201d\n\nSeveral former players under Miles told SI that boosters were highly visible \u2014 in the locker room, on team flights and bus trips. After the Cowboys knocked off archrival Oklahoma in 2001, boosters approached key players and slipped cash into their hands, said former player Fath\u2019 Carter.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about $500 handshakes,\u201d he told SI, which also detailed several examples of alleged sham jobs in which players were paid hundreds of dollars for little or no work by boosters.\n\nWilliam Bell, a defensive end in 2004, said he and a teammate were directed by a member of the coaching staff to a booster\u2019s home to do a job. When they arrived, they were told their \u201cjob\u201d for \u201ca couple hundred dollars\u201d was to fish for catfish at a nearby pond\n\n\u201cAnd we got to keep all the fish we caught,\u201d Bell told SI.\n\nGov. Mary Fallin said Tuesday that the allegations against her alma mater were \u201cdisturbing and disappointing\u201d and that she is confident the school\u2019s administration will investigate the charges thoroughly.\n\nOklahoma State athletic director Mike Holder said the school has notified the NCAA \u201cand they\u2019re going to assign an investigator.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll reach out and get someone to stand with that investigator and go through the facts and at the end of the day, we\u2019ll come to some conclusions and we\u2019ll deal with those, prop ourselves back up, polish off that OSU brand and move on down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nGundy, who is preparing the No. 13 Cowboys for their home opener on Saturday against Lamar, said he was confident the proper steps would be taken. The team said Tuesday no players will be made available to comment until after the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to guess that once we get all the information and we see what\u2019s out there, then our administration, our people inside, will look at it and we\u2019ll see where we made mistakes,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll try to make ourselves better and we\u2019ll correct it and then we\u2019ll move forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Oklahoma State football players accepted substantial money", "title": "Oklahoma State football players accepted substantial money", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/10/oklahoma-state-football-players-accepted-substantial-money/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130910__mike-gundyp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130910__mike-gundyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T16:47:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:22:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf719\"", "article_summary": "Sports Illustrated said its five-part series included interviews with more than 60 former players who played for Oklahoma State from 2001-10.\nOklahoma State said it has notified the NCAA about the report and launched its own investigation.\nEight players told SI they received cash, while 29 others were named by teammates as taking money.\nNCAA spokeswoman Emily Potter declined comment when asked about Oklahoma State, citing the organization\u2019s longstanding policy.\nAmong the allegations of misconduct and potential NCAA violations are:\u2014 An Oklahoma State assistant coach, Joe DeForest, paid cash bonuses to players of up to $500 for performance."}
