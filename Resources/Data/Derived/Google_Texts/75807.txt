For the first time ever, college football, which typically ends its seasons with a series of traditional-yet-fractured bowl games, will have a playoff system. And since ESPN inked a $5.64 billion, 12-year deal to broadcast the new College Football Playoff, as its known, the network wants to make sure fans know its coming and how it works.

So naturally, they got Rudy.

Or rather, they got Sean Astin, the actor who played Daniel Ruettiger, a walk-on football player at Notre Dame in the 1993 film “Rudy,” which is beloved by many a weepy/sentimental male college football fan.

In a humorous clip on YouTube, Mr. Astin reprises his role, giving a “inspiring” locker room speech during which he explains the new playoff system, which will attempt to honor traditional college bowls but also satisfying fan wishes for a championship settled on the field rather than in polls–an ongoing complaint about the sport.

The fact that ESPN is rolling out its promotional effort so early (the playoffs won’t start until January) speaks to the stakes involved, and potential fan confusion (something Rudy pokes fun of in the clip).

Whether the campaign succeeds won’t be clear for a while. But one thing is for sure: Mr. Astin, now in his early 40s, still looks fairly youthful in the Notre Dame uniform.
