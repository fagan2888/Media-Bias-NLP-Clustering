But I thought it was rare. My AARP editor, though, knows six staffers who know someone with cognitive impairment who has managed to walk off with keys to a shiny new car.\n\nHow could this happen? Were the dealers licking their chops when they saw a confused \u201cold guy\u201d coming or did that old guy present himself as able-minded? Were the dealers duped?\n\nI went cruising for more information and steered straight to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association (AA). \u201cIn the early stage of Alzheimer\u2019s, you can have wonderful people skills that remain intact for a long time,\u201d says Ruth Drew, AA\u2019s Director of Family and Information Services. \u201cIf someone comes into a dealership, is able to talk easily, seems sharp, has good long-term memory and a good credit history, why wouldn\u2019t you sell them a car?\u201d\n\nA person with early stage Alzheimer\u2019s may have many strengths that are still there but specific deficits that are profound, says Drew. If you don\u2019t tap those deficits, it may not be obvious.\n\nDriving is a big deal to everyone \u2013 whether they have dementia or not. A car gives people a sense of control and freedom. What\u2019s more, \u201cjust because a person has a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t drive,\u201d says Drew. \u201cAt some point it might be unsafe to drive.\u201d\n\nThere are three keys to the best outcome possible:\n\nEvaluating your loved one\u2019s current abilities. What makes sense at this stage? Detecting the disease early Talking with them about what they can do when they\u2019re no longer able to drive or handle their finances. (Some questions to ask may be \u201cShould we make major purchases together?\u201d or \u201cShould we have someone else pay the bills or handle the investments?\u201d). This is great advice for all older people.\n\nFor Drew, \u201cbuying a new car isn\u2019t my number one worry. It\u2019s that the person with Alzheimer\u2019s might make disastrous decisions about their financial future, which is something much bigger than a car.\u201d She knows many families who have gone bankrupt or lost their home because someone with Alzheimer\u2019s has made poor choices. \u201cLoss of judgment is a symptom of the disease, but the family didn\u2019t realize it until it was too late,\u201d says Drew.\n\nHere\u2019s something else to remember: If your parent, partner or you are age 65, Drew recommends getting screened for cognitive function at every annual physical exam. The sooner you know what you\u2019re dealing with, the better you\u2019ll do.\n\nBoston-based Sally Abrahms writes about boomers and aging.
