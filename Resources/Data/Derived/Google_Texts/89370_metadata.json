It also saw the opening of the University of Washington light-rail station in March.\n\nThe company aims to do half its work on public projects, and half on private.\n\n\u201cWe very consciously have a foot in both camps,\u201d Eberwein said. \u201cThe common denominator being large, complex projects.\u201d\n\nHot market sectors for Hoffman include urban housing, data centers, manufacturing, research and healthcare.\n\n\u201cWith Obamacare, hospitals are going to be the big winners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting up and paying attention.\u201d\n\nInternational competition\n\nStill, regional companies like Hoffman have their work cut out for them when they go out to compete against international firms for projects.\n\nEberwein said it\u2019s a challenge \u201cstaying alive when the landscape has really large multinational competitors with headquarters in New York and overseas with real muscularity in all markets.\u201d\n\nOther top challenges for the company include safety, attracting young people into the field, and stretching themselves too thin.\n\nAnother challenge, Eberwein said, was \u201cputting wealth into the communities that have been at a disadvantage.\u201d He said the company has been working on cultivating its relationships in minority communities and nurturing small minority firms.\n\nPlenty of graduates\n\nWhile attracting construction labor can be difficult, particularly in a booming market, recruiting engineers and estimators has been easier.\n\n\u201cI would still say there\u2019s not a lack of graduates that say \u2018I want to build cool buildings,\u2019\u201d Eberwein said.\n\nAs a Portland-based company, Hoffman is also active south of the Washington border.\n\nAsked about differences between the Seattle and Portland markets, Eberwein was hard-pressed to name many.\n\nBoth are busy, he said, with urban cores that are adding \u201ca ton\u201d of housing. Seattle has the stronger office market, and Portland\u2019s office projects are more suburban.\n\nThe one big difference? Well, that\u2019s old news: It\u2019s Washington\u2019s sales tax, which adds a bite to project costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Image by Graphite Design Group [enlarge] Hoffman Construction broke ground last December on a 40-story apartment in the Denny Triangle.\nSurvey: Hoffman Construction Co.\n\u201cThe common denominator being large, complex projects.\u201dHot market sectors for Hoffman include urban housing, data centers, manufacturing, research and healthcare.\nAs a Portland-based company, Hoffman is also active south of the Washington border.\nHoffman wants its projects to feel \u201ca lot more like a Lexus automotive factory than an old-fashioned jobsite,\u201d he said."}
