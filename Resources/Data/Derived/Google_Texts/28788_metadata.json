Recently, a judge ruled that the city's ordinance that adds a $25 tax on firearms sold within the city limits, plus an additional two to five cent fee on every round of ammunition, fell within the council's taxing authority. The law goes into effect next year (via CBS News):\n\nKing County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson dismissed arguments that Seattle's tax, adopted last summer, exceeded the city's authority under state law. The measure -- one of only a few of its kind in the nation -- adds $25 to the price of each firearm sold in the city, plus 2 or 5 cents per round of ammunition, depending on the type. CBS affiliate KIRO reported the City Budget Office estimates the tax will raise between $300,000 and $500,000 a year to be used for gun violence research and prevention programs when it takes effect in January. \"The NRA and its allies always oppose these common sense steps to shine light on the gun violence epidemic,\" said City Council President Tim Burgess, who sponsored the law. \"Judge Robinson saw through the NRA's distorted efforts to put gun industry profits ahead of public safety.\" The NRA did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment, but another plaintiff, the Bellevue-based Second Amendment Foundation, promised an immediate appeal. The groups have argued state law puts responsibility for regulating firearms solely in the hands of the Legislature, not local governments. \"It is unconscionable for Mayor Ed Murray and the City Council to codify what amounts to social bigotry against firearms retailers and their customers,\" Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb said in a written statement. But the judge found the measure falls within the city's taxing authority and is not an impermissible regulation.\n\nOf course, liberals think taxes are \u201ccommon sense steps\u201d to solve any social ill. Also, there is no gun violence epidemic. Violent crime remains low, gun murders have dropped 3.9 percent from last year, and overall gun deaths have dropped 30 percent since 1993.\n\nAt the same time, this isn\u2019t the first questionable bill regarding Second Amendment rights emanating from Washington State. In February of 2013, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray was then serving in the state senate and introduced a bill that would ban assault rifles. But it included a very controversial provision that would\u2019ve allowed law enforcement to search one\u2019s home once a year \"to ensure compliance.\" Even Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat found this troubling. The bill was subsequently killed, and Murray was elected mayor of Seattle in November of that year (via Seattle Times 2/13):\n\nLance Palmer, a Seattle trial lawyer and self-described liberal who brought the troubling Senate Bill 5737 to my attention. It\u2019s the long-awaited assault-weapons ban, introduced last week by three Seattle Democrats. [\u2026] Responding to the Newtown school massacre, the bill would ban the sale of semi-automatic weapons that use detachable ammunition magazines. Clips that contain more than 10 rounds would be illegal. But then, with respect to the thousands of weapons like that already owned by Washington residents, the bill says this: \u201cIn order to continue to possess an assault weapon that was legally possessed on the effective date of this section, the person possessing shall \u2026 safely and securely store the assault weapon. The sheriff of the county may, no more than once per year, conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with this subsection.\u201d\n\nEven the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, including then-Sen. Murray, admitted that this provision was \"a mistake,\" and that it was \"probably unconstitutional\":\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a liberal Democrat \u2014 I\u2019ve voted for only one Republican in my life,\u201d Palmer told me. \u201cBut now I understand why my right-wing opponents worry about having to fight a government takeover.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s exactly this sort of thing that drives people into the arms of the NRA.\u201d I have been blasting the NRA for its paranoia in the gun-control debate. But Palmer is right \u2014 you can\u2019t fully blame them, when cops going door-to-door shows up in legislation. I spoke to two of the sponsors. One, Sen. Adam Kline, D-Seattle, a lawyer who typically is hyper-attuned to civil-liberties issues, said he did not know the bill authorized police searches because he had not read it closely before signing on. \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Kline said. \u201cI frankly should have vetted this more closely.\u201d That lawmakers sponsor bills they haven\u2019t read is common. Still, it\u2019s disappointing on one of this political magnitude. Not counting a long table, it\u2019s only an eight-page bill. The prime sponsor, Sen. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, also condemned the search provision in his own bill, after I asked him about it. He said Palmer is right that it\u2019s probably unconstitutional. \u201cI have to admit that shouldn\u2019t be in there,\u201d Murray said.\n\nSo, in a sense, this gun tax is bad, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. The state also passed a universal background check law\u2013initiative 597\u2013last year. CBS News added that gun store owners might consider leaving the city, as these taxes would kill future sales.\n\nSo, when it comes to the Second Amendment, the city council of Seattle seems to be trying to tax it out of existence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxes..05/27/2016 7:41:43AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Taxes.", "title": "Merry Christmas: Judge Rules In Favor Of Seattle\u2019s Gun Tax", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/25/merry-christmas-judge-rules-in-favor-of-seattles-gun-tax-n2097164", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/181/4151eded-4d7f-43a8-8f78-69c68206eb09.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Taxes.", "title": "Merry Christmas: Judge Rules In Favor Of Seattle\u2019s Gun Tax", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/25/merry-christmas-judge-rules-in-favor-of-seattles-gun-tax-n2097164", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/181/4151eded-4d7f-43a8-8f78-69c68206eb09.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Merry Christmas: Judge Rules In Favor Of Seattle\u2019s Gun Tax, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "So, in a sense, this gun tax is bad, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse.\nThe groups have argued state law puts responsibility for regulating firearms solely in the hands of the Legislature, not local governments.\nThe law goes into effect next year (via CBS News):King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson dismissed arguments that Seattle's tax, adopted last summer, exceeded the city's authority under state law.\n\"Judge Robinson saw through the NRA's distorted efforts to put gun industry profits ahead of public safety.\"\nSo, when it comes to the Second Amendment, the city council of Seattle seems to be trying to tax it out of existence."}
