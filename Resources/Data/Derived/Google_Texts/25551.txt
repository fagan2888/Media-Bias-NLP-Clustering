A representative from the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday was hesitant to say how quickly the agency could propose a revision to its lead and copper rule in the wake of the Flint, Mich., water crisis.

“What we’ve been able to say is that we expect to propose in 2017, and I certainly hope that that’s as early in 2017 as possible,” said Joel Beauvais, deputy assistant administrator for the EPA’s office of water, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Wednesday.

Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas) both urged the EPA to hurry. “If there was one message you can send up the chain, it’s that we’d like to have something maybe earlier than 2017,” Upton said. “That’s a long ways off.”

Beauvais did offer a hint to one possible revision. Green noted that the current rule “requires corrective action when high lead levels are found but does not penalize systems for those initial high lead levels.” He asked Beauvais if he the EPA’s revision would “include changes to incentivize systems to prevent lead contamination, not just a remedy if it’s found?” Beauvais said he expects the new rule to include that change.

But the lead contamination problem in Flint should have been prevented under the current rule, according to Beauvais. As it stands now, the rule would not have allowed the city, under the state government’s direction, to change water sources to the Flint River without applying corrosion control.

Beauvais said the agency received recommendations for revisions to its rule in December from the National Drinking Water Advisory Council. Green questioned why five months could pass and still leave the agency nearly a year away from finishing the revision.
