This administration promised to be the most transparent in history, Rachel. And I think if you would stop being a cheerleader and be a journalist, you\u2019d recognize we\u2019re not getting those answers.\u201d\n\nMaddow, always eager to pounce on the slightest hint of Republican sexism, imaginary or not, was furious:\n\nMADDOW: Did you just call me a cheerleader? HUELSKAMP: Uh, I dunno. Maybe you have that history. I\u2019m saying look at the facts \u2014 MADDOW: No, wait, wait, wait. No, hold on, hold on, hold on. Did you \u2014 HUELSKAMP: I\u2019m saying\u2013 MADDOW: Hold on! HUELSKAMP: \u2014 you\u2019re a cheerleader for the administration \u2014 MADDOW: Ok, so I\u2019m a cheerleader? HUELSKAMP: \u2014 you\u2019re not being a journalist when you\u2019re not willing to look at the facts! If it was Bush you would be jumping and screaming \u2014 MADDOW: You\u2019re amazing. HUELSKAMP: \u2014 but because it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, you don\u2019t want the answers, Rachel. Face the facts! We don\u2019t know the answers there.\n\nThe two then got into a contentious debate over whether Obama\u2019s promise to take executive action without Congress \u2014 along with unilateral changes already made to Obamacare \u2014 constitute \u201clawlessness,\u201d with Maddow suggesting Huelskamp\u2019s comment come from another universe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the universe of reality, Rachel,\u201d he retorted. \u201cThe universe of outside this Beltway. The president\u2019s speech fell flat in the real world.\u201d\n\n[h/t RCP]\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
