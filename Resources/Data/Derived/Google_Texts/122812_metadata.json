But it wasn\u2019t until Tatum Hauck Allsep enrolled at Vanderbilt University that she became an official Nashvillian. The assumption was that she would follow in her grandfather\u2019s footsteps and carve out a career in medicine, but an internship at MCA Records turned into a job where, she says, she found her tribe, the \u201cindustry of gifted misfits.\u201d She went on to launch the first-ever Office of Music Industry Relations for Vanderbilt Medical Center, a position created to build a link between the music industry and Vanderbilt Medical Center and Monroe Carell Jr. Children\u2019s Hospital at Vanderbilt. It was in that position that she found her true calling. She honed in on how to marry both industries \u2014 music and medicine \u2014 and founded Music Health Alliance, a nonprofit that provides health care access to the music industry across the nation from birth to end of life. Today, we\u2019re beyond thrilled to introduce you to Tatum Hauck Allsep, the founder and executive director of Music Health Alliance and today\u2019s FACE of Nashville!\n\nTell me about Music Health Alliance. Where did the idea originate?\n\nI have had a lifelong interest in medicine. Even though I chose the music industry for my career, I was first able to bring together my two passions when I went to work for Vanderbilt in 2006. That job opened my eyes even wider to the deficit in health care access for the music industry, a need that was initially driven home to me through personal experience.\n\nA decade ago, I found myself facing a six-figure bill after giving birth to twin boys, despite having what I thought was a good health insurance plan. I had worked in the music industry for over a decade at that point, running my own artist management company and working for MCA Records. I had done everything I was supposed to do, and I was still almost bankrupted by medical bills. I quickly learned that I was not alone. Over 76 percent of the music industry is self-employed or part of a small business. There are no HR departments or group benefits available because many musicians work part-time jobs to make ends meet, and even the most successful artists and musicians are paid as contractors, so health insurance is an enormous problem for those at both ends of the spectrum. I realized that my mission was to find a solution to these problems. I learned the business side of health insurance, worked with Vanderbilt Medical Center and learned to navigate the hospital system, trained in health care navigation and advocacy at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, studied the Affordable Care Act inside and out and cashed in my 401K (with my husband\u2019s support and blessing) to launch Music Health Alliance. I began to realize that my whole life had been leading me in this direction. My Granddaddy\u2019s framed Hippocratic Oath hangs behind my desk as a daily reminder of the journey that led me here, and the duty of care I owe to our clients.\n\nWhat has been the biggest challenge you have encountered since launching MHA?\n\nCreating from scratch a nonprofit for which there was no template to follow. One of the most interesting challenges was merging expertise from the music and health care industries, two industries who rarely intersect and speak completely different languages. Blazing this new trail with an incredible staff and board of directors has been incredibly exhilarating and rewarding as well.\n\nTell me about \u201cThe First and The Worst.\u201d What is it, and where did the idea come from?\n\nThe First and The Worst is MHA\u2019s annual fundraiser now in the planning stages of its third year. Go ahead and mark your your calendars for March 1, 2017, at City Winery. It will be a night not to be missed! Singer-songwriter and MHA board member Sandy Knox, who wrote such Reba McEntire hits as \u201cDoes He Love You\u201d and \u201cWhy Haven\u2019t I Heard From You,\u201d came up with the idea when she was teaching a songwriting class at the University of Texas. On the first day of class, Sandy would play the early songs she wrote as a teenager just starting out (\u201cMr. Phone,\u201d \u201cUp-Chuck\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re Gonna Be Gettin\u2019 Some,\u201d to name a few). This made her students feel more at ease, and they could see no one starts out writing hit songs. The First and the Worst kicks the traditional songwriters\u2019 rounds into reverse by offering songwriters a chance to publicly perform the first and worst songs they ever created in hopes of winning the now-coveted Crappy Award. And then the hysterically bad songs are followed by the mega hits.\n\nDescribe for me the most memorable moment since launching MHA that has validated all of your hard work.\n\nFor the first two years of MHA we were on what I call the coffee shop tour. We did not have enough funding for salaries, much less an office, so our staff met clients in coffee shops all over the city. There is not a plug socket in a coffee shop from Nashville to Franklin that we have not used. We had to prove that our new and unique model of health care support would work. Now, three-and-a-half years later, one of the most amazing things about this experience has been the extent to which members of the music community have stepped up to help. The greatest of these occurred in March when Garth Brooks joined Jesse Alexander, Lee Brice and the songwriting great, Bobby Braddock, to headline The First & The Worst. We raised $230,000, over half of our annual budget, in one night. Without this financial support, none of the remarkable moments \u2014 I call these our bread crumbs from Heaven \u2014 would be possible.\n\nHow many musicians and music industry folks have you been able to steer towards health care since launching MHA?\n\nBy the end of 2015, we had served 4,100 music industry professionals and their families, and secured over $10.8 million in health care cost reductions to Heal the Music.\n\nWhat is the biggest misconception about the music business?\n\nFame equals fortune\n\nWhen you\u2019re not working, how do you unwind?\n\nI absolutely love estate sale treasure hunting. My husband calls this dumpster diving and suggests that an intervention may be in my future. I absolutely love to find vinyl records, Nashville relics and great jewelry that can be repurposed. As the mother of three, this has also been a very effective and fun way to teach financial responsibility in our house. We have spent many Saturday mornings at estate sales with the goal of seeing how creative we can be with $10. Every one of these Saturdays over the years has yielded a treasure, either a keeper or great eBay resale.\n\nWhere is your favorite place to grab a bite to eat, and what do you order there?\n\nCity House is my absolute favorite place in Nashville. Anything Tandy Wilson creates to eat and his wife, Stephanie, creates to drink is incredible. They make me feel like an honest-to-goodness foodie. Goozy in Green Hills Mall is a great stop with our kids for a grilled cheese sandwich and homemade artisan gelato.\n\nWho has been your biggest inspiration/mentor as you\u2019ve journeyed down your professional path?\n\nThe legendary women of the Nashville music industry who poured the foundation for us in what has traditionally been a good ol\u2019 boys\u2019 club are immense inspirations for me. Women like Jo Walker-Meador, Frances Preston, Judy Harris, Donna Hilley, Pat Rolfe, the founders of SOURCE, and now women like Cindy Mabe, Sarah Trahern, Beverly Keel, Linda Edell Howard, Anastasia Brown and Chandra LaPlume are carrying the torch for the next generation of women in the music industry. But my greatest music industry mentor is someone that I\u2019m fortunate enough to work with every single day, Shelia Shipley Biddy. Shelia was the first female head of a record label in Nashville in the late \u201890s, and I was her intern. She should have fired me several times during my stint at Decca Records, but she did not. Instead she used each of my offenses as teaching opportunities to learn life lessons like think before you speak, the value of paying your dues and work harder and work smarter to name a few. She is the yin to my chaotic yang in the MHA office. I am grateful for her patience, wisdom and perseverance more than words, but most of all, I am honored to call her my friend.\n\nWhat is the best piece advice you\u2019ve ever been given?\n\nThere have been some great nuggets of wisdom passed down over the years from my parents. From my mother who is a free spirit, \u201cRide the river, hold on, laugh loud and enjoy the moment.\u201d And my Dad, who is more cautious, \u201cHire slow, fire fast.\u201d But it\u2019s an old Polish proverb that my husband said in passing several years ago that I think of daily, \u201cNot my circus, not my monkeys.\u201d This has been a great reminder for all of us at MHA, especially when we have an urge to venture away from our core mission.\n\nWhat are three things you can\u2019t live without, excluding faith, family and friends?\n\nMusic, caffeine and an open mind\n\nThank you to Tatum and her team of wonder women for making a difference in the lives of so many.
