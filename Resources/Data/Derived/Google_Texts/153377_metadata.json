But a measure that should be a no-brainer, deserving of bipartisan support, permits dental therapists to practice in some rural and underserved areas of the state.\n\nCourtesy photo\n\nDental therapists are trained to provide routine care, including drilling and filling cavities. Last year, a bill that would have allowed dental therapists to practice in New Mexico passed the Republican-held House, with Democratic support, only to fail in the Senate without so much as a floor vote.\n\nHowever, a task force of legislators, along with supporters and opponents of dental therapists, came to a compromise late last year. The bill they\u2019ve crafted, HB 191, isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 the establishment of a state dental director isn\u2019t necessary, and neither is a mandate that all children receive a dental exam as a prerequisite to school enrollment. Nonetheless, allowing dental therapists to work in our state would be a promising reform.\n\nIt is not a government mandate. It doesn\u2019t involve taxpayer subsidies. It\u2019s working in other states, including Minnesota and Alaska. And it\u2019s a solid step away from the ugliness of professional protectionism through government licensing.\n\nSupport for reducing or eliminating government\u2019s role in occupational licensing has drawn support from such ideologically disparate people as Nobel-Prize-winning, libertarian economist Milton Friedman and President Obama.\n\nFriedman railed against the evils of professional licensing in speeches and debates that can be found online. The president\u2019s 2016 budget proposal \u201cseeks to reduce occupational licensing barriers that keep people from doing the jobs they have the skills to do by putting in place unnecessary training and high fees.\u201d Last year, the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers issued a detailed report questioning the benefits of occupational licensing.

Both of the latter support the \u201cAffordable Care Act,\u201d while the Rio Grande Foundation works overtime to expose Obamacare\u2019s many disappointments and failings.\n\nIn many rural areas of our state, dental coverage is not the issue \u2013 care is. According to a 2013 report by the Legislative Finance Committee, over 63 percent of New Mexicans live in areas where there are shortages of dental-health personnel. Allowing these professionals to carry out some activities that have previously been only available under the direct care of dentists would improve accessibility in rural and underserved communities. It can also create new business opportunities for entrepreneurial dentists.\n\nHB 191 allows dentists to supervise therapists from off-site. But remote management doesn\u2019t apply to filling cavities, despite mounds of evidence that shows that dental therapists can do the job effectively and safely under off-site supervision. Fixing this flaw would give a dental practices more flexibility in setting up a satellite office in a small town, and/or extending their office hours to serve more patients.\n\nHealthy teeth are in many ways the key to overall health. People with periodontal disease are two times more likely to develop heart disease and arterial narrowing as a result of bacteria and plaque entering the bloodstream through the gums. That\u2019s not all. Poor dental hygiene is correlated with everything from dementia to diabetes and even cancer. Increasing the availability of dental care in New Mexico can have cascading positive benefits throughout our healthcare system.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s lawmakers and governor have a chance to bring the free-market solution of dental therapy to our state by stripping the extraneous mandates and costs out of HB 191, and expanding scope-of-practice capabilities throughout rural New Mexico. The clock is ticking on the 2016 session.\n\nDental therapy is good for patients, taxpayers, and the economy.
