Everything we've worked for for the last 42 years, it's pretty much gone,\" farm owner Lila Fechner said.\n\nIn addition to a machine shed, grain bins, and field equipment, Lila and Michael Fechner lost their home.\n\nFor the Fechners, it all started with a warning from their son-in-law to \"look out the south window, and get in the basement,\" Fechner said.\n\nTogether with a neighbor, they took shelter in a corner of the basement.\n\n\"I said, 'We gotta hang on to each other,' so we covered up. Prayed, of course, that it wouldn't hit,\" Fechner said.\n\nWhen it did, it slid the house from above their heads, exposing the basement to the open sky.\n\n\"There was a rush - I say - there was was more noise, really, when it was on its way than when it actually happened,\" Fechner said.\n\nEven in the wake of such shocking destruction, family and friends were quick to respond.\n\n\"Words can't express what it means. I've heard from people I haven't heard from in years, since this happened,\" Fechner said.\n\nFechner's more concerned about people in town.\n\n\"We're in our sixties, but there's people in their eighties in town that have lost their homes, and I can't imagine, you know, what they're gonna do,\" Fechner said.\n\nAs for her belongings?\n\n\"We'll check that out later. You can replace things but not people,\" Fechner said.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
