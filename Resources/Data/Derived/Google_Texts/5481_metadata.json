The Bruins gradually improved their blocking. A key reverse for a TD by Joseph Parker covered 53 yards. A coffin-corner punt by Charlie Scott pinned Pomona at its 1-yard line.\n\nStill, the first half ended 6-3 and, well \u2026 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have sat there for this after paying,\u201d Madden said.\n\nBruins coach Dave Logan didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cWe tried to give the game away in the first half,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we played hard. We just need to get a lot better. I was proud of the effort. Pomona\u2019s good and this is part of the building process.\u201d\n\nHall, steady all game, said yes, he would sleep well.\n\n\u201cBut blockers helped me and we\u2019re just trying to get better every week,\u201d Hall said.\n\nThe Bruins rushed for 309 yards on 39 attempts, but they were only 9-of-29 passing for 112 yards.\n\nPomona was held to 181 total yards.\n\nNeil H.
