Obamacare will become even more reviled if it survives court challenges.\n\nIronically, more than 1400 Obamacare exemptions were granted by the Obama administration, mostly to liberal allies in labor and among special interests. Liberals have effectively discredited themselves if they don't want or trust a program they've sought to impose on America for decades.\n\nNo matter how diligently the left exploits random, senseless mass killings, most Americans oppose gun control. In the same way the Kyoto Protocol couldn't attract even Democratic support, climate treaties remain Senate non-starters.\n\nA significant majority of Americans understands that, when federal law is ignored as Obama has ignored immigration law, sovereignty is lost and chaos results.\n\nAnd a majority of Americans still accepts that enhanced interrogations may be justifiable under some circumstances.\n\nMost Americans haven't reached the conclusions liberals expected on any of these issues, because liberal media, higher education and other sources of left-wing indoctrination are gradually losing their power to influence public opinion.\n\nNone of the \"evidence\" the left accepts as irrefutable confirmation of their long-cherished liberal policies has been embraced by the nation at large.\n\nObama squandered his and fellow liberals' future political capital on programs they coveted but which traditional Americans dislike or with which they disagree.\n\nBench-thinning losses to conservative candidates at state and local levels should be even more distressing to the left than their national electoral and policy failures.\n\nA wave of Republican governors in blue Midwestern and Northeastern states (Snyder in Michigan, Walker in Wisconsin, Kasich in Ohio, Baker in Massachusetts) and large GOP gains in state legislatures nationwide suggest an almost comprehensive rejection of liberal policies, that the country as a whole is becoming more conservative.\n\nThe anti-liberal backlash will worsen as the self-styled imperial Obama obstinately presses on domestically and the malign effects o fhis foreign policy develop.\n\nDemocratic politicians are beginning to distance themselves from a president who lies to and misleads Americans, who has overseen numerous bureaucratic scandals, and who pursued policies that not only failed, but some of which, like Obamacare, were imposed on America knowing they would never work as advertised.\n\nConservatives will have help in dismantling the policies of the Obama years. In order to advance or, in some cases, simply preserve their careers and resurrect the party after (or before) Obama leaves office, ambitious Democrats will have no options other than denying, ignoring or rebuking the unpopular, destructive policies they enabled or defended during Obama's two terms.\n\nPractically speaking,it's difficult to imagineanother candidate as liberal as Obama being elected president anytime soon.\n\nAmerica's experience with Barack Obama has ensured that, for years, American presidents will most likely emerge from the political right.\n\nSorry, Hillary.\n\nJerry Shenk is a PennLive/Patriot-News community columnist.
