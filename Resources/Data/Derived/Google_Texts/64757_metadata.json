Bill Haslam (Photo: File / The Tennessean)Buy Photo Story Highlights Bill Haslam and I agree on a lot, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.\n\nIn this state, with its political climate, it is rare when Democrats and Republicans agree on anything. When they do, it must be pretty bad. Such is the case with Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s privatization plan and its direct aim at the jobs of thousands of dedicated Tennesseans.\n\nGov. Haslam says he and his administration are on a fact-finding mission, exploring the option of privatizing thousands of jobs across Tennessee at our state parks, state properties and colleges and universities. However, those who have followed the governor since taking office know of his administration\u2019s fondness for privatizing state operations and the missteps made along the way.\n\nWe saw it when they controversially paid private Chicago-based firm Jones Lang LaSalle to study state buildings, which led to the suggested demolition of the Cordell Hull building and subsequent public outcry.\n\nAfter that information finally became public, outcry from Tennessee residents forced the governor to halt his demolition plans and pay nearly $100,000 more to a new company only to find that it would be cheaper for the state to renovate the Cordell Hull building.\n\nNow the governor and his team want us to trust them again to privatize thousands more jobs across the state, with the help of more consultants being paid with state money.\n\nAgain, they say they are just looking at the option, but as uncovered by NewsChannel 5\u2019s Phil Williams, we now know a detailed report is in place to finalize a full privatization plan by August. In that report, it details how management of thousands of state jobs would be handed over to a private company and the supposed need to \u201cbuild momentum\u201d and \u201ccompress\u201d the timeline of implementing the plan.\n\nBill Freeman (Photo: Submitted)\n\nThere also have been directives for those involved with the study to not speak of the plans over email, to keep those from being made public.\n\nI have agreed with the governor on many things during his time in office, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.\n\nIf it were truly just a fact-finding endeavor to examine possible cost savings, why the need to \u201cbuild momentum\u201d and \u201ccompress\u201d timelines? Why is there a plan in place for full implementation in less than a year that would have gone unnoticed without investigative reporting?\n\nThe bigger question is why the privatization of state jobs is even something being looked at again. We have seen how ineffective that model can be.\n\nThe governor has used services like custodians at our colleges and universities as an example of where costs could be reduced. We have already seen that attempted, in the governor\u2019s backyard, in fact. At the University of Tennessee, the private company GCA Services Group was contracted to take over UT\u2019s custodial duties.\n\nGCA was a company facing accusations across the country for low pay to its employees, and it had numerous documented instances of employing people with violent criminal histories \u2014 even wanted criminals on the run \u2014 and placing them in schools, including here in Tennessee.\n\nAt UT, after GCA\u2019s initial contract expired in 2012, the university was so dissatisfied with GCA's performance it decided not to renew and brought the services back in-house.\n\nIn this one example, hundreds of dedicated Tennesseans' jobs were handed over to a company with a poor record of paying its employees and providing safe environments. Now the governor wants us to trust him and his administration to do this across the state?\n\nThere are many ways the governor can help higher education, but filling our campuses with employees brought in by the lowest bidder is not one of them. Our campuses and state facilities across Tennessee are filled with dedicated employees who care deeply about where they work and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect by their state\u2019s top leaders.\n\nWe as Tennesseans were able to tell the governor not to tear down the Cordell Hull building; now we must do like the League of Women Voters recently did and tell him again not to tear apart the lives of thousands of dedicated Tennesseans.\n\nBill Freeman is the chairman of Freeman Webb Inc., a real estate investment, management and brokerage company based in Nashville and that he co-\u00adfounded in 1979.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1OA5qaW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bill Haslam and I agree on a lot, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Bill Haslam and I agree on a lot, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.", "title": "Governor, protect Tennessee jobs, don't outsource them", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/01/02/governor-protect-tennessee-jobs-dont-outsource-them/77967800/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill Haslam and I agree on a lot, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.", "title": "Governor, protect Tennessee jobs, don't outsource them", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6a7eb738163af433996065661a550090a39aada3/c=0-0-401-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Governor, protect Tennessee jobs, don't outsource them", "author": "Bill Freeman", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1567c81b125406b84ca821f38c41db5ae3676168/c=117-0-418-401/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89a6fa9362dfa0f9a4d7590293879b99c3b724aa/c=0-0-401-401/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9902e24b3ce22452871a78d74d7f00970fb66eca/c=0-0-533-401/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4eaa6c47a999837495a122facfcdc436e76a4b83/c=0-65-533-366&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-02T10:47:03.127000-06:00", "shorthed": "Governor, don't outsource Tennessee jobs", "articleid": 77967800, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7daa3cb5266fb5b21cd45ff402f07bd209f8a88c/c=0-65-533-366/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12e8db1cf3ffa498f089d5fa0fd628dc1c2b4ebe/c=155-0-380-401/local/-/media/2015/12/14/Nashville/Nashville/635857078565333108-haslam.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Governor Bill Haslam, privatization, University of Tennessee, outsourcing, Tennessee state parks"}, "article_summary": "The bigger question is why the privatization of state jobs is even something being looked at again.\nBill Haslam\u2019s privatization plan and its direct aim at the jobs of thousands of dedicated Tennesseans.\nBill Haslam (Photo: File / The Tennessean)Buy Photo Story Highlights Bill Haslam and I agree on a lot, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.\nI have agreed with the governor on many things during his time in office, but this privatization plan does not pass the smell test at all.\nHaslam says he and his administration are on a fact-finding mission, exploring the option of privatizing thousands of jobs across Tennessee at our state parks, state properties and colleges and universities."}
