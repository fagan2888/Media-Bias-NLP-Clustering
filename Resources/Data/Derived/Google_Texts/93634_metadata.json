The rest of us suffer with higher prices and fewer choices.\n\nA case in point: the proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot currently under review by the Federal Trade Commission. For decades, big chains have been wiping out small stationery stores, and two years ago Office Depot swallowed Office Max.\n\nIf this latest deal goes through, there will be nothing left to merge. The United States will be left with just one office-supply superstore chain.\n\nOur union has studied the proposed merger and we found that consumers will suffer, especially in low-income and minority communities with limited Internet access. And companies that buy office supplies \u2014 essentially every business in the country \u2014 will be held hostage to price increases, supply interruptions and other negative consequences of a nationwide monopoly.\n\nThe trend toward bigger mergers can and should be stopped. Blocking the Staples/Office Depot deal is the right place to start.\n\nMARK DIMONDSTEIN\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Postal Workers Union\n\nWashington", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151109032103, "twitter": {"description": "The postal workers union objects to a proposed merger of the two remaining office-supply superstores.", "title": "Too Many Giant Mergers", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/too-many-giant-mergers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004018628"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/too-many-giant-mergers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004018628", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/too-many-giant-mergers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Too Many Giant Mergers", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 9, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Staples Inc", "keywords": "Mergers  Acquisitions and Divestitures,Office Supplies and Equipment,Office Depot Inc.,Staples Inc", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The postal workers union objects to a proposed merger of the two remaining office-supply superstores.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The postal workers union objects to a proposed merger of the two remaining office-supply superstores.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 9, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-11-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Staples Inc", "published": "2015-11-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "09LWEBmergers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151109062706, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/too-many-giant-mergers.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The postal workers union objects to a proposed merger of the two remaining office-supply superstores.", "title": "Too Many Giant Mergers"}, "pdate": 20151109, "des": "Office Supplies and Equipment", "articleid": 100000004018628, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Too Many Giant Mergers", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "For decades, big chains have been wiping out small stationery stores, and two years ago Office Depot swallowed Office Max.\nTo the Editor:The Times hit it right on the money with your Nov. 1 editorial \u201cHow Mergers Damage the Economy.\u201d Federal officials have allowed too many already giant companies to get even bigger.\nA case in point: the proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot currently under review by the Federal Trade Commission.\nBlocking the Staples/Office Depot deal is the right place to start.\nOur union has studied the proposed merger and we found that consumers will suffer, especially in low-income and minority communities with limited Internet access."}
