A hospital social worker is suing Broward Health, saying officials refused to let her return to work after she underwent a double mastectomy and refused to undergo a health screening, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.

Broward Health requires a mandatory health screening for all employees returning to work after taking three or more days of sick leave, the Sun Sentinel reports. Medical social worker Andrea Santiago asked to waive that in lieu of a note from her doctor.

According to the Sun Sentinel, Santiago's lawsuit claims that the health screening policy is a violation of the Family Medical Leave Act.
