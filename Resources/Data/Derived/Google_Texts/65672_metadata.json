President Barack Obama has mischaracterized the JCPOA as an \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d to avoid the necessity of Senate approval by a two-thirds majority. That consensus is beyond his political reach.\n\nThe president\u2019s JCPOA label is both preposterous and alarming \u2014 another executive usurpation of a congressional prerogative that has reduced the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers to an ink blot.\n\nA treaty by any other name is still a treaty.\n\nAn analogy from Abraham Lincoln is unanswerable. When asked, \u201cHow many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Lincoln owlishly replied, \u201cFour. Calling a tail a leg doesn\u2019t make it a leg.\u201d\n\nBut the Senate is doing nothing to defend its Treaty Clause role. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, exhibits all the courage of a watchdog that retreats to its kennel when danger appears.\n\nHe disarmed the Senate\u2019s ability to block the JCPOA by spearheading the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. It permits the executive agreement to become effective unless both the House and Senate vote resolutions of disapproval and marshal two-thirds majorities to override a certain presidential veto. That negative congressional consensus unattainable. Nearly 40 senators have already announced their support for the JCPOA.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, however, has refused to excuse a separation of powers violation simply because the violated branch consents to the rape. The doctrine is intended to protect the liberties of the people irrespective of a branch\u2019s eagerness to abdicate its responsibilities. Chief Justice John Roberts has explained: \u201c[T]he values of liberty and accountability protected by the separation of powers belong not to any branch of the Government but to the Nation as a whole. A branch\u2019s consent to a diminution of its constitutional powers therefore does not mitigate the harm or cure the wrong. \u201c\n\nThe Treaty Clause was embraced because the president cannot be trusted on the international stage to subordinate private ambitions to the national welfare. Alexander Hamilton elaborated in Federalist 75: \u201cThe history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind, as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a President of the United States.\u201d Hamilton also defined treaties as \u201cCONTRACTS with foreign nations which have the force of law \u2026 agreements between sovereign and sovereign.\u201d\n\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties echoes that definition: \u201c[A]n international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.\u201d\n\nEven migratory birds have been subject to treaties, for instance, the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916 with Great Britain Agreements addressing nuclear weapons have uniformly been deemed treaties by the United States, including the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (I), the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (II), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.\n\nTestifying before the House Foreign Relations Committee last July 28, Secretary of State John Kerry defiantly maintained that the JCPOA was not submitted as an executive agreement because Senate would reject it as a treaty. He amplified to Republican Rep. Reid Ribble of Wisconsin: \u201cI spent quite a few years ago trying to get a lot of treaties through the United States Senate. And frankly, it\u2019s become physically impossible \u2026 Because you can\u2019t pass a treaty anymore \u2026 And I sat there leading the charge on the Disabilities Treaty which fell to, basically, ideology and politics. So I think that\u2019s the reason why [the JCPOA was not submitted as a treaty].\u201d\n\nOnce upon a time, such sneering contempt for the Constitution would have been deemed an impeachable offense justifying removal from office \u2014 a variation of President Richard Nixon\u2019s counter-constitutional arrogance to David Frost: \u201c[W]hen the President does it that means it is not illegal.\u201d\n\nMajority Leader McConnell should orchestrate a Senate resolution authorizing the chamber to bring suit against President Obama to enjoin implementation of the JCPOA as an unconstitutional executive agreement in violation of the Treaty Clause. Recent Supreme Court decisions concerning the political question doctrine and standing would give the litigation a fair prospect of success.\n\nPosterity will execrate him if he acquiesces in presidential dictatorship without a fight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) intended to constrain Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for a relaxation of sanctions is a \"treaty\" under Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) intended to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions in exchange for a relaxation of sanctions is a \u201ctreaty\u201d under Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.", "title": "BRUCE FEIN: Another Senate abdication: The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/7/bruce-fein-another-senate-abdication-joint-compreh/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/27/federalist_papers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/27/federalist_papers.jpg", "description": "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) intended to constrain Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for a relaxation of sanctions is a \"treaty\" under Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the U.S.", "card": "summary", "title": "BRUCE FEIN: Another Senate abdication: The Joint Comprehensive Plan of"}, "Author": "Bruce Fein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Barack Obama, Senate"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama has mischaracterized the JCPOA as an \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d to avoid the necessity of Senate approval by a two-thirds majority.\nHe disarmed the Senate\u2019s ability to block the JCPOA by spearheading the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015.\nHe amplified to Republican Rep.
