WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama nominated a diverse group of candidates Wednesday to be judges as the White House tries to address concerns from black lawmakers about minority representation on the federal bench.

The White House noted that only one of the five nominees was a white male. One nominee was Florida state judge Darrin Gayles, who would be the first openly gay black man to serve as a federal judge if confirmed by the Senate.

Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, meanwhile, was meeting privately with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. They’ve complained about a lack of diversity among Southern judges in particular.

The meeting was first reported by Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill and confirmed by the White House, which declined to comment on what was said. The Congressional Black Caucus and several of its members did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
