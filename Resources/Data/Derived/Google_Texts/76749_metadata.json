The new book by the founder and editor of National Affairs would be formidable if it merely diagnosed how America arrived at what he calls \u201cour age of fracture.\u201d But The Fractured Republic is exhilarating because Levin doesn\u2019t just demand that policymakers jettison nostalgia and come up with creative new approaches\u2014he walks the walk, offering a model answer of his own.\n\nLevin traces the national economic and cultural consolidations of the Progressive Era, the Great Depression, World War II, and the postwar era, when a moment of cohesion and liberalization allowed the country to \u201cbenefit from the familial, social, cultural, and economic stability made possible by that unity and order, while also benefiting from the dynamism made possible by greater individualism, diversity, and competition.\u201d But this \u201cinevitably fleeting transition,\u201d he shows, gave way to \u201cdwindling solidarity, cohesion, stability, authority, and social order.\u201d\n\nChange creates serious problems if met with nostalgia instead of creativity. In a wry yet insightful passage, Levin maps the aging of the nation\u2019s culturally dominant Baby Boomers to the way each decade has come to be remembered: childhood in the 1950s as \u201ca simple time of stability and wholesome values\u201d giving way to the \u201cyouthful rebellion and growing cultural awareness\u201d of the mid-1960s, then a \u201cconfidence shaking\u201d entry into real life in the 1970s, \u201csettling down\u201d in the 1980s, \u201cbuilding wealth and stability\u201d in the 1990s, and starting to \u201cpeer over the hill toward old age\u201d at the turn of the century. The Left, he suggests, looks back longingly to the idealism of the sixties; the Right, to the stability of the eighties. Rather than accept society\u2019s profound transformation, \u201cwe have tended to understand this era of uncertainty . . . as an aberration, and so we have spent the past decade and more waiting for a return to normal that has refused to come.\u201d\n\nLevin illustrates how this nostalgia infects and distorts American politics, leading both parties to create platforms aimed at resurrecting a bygone era. Policymakers on the left are forever \u201cseeking to add more rooms onto the mansion of the Great Society\u201d because they fail to recognize the \u201cunstable dichotomy\u201d of economic consolidation and cultural liberalization it embodied. Presiding over the Obamacare vote in the House of Representatives, Levin notes, Nancy Pelosi proudly wielded the same gavel used by Congressman John Dingell for the passage of Medicare 45 years earlier. The Right, meanwhile, feels \u201cthe urge to define today\u2019s problems as simply a reversal of Reagan-era achievements . . . . They paint in broad strokes an economy that could grow with gusto if only some straightforward, misguided restraints were removed.\u201d But \u201cthe combination of global circumstances, regulatory restraints, cultural exclusions, and policy controls\u201d that supported a \u201chalf-remembered golden age\u201d at mid-century \u201cis not one that we could (or would want to) re-create today.\u201d So Levin poses the question at the book\u2019s heart: \u201cHow can we make the most of the opportunities afforded by the dynamism and the freedom set loose by America\u2019s postwar diffusion while mitigating its costs and burdens, especially for the vulnerable among us?\u201d\n\nThe key question is not which federal programs should we expand, contract, or reform, but under what social framework\u2014inevitably different from the one in place in 1950\u2014will America thrive? Neither Left nor Right has answered this question. Levin seeks to offer a plausible vision of an American future that sounds different from LBJ-era progressivism or Reaganite smaller government. Paraphrasing James Madison, he argues that \u201cwe must seek diffusing, individualist remedies for the diseases most incident to a diffuse, individualist society.\u201d He calls his own vision \u201csubsidiarity,\u201d which he defines as \u201cthe entrusting of power and authority to the lowest and least centralized institutions capable of using them well.\u201d\n\nSubsidiarity demands a reinvigorated role for what Levin, following figures like Peter Berger and Richard John Neuhas before him, calls the \u201cmediating institutions\u201d of society\u2014family, work, community, religion\u2014that operate in the middle ground between individuals and their government. These institutions have, he says, been \u201chollowed out\u201d by the complementary ascent of centralized government and radical individualism. Forcing interaction \u201cface to face\u201d or \u201cliving more of our lives at eye level with one another,\u201d as he puts it, \u201ccan help build stronger habits of engagement and participation at the local level, where, too often, meeting spaces now stand empty, because what happens there is not allowed to matter.\u201d This is a federalism of sheer necessity: localized problem-solving is uniquely responsive to the challenges of fracture.\n\nThese principles find ready application in the economic sphere. The concept of subsidiarity provides intellectual grounding for a broad range of existing policy ideas from the Right\u2014flex funds, charter schools, faith-based initiatives, among others\u2014and also offers a basis for the nascent \u201cpublic-options progressivism\u201d on the left.\n\nBut what about the culture, whose transformation Levin says has run much deeper than the economy\u2019s? Levin is at his best when making the secular case for social conservatism\u2014describing how \u201cexpressive individualism,\u201d in coming to dominate American culture, has eviscerated many of society\u2019s critical institutions, and what an alternative built on relational obligations and \u201cmorally meaningful communities\u201d might look like. While declaring it \u201crather obvious . . . that cultural and economic factors are inseparable,\u201d Levin views \u201cfamily breakdown, cultural dysfunction, and the polarization of norms\u201d to be the primary culprits impairing opportunity.\n\nHis formula of subsidiarity, however, makes an awkward fit for this challenge. Levin believes that \u201cthe common culture is much less important than it used to be,\u201d which makes it \u201cmuch easier to imagine local, bottom-up moral subcultures creating the circumstances necessary for social renorming and moral revival.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t \u201cabandon\u201d the common culture or \u201cstop struggling for its character and soul,\u201d but he sees the best opportunity for positive change in \u201cliving out what we propose to our neighbors as the good life.\u201d That prescription seems inadequate for those struggling with cultural dysfunction in collapsing communities, who are the focus of his concern. Many of the societal bifurcations he laments would preclude these Americans from encountering positive role models. And his prescription of a \u201csubcultural approach\u201d doesn\u2019t differ much from what we\u2019re doing today, which isn\u2019t working terribly well. Levin suggests that traditionalists \u201cmay not need to do something new, but they might need to understand what they are already doing in a new way,\u201d and that \u201cthis can suffice, especially if they are willing to welcome into their circle outsiders who come in search of what they have to offer.\u201d But this can\u2019t suffice if the goal is to reverse the decline of subcultures whose members seem ill-equipped to turn this around on their own.\n\n\u201cThe absence of easy answers,\u201d Levin argues, \u201cis precisely a reason to empower a multiplicity of problem-solvers throughout our society.\u201d Yet he wants the conservative subculture to \u201cembody universal human truths that should shape the character of the larger society.\u201d Since, in his view, there is a right answer, subsidiarity as he describes it seems less solution than resignation.\n\nStill, it\u2019s no small accomplishment that Levin manages to give readers a thorough diagnosis, a usable vocabulary, and a foundation to build from. He urges us to define notions of success that are \u201cindigenous to twenty-first-century America,\u201d not relics of an earlier era. And he puts society\u2019s mediating institutions at the center of his vision. \u201cThe work of reinforcing them,\u201d he concludes, \u201csustaining the space for them, and especially putting them within the reach of as many of our fellow citizens as possible must be among our highest and most pressing civic callings. That calling, rather than a hyper-individualist liberation, should be the organizing principle of our political life, helping us to see what to conserve and how to progress.\u201dAgree or disagree with Levin\u2019s prescription, he has made the need for a novel and aggressive course of treatment impossible to deny.\n\nPhoto by wwing/iStock", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "City Journal", "description": "Yuval Levin shows how America can thrive in its age of fracture.", "title": "No More Nostalgia", "url": "http://www.city-journal.org/html/no-more-nostalgia-14451.html", "image": "http://www.city-journal.org/sites/cj/files/20160523-oc.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-24T15:24:44-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.city-journal.org/html/no-more-nostalgia-14451.html", "image": {"src": "http://www.city-journal.org/sites/cj/files/20160523-oc.jpg"}, "description": "Yuval Levin shows how America can thrive in its age of fracture.", "card": "summary", "title": "No More Nostalgia"}, "fb": {"app_id": 841926292587734}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-23T16:58:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-24T15:24:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "as an aberration, and so we have spent the past decade and more waiting for a return to normal that has refused to come.\u201dLevin illustrates how this nostalgia infects and distorts American politics, leading both parties to create platforms aimed at resurrecting a bygone era.\nThe Left, he suggests, looks back longingly to the idealism of the sixties; the Right, to the stability of the eighties.\nThe Fractured Republic: Renewing America\u2019s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism, by Yuval Levin (Basic Books, 272 pp.\n$27.50)Yuval Levin has issued a challenge to both the Left and the Right: define and communicate a positive vision for twenty-first-century America.\nthat cultural and economic factors are inseparable,\u201d Levin views \u201cfamily breakdown, cultural dysfunction, and the polarization of norms\u201d to be the primary culprits impairing opportunity."}
