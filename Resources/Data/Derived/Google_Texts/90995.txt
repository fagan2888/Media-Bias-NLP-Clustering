Re “China Fences In Its Nomads, and an Ancient Life Withers” (front page, July 12):

I recently traveled to Erthi, a village of farmers and herders in Qinghai Province. At first glance, the village was monochrome: unpaved roads, skeletal trees and earthen houses washed out by snow and dust.

But before long, the vibrancy of Tibet’s culture set my senses ablaze. The grittiness of yak cheese in tsampa, a barley flour porridge; the splendor of the village temple, every surface a filigree of Buddhist deities and scripture; and the whipping prayer flags atop snowy pinnacles all impressed upon me Tibet’s distinct beauty.

No one can blame nomads for choosing the comforts of modern life over an exacting traditional lifestyle. But the government resettlement campaign is forcibly imposing its own vision of modernity, often resulting in poverty and destroyed communities.

By isolating nomads from their traditions, the government depletes minority cultures like Tibet’s of their power.

China needs a uniting idea other than the Communist Party. Its rise is a story of sovereignty: escaping past colonial subjugation to reach the heights of global power. Thus, the government should return sovereignty to the Chinese people by respecting their diverse histories and cultures, in all of their harsh truths and raw beauty.
