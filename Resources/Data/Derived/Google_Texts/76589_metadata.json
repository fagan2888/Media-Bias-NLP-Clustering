But on this day, Ms. Munoz was selling health care, not hotcakes.\n\n\u201cDo you want to learn more about affordable health care?\u201d she asked, in English and Spanish, near a promotional sign for New York\u2019s health insurance marketplace that read \u201cToday\u2019s the Day.\u201d\n\nMs. Munoz, a community relations manager, was helping to staff an informational booth outside the hospital on Tuesday as part of Montefiore\u2019s extensive efforts at helping patients and other community members enroll in insurance under the new health care law.\n\nHospital administrators had initially wondered how many people would show up, but by noon on Tuesday, they had their answer: the booth was bustling. The questions were as diverse as the crowd that approached the tables \u2014 some were nurses and other hospital workers, asking for information for friends and neighbors. Others were regulars at Montefiore\u2019s health clinics who were hoping to get more comprehensive coverage. Still others had been researching their options online and wanted to put their questions to a real person.\n\nBeatriz Nunez was bringing her mother, who receives Medicaid and Medicare, to the hospital for X-rays but stopped at the booth to pick up information for herself. Ms. Nunez, who is 25, works as a secretary but said her boss did not pay for health insurance. She said she had applied for Medicaid in the past but was told she made too much. Buying private insurance was too expensive, she said.\n\n\u201cI spoke with my doctor a while back and he said, \u2018wait for Obamacare to kick in,'\u201d she said. \u201cThe sooner I can apply, the better.\u201d\n\nMichael Echevarria, 33, works in the hospital gift shop \u2014 which is run by an outside entity \u2014 and said he could not afford the health insurance that his employer offered. He was curious about his options and confused by the onslaught of news coverage in recent days. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of different things \u2014 we have to have it, we don\u2019t have to have it, the government is shutting down,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Ms. Nunez, Mr. Echevarria said he was interested in buying health insurance and had been told previously he did not qualify for Medicaid. He said doctors had warned him he was prone to diabetes and had kidney troubles, but those conditions have largely gone untreated. He sometimes visits a free health clinic intended for homeless people to get care, he said. Having health coverage would be a relief, he said, but he\u2019s still not sure he can afford it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do the math,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131001142524, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/health-care-coverage-business-is-bustling-at-new-york-city-hospital/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "New York\u2019s Montefiore Medical Center has extensive outreach program to help consumers choose healthcare coverage.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Care Coverage Business Is Bustling at New York City Hospital"}, "DISPLAYDATE": "October 1, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1380651924, "modified_time": "2013-10-01T19:20:23-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Hospitals,Medicaid,Medicare,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Montefiore Medical Center,New York City,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Katie Thomas", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Katie Thomas", "byl": "Katie Thomas", "BN": "affordable-care-act", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "New York\u2019s Montefiore Medical Center has extensive outreach program to help consumers choose healthcare coverage.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 1, 2013", "org": "Montefiore Medical Center", "geo": "New York City", "utime": 20131001192023, "PUD": 20131001, "pdate": 20131001, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Hospitals;Medicaid;Medicare;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "New York\u2019s Montefiore Medical Center has extensive outreach program to help consumers choose healthcare coverage.", "title": "Health Care Coverage Business Is Bustling at New York City Hospital", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/health-care-coverage-business-is-bustling-at-new-york-city-hospital/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Health Care Coverage Business Is Bustling at New York City Hospital", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7a0\"", "article_summary": "Having health coverage would be a relief, he said, but he\u2019s still not sure he can afford it.\nBut on this day, Ms. Munoz was selling health care, not hotcakes.\nMs. Nunez, who is 25, works as a secretary but said her boss did not pay for health insurance.\nLike Ms. Nunez, Mr. Echevarria said he was interested in buying health insurance and had been told previously he did not qualify for Medicaid.\nHospital administrators had initially wondered how many people would show up, but by noon on Tuesday, they had their answer: the booth was bustling."}
