People often forget or take for granted that their lives could be much worse.

You donâ€™t have to look very far to see misery. People have been burned out of their homes. Others have lost loved ones and some live in constant fear, hiding behind yellow police tape.

And unseen, for the most part, are children who wake up and go to sleep hungry every day. So, on this Thanksgiving, it is important to realize that we all have so many reasons to count our blessings.

At a time when so many parts of the world seem to be in chaos, and so many people are depending on the generosity of others, the number one thing that people seem to be most grateful for is family.

For others, it means enduring the hassles of a plane ride to see loved ones, dearly missed for too long.
