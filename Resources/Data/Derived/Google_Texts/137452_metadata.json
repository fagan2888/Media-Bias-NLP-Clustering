O\u2019Keefe\u2019s group, the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth, was among the parties being investigated.\n\nIt was the beginning of an extraordinary scorched-earth campaign by O\u2019Keefe to harass and undermine the John Doe investigators, who had targeted alleged illegal coordination between Walker and conservative groups including Club for Growth and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. But O\u2019Keefe had a bigger goal in mind: overturning decades of established law in America saying that independent advocacy groups could not coordinate with political campaigns.\n\nO\u2019Keefe launched a series of suits against the prosecutors leading the investigation, continued to leak information about the probe, and publicly denounced it as a \u201cpartisan\u201d attack on free speech. He went on conservative talk radio to accuse prosecutors of imposing \u201ca traumatic, unconstitutional abuse on people\u201d and compared those being investigated to \u201ca rape victim\u201d\u2014adding, \u201cI am saying this deliberately.\u201d\n\nTogether with his lawyer, David Rivkin, O\u2019Keefe pushed the idea that the John Doe investigators conducted early morning \u201cparamilitary raids\u201d violating the constitutional rights of those being investigated, and which resulted in stories in conservative publications like National Review. Stories of these abuses were discredited by an audiotape in which investigators treated their alleged victim politely. Yet a majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July released an extraordinary ruling that shut down the John Doe probe, with three of the four-member majority citing unproven violations of constitutional rights.\n\nThe Club for Growth and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce had together provided more than $8 million supporting these four justices in their last elections, accounting for anywhere from 48 percent to 76 percent of the total spent on each justice\u2019s behalf. The justices returned the favor, writing a decision that seemed to ignore Wisconsin law and decades of U.S. Supreme Court decisions holding that independent advocacy groups cannot coordinate with political campaigns, since that would make them no longer independent.\n\nIt was a huge victory for O\u2019Keefe and for Walker, one that has legalized the unlimited use of dark money in campaigns in Wisconsin and could influence how such cases are handled in other jurisdictions. Long after the end of Walker\u2019s 2016 Republican presidential campaign, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s national aspirations still have legs.\n\n\u201cWisconsin has sort of become ground zero for the testing of how far outside groups could coordinate with candidates,\u201d says Tara Malloy, senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has closely followed the Wisconsin fight. But she notes that what is happening here is part of a much larger conservative agenda. Across the country, Malloy says, \u201cThe envelope is being pushed on coordination in all areas.\u201d\n\nAll of which has made O\u2019Keefe a public figure, despite a long history of quietly effective conservative advocacy. He has been dubbed the \u201cthird Koch brother\u201d for his efforts to lead and recruit donors to numerous advocacy groups connected to billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch.\n\nO\u2019Keefe founded the Sam Adams Alliance, which has trained Tea Party activists. He helped establish a network of rightwing journalistic publications, hired lawyers who are gradually chipping away at legal restrictions on independent advocacy groups, and created groups to challenge Obamacare. Though poorer than the Kochs, he is arguably just as indispensable to the rightwing agenda.\n\nO\u2019Keefe, sixty-one, was born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit known as a wealthy community for auto executives. His father was an investor and Eric did well in the stock market, telling friends he was independently wealthy by age twenty-five. When David Koch ran as a Libertarian for vice president in 1980, O\u2019Keefe served as the party\u2019s national field coordinator. As The Washington Post reported, he \u201cbecame friendly with the Koch brothers, with whom he has joined in many battles.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe has been at the center of a series of national rightwing policy efforts, including the fight for term limits and a so-called taxpayer bill of rights. Paul Jacob, executive director of U.S. Term Limits, has written that O\u2019Keefe \u201cshould be known, but isn\u2019t, as the man who came up with the plan to blitz the country with statewide ballot initiatives aimed at limiting the terms of politicians.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe was a founding board member of U.S. Term Limits, and also served as president of Americans for Limited Terms, which during the 1994, 1996, and 1998 congressional election cycles ran ads bashing candidates who opposed term limits. The movement also pushed twenty-three states to put congressional term limit initiatives in front of voters. The Koch brothers were \u201cthe main financial backers\u201d of the effort, The New York Times reported.\n\nSome $300,000 went into a series of attack ads targeting House Speaker Tom Foley, Democrat of Washington, for attempting to overturn the term limits law voters in his state had approved in 1992. The TV ads, relates O\u2019Keefe on his website, \u201cshowed a tear rolling down the cheek of the George Washington face\u201d on Mount Rushmore. Foley became the first Speaker to lose re-election since the Civil War.\n\nO\u2019Keefe also served on the board of Americans for Limited Government, founded in 1996 and funded by the Koch brothers. The group has backed \u201ctaxpayer bill of rights\u201d ballot initiatives in Colorado and other states, with a goal of slashing state government spending. The group systematically savaged President Obama, calling him \u201c\u2018the biggest liar of all\u201d and comparing his vision of a national volunteer service agency to the Hitler Youth.\n\nA fierce opponent of the McCain-Feingold law\u2019s campaign finance restrictions, O\u2019Keefe helped create the Center for Competitive Politics in 2005. The group filed briefs in Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court case that allows unlimited campaign donations by corporations and unions to the kind of independent advocacy groups O\u2019Keefe has used to target incumbents for defeat. This greatly expanded the political might of these groups, many of which do not disclose their donors. OpenSecrets.org found that 72 percent of all such spending in 2014 was by conservative groups.\n\nO\u2019Keefe also launched the Health Care Compact Alliance to combat Obamacare and undermine Medicare and Medicaid by letting states use the funding as they wished. The group\u2019s approach reinforced the anti-Obamacare ads by Americans for Prosperity.\n\nThe Sam Adams Alliance, which O\u2019Keefe created in 2006, helped train citizen activists and bloggers and provided key support to the Tea Party, as did the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity. In 2009, the group provided the seed money to create the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, which has bankrolled a huge new network of conservative news publications. By 2012, Media Matters reported, there were \u201cfifty-five news sites covering state government in thirty-nine states that have ties to the Franklin Center.\u201d\n\nThe total amount of spending by the vast network of rightwing advocacy groups O\u2019Keefe has helped create is unknown but formidable indeed. While much of the money came from the Kochs, O\u2019Keefe has also \u201ccreated a network of uber donors and of fundraisers,\u201d says an O\u2019Keefe sympathist who declined to speak on the record.\n\nBut when asked about concerns over wealthy donors spending fortunes to influence elections and government policy, O\u2019Keefe told The Washington Post that voters don\u2019t care. \u201cThat\u2019s inside baseball,\u201d he said.\n\nR. J. Johnson, a longtime Republican operative, was likely the person who connected O\u2019Keefe to Scott Walker, first elected governor in 2010. Walker\u2019s campaign paid Johnson\u2019s consulting firm more than $130,000 between July 2009 and January 2012. Johnson also worked as a top adviser to Wisconsin Club for Growth.\n\nJust three days after Walker introduced his bill gutting collective bargaining for public employees in February 2011, the Center for Media and Democracy reported, \u201cWisconsin Club for Growth began running slick ads accusing state workers of not having to sacrifice, and urging support for the legislation to make state workers \u2018pay their fair share.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen the bill passed, and opponents tried to recall a group of state senators and Walker himself, Club for Growth spent an estimated $9 million on the recalls, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Johnson served as a key consultant to both Club for Growth and Walker\u2019s campaign in his 2012 recall election.\n\nThat would seem to make it impossible for coordination not to have occurred between the two groups, and such coordination was then considered illegal in Wisconsin. Emails later showed that Walker secretly fundraised for the Club for Growth; his staff advised the governor to \u201cstress that donations to [Club for Growth] are not disclosed.\u201d Walker met with donors who soon contributed to Club for Growth.\n\nThere was every reason to believe the John Doe might succeed. It was actually the second probe involving Walker launched by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a reputed straight arrow who had previously angered Democrats by prosecuting several Democratic politicians. The first probe, which concerned Walker\u2019s tenure as the Milwaukee County executive, led to the convictions of six people, including three members of his staff, for campaigning on government time.\n\nWhile Chisholm was a Democrat, the special prosecutor he chose was Francis Schmitz, a longtime Republican who revealed that he voted for Walker in the recall election. Two Republican district attorneys and three chief judges of circuit courts with Republican credentials also took part in the multicounty, bipartisan investigation.\n\nYet Walker supporters condemned the probe as a \u201cpartisan witch hunt,\u201d and this became a conservative mantra on talk radio and at WisconsinWatchdog.org, one of the rightwing news sites funded by the Franklin Center. To date, it has published more than 300 stories condemning the probe and repeating O\u2019Keefe\u2019s criticisms of it. Those criticisms have been echoed by The Wall Street Journal and National Review.\n\nO\u2019Keefe went on the offensive right away. He hired Rivkin, a top attorney in Washington, D.C., to sue Chisholm and all the prosecutors involved in the John Doe probe, accusing them of violating the civil rights of those under investigation and demanding personal damages from the prosecutors. A WisconsinWatchdog story cheered this, warning that Chisholm and company are \u201cin for a very unpleasant time. He\u2019s got a tiger by the tail, and he\u2019s not up to it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe and Rivkin launched a barrage of suits, tied the investigation in legal knots, and eventually brought it to a halt. Frank Gimbel, a top Milwaukee defense attorney for more than five decades who represented one of the Walker aides convicted in the first John Doe probe, marvels at what O\u2019Keefe has done.\n\n\u201cI have not ever seen an individual being investigated who has gone on the offensive like this,\u201d Gimbel says in an interview. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s an uneven battle with the police and prosecutors. But he has gone on the offensive with very high quality lawyering.\u201d\n\nMalloy of the Campaign Legal Center agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely become a bit of an ugly personal fight,\u201d she says of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s effort \u201cto hold the prosecutors personally liable.\u201d A federal appeals court rejected this line of contention, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for review.\n\nTo further frighten Chisholm, O\u2019Keefe and other conservatives threatened to bankroll a recall effort against him. It never materialized, but the threat hung over his head for a year or so.\n\nO\u2019Keefe also put a scare into Walker. In June 2014, as news surfaced that the governor was seeking an out-of-court settlement to the Doe probe, The Wall Street Journal editorial page excoriated Walker, charging that while O\u2019Keefe\u2019s group \u201cfights for its First Amendment rights to speak out on the issue, the Walker campaign apparently seeks to negotiate a settlement with the prosecutors that will keep the issue out of the spotlight.\u201d It concluded: \u201cMr. Walker has to decide whose side he\u2019s on\u2014his own, or the larger principles he claims to represent.\u201d\n\nFor O\u2019Keefe and other conservative activists, Walker\u2019s re-election was small potatoes compared to pushing the courts to kill restrictions on independent advocacy groups. Walker got the message, quickly backing off from talk of a settlement.\n\nWalker\u2019s collapse as a presidential candidate does not mean much to O\u2019Keefe and company either. They have a loftier goal: doing away with campaign finance limits and other regulations that keep the wealthy from swaying elections.\n\nRivkin is probably the foremost proponent of the view that the First Amendment prohibits coordination between political campaigns and independent advocacy groups only when the groups expressly advocate for someone\u2019s election, rather than simply running ads condemning or praising a candidate.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, since the Buckley v. Valeo case of 1976, has repeatedly ruled that once groups have coordinated with campaigns the money they spend becomes subject to campaign finance disclosure laws. Yet the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision bought Rivkin\u2019s argument and ignored both Buckley v. Valeo and a recent Seventh Circuit Federal Court of Appeals ruling on the John Doe which found that \u201cno opinion issued by the [U.S.] Supreme Court, or by any court of appeals, establishes. . . that the First Amendment forbids regulation of coordination between campaign committees and issue-advocacy groups\u2014let alone that the First Amendment forbids even an inquiry into that topic.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patrick Crooks, who died suddenly in September, dissented in part from the court\u2019s decision, calling it \u201cerroneous\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d As for O\u2019Keefe\u2019s complaint that the John Doe infringed on his First Amendment rights, Crooks wrote, \u201cThere is a simple solution to that problem: stop coordinating. In the absence of coordination, the contributor is free to discuss candidates and issues.\u201d Crooks said the John Doe probe \u201cshould not be terminated.\u201d\n\nThe ruling was a tremendous victory for O\u2019Keefe, but there were more to come. In the fall of 2015, the Wisconsin legislature passed a law ending the use of John Doe probes into political corruption, a measure The New York Times dubbed \u201cThe Revenge of Scott Walker.\u201d Another law dismantled the Government Accountability Board, a nationally praised nonpartisan watchdog of ethics and elections,which had been involved in the John Doe probe, replacing it with two toothless boards whose funding to pursue cases must be approved by the Republican-controlled legislature. A third law lets independent advocacy groups coordinate with candidates they favor, clearly violating past U.S. Supreme Court decisions, and even opens the door to express advocacy groups (which openly tell people how to vote) to coordinate with candidates, so long as the candidate doesn\u2019t specifically ask that the groups spend campaign money in a certain way.\n\n\u201cThis is a loophole large enough to drive a Koch Industries truck through,\u201d declared Matt Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Another longtime observer of state politics, Jay Heck of the group Common Cause in Wisconsin, said the new laws, all of which Walker signed, were products of \u201cthe Eric O\u2019Keefe session of the Wisconsin legislature.\u201d\n\nMalloy thinks the U.S. Supreme Court might consider a review of the case, seeing it as an opportunity to rethink its past positions and open the floodgates to new kinds of campaign activity. And, she says, \u201cWalker\u2019s departure from the presidential race can only improve slightly the case\u2019s chance of being heard, because the issues are at least somewhat less politically \u2018hot.\u2019 \u201d\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s many legal and legislative victories will allow the nation\u2019s wealthiest people and corporations to secretly bankroll the candidates and political outcomes they favor in Wisconsin. But his long-term goal is to achieve a similar victory in other jurisdictions and, ultimately, turn the entire country into a land where dark money rules all politics. \u03c9", "article_metadata": {"apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"pages": 200548226627766}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "He has been dubbed the \u201cthird Koch brother\u201d for his efforts to lead and recruit donors to numerous advocacy groups connected to billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch.\nHe helped establish a network of rightwing journalistic publications, hired lawyers who are gradually chipping away at legal restrictions on independent advocacy groups, and created groups to challenge Obamacare.\nThere was every reason to believe the John Doe might succeed.\nBut O\u2019Keefe had a bigger goal in mind: overturning decades of established law in America saying that independent advocacy groups could not coordinate with political campaigns.\n\u201cThis is a loophole large enough to drive a Koch Industries truck through,\u201d declared Matt Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign."}
