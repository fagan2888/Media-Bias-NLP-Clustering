The insurer also raised the plans' premiums, which had been among the lowest in the nation.\n\nThe medical society called the payment reduction unfair, saying that doctors should not be held responsible for Highmark's premium pricing.\n\nDr. Scott Shapiro, the society's president, said in the letter that he had met with Highmark officials Friday.\n\n\u201cIn order to begin the process of building mutual trust, we proposed the need to either immediately reverse the cuts or pursue a new clear and specific initiative that will help physicians recoup the cuts and potentially increase practice revenue within the time that physicians are already spending when seeing patients enrolled in Highmark's individual ACA exchange products,\u201d Shapiro wrote in the letter. He was unavailable for comment.\n\nThe society is working with the insurer to expand value-based payments, in which doctors receive higher-than-normal reimbursement when they meet quality standards, he said in the letter. Shapiro said the new payments will be tested in 2016 and launched as early as January 2017.\n\nHighmark has value-based payment programs in place and plans to add more in the near future, Highmark spokesman Aaron Billger said.\n\n\u201cWe welcome continued conversations on collaboration with the Pennsylvania Medical Society,\u201d Billger said. \u201cAnd our focus when it comes to health care is a system that is really, truly physician-led.\u201d\n\nWes Venteicher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
