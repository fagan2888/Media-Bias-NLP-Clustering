Paul\u2019s office announced on Monday that the lawmaker introduced a Constitutional amendment in Washington last week \u201cthat would hold government officials to the same standard as the American people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politico, the proposal is a direct response to a provision within President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act that allows lawmakers and their aides to receive federal employer contributions to go towards covering the cost of buying in to the controversial health insurance mandate.\n\nResponding to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the legality of so-called Obamacare, Sen. Paul told the Daily Caller last month, \u201c[Chief] Justice [John] Roberts is still continuing to have federal employee health insurance subsidized by the taxpayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he likes Obamacare so much, I\u2019m going to give him an amendment that gives Obamacare to Justice Roberts,\u201d Paul told the publication. Chief Justice Roberts voted in July 2012 to uphold the constitutionality of the health care mandate, much to the chagrin of the law\u2019s conservative opponents.\n\n\n\nNow just weeks after warning of a potential proposal, the senator has followed through with that promise and has officially introduced a measure that would amend the Constitution to ensure all Americans must abide by the same laws, regardless of any role, elected or otherwise, in the US government.\n\nThe proposal reads that \u201cCongress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress,\u201d while also preventing legislation from being passed that would favor members of the executive branch of government \u2014 including the president, vice president, ambassadors and others \u2014 or the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nCongress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress: http://t.co/fqvMpd53mj \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) October 21, 2013\n\nIn order for the proposal to have any footing, however, Paul has an uphill battle ahead, to say the least. First he will need two-thirds of each the Senate and House of Representatives to approve his amendment, which would then require state legislatures across the US to accept it as well. Even then, though, critics \u2014 including some conservatives \u2014 have found flaws with his proposal.\n\nJennifer Rubin wrote in the Washington Post on Tuesday that the senator\u2019s effort is, in her opinion, \u201cnonsensical in its intention and incoherent in its expression.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]f Paul wants to level the playing field, he should simply propose a statutory fix to Obamacare itself,\u201d Rubin wrote. \u201cWhy not propose and vote on it?\u201d\n\nIan Millhiser at Think Progress went as far as to say that, in its current language, Sen. Paul\u2019s amendment would render the lawmaking process itself all too impractical. \u201cIndeed, Paul\u2019s amendment is so broadly drafted that it could immediately grant to every member of Congress every single benefit offered to anyone at all under federal law,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAdmittedly, the intent of Paul\u2019s amendment is to limit the privileges afforded to members of Congress, not to transform them into recipients of the most generous and unnecessary welfare program in American history. So it is possible that the courts would ignore the literal meaning of the amendment and interpret it narrowly to merely forbid laws that give special privileges to lawmakers. Even this interpretation is problematic, however,\u201d added Millhiser.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Rand Paul doesn\u2019t want government officials to receive any sort of special treatment, and a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution courtesy of the Kentucky Republican could accomplish just that.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Senator Rand Paul doesn\u2019t want government officials to receive any sort of special treatment, and a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution courtesy of the Kentucky Republican could accomplish just that.", "title": "Rand Paul proposes constitutional amendment barring government officials from being above the law", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/20/da/50/00/rand-paul.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/rand-paul-amendment-obamacare-565/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "Senator Rand Paul doesn\u2019t want government officials to receive any sort of special treatment, and a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution courtesy of the Kentucky Republican could accomplish just that.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/20/da/50/00/rand-paul.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c14\"", "article_summary": "Senator Rand Paul doesn\u2019t want government officials to receive any sort of special treatment, and a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution courtesy of the Kentucky Republican could accomplish just that.\n\u201cIndeed, Paul\u2019s amendment is so broadly drafted that it could immediately grant to every member of Congress every single benefit offered to anyone at all under federal law,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cWhy not propose and vote on it?\u201dIan Millhiser at Think Progress went as far as to say that, in its current language, Sen.
