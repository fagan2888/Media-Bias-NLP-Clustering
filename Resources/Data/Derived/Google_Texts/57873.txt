An ad placed on a billboard along I-135 in northern Sedgwick County hit its' targeted market. Justin Phillips put up the ad asking his girlfriend of nine years to marry him and it worked.

"We had kind of tossed around the idea of a billboard, I have a friend that owns some billboards here and decided to go big," Phillips said.

Phillips and his girlfriend, Dawn Freeborn, were out driving Friday evening. Freeborn thought that the pair were out to pick up some surveillance video from a deer stand Phillips had. When Phillips turned his truck around and faced it towards the billboard, Freeborn had a near immediate reaction. "It was a very quick yes," she said.

The billboard is located just south of 101st St. along Interstate 135 and can be seen from the southbound lanes of traffic.

There is no date set for the wedding. The pair say that once married, they want to have children.

The billboard's total cost for Phillips was less than $500.
