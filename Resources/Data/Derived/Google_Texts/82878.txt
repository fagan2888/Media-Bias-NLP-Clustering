Senator Bernie Sanders filed a bill to end federal criminalization of marijuana, aiming to allow states make their own decisions without the federal government.

Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has filed a bill in the Senate seeking to end the federal criminalization of marijuana.

The bill filed Wednesday, called "Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2015," would amend the Controlled Substances Act to remove mentions of the drug from the law.

The laws on cannabis differ between the states. So far, Colorado, Washington state, Alaska and Oregon have legalized the sale and possession of marijuana for medical and recreational use, while Washington, D.C., has legalized the personal use but not the sale of the drug.



On Tuesday, Ohio voters strongly rejected the legalization of marijuana.
