But so far, he hasn\u2019t sealed the deal with folks like Thomas and Susan Fitzpatrick.\n\nHe\u2019s 63, just sold a car dealership and backs Donald Trump because \u201cwe need an outsider in there.\u201d She\u2019s 59, sells insurance and prefers Marco Rubio, deeming him smoother than Cruz and far less crass than the billionaire developer who has dominated the race for months.\n\nBut both see Cruz as a fallback. So there they were at a lakeside hotel one night last week with a hundred or so other Iowa Republicans, to kick the tires.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Cruz knocks either of them out.\u201d\n\nThe six-day bus tour Cruz wrapped up late Saturday showed a candidate hitting stride yet with little margin to slack off before the Feb. 1 caucuses. At Storm Lake and 27 other stops, he brought Iowan Republicans to their feet by the scores and by the hundreds, pitching himself as the antidote to Barack Obama. Religious conservatives flocked to small-town coffee houses, pubs and churches for a glimpse, most already with their minds made up, demonstrating that Cruz has a clear edge in the state.\n\nBut the tour also exposed vulnerabilities that could hurt Cruz beyond Iowa. Doubts that Trump planted about the Canada-born senator\u2019s eligibility seeped into Q&A sessions. Saturation-level attacks from the ethanol industry prompted pointed questions from Iowans alarmed that Cruz would scrap a federal mandate that props up the price of their corn.\n\nAnd Cruz\u2019s relentless appeal to evangelical Christians and hard-core conservatives could prove limiting in states to come. His own rhetorical excesses, like floating a \u201cspanking\u201d for Hillary Clinton, reinforced his edgy image.\n\nCruz edges Trump in the latest Iowa polls, with Rubio in solid third. The rest can\u2019t crack double digits. Cruz has a small army of volunteers from Texas and other states filling two college dorms he rented in Des Moines. He has pastors in every county prodding the faithful to caucus for him. Trump draws bigger crowds but can\u2019t touch that level of organization.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that I\u2019m never going to have a plane with my name painted on it,\u201d Cruz said in a gentle poke at his rival\u2019s swoop-in campaign style. \u201cIt is a wonderful thing that the election to be the president of the United States ... begins, and much of it is decided, in Pizza Ranches and junior high gymnasiums and church fellowship halls.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, more than half of the Republicans who take part in the Iowa caucuses identify as evangelical Christians. Cruz, son of a preacher, speaks their language fluently and without hesitation.\n\nHe quotes Scripture at length. He exhorts Iowans to pray when they awake and at bedtime, while they\u2019re shaving or heading to lunch. Pray, he suggested time and again last week, to \u201cawaken the body of Christ that we may stand and pull our country back from the cliff.\u201d\n\nIt resonates with many Cruz fans.\n\n\u201cI love his Christian values,\u201d said nursing assistant Lisa Goodwin, 37, as Cruz worked the crowd at Charlie\u2019s Steakhouse in Carroll. \u201cIf it\u2019s God\u2019s plan, he will use Cruz. America\u2019s in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe overt religiosity turns off Linda Carlsen, 66, a retired school principal. She supports Trump, but gave Cruz a look in Pocahontas at a stuffy Pizza Ranch, a popular chain that draws many GOP candidates.\n\n\u201cHe says what my neighbors say,\u201d she said. By contrast, \u201cCruz talks about abortion and gay rights, but when you get out of Iowa, those are not issues that win a general election.\u201d\n\nThe evangelical vote meant victory for Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012. And \u201cit\u2019s going to be exceptionally important in 2016,\u201d predicted Bob Vander Plaats, the state\u2019s most influential Christian activist, who spent the week at Cruz\u2019s side as he was named a national co-chairman of the Texan\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump exposed that people are upset with Washington. They want someone to change Washington,\u201d Vander Plaats said. \u201cAnd now you have to ask, \u2018Well, who\u2019s the best prepared to do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nA win in Iowa, even a strong second, would put a hot spotlight on Cruz when the battle shifts to New Hampshire eight days later. That state tends to favor centrists, and much of the GOP field is dug in there.\n\nCruz will be there this week for the first time in two months. Later, a five-day bus tour is meant to set the stage for Cruz to sop up the anti-Trump, anti-establishment vote \u2014 if Iowa goes as well as expected.\n\nCruz keeps the mood light. He has a storehouse of jokes he tells dozens of times a week, like the one about the West Texas farmer who contradicts Cruz when told that unlike with locusts, you can\u2019t use pesticide to ward off regulators.\n\n\u201cWanna bet?\u201d the farmer replied.\n\nAt a Christian bookstore in Boone, a cellphone interrupted with the theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Everyone laughed, and Cruz hardly missed a beat.\n\n\u201cI will say to everyone in Washington, \u2018When you hang a man, make sure to hang him high,\u2019\u201d he quipped \u2014 a reminder not only that he\u2019s a huge movie buff and amateur impressionist, but a pariah in the halls of Congress. That, he wears as a badge of honor.\n\nThe humor targeting the president and the Democratic front-runner, Clinton, is biting.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the 10th Amendment,\u201d Cruz likes to say, \u201cor as Barack Obama calls it, \u2018the what?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe likes to say that to make it easy on Clinton, Democrats set their next debate at Leavenworth \u2014 site of a famous military prison. At the Pocahontas stop, a woman fainted just as Cruz was wrapping up.\n\n\u201cGood news, she\u2019s doing OK,\u201d he said once she revived. \u201cYoung woman heard the name Hillary Clinton, she immediately fainted.\u201d\n\nFriday night in Charles City, he raised eyebrows asserting that like his own 5-year-old when she lies, Clinton deserves a \u201cspanking\u201d over statements on the Benghazi attacks.\n\nSuch comments aren\u2019t a usual part of the half-hour stump speech Cruz delivers four to six times a day, not counting time for questions. And he always sticks around to pose for photos and chats.\n\nThe college debate champ so rarely stumbles that when he does it goes nearly unnoticed, as when he vowed one evening in Winterset that \u201cwe will end national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing 18 hours a day, six days a week \u2026 can be tiring,\u201d he acknowledged moments later.\n\nMost days weren\u2019t quite that long. But it was past 10 p.m. when the senator\u2019s luxury bus, decked out as the \u201cCourageous Cruzer,\u201d pulled into Missouri Valley, population 3,000.\n\nCruz stood behind the counter at Penny\u2019s Diner and puckishly refilled coffee mugs as U.S. Rep. Steve King introduced him. A hundred or so people filled every stool, booth and floor tile. A few had driven three hours from South Dakota.\n\nDespite the hour, Cruz didn\u2019t skimp. They got the full speech, from jabs at the IRS to tough talk on the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI liked when he was out on the Senate floor [railing overnight against Obamacare] and Senator [John] McCain called him a whacko bird,\u201d said Rex Haner, 76, a retired farmer from Woodbine, Iowa, who showed off his NRA Golden Eagles hat and belt buckle. \u201cHe might win it. They\u2019re scared of him.\u201d\n\nLots of candidates stop at Penny\u2019s. The mayor, Clint Sargent, couldn\u2019t remember the last time it was packed so tight.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty hefty turnout this late at night in the middle of the week,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in what Senator Cruz brings to the table. It\u2019s really lighting up people in Iowa.\u201d\n\nAs the week wore on, the \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d issue took root. Cruz was forced to spend time reassuring Iowans that while he was born in Canada, he\u2019s eligible for the presidency, thanks to the fact that his mom is American. He even released her Delaware birth certificate Friday to tamp down online rumors.\n\nIn Mason City, Rich Hugeback, 68, was one of several hundred people who filled a church to see Cruz. The retired power company executive called it a nonissue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Trump\u2019s good at \u2014 stirring stuff up,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hates losing. That\u2019s the only reason he\u2019s attacking Cruz.\u201d\n\nBut doubts gnawed at Kay Clark, 64, the retired Cerro Gordo County auditor and elections commissioner.\n\n\u201cWe need to have someone who\u2019s electable,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we need to have a Republican in the White House.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@toddgillman", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz\u2019s religious rhetoric and tough talk are drawing big crowds but could be a turnoff for voters in other states.", "og": {"description": "Ted Cruz\u2019s religious rhetoric and tough talk are drawing big crowds but could be a turnoff for voters in other states.", "title": "In Iowa, Cruz scores with evangelical flair on script and off", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160109-in-iowa-cruz-scores-with-evangelical-flair-on-script-and-off.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160109-gop_2016_cruz.ece/BINARY/original/GOP_2016_Cruz", "height": 850}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-10T05:39:50Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-10T05:11:25Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"In Iowa, Cruz scores with evangelical flair on script and off\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160109-in-iowa-cruz-scores-with-evangelical-flair-on-script-and-off.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160109-gop_2016_cruz.ece/BINARY/original/GOP_2016_Cruz\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2608086\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-10T05:11:25Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"TODD J.
