DOVER, Del. (AP) - A coalition of pastors and the NAACP that is investigating accusations of discrimination in state government is beginning to seek testimony at hearings in Kent and Sussex counties.

The News Journal of Wilmington (http://delonline.us/1KJSFsB ) reports that the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, a coalition of churches in the Dover area, and the Central Delaware NAACP have joined black pastors in New Castle County to conduct the hearings starting Tuesday.

The coalition of ministers and the NAACP say theyâ€™ve heard stories about black employees routinely being passed over for promotions, enduring outright racist acts and being punished more severely for workplace infractions than white employees.

A court reporter will be transcribing all interviews at the hearings. The groups will deliver a report based on the testimonies to Gov. Jack Markell this fall.
