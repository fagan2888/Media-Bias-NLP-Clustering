Parts of Southwest Florida are seeing a lot of rain. The rain has been steady in Bonita Springs, Estero, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and Naples.

For the second straight day, rain is pounding Southwest Florida. Many streets are underwater.

As rain continues to fall in Southwest Florida, many are dealing with the soggy conditions.

Southwest Florida soaked by this weekend’s storms, but it’s not stopping the one family in San Carlos Park from having some backyard fun. Their backyard is more like a small pond, perfect for some canoeing.

In Estero, the Fountain Lakes community has turned into a lake.

“Well, we’ve had almost 18 inches of water in here,” said Ed Schreiner with Fountain Lakes.

Two people out for a casual bike ride found themselves sinking, and then got stuck. Cars fared the same fate. Some drivers found themselves in too deep.

“We’ve had cars stall in the water and having to be dug out. If it gets much higher, it will be in the apartments,” said Schreiner.

In Fort Myers, a viewer sent in video of a very wet drive down College Parkway near US-41.

“We’re in the middle of a rainy season at this time, and people’s homes are in danger of being flooded,” said Matthew Burton of Fort Myers Beach.

Besides those out for a casual canoe or bike ride, many from Fort Myers to Naples are becoming concerned with the amount of rain.

“We’re in a little bit of trouble,” said Schreiner. “We’re worried that we can’t get rid of this water because people live here and have to drive through it.”
