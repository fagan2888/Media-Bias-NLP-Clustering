He\u2019s the first rookie winner since Jordan Spieth in July in the John Deere Classic.\n\n\u201cI was so nervous,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cI did not eat well last night. I did not eat well this morning.\u201d\n\nHadley finished at 21-under 267 and earned $630,000, a two-year tour exemption and spots in The Players Championship, PGA Championship and Tournament of Champions. He will move into the mid-60s in the world ranking, giving him a chance to get into the Masters if he can crack the top 50 at the end of the Texas Open.\n\n\u201cIt opens up a lot of doors,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cIt guarantees me a major. I\u2019ve never played in a major before.\u201d\n\nHe birdied three of the first five holes, chipping in on the par-5 fifth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the start and I got off to a great start,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cProbably the shot that won me the tournament was the chip in on 5. I mean I was dead over there and I hit the nastiest little nipper over there, and it snuck in the left door.\u201d\n\nLee birdied three of the last four holes for a 68. The South Korean-born New Zealander won the 2008 U.S. Amateur and also has European and Web.com victories.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chesson Hadley wins Puerto Rico Open", "title": "Chesson Hadley wins Puerto Rico Open", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Chesson Hadley wins Puerto Rico Open", "title": "Chesson Hadley wins Puerto Rico Open", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/09/chesson_hadley_wins_puerto_rico_open/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/puerto-rico-golf-open.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chesson Hadley wins Puerto Rico Open", "title": "Chesson Hadley wins Puerto Rico Open", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/puerto-rico-golf-open.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Associated Press", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe8c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsRIO GRANDE, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Chesson Hadley won the Puerto Rico Open on Sunday for his first PGA Tour victory, holding off Danny Lee by two strokes in wind gusting to 25 mph.\nMaking his 13th PGA Tour start, the 26-year-old Hadley birdied the final two holes at Trump International for a 5-under 67.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the start and I got off to a great start,\u201d Hadley said.\nI\u2019ve never played in a major before.\u201dHe birdied three of the first five holes, chipping in on the par-5 fifth.\n\u201cProbably the shot that won me the tournament was the chip in on 5."}
