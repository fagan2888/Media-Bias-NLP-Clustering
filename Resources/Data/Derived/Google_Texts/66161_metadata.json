Trey Radel (R-Fla.) to resign after he pleaded guilty this week to cocaine possession.\n\nBut she sought to link Radel\u2019s behavior to Republicans move to cut food stamps and require recipients to get drug tested before receiving them.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe inconsistency on the Republican side to say, we\u2019re going to cut $40 billion out of food stamps and by the way you should be drug tested before you can get food stamps, when people are voting to do that are engaged in that activity,\u201d Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters on Thursday.\n\nDuring the farm bill debate earlier this year Republicans, including Radel, overwhelmingly supported a provision that would allow states to drug test food stamp recipients.\n\nRadel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession on Wednesday and announced later in the day he would take a leave of absence to receive in-patient treatment for addiction. He has given no indication that he will resign.\n\nRepublicans have compared Radel\u2019s arrest and guilty plea to the 2006 incident that ultimately led to former Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.) pleading guilty to driving under the influence of prescription medication after crashing his car into a U.S. Capitol barricade. He left Congress temporarily to seek addiction treatment. Kennedy remained in Congress with the support of Democrats until 2011, when he opted not to seek reelection.\n\nPelosi pushed back at the comparison to Kennedy, saying he used his problems to try to improve drug addiction policy.\n\n\u201cPatrick Kennedy took the lead in passing the mental health parity legislation, which had important provisions regarding addiction in it. And that\u2019s really important and that is well served by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nShe said Kennedy ultimately did decide to step down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that Congressman Radel do that \u2014 that\u2019s a decision that he and his family have to make,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut I think if they want to compare themselves to Patrick Kennedy, they are setting a very high standard for themselves because he used his personal challenges to make a difference in public policy for our country that makes a big difference in improving the lives of the American people. That\u2019s a tough act to compare yourself to.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) echoed the criticism of Republicans, saying the incident should remind members that addiction is an illness that needs to be treated not punished.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that illnesses are illnesses and they are to be treated that way,\u201d Clyburn, the No. 3 in the House Democratic caucus, said. \u201cI believe that it is disingenuous for our Republican colleagues to start looking for scapegoats or doing these sorts of comparisons.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed to an incident on Tuesday when Virginia state Sen. Creigh Deeds (D), a former gubernatorial nominee, was stabbed by his son one day after he was released from a Virginia psychiatric hospital because a bed couldn\u2019t be found for him.\n\n\u201cWe just saw a public official in Virginia who came close to losing his life because our mental health system failed his family,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cI think this ought to highlight for all of us the necessity to treat illnesses as illnesses and stop looking for scapegoats.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She sought to link Radel\u2019s behavior to Republicans move to cut food stamps.", "title": "Pelosi avoids calling for Radel resignation", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/nancy-pelosi-trey-radel-resignation-100203.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/11/21/131121_pelosi_radel_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nancy Pelosi (1305),Trey Radel,Congress (2986)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She sought to link Radel\u2019s behavior to Republicans move to cut food stamps.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec53\"", "article_summary": "| AP Photos Pelosi avoids calling for Radel resignationHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t calling for Rep.
