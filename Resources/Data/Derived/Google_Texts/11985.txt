A Denver woman accused of beating to death her 2-month-old baby has been charged with first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death.

Kelsy Newell-Skinner, 21, allegedly beat her child so severely on the night of July 27 that the baby girl died four days later, according to the Denver district attorney’s office.

“Once at the hospital, the baby was determined to have multiple skull fractures, broken ribs, severe bruising, bite marks on her thigh and brain damage,” the office said in a news release Tuesday.

Newell-Skinner allegedly sent texts to her boyfriend after the beating, including one saying that “she must have been very drunk last night because she woke up and the baby had been beaten,” according to court documents.

Newell-Skinner has four other children under 5 years old.

Skinner is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail, and her next court date has yet to be set.
