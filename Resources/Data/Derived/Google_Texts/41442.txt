A 13-year-old boy died Saturday from injuries suffered in a car accident Friday afternoon, Grand Prairie police said.

Carson Parr was ejected through the back window of a 1999 Honda Civic that was southbound on New York Avenue when it reportedly ran a red light at State Highway 360 and was hit by an armored car, police said.

Carson was flown to Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth, where he died about 1:20 p.m. Saturday.

Police said the Civic was being driven by Carson’s 17-year-old sister, Allie Parr. She was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth in serious condition.

Also in the car was their mother, 39-year-old Teddi Parr, who was taken to JPS with injuries that weren’t considered life-threatening.

Two people were in the armored car and were not injured. The crash remains under investigation.
