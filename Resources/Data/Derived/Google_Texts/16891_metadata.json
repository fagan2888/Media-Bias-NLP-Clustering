Congress thought that undermining the IRS would cause Obamacare to magically disappear. Instead, they have wreaked havoc on their constituents by making it nearly impossible to secure tax help from the IRS. Many people will be filing late or not at all, thus starving our government of needed tax revenue and tax refunds Americans are counting on.\n\n2016 cannot come soon enough.\n\nTracy A. Odell Jr.\n\nRossmoor\n\nAnother diplomatic coup\n\nRe: \u201cPutin lifts ban on missile sales to Iran\u201d [News, April 14]: While Ukraine begged the U.S. for defensive hand-fired weapons to stop Russian-backed aggression, the U.S. sends them packaged meals. Meanwhile, Russia plans on selling S-300 advanced anti-aircraft missiles to Iran. Another example of negotiations by the Obama administration.\n\nBill Ring\n\nMission Viejo\n\nLincoln\u2019s real legacy\n\nRe: \u201cLincoln\u2019s legacy provides lesson in prudence\u201d [Opinion, April 14]: Within President Lincoln\u2019s legacy should be an acknowledgment of the birth of the autonomous administrative state that, with acceleration provided by the progressive movement, has created slaves of the productive people to the whims and desires of the public service masters. Not that we use them much anymore, but a fair reading of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution provides no basis for the taking from one to redistribute to another.\n\nChris Taylor\n\nNewport Coast\n\nImmigration bills not sensible\n\nRe: \u201cState Senate committee votes to subsidize health care for immigrants here illegally\u201d [News, April 16]: A bill introduced by Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara would expand Medi-Cal eligibility to illegals, along with 10 other bills to protect the \u201crights\u201d of illegals in California. The cost of Lara\u2019s bill alone is $1 billion. Lara says we have to embrace this opportunity to be decisive and make a historic, sensible and humane change in health care and immigration policy.\n\nIt may be historic, but what is sensible or humane about laying a $1 billion plus burden on California\u2019s taxpayers? This article should have been on the front page. Taxpayers should see how the Democrats prefer to spend taxpayer money on illegals\u2019 \u201crights\u201d and a bullet train rather than dams and catch basins for water. More than 2 million illegals in California use a lot of water, but I suppose that is one of their \u201crights.\u201d When will California voters learn that the Sacramento Democrats are not interested in citizens\u2019 \u201crights\u201d?\n\nEd Bjork\n\nFountain Valley\n\nImmigrant Rights bills are moral\n\nWe note that \u201cLawmakers want to further protect immigrants\u201d [Front page, April 8] by, among other things, extending Medi-Cal health coverage to them, supporting their purchase of health insurance through Covered California and protecting them from discrimination.\n\nThat is why I and 19 members and friends of Irvine United Congregation Church support these efforts. According to the Bible, \u201cFor I was a stranger, and you invited me in.\u201d\n\nKeith O.
