He largely failed on the fiscal front, not because he didn\u2019t slash taxes and spending \u2013 he did \u2013 but because the result has been a fiscal disaster of plummeting tax receipts and emergency spending cuts.\n\nNow, you might argue, his legacy as a social conservative may be about to take a minor dent as well. On Tuesday of next week, the state will find out just how much money it has earned from an online auction of thousands of sex toys, adult DVDs and other erotic merchandise from a string of sex shops shut down by the state\u2019s Department of Revenue.\n\nRelated: Brownback Feeling Big Political Backlash to Tax Cuts in Kansas\n\nState officials claim that they are not auctioning off the items at all \u2013 that they returned them to the owner who contracted with an online auction house to sell them. But there\u2019s no doubt that when the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey You Are Mine Metal Handcuffs,\u201d the \u201cGuido Inflatable Love Doll,\u201d the \u201cFetish Fantasy Doggie Hood and Leash,\u201d and numerous other items not suitable for a family website go on sale, the proceeds are headed straight into the Kansas state treasury.\n\nIn a statement, Kansas State Senate Democratic Leader Anthony Hensley blasted the sale. \u201cBrownback is so desperate to fill the massive hole in the state budget caused by his reckless income tax cuts that the state of Kansas is now in the porn business,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Why State Tax Cuts Aren\u2019t Driving Job Growth\n\nThe business in question, United Outlets LLC, operated five sex toy shops in the state, and had racked up some $164,000 in unpaid tax bills. There was no estimate available indicating how much the government expects to recoup through the online auction.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Gov.
