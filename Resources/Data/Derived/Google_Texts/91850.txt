WINTER PARK — Since this year’s Ride The Rockies route was announced in February, the first day of the 29th annual cycling tour promised to be grueling between its 10,000 feet of climbing 89 miles of distance. In the week leading up to the tour, which started in Boulder, RTR tour director Chandler Smith went so far as the call Day 1 “one of the toughest days” in tour history.

Assuming fair weather, that is.

But on a Sunday that saw Mother Nature play all her cards, 2,000 cyclists dealt with morning sun at the 20th mile in Nederland; rain, hail and lightning in the late morning between Central City and Idaho Springs; freezing rain, headwinds and snow (snow!) midafternoon during the day’s final climb of Berthoud Pass. And then the ace in the hole: fog. FOG at the Berthoud Pass summit that led tour officials to end the route there at the 75th mile.

Cyclists and their bicycles, it was determined, would be shuttled en masse over the final 14 miles of the original course down Berthoud Pass to Winter Park. The line for the passenger bus was hundreds deep, pulsating with shivering limbs and chattering teeth.

Among the hands on deck scrambling to provide cyclists relief from the snow and cold as well as transportation was Susie Masterson, a 25-year resident of Winter Park and publisher of “GuestGuide,” a guidebook to the area’s attractions. All she did — on her own accord — was walk the line of cyclists, pluck five of the most desperate, load by herself on her own vehicle three bicycles, crank the heat to 85 degrees and drop them off where they were staying that night.

Elevation profile with distance and the full complement of Colorado weather transformed “one of the toughest days” in Ride The Rockies history into one of the most unforgettable.
