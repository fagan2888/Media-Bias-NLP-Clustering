This poses an enormous challenge to employers, employees, and policymakers all over the world.\"\n\nThe total value of unfunded or underfunded government pension liabilities for 20 countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \u2014 a group of largely wealthy countries \u2014 is $78 trillion, Citi said. (The countries studied include the U.K., France and Germany, plus several others in western and central Europe, the U.S., Japan, Canada, and Australia.)\n\nThe bank added that corporates also failed to consistently meet their pension obligations, with most U.S. and U.K. corporate pensions plans underfunded.\n\nRelated: Low interest rates, weak stock market hurting U.S. corporate pensions\n\nCountries with large public pension systems in Europe appear to have the greatest problem. Citi noted that Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Portugal and Spain had estimated public sector pension liabilities that topped 300 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nImprovements in health care mean retirees need to string out their income for longer. Meanwhile, the increase in the retirement-age population versus the working population is straining government pension schemes.\n\nSeveral countries, including the U.K., France and Italy are gradually hiking retirement ages. Citi recommended that governments explicitly link the retirement age to expected longevity.\n\nIt also advised that government-funded pensions should serve merely as a \"safety net,\" rather than the prime pension provider, and that corporate pensions should be \"opt out\" rather than \"opt in\" to encourage greater enrollment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.
