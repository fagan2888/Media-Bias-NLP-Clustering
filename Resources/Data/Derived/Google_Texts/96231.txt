There will be many Republicans seeking the presidential nomination in 2016, and one of the potential candidates, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, urged conservatives gathered at the Iowa Freedom Summit Saturday to demand their choice demonstrate a track record of accomplishment."Every candidate is going to come in front of you and say, 'I am the most conservative guy to ever live,' " said Cruz. "Well, you know what? Talk is cheap.'"He challenged those at the forum to "look each candidate in the eye and say 'do not talk, show me,' " especially when it comes to religious freedom or opposing Obamacare."If you say you oppose the president's unconstitutional executive amnesty, show me where you stood up and fought," said Cruz, to huge applause from the crowd of about 1,300. "If you say you will stand up to the Washington establishment, the career politicians of both parties that have gotten us in this mess, show me where you stood up and fought. If you say you oppose Common Core, show me where you stood up and fought. And if you say you stand with our friend and ally, the nation of Israel, show me where you stood up."Cruz called for a full repeal of Obamacare, demanded a lock down of the nation's southern border, called to stop environmental regulations, and demanded the shutdown of the IRS.Cruz said it is time to "reignite the miracle of America," which would come by championing jobs, reforming the tax structure and repealing Obamacare.Cruz also called for America's world leadership to be restored."Just a couple of weeks ago, we were horrified at the terrorist attacks on the streets of Paris," said Cruz. "And then horrified again when over 40 world leaders came in solidarity, and yet missing from that rally graphically was the United States of America. You cannot fight and win a war on radical Islamic terrorism if you are unwilling to utter the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' "
