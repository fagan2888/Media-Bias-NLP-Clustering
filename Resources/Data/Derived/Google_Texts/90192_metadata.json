Rand Paul (R-Ky.), his party and general worldview notwithstanding, because of his position on one important issue: the use of drone strikes as part of the U.S. national security policy.\n\nW ith this in mind, it was interesting to see Rand Paul talk approvingly yesterday about \u2026 launching drone strikes\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) late Tuesday said if the United States discovered any of the released Guantanamo Bay prisoners were planning a terrorist attack, \u201cthere would be a drone with their name on it.\u201d On Fox News\u2019s \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto,\u201d Paul was asked if he advocates tracking them down and killing them if they plot against the U.S. \u201cI would say that there would be a drone with their name on it,\u201d replied Paul, who has been somewhat critical of portions of President Obama\u2019s drone program.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not quite what Paul\u2019s supporters expected to hear.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the GOP senator has strayed from his own talking points. Last April, also during an interview with Fox\u2019s Cavuto, Paul said he\u2019s comfortable with the executive branch having the authority to use drones on Americans over U.S. soil if an administration perceives an \u201cimminent threat.\u201d Paul even went so far as to say, \u201cIf someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and 50 dollars in cash, I don\u2019t care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him.\u201d\n\nB ut yesterday\u2019s rhetoric seemed especially out of place given all of the senator\u2019s recent posturing on the issue of drone strikes, and raises some important questions about Paul\u2019s actual beliefs.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, for example, that the Kentucky Republican is starting to engage in some chest-thumping, there-would-be-a-drone-with-their-name-on-it \u201ctough\u201d talk in order to impress his party establishment. As Paul gears up for a national campaign, he\u2019s no doubt aware of the fact that many Republicans reject his foreign policy vision and fear his general preference for isolationism.\n\nIn other words, maybe the senator is starting to talk more like the typical Republican, talking up things like drone strikes during Fox News interviews, to make himself more appealing to his intra-party critics.\n\nBut let\u2019s also not discount the possibility that Rand Paul doesn\u2019t fully understand the issues he claims to care the most about. This applies to drones, but it\u2019s not the only issue that has recently tripped up the senator.\n\nPaul claims to have invested considerable time in the \u201cphilosophic debate\u201d over \u201crights,\u201d which he doesn\u2019t seem to understand at all.\n\nHe says he\u2019s deeply concerned with the Federal Reserve, which he also clearly does not understand\n\nPaul claims to be outraged by the Affordable Care Act, though he seems confused by the basics of the health care law.\n\nHe says he\u2019s concerned with voting rights, which also seems to push the confused senator into incoherence\n\nPaul insists he has serious questions about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, though the details have left him clueless\n\nAnd he claims to be deeply outraged by the federal budget deficit, though he has no idea what the federal budget deficit is.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, it\u2019s one thing for a politician to be ignorant; it\u2019s something else when he\u2019s ignorant about his signature issues. Paul isn\u2019t just confused; he\u2019s confused about the issues he claims to care about most.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The Kentucky Republican has been critical of the use of drones as a counter-terrorism tool.
