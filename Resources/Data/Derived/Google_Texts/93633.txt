NEW YORK (AP) â€” The Warriors' record-tying victory had plenty of fans taking advantage of a free preview of NBA TV.

Golden State's win Sunday in San Antonio to match the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' mark of 72 victories averaged almost 2.6 million viewers. That's 78 percent higher than the previous best for the network, regular season or playoffs. An earlier Spurs-Warriors matchup Jan. 25 averaged more than 1.4 million viewers.

NBA Digital announced Thursday that Sunday's game would be made available to fans who don't normally get the channel as part of a free preview to cable and satellite subscribers.

In February, the Warriors' come-from-behind overtime win over the Thunder averaged more than 5.3 million viewers on ABC, the most-watched non-Christmas NBA regular-season game since 2013.
