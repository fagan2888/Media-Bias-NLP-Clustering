To put that figure in perspective, the last time the jobless rate was 5% was in April 2008 \u2014 when Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama were battling for the Democratic nomination for president. At the end of Obama's first year in office, the unemployment rate peaked at 10% in October 2009.\n\nThe most striking bright spot in Friday's report was wage growth. After remaining stubbornly stagnant, average hourly earnings rose 2.5% \u2014 the best gain since 2009.\n\nEconomic analysts warn against making sweeping conclusions about the health of the economy based on one jobs report. But the surprisingly robust jobs growth and wage gains in October are undoubtedly welcome news for Democrats \u2014 particularly the party's eventual nominee for president. Clinton has a wide lead in polls of Democratic primary voters.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton received another piece of good news to head into the weekend with: a stellar jobs report.", "pubdate": "2015-11-06T17:58:23Z", "author": "MJ Lee, CNN Politics and Finance Reporter", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton received another piece of good news to head into the weekend with: a stellar jobs report.", "pubdate": "2015-11-06T17:58:23Z", "title": "Strong jobs reports could help Hillary Clinton, Democrats", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/06/politics/hillary-clinton-democrats-jobs-report/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151023110722-hillary-clinton-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/06/politics/hillary-clinton-democrats-jobs-report/index.html"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "template-top": "politics,art-vid", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "keywords": "politics, Strong jobs reports could help Hillary Clinton, Democrats - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-11-06T17:58:23Z", "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151023110722-hillary-clinton-large-169.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton received another piece of good news to head into the weekend with: a stellar jobs report.\nAt the end of Obama's first year in office, the unemployment rate peaked at 10% in October 2009.\nThe Labor Department announced Friday that the U.S. economy added 271,000 jobs in October, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5%.\nEconomic analysts warn against making sweeping conclusions about the health of the economy based on one jobs report.\nBut the surprisingly robust jobs growth and wage gains in October are undoubtedly welcome news for Democrats \u2014 particularly the party's eventual nominee for president."}
