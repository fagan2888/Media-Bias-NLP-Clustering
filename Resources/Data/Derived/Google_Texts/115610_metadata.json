Jodi Blair , said Daelene Mix , a spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Department of Public Safety, which oversees the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nThe complaint filed this week involves the detention of a third sheriff\u2019s captain, Sonya Gillespie, who was arrested earlier this week for assault, Mix said.\n\nMix cited an internal investigation as why she was not able to offer any more details about the complaint.\n\nGillespie was charged Sunday night with assault and disturbing the peace, according to court records. The case type was listed as domestic violence but details of the charge were not available late Friday.\n\nGillespie is the ex-wife of Sheriff Gary Wilson , who has recused himself from any issues associated with her arrest, sources told The Denver Post.\n\nGale has long been the face of the department, serving as its spokesman. He is in charge of the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s downtown division, which includes the downtown jail, court services and the civil process unit, according to the sheriff\u2019 s website.\n\nHe is one of two division chiefs who report to Sheriff Gary Wilson.\n\nGale did not return phone calls Friday afternoon.\n\nThe complaint is the latest in a string of investigations coming out of the Denver jail.\n\nA federal judge has asked federal authorities to investigate the jail\u2019s and the police department\u2019s patterns and practices as part of a civil lawsuit filed by a former inmate, who has accused sheriff\u2019s deputies of assaulting him while he was in jail.\n\nIn April, a former Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department administrator, Michael Than was indicted in Jefferson County on accusations of stealing TurboTax software from Target and submitting false tax returns.\n\nReporter Jordan Steffen contributed to this report.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Jail chief Frank Gale under investigation", "title": "Denver Jail chief Frank Gale under investigation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/denver-jail-chief-frank-gale-under-investigation/", "image": {"width": 458, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620_071239_Frank-Gale.jpg", "height": 331}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620_071239_Frank-Gale.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T19:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:36:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Jail"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bab\"", "article_summary": "A top-ranking Denver sheriff\u2019s deputy is under investigation after a complaint was filed by another officer.\nIn April, a former Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department administrator, Michael Than was indicted in Jefferson County on accusations of stealing TurboTax software from Target and submitting false tax returns.\nJodi Blair , said Daelene Mix , a spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Department of Public Safety, which oversees the sheriff\u2019s department.\nThe complaint against Division Chief Frank Gale was filed by Capt.\nThe complaint filed this week involves the detention of a third sheriff\u2019s captain, Sonya Gillespie, who was arrested earlier this week for assault, Mix said."}
