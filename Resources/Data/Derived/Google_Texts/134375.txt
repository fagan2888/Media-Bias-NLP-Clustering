No agreement has been reached yet on the settlement of remaining claims in lawsuits over the May 2013 discovery of genetically engineered Monsanto wheat in an Oregon field.

A joint status report filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Kansas says the parties have been exchanging settlement offers and that the last offer from non-soft white wheat plaintiffs is under consideration by St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. The lawsuits from across the country have been consolidated in Kansas.

The filing says the parties will continue to discuss an amicable resolution, but again urges the court to vacate its earlier order staying court proceedings.

The parties want the court to address the motions filed by Monsanto seeking to dismiss the cases.
