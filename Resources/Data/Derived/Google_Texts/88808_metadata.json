At the end of the interview, Hannity asked the experts how much it would have cost them to build a site similar to healthcare.gov that both operated properly from the beginning and was built secure to protect users\u2019 sensitive information.\n\n\u201cI would say to build a site like this with the infrastructure, the architecture around it, you are looking at maybe $5 million to $10 million at a very maximum rate,\u201d said David Kennedy, president of the technology firm TrustedSec. \u201cIt isn\u2019t rocket science.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would agree with Mr. Kennedy in the $5 million-$10 million range max,\u201d Luke Chung, president and founder of the technology firm FMS, concurred.\n\n\u201c[N]one of these contractors are ever held accountable for delivering such crap,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to CNN, the government paid outside contractors more than $300 million to build the preposterously-troubled Obamacare website. Other estimates put the number higher.\n\nDespite all the money thrown at the site, Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testified before Congress late last month that as much as 40 percent of the site had yet to be even built.\n\n\u201cWe still have to build the financial management aspects of the system, which includes our accounting system and payment system and reconciliation system,\u201d he said.\n\nKennedy, who is known as a \u201cwhite hat hacker,\u201d also appeared before Congress last month and testified that the Obamacare website doesn\u2019t appear to have been developed \u201cwith security in mind.\u201d He added it could take as long as a year to fix the security issues.\n\n\u201cWhen you develop a website, you develop it with security in mind. And it doesn\u2019t appear to have happened this time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to go back and fix the security around it because security wasn\u2019t built into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking multiple months to over a year to at least address some of the critical-to-high exposures on the website itself,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Get ready to smash you head against a wall.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Get ready to smash your head against a wall.
