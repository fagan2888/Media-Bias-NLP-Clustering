This completes the Company\u2019s portfolio of PICCs with the unique and groundbreaking Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology.\n\n\u201cWith the completion of our ARROW\u00ae PICC with Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology portfolio, Teleflex can now help provide the benefits of Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology to all patients with PICCs, whether they require a single-, double-, or triple-lumen device,\u201d said Jay White, President, Vascular Division of Teleflex. \u201cBecause ARROW\u00ae PICCs with Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology are both antimicrobial and antithrombogenic, they provide an extra measure of protection against thrombosis, occlusion, intimal hyperplasia and infection. That is a crucial advantage at a time when many hospitals still struggle to minimize these potentially deadly and costly complications. Additionally, as house-wide reporting takes effect as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2015, Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology\u2019s proven ability to reduce PICC-related CLABSI will be important for hospitals to consider.\u201d\n\nPressure-injectable ARROW\u00ae PICCs with Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology are the world\u2019s first FDA-cleared central venous catheters to significantly reduce the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and PICC-related vessel thrombosis, compared to traditional uncoated catheters.1 They are also the only PICCs in the IV catheter marketplace that have received FDA 510(k) clearance for both broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antithrombogenic protection.\n\nHospitals and clinicians have increasingly focused on reducing CLABSI and catheter-related vessel thrombosis when inserting PICCs, which are widely used in acute-care and long-term care settings. CLABSI is fatal in 12%-25% of cases concerning critically ill patients without cancer and 31%-36% of cases involving critically ill patients with cancer.2 PICC-related vessel thrombosis can lead to a CLABSI and also cause other serious complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.3\n\nIn addition to CLABSI and thrombosis, the ARROW\u00ae PICC with Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology protects against thrombotic, intraluminal catheter occlusion, the most common non-infectious complication in the long-term use of central lines.4 Occlusions can delay patient therapy and also require the use of expensive de-clotting agents.\n\nChlorag+ard\u00ae Technology uses a proprietary process to chemically bond chlorhexidine to both the internal and external surfaces of the catheter. The chlorhexidine-bonded surfaces, which provide a controlled release of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial, are the key to the PICC\u2019s antimicrobial and antithrombogenic benefits.\n\nStudies have shown that the risk of PICC-related infections is similar to the widely recognized risk of bloodstream infections with central venous catheters (CVCs). In fact, certain patient populations may be at higher risk for PICC-related infections.5,6,7 Published rates of PICC- associated symptomatic upper extremity vessel thrombosis vary from 3.0% - 7.8%8,9, while asymptomatic rates are as high as 38.5%.10\n\nThe impact of these complications on the healthcare economy is also significant, with the average cost of care for upper extremity vessel thrombosis exceeding $11,000 per incident11 and the cost of care for CLABSIs exceeding $45,000 per incident.12\n\nThe ARROW\u00ae PICC with Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology has been the subject of two recently published studies that documented substantial reduction in CLABSIs. Both studies appeared in the Journal of the Association for Vascular Access (JAVA).13,14\n\nThe FDA clearance for ARROW\u00ae PICCs with Chlorag+ard\u00ae Technology states that these IV catheters provide less thrombus accumulation for at least 30 days. In Vitro data establishes that the device provides 99.99% colonization reduction against gram + and gram - bacteria and fungi for at least 30 days.15\n\nConsideration of antimicrobial catheters is supported by multiple regulatory and clinician organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Epidemiology, the Society for Health Epidemiology of America, and the Infusion Nurses Society. Their recommendations and guidelines generally urge consideration of antimicrobial catheter usage if the IV catheter is expected to dwell greater than five days and if, after successful implementation of a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of CLABSI, the CLABSI rate is not decreasing.16,17\n\nAdditional information may be found at www.chloragard.com.\n\nAbout Teleflex Incorporated\n\nTeleflex is a leading global provider of specialty medical devices for a range of procedures in critical care and surgery.
