These bacterial worlds form around our bodies, cell phones, and clothes \u2014 making us \u201cmicrobiologically connected\u201d to these personal items.\n\nIn a new study, researchers from the University of Oregon measured the extent to which our personal microbes were linked to our cell phones. They took bacteria samples from the index fingers and thumbs from participants\u2019 dominant hands, as well as from the touchscreens of their smartphones. The bacteria from the phones were very similar to the microbes on the owners\u2019 fingers; 82 percent of the common bacteria on their fingers were also on their phones. Interestingly, the researchers found that women were more \u201cmicrobiologically connected\u201d to their phones than men.\n\n\u201cThis project was a proof-of-concept to see if our favorite and most closely held possessions microbially resemble us,\u201d James F. Meadow, a lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in the Biology and the Built Environment Center at the University of Oregon, said. \u201cWe are ultimately interested in the possibility of using personal effects as a non-invasive way to monitor our health and our contact with the surrounding environment.\u201d\n\nResearchers identified 7,000 different types of bacteria on both people's hands and their cell phones. The most common were Streptococcus (often found in the mouth), Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium (both of which are often found on the skin).\n\nThe team believes that being able to identify a connection between personal bacteria and phones might be useful in the future, when trying to prevent the spreading of diseases, particularly in a health care setting. They could screen people\u2019s cell phones to identify bacteria and possible exposure to outbreaks. \u201cMost people on the planet own mobile phones, and these devices are increasingly being utilized to gather data relevant to our personal health, behavior, and environment,\u201d the authors wrote in the abstract. \u201cOur results suggest that mobile phones hold untapped potential as personal microbiome sensors.\u201d\n\nSource: Meadow JF, Altrichter AE, Green JL. \u201cMobile phones carry the personal microbiome of their owners.\u201d PeerJ. 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cell phone bacteria, personal microbes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers found that our personal items, like cell phones, carry a large amount of the same bacteria found regularly in our skin and mouths.", "title": "Your Cell Phone Is Covered With Your 'Personal Bacteria'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/our-personal-bacteria-cover-cell-phones-clothes-why-were-connected-microbiologically-our-firsthand", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/cellphones.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers found that our personal items, like cell phones, carry a large amount of the same bacteria found regularly in our skin and mouths.", "title": "Your Cell Phone Is Covered With Your 'Personal Bacteria'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/our-personal-bacteria-cover-cell-phones-clothes-why-were-connected-microbiologically-our-firsthand", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/cellphones.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/25/cellphones.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-25T13:42:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T13:42:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers found that our personal items, like cell phones, carry a large amount of the same bacteria found regularly in our skin and mouths."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd154\"", "article_summary": "These bacterial worlds form around our bodies, cell phones, and clothes \u2014 making us \u201cmicrobiologically connected\u201d to these personal items.\n\u201cOur results suggest that mobile phones hold untapped potential as personal microbiome sensors.\u201dSource: Meadow JF, Altrichter AE, Green JL.\n\u201cMobile phones carry the personal microbiome of their owners.\u201d PeerJ.\nInterestingly, the researchers found that women were more \u201cmicrobiologically connected\u201d to their phones than men.\nThey could screen people\u2019s cell phones to identify bacteria and possible exposure to outbreaks."}
