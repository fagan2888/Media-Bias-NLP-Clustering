The new state law requires parents to adhere to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations for child passenger safety.\n\nThe proper use of child safety seats is one of the simplest and most effective methods available for protecting the lives of young children in the event of a motor vehicle accident.\n\nUnion County\u2019s Child Safety Seat Inspection Program is open every Wednesday and Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. and is at the Garwood Rescue Squad at 401 Second Ave., in Garwood.\n\nOn Saturday, Sept. 19, as part of \u201cNational Seat Check Saturday\u201d which is also the last day of \u201cNational Child Passenger Safety Week,\u201d trained technicians from Union County\u2019s Child Safety Seat Inspection Program will conduct child seat inspections at the Babies \u2018R\u2019 Us on Route 22 in Union, sponsored in part by AAA Northeast-NJ Division.\n\nCertified child passenger safety technicians will check the car seat for proper installation and educate parents and guardians on using the seat correctly.\n\nUnder the new child passenger safety law:\n\nChildren under age 2 and weighting less than 30 pounds must be secured in a rear-facing child safety seat that is equipped with five-point harness and is in the back seat.\n\nmust be secured in a rear-facing child safety seat that is equipped with five-point harness and is in the back seat.

It is staffed by personnel from the county\u2019s Department of Public Safety who are certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and by the organization SafeKids. The program is credited with saving at least one life, when a toddler survived a 2008 vehicle rollover shortly after the seat was properly adjusted by county personnel.\n\nThe child seat inspection program is provided as a public service by the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders, Union County Police Department, New Jersey Division of Highway Traffic Safety, AAA Northeast-NJ Division and Garwood First Aid Squad.\n\nFor more information about Union County\u2019s Child Safety Seat Inspection Program, visit ucnj.org or call 908-789-6830.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1FhOQJo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders announces free child safety seat inspection opportunities as new State law takes effect.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "The Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders announces free child safety seat inspection opportunities as new State law takes effect.", "title": "New car seat regulations in effect in New Jersey", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/outreach/caring-communities/2015/09/01/new-car-seat-regulations-effect-new-jersey/71539358/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders announces free child safety seat inspection opportunities as new State law takes effect.", "title": "New car seat regulations in effect in New Jersey", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e8dfc58219820e0f050d8f5cab91b595376b4c3/c=344-0-1656-1312&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/01/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635767270189454825-carseatevent.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "car seat safety, union county, inspection, new jersey"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2614\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur experts can help you get familiar with a new seat, and they can help you spot any problems with an older seat.\u201dNew Jersey\u2019s new child safety seat regulations took effect Sept. 1, 2015.\nUnion County offers free child safety seat inspectionsOn Saturday, Sept. 19, as part of \u201cNational Seat Check Saturday,\u201d trained technicians from Union County\u2019s Child Safety Seat Inspection Program will conduct child seat inspections at the Babies \u2018R\u2019 Us on Route 22 in Union (Photo: ~Courtesy of Union County)The Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders announces free child safety seat inspection opportunities as new state law takes effect.\nmust be secured in a rear-facing child safety seat that is equipped with five-point harness and is in the back seat.\nFor more information about Union County\u2019s Child Safety Seat Inspection Program, visit ucnj.org or call 908-789-6830.\nmust be secured in a forward-facing seat equipped with a five-point harness (up to the height and weight limits of the seat) or in a booster seat."}
