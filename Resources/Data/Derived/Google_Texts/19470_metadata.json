Or, actually, maybe it is, given how predictable Maher\u2019s become. My favorite part is how smug he gets in scolding the GOP for forever blaming the president for all the world\u2019s sins, alternately treating him as an evil genius or a slackjawed imbecile as the day\u2019s narrative requires. If you ever read a lefty blog or two back during the Bush years, you\u2019ll appreciate the irony.\n\nHere\u2019s how much of a joke the Benghazi committee is, by the way, per Guy Benson:\n\nThe public also thinks that the GOP\u2019s acting out of political reasons in forming the committee rather than to get at the truth (63/30), but clearly they also believe there\u2019s more truth to be gotten. Even Hillary looks shady: When people are asked whether they think she was honest with the public about State\u2019s role in Benghazi or deceptive, they split 40/50.\n\nLay all of that aside, though, and tell me this: What would you say is the GOP\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d or \u201cstrategy\u201d headed into the midterms this year? I thought about that after I saw Greg Sargent say this morning that the Democrats are \u201crunning against plutocracy.\u201d What are Republicans running for or against at this point as an overarching theme for 2014? The obvious answer until about a month ago was \u201cObamaCare,\u201d but they\u2019ve gone quiet on that lately. And not without reason:\n\nHarry Reid\u2019s now openly taunting them over it on the Senate floor. Granted, the GOP will surely return to O-Care this fall as new plan cancellations hit and premium hikes are announced, but the issue might not bite quite as hard as they expected. (If it did, would Mark Pryor be competitive in Arkansas right now?) So if, for the moment at least, the party\u2019s message isn\u2019t all about O-Care, what is it about? Immigration reform(!)? \u201cWhere are the jobs\u201d? Something else? A Twitter buddy suggested earlier today that maybe the Benghazi committee is their \u201cmessage\u201d as a way to remind voters throughout the summer of Obama\u2019s incompetence and/or corruption. Although, in fairness, a party in the GOP\u2019s position doesn\u2019t really need a message; as the out-group in a climate of deep dissatisfaction with the status quo in Washington, they\u2019re going to gain purely from voter antipathy to the party in power. What they really need is to make sure that their own party\u2019s unified in November, as Republicans split on different issues much more sharply than Democrats do. The Benghazi committee helps in that regard, whereas a summer amnesty push would hurt \u2014 a lot. So, count on \u201cthe stupid party\u201d to try it sometime in July or August.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oh my.", "title": "Bill Maher: Republicans should impeach Obama over Benghazi", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/15/bill-maher-republicans-should-impeach-obama-over-benghazi/", "image": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/o-c1.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Benghazi, Bill Maher, GOP, gowdy, impeach, Obama, Republicans, select committee,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T23:21:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-15T22:33:18+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb81\"", "article_summary": "The Benghazi committee helps in that regard, whereas a summer amnesty push would hurt \u2014 a lot.\nBill Maher: Republicans should impeach Obama over Benghaziposted at 7:21 pm on May 15, 2014 by AllahpunditVia Mediaite, this isn\u2019t what you think.\nLay all of that aside, though, and tell me this: What would you say is the GOP\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d or \u201cstrategy\u201d headed into the midterms this year?\nA Twitter buddy suggested earlier today that maybe the Benghazi committee is their \u201cmessage\u201d as a way to remind voters throughout the summer of Obama\u2019s incompetence and/or corruption.\nIf you ever read a lefty blog or two back during the Bush years, you\u2019ll appreciate the irony."}
