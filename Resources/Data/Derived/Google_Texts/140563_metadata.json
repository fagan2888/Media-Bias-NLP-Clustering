'We're talking multiple months to over a year to at least address some of the critical-to-high exposures on the website itself.'\n\n\n\nMorgan Wright, CEO of Crowd Sourced Investigations, went further, saying that the entire Affordable Care Act enrollment website should be scrapped and rebuilt from scratch with a proper security backbone in place.\n\n\n\n'There's not a plan to fix this that meets the sniff test of being reasonable,' said Wright.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nTrustedSec CEO David Kennedy said it would take 'multiple months to over a year to at least address some of the critical-to-high exposures on the website itself'\n\nSigning on to healthcare.gov is easier now, but signing up could expose taxpayers to hackers or identity thieves, experts say\n\nHe and Kennedy testified last month in a House Science Committee hearing that examined whether consumers' personal information would be safe on healthcare.gov's servers.\n\nThe consensus was overwhelming.\n\n'Americans should be scared to death,' warned Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewart.\n\nAlabama Rep. Mo Brooks, another Republican, said providing the federal government's untested website with Social Security numbers, income levels, mortgage information, dates of birth and home addresses would create 'a mother lode for identity theft.'\n\n'There's not a plan to fix this that meets the sniff test of being reasonable,' said cybersecurity CEO Morgan Wright\n\n'It's not only Social Security numbers,' Kennedy agreed.\n\n\n\n'It\u2019s one of the largest collections of personal data, social security and everything else, that we\u2019ve ever seen.'\n\nBrooks asked the panel whether they think the public can use the Obamacare website safely.\n\n'Given healthcare.gov\u2019s security issues, and assuming for the moment that you would be personally responsible for all damages incurred from your advice,' he asked, 'would any of you advise an American citizen to use this website as the security issues now exist?'\n\n'No,' replied all four, including Kennedy and Wright.\n\nThree of the witnesses agreed that the site should be shut down and rebuilt.\n\nKennedy told CNBC that that 15 state-level health insurance exchange websites, including one run by the District of Columbia, are equally vulnerable and will be 'a large area for attack.'\n\nHe pointed to a problem on the Vermont website on Friday.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 22, officials in charge of the Vermont Health Connect website admitted that one user was shown the personal information of another \u2013 including a Social Security number.\n\nIn another case, a government website delivered a South Carolina man's personal information to an unrelated person in North Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Obama returned to campaign mode on Tuesday, trying to re-sell the Affordable Care Act to the American people amid concerns that its flagship website is unworkable and lacks security features", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords":
