Police say the victim stopped and got out of the vehicle to confront the four, that's when 18-year-old Damauria Walton and a 13-year-old suspect began shooting at the man with a pistol and sawed-off rifle.

Police have not identified the 13-year-old.



Officers say the victim called 911 to report the crime. He was taken from the scene in serious condition.

Police took Walton and the 13-year-old suspect into custody. Walton has been booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon, and possession of a firearm. The 13-year-old is being charged the same, but as a juvenile.

The other two people walking in the roadway have been identified as two 15-year-old runaways from Norman and Ardmore.
