We need a leader who is not afraid,\u201d Goodwin told a crowd of about 100 supporters in downtown Charleston. \u201cWe will work through, together, the hard problems that face West Virginia today, because we always come back stronger and with more resolve.\u201d\n\nGoodwin offered few specifics but tried to position himself in the political center of a three-way Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cIf I were to say where I lie on the political spectrum, it is right down the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe what most West Virginians believe \u2014 they want a good education for their kids; they want a strong community; they want to be safe.\u201d\n\nGoodwin answered questions largely with generalities, although he did say he agrees with Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to more than 160,000 West Virginians.\n\nAsked about the state\u2019s budget deficit, projected to be well over $300 million this year, he said \u201cthere\u2019s not one quick fix,\u201d that he looks forward to hearing from West Virginians about the issue and that \u201cthere are really tough choices we have to make.\u201d\n\nDespite West Virginia\u2019s flagging coal industry, and with many major coal companies either bankrupt or on the brink of bankruptcy, Goodwin said, \u201cCoal will always be a big part of West Virginia. There\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\n\nHe added that residents of the Mountain State must \u201ccome together and figure out what we\u2019re going to do going forward.\u201d\n\nGoodwin enters a Democratic primary that includes Jim Justice, a coal and agriculture magnate and owner of The Greenbrier resort, and state Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, a Marshall County lawyer.\n\nJustice, a former Republican, has said he sees a \u201creal possibility\u201d of coal jobs returning in large numbers.\n\nKessler, on the other hand, largely agrees with industry forecasts that say coal jobs likely aren\u2019t coming back.\n\nGoodwin mentioned neither candidate in his five-minute speech or in taking questions afterward from reporters.\n\nThe closest he came to referencing Justice, the state\u2019s richest man, was when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not a millionaire; I\u2019m certainly not a billionaire.\u201d\n\nGoodwin spoke in front of the federal courthouse where he served as a prosecutor for 15 years, the last five as the presidentially appointed U.S. attorney.\n\nThat appointment, by President Barack Obama, could be a political liability, with the state Republican Party already calling Goodwin \u201chis lawyer.\u201d\n\nWhile he prosecuted several high-profile cases, Goodwin mentioned none of them by name Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take it from the crooked politicians,\u201d he said, a reference to the Democratic judge, prosecutor and magistrate in Mingo County that his office successfully prosecuted.\n\nHis office also secured convictions and guilty pleas from former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship and six former executives of Freedom Industries, the company responsible for poisoning the Kanawha Valley\u2019s drinking water.\n\nGoodwin didn\u2019t mention them, saying, instead, \u201cI didn\u2019t take it from the corrupt corporate bigwigs who don\u2019t care about their workers and don\u2019t care about us.\u201d\n\nThe Blankenship trial, one of the highest-profile cases in West Virginia history, ended just a month ago. Blankenship and his attorneys long contended that his prosecution, which came in the wake of 29 miners being killed at the Upper Big Branch Mine, was political. Blankenship was convicted of a misdemeanor but acquitted on two other charges.\n\nGoodwin said he didn\u2019t consider politics as U.S. attorney and, when asked about Blankenship, for years the pre-eminent Republican donor in West Virginia, he declined to name him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t always take politically popular positions,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do that which brings justice, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nGoodwin comes from a family with a long history in West Virginia Democratic politics. On hand for his campaign announcement were his wife, Amy Shuler Goodwin, the state\u2019s tourism commissioner; his mother, Kay Goodwin, a Cabinet secretary for Tomblin; and his cousin, Carte Goodwin, a former U.S. senator. His father, U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin, was in his courtroom across the street.\n\nDelegate Nancy Guthrie, D-Kanawha, one of several local Democratic politicians on hand, said she is supporting Goodwin because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have an agenda.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in this for West Virginians,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cHe\u2019s in it for the middle class.\u201d\n\nReach David Gutman at david.gutman@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5119 or follow @davidlgutman on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ0607/160529692/AR/0/AR-160529692.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/ae-music/20160526/with-star-wars-album-release-wilco-proves-its-still-a-rebel", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ0607/160529692/AR/0/AR-160529692.jpg"}, "title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "With \u2018Star Wars\u2019 album release, Wilco proves it\u2019s still a rebel"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do that which brings justice, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201dGoodwin comes from a family with a long history in West Virginia Democratic politics.\nEarl Ray Tomblin\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to more than 160,000 West Virginians.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in this for West Virginians,\u201d Guthrie said.\n\u201cIf I were to say where I lie on the political spectrum, it is right down the middle,\u201d he said.\nSaying that West Virginia is facing three crises \u2014 substance abuse, a massive budget deficit and a lack of jobs \u2014 former U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin announced his candidacy for governor on Wednesday."}
