(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\nTHE BIG IDEA:\n\nThe State Department posted 7,800 pages of Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails yesterday afternoon, the latest batch of the 55,000 pages that she sent and received while in office.\n\nIn this installment, 328 of the e-mails were withheld from public consumption because they are now deemed classified \u2014 the State Department says that brings the total number of messages partially withheld on that basis to 999. \u201cAll the messages designated as classified Monday were at the lowest tier, \u2018Confidential,\u2019 which is usually used for sensitive diplomatic communications,\u201d Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein notes.\n\n[Get The Daily 202 delivered directly to your email inbox]\n\nA few of the most interesting nuggets:\n\n\u2014 Superstorm Sandy apparently knocked out the Clinton private server for two weeks in 2012, delaying her responses to several messages, including birthday greetings. Karen Tumulty recalls that it was this episode that led the Clintons to seek more IT help.\n\n\u2014 One 2012 exchange underscores the belief within Clinton\u2019s high command that Hillary had erred in 2008 by not showing enough emotion on the campaign trail. Rosalind S. Helderman zeroes in on a note that Mark Penn, who was Clinton\u2019s 2008 chief strategist, sent after the Secretary of State testified before the Senate about the Benghazi attacks and famously asked: \u201c\u2026 what difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d\n\nWhile Hillary\u2019s closest aides at Foggy Bottom were celebrating the hearing \u2013 they thought the boss crushed it \u2013 Penn warned that she had hurt herself. \u201cI don\u2019t think the emotion in the hearing works to your advantage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLooks more like they rattled you on something no one outside the crazy right blamed you for anyway.\u201d Penn had prodded Clinton to come across as Thatchersque in her 2008 battle with Barack Obama.\n\n\u2014 Exposing the battle lines from that battle, Clinton aide-de-camp Phillipe Reines forwarded it along: \u201cGive. Me. A. Break.,\u201d he wrote to Clinton. \u201cYou did not look rattled. You looked real. There\u2019s a difference. A big one.\u201d\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Jake Sullivan then replied to Clinton: \u201cMy problem with Mark\u2019s analysis is that it repeats the same flawed assumption that underpinned his 2008 advice; namely, that being yourself is risky,\u201d he said.\n\nHillary agreed, writing back: \u201cBINGO!!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bigger picture, Clinton stayed focused on politics even when she was officially out of it. \u201cIn March 2011 \u2026 Reines alerted Mrs. Clinton to her 65% approval rating in a recent poll. \u2018This is why we cooperate with so many profiles,\u2019 he wrote,\u201d the Wall Street Journal flags. \u201cIn 2009, a longtime supporter from New Hampshire, state Sen. Lou D\u2019Allesandro, dropped by for a visit. In October 2012, her schedule showed a 15-minute phone call with megadonor George Soros.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In another e-mail getting buzz, Clinton criticized the caucuses as \u201ccreatures of the parties\u2019 extremes\u201d: \u201cIf Mittens can\u2019t beat Grinch in Florida, there will be pressure on state Republican parties to reopen or liberalize ballot access especially in the caucuses, which as we know are creatures of the parties\u2019 extremes,\u201d she wrote in a 2012 email to Sid Blumenthal. (Mittens is Mitt Romney; Grinch is Newt Gingrich.) Will the Des Moines Register follow up?\n\n\u2014 After Hillary suffered a concussion from fainting and hitting her head in late 2012, aides reached out to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former Republican Sen. Bill Frist to help push back on conservative conspiracy theories. \u201cHaving a cracked head is no fun at all,\u201d Clinton joked in an email to Reines. \u201cI reached out to both the Nfl commish [Goodell] (I remembered that his dad held your Senate seat) and Bill Frist,\u201d Reines told Clinton. \u201cI enlisted their help in my ongoing efforts to undermine the John Boltons and Laura Ingraham\u2019s of the world who are belittling your health\u2026 just not letting these comments stand, no matter who says them.\u201d The Daily Beast notes that \u201cFrist responded warmly, but there is no evidence that Goodell wrote back to Reines.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In 2012, an aide sent Clinton a list of 94 countries she had not visited yet as Secretary of State. The subject line was \u201c100 and counting \u2026\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the nations she had visited. \u201cWith 7ish months left, plenty of time to run up the score on total countries,\u201d Reines wrote. \u201c110 is a reasonable goal.\u201d (New York Times)\n\n\u2014 Finally, the Secretary asked Reines what channel Showtime is on so that she could watch \u201cHomeland.\u201d\n\nRead the trove all for yourself: The State Department posted the full release here.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nHillary Clinton holds up hands with Barbara Boxer, Barbara Mikulski and Patty Murray during last night\u2019s \u201cWomen for Hillary\u2019 fundraiser. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Warren, still not ready for Hillary, is a glaring holdout. Thirteen of the 14 Democratic women in the Senate raised hands with Clinton at an event last night. But not the freshman from Massachusetts. \u201cHer absence served as an awkward reminder of the frontrunner\u2019s enduring struggle to generate support and enthusiasm among an influential segment of her party\u2019s most liberal members,\u201d write Anne Gearan and Mike DeBonis. \u201cIt also illustrates the leverage that Warren holds in an election that Democrats are calculating will be waged on issues of economic advancement and fairness.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders on Sunday in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Cheryl Senter)\n\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders is recovering at his Capitol Hill townhouse this morning after hernia surgery at George Washington University hospital yesterday. His campaign insists that he will vote in the Senate later today and be back on the hustings later this week. Sanders, 74, was campaigning as recently as Sunday night and often says he\u2019s blessed with good health. For what it\u2019s worth, I had outpatient hernia surgery three years ago, also at GWU hospital, and that\u2019s definitely not the kind of activity that my medical team permitted. My surgeon told me to stay off the campaign trail for two weeks during the summer of 2012, but then again I wasn\u2019t running for president\u2026\n\nThe Vermont senator\u2019s first words after coming out of the recovery room were \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d The Post\u2019s John Wagner reports.\n\nMitch McConnell (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\n\u2014 Coming attraction: Looking to force a veto confrontation before the end of the year, Senate Republicans will vote, as early as Thursday, on legislation that would repeal large parts of Obamacare and cut off funding for Planned Parenthood. \u201cThe strategy for leaders in both the House and the Senate has been to allow conservatives to vent their frustration with Obama through the reconciliation bill, which cannot be filibustered and requires only 51 votes for passage,\u201d Kelsey Snell reports. \u201cThe hope is that members will be satisfied with the vote and abandon any plans to try to defund Planned Parenthood or target Obamacare in the omnibus spending bill that must pass by Dec. 11.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mystery in the Last Frontier: The newly elected mayor of Juneau, Alaska, was found dead in his home. Greg Fisk had just defeated an incumbent. A police spokesman said in a statement that the department \u201cis aware of rumors\u201d and \u201cspeculation\u201d that an assault occurred in connection with the 70-year-old\u2019s death but said detectives are still \u201cactively investigating,\u201d per Alaska Dispatch News. His body is being sent for an autopsy, and cops were spotted examining the area around his house with flashlights late into the evening.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM THE WAR ON ISIS:\n\nJohn Kerry confers with Robert Malley (the bald one on the left) during the July Iran nuclear negotiations in Vienna. He was then the National Security Council point person on the Middle East. (Carlos Barria/Pool via AP)\n\nA big escalation is possibly coming in Syria, as Obama mulls more boots on the ground: \u201cThe Pentagon will consider deploying more special operations troops to fight Islamic State militants if its pilot project in Syria shows signs of progress,\u201d a senior Defense official told USA Today last night in what appears to be a trial balloon. \u201cThe Pentagon last month announced that 50 commandos would be sent to northern Syria to advise forces battling the Islamic State. Sending that initial force amounts to \u2018breaking the seal\u2019 on inserting special operations forces in Syria and could lead to further deployments, said the official\u2026The Pentagon will not comment on whether those commandos have arrived in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe White House named Robert Malley as its new anti-ISIS czar. He previously served as senior director at the National Security Council for the Middle East and Africa. Press Secretary Josh Earnest says Malley\u2019s role will be complementary to that of Brett McGurk, the State Department special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, per CNN.\n\nU.K. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after receiving what the BBC describes as a \u201cthorough kicking\u201d at yesterday\u2019s leadership meeting, granted his members a free vote on Syria, allowing them to back Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s request for airstrikes and guaranteeing passage through Parliament on Wednesday. (Yesterday\u2019s 202 has the backstory.)\n\nAn \u201coptimistic\u201d Vladimir Putin said he and Obama discussed creating a list of groups in Syria considered terrorist organizations and a list of groups considered a part of the Syrian opposition. \u201cFrench and U.S. officials said Russia\u2019s military operations have shifted slightly in a positive direction in recent days,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFormer top intelligence official criticizes U.S. invasion of Iraq and botched response to the rise of ISIS: \u201cWe were too dumb,\u201d retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who spent three decades in the Army before serving as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the German newspaper Der Spiegel. \u201cIt was a huge error,\u201d he said of the decision to go into Iraq. \u201cWhen 9/11 occurred, all the emotions took over, and our response was, \u2018Where did those bastards come from? Let\u2019s go kill them. Let\u2019s go get them. \u2026 Then, we strategically marched in the wrong direction.\u201d Read the full Der Spiegel interview (in English) here.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Kabul warned American citizens that an \u201cimminent attack\u201d in the area is likely in the next two days, and urged those living in the Afghan capital to take extreme caution, according to AFP.\n\nGET SMART FAST:\n\nColorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting suspect Robert Dear, right, appears via video hearing during his first court appearance, where he was told he faces first degree murder charges.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus, Pool)\n\nThe president urges action. \u201cObama, who has staked his legacy on the fight against climate change, struck an ominous tone in describing the ravages of a warming planet, declaring that \u2018no nation large or small, wealthy or poor, is immune.\u2019 He urged leaders to take action even if the benefits were not evident for generations,\u201d Steven Mufson and Joby Warrick report.\n\n\u201cBut there were also signs of discord as negotiators prepared to haggle over details of a complex treaty that requires all nations \u2014 even the poorest ones \u2014 to make a contribution to cutting greeenhouse-gas pollution. \u2026 Obama has already aligned most of the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters behind substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, but over the next dozen days international climate negotiators must still nail down the details of an agreement that would strengthen existing commitments and introduce a way for countries to review and expand their commitments in the near future.\u201d\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narenda Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin this summer (Pool photo, via Getty Images)\n\nIndia may derail any deal. Negotiators for the world\u2019s 3rd-largest greenhouse gas polluter have, so far, publicly staked out an uncompromising position. The New York Times reports that Narenda Modi said climate change isn\u2019t India\u2019s fault during a speech yesterday, instead blaming \u201cthe prosperity and progress of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.\u201d \u201cDuring the climate change talks, India is expected to challenge the United States on three counts: To speed up emissions reductions by wealthy countries to compensate for emissions growth in poor countries; to pay more to poor countries to assist in mitigation plans; and to provide clean-energy technology to poor countries.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as the politicians postured, heavy smog engulfed many parts of northern and eastern China on Monday.

They spoke at length with The Post about why they back Ben Carson. (Max Becherer/Polaris)\n\n\u2014 \u201cFear, faith and the rise of Ben Carson,\u201d by Stephanie McCrummen: \u201cThe rise of Carson toward the top of the polls in the Republican presidential primary race has baffled many political pundits, liberals and some within the GOP establishment, who find his positions short on details, and certain assertions \u2026 But to see Carson from Mike and Toni Ledet\u2019s front porch, the reverse is true: To them, Carson is the only candidate who fully grasps what they see as the one reality that matters most \u2014 that America has fallen away from God. And while other Republican contenders express some version of that sentiment, Toni says it is Carson who seems both the closest to God and the furthest from Obama, who troubles her deeply \u2026 In the life of Ben Carson, they see a man in tune with the will of God. \u2018A Christian attitude,\u2019 Mike says. \u2018A Christian-based physician,\u2019 Toni says.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cFollowing U.S. indictments, Chinese military scaled back hacks on American industry,\u201d by Ellen Nakashima: \u201cThe Chinese military scaled back its cybertheft of U.S. commercial secrets in the wake of Justice Department indictments of five officers, and the surprising drawdown shows that the law enforcement action had a more significant impact than is commonly assumed, current and former U.S. officials said. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has not substantially reengaged in commercial cyberespionage since then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced charges against the officers in May 2014, the officials said. It is still unclear, however, whether President Xi Jinping will be able to deliver on a September pledge to President Obama that China would not conduct economic spying in cyberspace to benefit its own companies.\u201d\n\nTHE 2016 NARRATIVE:\n\nTed Cruz and Marco Rubio in happier days (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\n\u2014 Cruz v. Rubio battle continues to heats up. In the wake of the Paris attacks, the Florida senator attacked his Texas colleague for being weak on national security. Rubio was referring to Cruz\u2019s vote to limit government surveillance in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations (and it\u2019s only fair to say, Cruz was one of 67 senators to support the USA Freedom Act\u2019s reforms). \u201cThere are Republicans, including Senator Cruz, that have voted to weaken those programs. That is just part of the record, it is nothing personal,\u201d Rubio said on \u201cFox News\u201d yesterday. He repeated his comments after a Senate Intelligence Committee briefing.\n\nCruz fired back on the Hugh Hewitt show, taking aim at Rubio for his support of the 2013 Senate immigration bill. \u201cI think the reason that Rubio\u2019s allies have resorted to false attack ads is they are very, very nervous about our surge in the polls, about the fact that conservatives are uniting behind our campaign, and they\u2019re even more nervous about all the scrutiny that people are focusing on Marco Rubio\u2019s longtime partnership with Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer pushing a massive amnesty plan,\u201d Cruz barbed.\u201d And so I think they were looking to change the subject, and they believed that launching a false attack based on the USA Freedom Act was the way to do it.\u201d\n\nCruz defended his opposition to the government collecting metadata for national security reasons, saying \u201cit is not necessary\u201d to protect Americans by violating the \u201cConstitutional rights of millions of law-abiding citizens. I don\u2019t believe the federal government needs to collect in bulk and maintain your and my phone records. That does not further national security. But the second thing the USA Freedom Act does is it strengthens the tools for going after the terrorists.\u201d Listen to Cruz\u2019s full comments on the subject here. And definitely look for more drama between the two senators in coming weeks.\n\n\u2014 Ethanol could now emerge as a big issue in the run-up to the caucuses. In a move with political ramifications in Iowa, the Obama administration scaled back its requirement for how much corn-based ethanol must be mixed into gasoline in 2016. Already two years behind on issuing the quotas for the Renewable Fuel Standard, the EPA mandated that 18.11 billion gallons be mixed into the nation\u2019s gas supply next year \u2014 below the 22.25 gallon amount set by Congress in 2007. The move sparked an uproar in Iowa, where ethanol producers and Gov. Terry Branstad bashed it. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the EPA was a gut punch for consumers and farmers,\u201d said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. Politico notes that the lower ethanol quota seems to have been influenced by an intense lobbying campaign by the oil industry.\n\nDonald Trump is mobbed by the media in the Trump Tower lobby yesterday. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\n\u2014 Trump met with African-American pastors, as opponents piled on. So after all the hubbub, The Donald did sit down with about two dozen at his Trump Tower in Manhattan, saying he saw \u201clove in that room.\u201d But the planned press conference to roll out the endorsements of 100 black pastors never happened. Trump, though, talked to the press after the event (the number of endorsements wasn\u2019t offered). By his side was Omarosa Manigault, a contestant from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and an ordained minister. And as the New York Times reported, some attendees were skeptical even before meeting with the real-estate mogul: \u201cIt appears as if he\u2019s a possible racist based upon some of the things he said about black America,\u201d said Brehon Hall, a preacher from Toledo, Ohio.

What accounted for the difference in mentions? Our analytics partners at Zignal Labs pass along some fascinating metrics. Some of the Sanders edge is attributable to a single Sanders-related Vine, posted by a Los Angeles radio station, which continues to dominate social media. It was shared more than 110,000 times of Twitter alone last month. Here\u2019s Sanders\u2019 word cloud for the month:\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton, the conservative Internet continues to mobilize against her, which makes mentions of her overwhelmingly more negative than positive on the Internet overall. Here is a word cloud tracking all mentions of Clinton during the month of November:\n\nThe race continues to look very different on TV than it does on social media. While Sanders received 57 percent of the Democratic chatter on Twitter, compared with 42 percent for Clinton, the former Secretary of State secured 54 percent of the month\u2019s television mentions among Democratic candidates. Sanders received 35 percent and Martin O\u2019Malley received 11 percent \u2014 much higher than his 1 percent on Twitter.

In August, a judge ruled that the entrepreneur, Nicholas Merrill, could disclose what he had been asked to turn over if the government did not file an appeal within 90 days, and the deadline has now passed. Mr. Merrill revealed that the F.B.I. in 2004 ordered his company, Calyx Internet Access, to turn over all physical mail addresses, email addresses and Internet Protocol addresses associated with one customer\u2019s account, as well as telephone and billing records and anything else considered to be an \u2018electronic communications transactional record.\u2019 The order said the content of communications between the customer and others should not be handed over.\u201d\n\n\u2014 New Republic, \u201cYes she can,\u201d by Michael Eric Dyson: \u201cWhat can Hillary Clinton do for black people as president? She possesses neither her husband\u2019s performative charisma with black folk, nor Obama\u2019s undeniable blackness. She must instead wield the sort of power that politicians would, in a better world, solely rely on: public policy. If we were betrayed by Bill Clinton, and suffered dashed hopes under Obama, maybe, just maybe, we will get from Hillary Clinton what we most need and truly deserve: a set of political practices and policies that reinforce the truth that black lives must, and do, finally matter. On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has exhibited a greater sophistication about race, increased sensitivity about how blackness is lived in our country, and a deeper awareness of how the small brutalities of racism rend the fabric of the social compact after first spoiling the flesh of those at the bottom of society. If there were disturbing racial echoes in Hillary\u2019s first attempt to gain the White House, what\u2019s to guarantee we won\u2019t get blinkered in a fog of racial sensitivity now? Has Hillary Clinton changed? Have we?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Los Angeles Times, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a \u2018male brain\u2019 or \u2018female brain,\u2019 and scientists have the scans to prove it,\u201d by Karen Kaplan: \u201cScientists examined detailed brain scans of more than 1,400 men and women. No matter which group of people they looked at, what type of scan was used or which part of the brain was examined, the researchers consistently failed to find patterns that set men and women apart. \u2018Although there are sex/gender differences in brain structure, brains do not fall into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females,\u2019 the team wrote in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u2018Each brain is a unique mosaic of features, some of which may be more common in females compared with males, others may be more common in males compared with females, and still others may be common in both females and males.\u2019 \u2026 Only 6% of the brains consistently ranked among the \u2018most male\u2019 or \u2018most female\u2019 in all 10 categories, the researchers found. On the other hand, 35% showed \u2018substantial variability,\u2019 with male traits in some regions and female traits in others.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Motherboard, \u201cHacker obtained children\u2019s headshots and chatlogs from toymaker Vtech,\u201d by Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai: \u201cHacked toymaker VTech also left thousands of pictures of parents and kids and a year\u2019s worth of chat logs stored online in a way easily accessible to hackers. \u2026 Over the weekend, the hacker, who asked to remain anonymous, said that VTech left other sensitive data exposed on its servers, including kids\u2019 photos and chat logs between children and parents. This data is from the company\u2019s Kid Connect, a service that allows parents using a smartphone app to chat with their kids using a VTech tablet. In online tutorials, the company encourages parents and kids to take headshots and use them in their apps. \u2026 While probing VTech servers, the hacker found tens of thousands of pictures of parents and kids. Some are blank, or duplicates, so it\u2019s hard to establish exactly how many are legitimate pictures. But the hacker said he was able to download more than 190GB worth of photos.\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT\n\nNearly 15,000 people in Wisconsin have lost access to food stamps since Scott Walker required recipients to seek employment or job training in his budget this spring. The Wisconsin State Journal: \u201cIf you\u2019re an able-bodied adult without children living at home, you must work at least 80 hours a month or look for work to stay in the program. That rule went into effect in April, and between July and September, about 25 percent of the 60,000 recipients eligible to work were dropped from the program when the penalty took effect.\u201d \u201cThey will bankrupt our food banks,\u201d said Sherrie Tussler, executive director of the Milwaukee-based Hunger Task Force, a supplier of food pantries, soup kitchens and homeless shelters with emergency food.\n\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\n\nAlabama to pay Planned Parenthood\u2019s legal fees after trying to defund it. From the Montgomery Advertiser: \u201cAlabama would pay just over $51,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood Southeast over Gov. Robert Bentley\u2019s attempt to cancel the organization\u2019s Medicaid contract, under an agreement filed in federal court Monday morning. The governor moved to cancel the organization\u2019s contract \u2026 in August after videos surfaced alleging that Planned Parenthood sold fetuses and fetal tissue.\u201d\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\n\u2014 What\u2019s happening today on the campaign trail: Trump rallies supporters in Waterville Valley, N.H.
