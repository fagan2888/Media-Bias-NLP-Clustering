Enter 6-foot-3-inch, 295-pound defensive end Tyson Alualu. In short yardage situations, offensive coordinator Greg Olson intends to use Alualu as a lead blocker.\n\n\n\n\"We just like what he brings as far as the size and the athleticism,\" said Olson. \"I think that's a unique skill set that we don't have right now or don't feel like we have offensively and we're just going to experiment with it and see how it plays out.\"\n\n\n\nIn the Jaguars defensive system, Alualu is moved all over the defensive line but doesn't feel like his approach changes when playing offense.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's still the same mentality \u2013 it's playing football. It's just on a different side of the ball. I think my job as a fullback in short-yardage goal line is just to try and blow somebody up and make a hole.\"\n\n\n\nOther news and notes from Friday's practice session:\n\n\n\n-Gus Bradley said that WR Marqise Lee is the only player he expects to miss Saturday's scrimmage\n\n\n\n\n\n-Both Bradley and Olsen would like to decide on a starting center by the third preseason game\n\n\n\n\n\n-Bradley said there may be one live tackling period during Saturday's scrimmage. During practice players typically wrap-up but don't bring the offensive player to the ground\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
