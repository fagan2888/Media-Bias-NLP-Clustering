Top 10 for Tuesday: 10 Reasons To Give a Hug Today:

National Hugging Day is an annual unofficial event devised by Rev. Kevin Zaborney in 1986. The date chosen was because it falls between the holidays and Valentines Day, known to be the most depressing time of year. The in-between, not Valentines itself However, Valentines has been know to throw people into a bit of a slump as well.

1. Hugs are a feel-good for both parties. They are fun to give and fun to receive. Bear hugs are the best!

2. Hugs are free, unless you hug someone who doesnt want to be hugged, that may cost you. Be prudent.

3. Not everyone gives the best hugs, especially if it is out of their comfort zone. I say, keep doing it until they get the hang of it, practice. Also read #2 one more time, just in case.

4. A hug is a connection, a bond.

5. It can mean I care, I understand, I will miss you, I missed you, it is great to see you!

6. Every body needs a hug.

7. My parents were not hugging people, so I did not grow up in that environment, but I grew into it. I think I am blaming my Italian friends, however my cousin Jimmy gave the best bear hug I ever had and he was all Irish. His personality lit up the room. You couldnt wait to hug and be hugged by him.

8. After I started to go away on trips or if my parents were going away on a trip I started hugging them. It was just something I started, in case they might miss me, I guess. It is never too late to start. I wish I would have hugged my parents sooner and longer. That is my tip and advice to all those who still have the opportunity.

9. It was after 9/11 that I began distributing more hugs with my family and friends. My kids were in middle school and I had stopped hugging them regularly. That horrific day was a lesson to all of us. Hug and hug often.

10. You are never too old or too young to get or give a hug. Greeting a friend? Give them a hug especially if you havent seem them in a long time or if you will not be seeing them for a while. A hug connects you till next time.

Here is your lead in, it is National Hug Day!

Warning: Hugs: may not be covered by your insurance company, but they are part of an affordable care act. Hugs are free and the payback is a healthy choice.

A hug is going to make you and the hugged feel good.

Go for it!

IOUs are acceptable.
