Scott Wartman’s article deserves more discussion (“Conway’s challenge: The Obama factor” Oct. 13). The statement that some Republicans in Northern Kentucky have come out in support of Conway is laughable. These are the same few malcontents who came out five years ago in support of Jack Conway over Rand Paul. One must ask, how did that work out for them?

Conway voted for President Obama twice, was a delegate for him at two Democratic National Conventions and supported the signature piece of legislation from his presidency, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Conway supports Planned Parenthood and all its grisly practices, and he is a cheerleader for gay marriage.

Kentucky voters have had enough of these liberal policies and will be electing Matt Bevin as the next governor of our Commonwealth.
