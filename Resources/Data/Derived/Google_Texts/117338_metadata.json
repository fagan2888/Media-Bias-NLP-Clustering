The fact that you exist and make a profit is largely due to the generous support of U.S. taxpayers. It\u2019s the taxpayers, after all, who pony up for the National Institutes of Health, which does the basic research you rely on to develop drugs on which you make gigantic sums. And it\u2019s the taxpayers who shell out large amounts of money to protect your patents, broker trade treaties in your favor, and protect your interests around the world in international negotiations. The same ones who pay for the public education of your employees and the costly infrastructure\u2014the highways, airports, etc.\u2014needed to move your products. The very folks who pay the billions in federal contracts you receive.\n\nSo what do you do? Do you pay your share of taxes to return some of this largesse?\n\nOh, no. You vigorously lobby for lower taxes and leave no loophole unexploited. You are not satisfied to have received $2.2 billion in federal tax refunds from 2010-2012 while raking in $43 billion worldwide even though 40 percent of your sales are in America. You\u2019re not ashamed in the least that in 2012, you stashed $73 billion in profits offshore on which you paid zilch in U.S. income taxes.\n\nYour greed and irresponsibility demand still more. So you decide to get out of paying a single nickel to the country that feeds you. You rig up an overseas purchase so you can \u201cofficially\u201d relocate to a place with a lower tax rate and in doing so deliver a giant middle finger to your fellow Americans.\n\nLast week, New York-based drugmaker Pfizer finally admitted why it wants to buy British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is based in London. Sure, it will get some experimental drugs out of the deal, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s really after. What Pfizer wants is to cheat American taxpayers.\n\nIan Read, CEO Hall of Shame\n\nPfizer is willing to shell out $100 billion for AstraZeneca so it can get a new tax home and lower its tax rate from the roughly 27 percent it paid last year, to the UK tax rate, which is now 21 percent and will drop down to 20 percent in 2015.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a moment to consider the CEO of Pfizer, Ian Read, who is orchestrating this move. According to Forbes, he is a poster boy for grossly overblown executive salaries, hauling in almost $19 million bucks last year. Read looted the company for this obscene amount of money, despite the fact that under his leadership, profits actually declined in 2013. So instead of trying to make money by doing productive things, like, for example, investing in research and development for new products, Read is looking for shortcuts that are less about doing anything useful for society and more about plain destroying it.\n\nFiduciary Duty to Cheat?\n\nRight on cue, Read trotted out the predictable nonsense that he has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize value for Pfizer shareholders, and therefore must make the tax-dodging move.\n\nActually, that is baloney, as economist William Lazonick has repeatedly pointed out.\n\nShareholder value ideology is merely an absurdity that has been spread through American business schools since the go-go 1980s \u2014 a specious justification that allows executives to turn corporations into predatory extraction machines at the expense of stakeholders like workers and taxpayers. The fiduciary-duty-to-shareholders argument would be laughed out of court in nearly all circumstances (such as the exceptional case when a company is going to be sold). The reason for this is simple. Any idiot can figure out that sometimes a company must take short-term profit hits in order to do things that are in the long-term interest of the company.\n\nShareholder value ideology is only about boosting stock prices in the short-term, which often depends on moves that decrease the company\u2019s value over the longer time horizon,as Lazonick has tirelessly pointed out. So Read is utterly full of it. But things have gotten so out of hand in corporate America that executives now actually believe, as hedge fund manager Jim Chanos has observed, that they have a fiduciary duty to cheat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Relocating to another country with a lower tax rate is just one of the tricks in these companies' arsenals", "title": "Megacorporations\u2019 galling tax swindle: How Pfizer and others are robbing us blind", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Relocating to another country with a lower tax rate is just one of the tricks in these companies' arsenals", "title": "Megacorporations\u2019 galling tax swindle: How Pfizer and others are robbing us blind", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/14/megacorporations_shameless_tax_swindle_how_pfizer_and_others_rob_us_blind_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/AP090125162918-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Relocating to another country with a lower tax rate is just one of the tricks in these companies' arsenals", "title": "Megacorporations\u2019 galling tax swindle: How Pfizer and others are robbing us blind", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/AP090125162918-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynn Stuart Parramore", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Ian Read, Pfizer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1eb4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Ian Read, Pfizer, Business News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a giant American corporation like Pfizer, founded in Brooklyn way back in 1849.\nYou rig up an overseas purchase so you can \u201cofficially\u201d relocate to a place with a lower tax rate and in doing so deliver a giant middle finger to your fellow Americans.\nLet\u2019s pause for a moment to consider the CEO of Pfizer, Ian Read, who is orchestrating this move.\nLast week, New York-based drugmaker Pfizer finally admitted why it wants to buy British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which is based in London.\nThe fact that you exist and make a profit is largely due to the generous support of U.S. taxpayers."}
