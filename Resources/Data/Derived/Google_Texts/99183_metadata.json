They then boarded a black armored limousine, with U.S. and Cuban flags fluttering from the hood, and headed out in their motorcade.\n\nThe three-day trip, the first by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years, is the culmination of a diplomatic opening announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, ending a Cold War-era estrangement that began when the Cuban revolution ousted a pro-American government in 1959.\n\nObama, who abandoned a longtime U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba, wants to make his shift irreversible. But major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, and the Democratic president's critics at home say the visit is premature.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "President Barack Obama arrived in Cuba on Sunday on a historic visit, opening a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "President Barack Obama arrived in Cuba on Sunday on a historic visit, opening a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government.", "title": "Obama arrives in Havana for historic visit", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/20/obama-arrives-in-havana-for-historic-visit-first-us-president-in-cuba-in-88-years.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/20/103483141-RTSBDKY.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama arrived in Cuba on Sunday on a historic visit, opening a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government.", "title": "Obama arrives in Havana, Cuba, for historic visit", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/20/obama-arrives-in-havana-for-historic-visit-first-us-president-in-cuba-in-88-years.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/20/103483141-RTSBDKY.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Politics, Cuba, United States, Communism, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-20T20:15:41-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2016-03-20T20:15:41-0400", "tag": "Communism"}, "pageNodeId": 103483142, "news_keywords": "Obama arrives in Havana for historic visit, first US president in Cuba in 88 years"}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama arrived in Cuba on Sunday on a historic visit, opening a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the island's Communist government after decades of animosity between the former Cold War foes.\nObama, who abandoned a longtime U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba, wants to make his shift irreversible.\nBut major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, and the Democratic president's critics at home say the visit is premature.\nThe three-day trip, the first by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years, is the culmination of a diplomatic opening announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, ending a Cold War-era estrangement that began when the Cuban revolution ousted a pro-American government in 1959.\nThey then boarded a black armored limousine, with U.S. and Cuban flags fluttering from the hood, and headed out in their motorcade."}
