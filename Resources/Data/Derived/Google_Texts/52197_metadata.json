Liberal women tend to place more importance on higher salaries and generous paid medical leave. Mothers from both sides of the political spectrum often value flexibility more than women without children, who say they appreciate ample pay over other perks.\n\nThat\u2019s all according to a new study commissioned by the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a research group now brainstorming workplace policy updates that could please both Republicans and Democrats. (The group is hosting an event Thursday on the issues in Washington).\n\n\u201cDemocrats address women in the workplace all the time,\u201d said Sabrina Schaeffer, executive director of the IWF, who wants presidential hopefuls to propose more than \"one-size-fits-all\" solutions. \u201cRepublicans need to be able to offer alternative ideas. They need to understand the issues. They need to engage. They can\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n\nOver the last half century, labor policies in America haven\u2019t changed much. Family structures, however, have utterly transformed. In 1960, for example, women financially supported only 11 percent of households. Today, 40 percent of working moms identify as breadwinners.\n\nMany American workplaces, largely designed while most families could be supported by one income, make it difficult for parents today to succeed, said Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director of MomsRising, a non-partisan advocacy group.\n\n\u201cWomen make up half of the labor force for the first time in history,\u201d Rowe-Finkbeiner said at a recent gender equality panel in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut our public policies are still stuck in the stone ages. It\u2019s time to catch up.\u201d\n\nThe growing national debate: How can lawmakers and employers best support working mothers? What changes to the workplace will boost them and the country?\n\nResearchers hired by IWF started tackling this quandary with another question: What do women want? They showed varying job descriptions to 1,000 American women of \u201cmajor demographic\u201d backgrounds and asked them which seemed more desirable.\n\nThe competing packages looked like this:\n\nCourtesy of the Independent Women's Forum\n\nResearchers then broke down which benefits most appealed to respondents. The below chart shows the average impact each feature had on the probability they\u2019d choose a job with a certain feature, relative to the \"lowest value\" feature.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of the Independent Women's Forum\n\nAnd here's how company attributes, like average employee tenure, mattered to respondents. A company where 50 percent of its executives are female, for example, has an 8-point edge on the desirability scale over a company with no female executives.\n\nCourtesy of the Independent Women's Forum\n\nValues shifted by ideology. Women who consider themselves conservative reported different preferences than women who identified as liberal. Again, each point on the graph shows the difference between the groups in the average impact of features in a particular category compared to that category\u2019s least attractive feature:\n\nCourtesy of the Independent Women's Forum\n\nIt makes sense that conservatives, who generally opposed the Affordable Care Act, valued private health-care packages. (Tenure, however, is a bit harder to explain.) And it make sense that liberals favored family medical leave: The U.S. currently guarantees none to employees of private companies, and mandating some is central to several liberal lawmakers' policy agendas.\n\nBut higher salaries? \"Since the ideology of liberals does not favor material wealth, it does not make sense that liberals value more annual salary, and by so much,\" the researchers noted, offering no explanation.\n\nMothers and women without children, regardless of political ideology, also expressed differing needs:\n\n\n\nCourtesy of the Independent Women's Forum\n\n\"Since mothers have greater time constraints as a result of having children to care for,\" the authors wrote, \"they should value more workplace features that either allow them to use their time more flexibly or that give them more time.\"\n\nThe report\u2019s takeaway, according to Schaeffer: Different people across different backgrounds want different things. \"Not everyone woman wants the same thing in the workplace,\" she said, \"and I don't know why people sometime think they do.\"\n\nLawmakers should keep that in mind, she said, as American workers (of all genders) rally for change. And employers should consider ramping up benefits to attract more female workers, which, studies show, can boost a company's bottom line.\n\nOf course, what women want isn\u2019t dictated by their chromosomes. But it\u2019s important to acknowledge working moms in the United States tend to face steeper uphill battles than working dads.\n\nTake this national salary analysis, published Tuesday by the National Women's Law Center: Moms, on average, make 70 cents for every dollar paid to dads. Many low-wage workers have no access to paid sick days or maternity leave. And women across income levels often hide pregnancies, fearing discrimination.\n\nLeaders on Capitol Hill and in corner offices across the country, no matter where they stand politically, can take steps to ease those problems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research shows preferences vary widely for women on both sides of the political divide.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New research shows preferences vary widely for women on both sides of the political divide.", "title": "How political beliefs affect what women want in the workplace", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/04/how-political-beliefs-affect-what-women-want-in-the-workplace/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/06/large.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dpaqreport"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/04/how-political-beliefs-affect-what-women-want-in-the-workplace/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c3f\"", "article_summary": "The competing packages looked like this:Courtesy of the Independent Women's ForumResearchers then broke down which benefits most appealed to respondents.\nThat\u2019s all according to a new study commissioned by the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a research group now brainstorming workplace policy updates that could please both Republicans and Democrats.\nWomen who consider themselves conservative reported different preferences than women who identified as liberal.\nMothers from both sides of the political spectrum often value flexibility more than women without children, who say they appreciate ample pay over other perks.\n\u201cDemocrats address women in the workplace all the time,\u201d said Sabrina Schaeffer, executive director of the IWF, who wants presidential hopefuls to propose more than \"one-size-fits-all\" solutions."}
