Cassidy: Obamacare 'pounding the American people'

Rep. Bill Cassidy, who toppled Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in Saturday’s runoff election, says his top priority is to tackle Obamacare.

“It’s pounding the American people,” the Republican senator-elect said on “Fox News Sunday.” “People are upset about this law, and we must do something about it.”

“The Supreme Court is now considering a case as to whether the administration is breaking a law in terms of how they give subsidies - and a plain reading of the law suggests that they are,” he said. “If the Supreme Court rules that the administration is breaking the law, it crashes in 30 some odd states.”

Asked by host Chris Wallace why so many Republicans were elected in the South this fall, Cassidy said, “If there’s one party for the working person right now, it’s the Republican Party. The Republican Party is pushing the use of natural resources to create American jobs. It is the Democratic Party is trying to kill those jobs.”

“For example, in the coal industry,” he added, “they clearly have a war on coal, the oil and gas industry, Barack Obama continues to impede our jobs with regulations.”

Asked if he sees himself more like incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is known to compromise, or more like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who takes a “much harder line,” Cassidy said he represents “the people of Louisiana, and it is their concern that is uppermost.”

“I don’t necessarily align myself with anybody,” Cassidy said. “It sounds like campaign rhetoric, but it’s from the heart.”
