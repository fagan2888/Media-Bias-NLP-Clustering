And now it's available to everyone.\n\nLast spring, CNET was first to report on the surfacing of documents that led to Apple's commissioning the creation of a disk operating system (DOS) for the young company's new computer, the Apple II.\n\nWithout that DOS, the computer would probably never have made a mark, since the only storage option otherwise available was a tape drive. Over the Christmas holidays of 1977, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak designed a disk controller, but he needed a DOS.\n\nIn early 1978, Apple signed a $13,000 contract with Shepardson Microsystems to create the DOS. The contract was addressed to Steve Jobs. Once it was written, programs like VisiCalc, which led to the Apple II's tremendous success, were possible.\n\nNow, thanks to the help of the DigiBarn, a vintage computer museum in Santa Cruz County, Calif., the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., has officially published the DOS source code for all to see.\n\nAccording to Bruce Damer, the founder and curator of the DigiBarn, Apple, which still owns the code, gave its blessing for the documents to be made public. What anyone will do with them is unclear, but this is one of Silicon Valley's most important treasures -- a disk operating system that helped a young company become a behemoth. Without it, we might never have seen Apple become the company it is today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Computer History Museum has published the source code for the Apple II DOS.
