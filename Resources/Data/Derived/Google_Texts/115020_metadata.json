Democratic ads in particular are pushing old, false claims about a Republican Medicare plan, while some Republican ads are repeating a stale, misleading statistic about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNearly $50 million has been spent on television advertising in the first nine months of this year on ads that mention Medicare, with Democrats outspending Republicans nearly 2 to 1, according to Kantar Media Intelligence\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Federal, state and local campaigns nationwide have aired nearly 76,000 Democratic TV ads and more than 36,000 Republican spots on the subject from January through September.\n\nGiven that mass of messaging, we, too, are repeating ourselves \u2014 fact-checking claims that first surfaced several years ago. During the 2012 presidential campaign, we wrote that there was a serious policy debate to be had on the future of Medicare\u2019s financing, yet voters were subjected to campaign messages aimed at scaring, not informing, them. That hasn\u2019t changed. Nor have the specific claims being made by each political party.\n\nDemocratic ads claim Republicans would \u201cend the Medicare guarantee,\u201d a reference to their support of Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan. But Ryan\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t end the guarantee of Medicare benefits. Instead, it proposes phasing in a government-subsidy program in which future beneficiaries pick from private plans or traditional Medicare.\n\nOther Democratic ads claim seniors\u2019 prescription drug costs would rise by $1,700 under a Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the law\u2019s gradual closing of the Part D doughnut hole gap in coverage. Some seniors would pay more, but the vast majority wouldn\u2019t be affected.\n\nDemocratic ads also claim that Republicans want to cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. But that makes assumptions about how the Ryan plan would be implemented. The budget plan sets goals but provides no details on how it would pay for its tax rate reductions.\n\nRepublicans, led by the National Republican Congressional Committee, continue to say the Affordable Care Act would cut Medicare by $716 billion. That\u2019s a reduction in the future growth of spending over 10 years, not a slashing of the current budget.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSeveral ads, mainly from the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, make the claim that Republicans want to \u201cend the Medicare guarantee\u201d or \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d long-running Democratic talking points. In mid- to late September, we saw such claims in ads in three Senate races and four House races.\n\nWe first fact-checked variations of the \u201cend Medicare\u201d theme in 2011, when the claim made our list of whoppers of the year. That\u2019s when Rep. Paul Ryan introduced a House budget plan that called for significant changes to Medicare for those who were then younger than 55. It wouldn\u2019t \u201cend Medicare\u201d or \u201cessentially end Medicare,\u201d as Democrats claimed then. In fact, it would continue the current system, as is, for those who were already beneficiaries or close to retirement.\n\nFor those under age 55, Ryan\u2019s plan called for a transition to a premium-support system in which those individuals, once eligible for Medicare, would get a subsidy from the government for a selection of private insurance plans available on a Medicare exchange. The subsidy would be sent to the insurer. That first Ryan plan didn\u2019t include traditional Medicare as an option on that exchange, but his plan the subsequent year, and every year since, has. His proposals also have grown increasingly more generous in terms of how that premium-support subsidy increases over time.\n\nA Whopper Lives On\n\n\n\nThree years later, Democrats are still hammering Republicans for supporting Ryan\u2019s plan. The Senate Majority PAC has aired ads attacking Republican challengers in Colorado, North Carolina, Arkansas and Iowa. In Colorado, for instance, the super PAC\u2019s ad claims that Republican Rep. Cory Gardner would \u201cend the Medicare guarantee.\u201d But adding the word \u201cguarantee\u201d to the long-running talking point doesn\u2019t make it any more accurate.\n\nIn the ad, which began airing Sept. 19, a man who says he\u2019s close to retirement \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve got Medicare around the corner to take care of me\u201d \u2014 says he\u2019s \u201cworried\u201d about Gardner, who would \u201cend the Medicare guarantee. Voted for it.\u201d On screen, viewers see the words \u201cend to the guaranteed benefit in Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe citation is to an August 2012 Reuters article that says: \u201cRyan\u2019s plan calls for an end to the guaranteed benefit in Medicare and replaces it with a system that would give vouchers to recipients to pay for health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe ad, however, doesn\u2019t say that \u201cthe Medicare guarantee\u201d would be replaced with anything at all, leaving the impression that the gentleman who is about to retire wouldn\u2019t be able to count on getting Medicare if Gardner were elected. The full Reuters article makes clear that the current system, in which traditional Medicare directly pays for qualified Medicare services, would change to one in which beneficiaries choose from private plans (much like Medicare Advantage plans) or traditional Medicare, with a government subsidy covering all or some of the cost.\n\nThe Ryan plan \u2014 which Gardner voted for this year, as well as in 2011 \u2014 doesn\u2019t take away the guarantee of Medicare from seniors. And the private plans offered would have to include minimum benefits equivalent to those covered by traditional Medicare, so it doesn\u2019t take away any \u201cguaranteed\u201d benefits, either. Also, as we said, the plan wouldn\u2019t even pertain to a man with \u201cMedicare around the corner,\u201d as the man in the ad says. Ryan\u2019s premium-support system wouldn\u2019t begin until those under age 55 reached Medicare eligibility.\n\nGardner did, however, also vote for the Republican Study Committee budget, which called for a quicker transition to a premium-support system, five years earlier than the Ryan plan. But it didn\u2019t call for taking away any \u201cguarantee\u201d of Medicare, either. On the contrary, the budget proposals are both aimed at slowing spending and extending the solvency of the program.\n\nWe explained in detail the financial challenges facing Medicare, and the fact that politicians from both parties want to slow the growth of spending in the program, in our August 2012 story \u201cA Campaign Full of Mediscare.\u201d But politicians disagree on how best to do that.\n\nOpponents of the Ryan plan have argued that his premium-support payments wouldn\u2019t grow as quickly as health costs, leaving seniors to pay more out of pocket than they would under the current system. It\u2019s true that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said early versions of Ryan\u2019s plan could cost seniors more. But the latest Ryan plan ties those subsidy payments to the average of all bids submitted by private insurers plus traditional Medicare. And the CBO said in a September 2013 report that a model such as that would cost seniors 6 percent less on average for total medical costs in 2020 than under the current Medicare system.\n\nOpponents also argue that private insurers will attract younger, healthier beneficiaries, leaving older and less healthy seniors in traditional Medicare, and then raising costs for that program. The Ryan camp maintains there are risk adjustment procedures to guard against that. It\u2019s a matter of opinion and speculation whether those would be sufficient.\n\nBut instead of debating the finer points of how to shore up the long-term sustainability of Medicare, political ads go for the senior scare tactics.\n\nAnother Senate Majority PAC ad, this one in North Carolina, features a young man sitting at a kitchen table with his grandmother. He tells her that Republican Thom Tillis \u201csupports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it and raise premiums. Tillis is bad news, grandma.\u201d As we said, the Ryan plan wouldn\u2019t end Medicare, and wouldn\u2019t change the current system for the man\u2019s grandmother.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s not even clear whether Tillis supports Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan. He backed the 2012 budget plan but was quoted by CNN in May as saying on the Medicare proposal, \u201cI haven\u2019t studied it to the position where I can really give you a well-informed response.\u201d Tillis is the state House speaker, so he\u2019s not on record voting for or against the Ryan plan.\n\nYet another Senate Majority PAC ad in Iowa claims that Republican Joni Ernst supports \u201ca plan cutting Medicare\u2019s guaranteed benefit.\u201d As we mentioned, Ryan\u2019s proposed Medicare exchange would require private plans to cover the same benefits as traditional Medicare now does. And the group goes after Tom Cotton in Arkansas with the same \u201cend the Medicare guarantee\u201d claim.\n\nOther versions of the \u201cend Medicare\u201d attack ad aired recently in Florida\u2019s 26th District, where Rep. Joe Garcia claims that Carlos Curbelo \u201cbacks the tea party Republican plan to end the Medicare guarantee\u201d and in Illinois\u2019 10th District, where the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says in an ad that former Rep. Robert Dold \u201cand the Republicans voted to end the Medicare guarantee.\u201d A Rocky Lara TV ad in New Mexico\u2019s 2nd District features an elderly woman who says, \u201cI rely on Medicare to survive but congressman [Steve] Pearce voted to end Medicare as we know it,\u201d and a Martha Robertson ad in New York\u2019s 23rd says \u201cthe AARP says [congressman] Tom Reed\u2019s plan quote removes the Medicare guarantee. It\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nNot quite. The full quote from AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond was: \u201cRemoving the Medicare guarantee of affordable health coverage for older Americans by implementing a premium support system and asking seniors and future retirees to pay more is not the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe actual impact of the Ryan plan is debatable \u2014 and unknown. Clearly, AARP doesn\u2019t support the idea. But, as we said, the latest version is modeled on a premium-support option that CBO said would cost seniors less than the current Medicare system.\n\nCosting Seniors More for Prescriptions?\n\n\n\nOther Democratic ads have gone after the Ryan plan for rolling back the increased prescription drug coverage for seniors instituted by the Affordable Care Act. The Ryan plan could cost some seniors more for prescriptions, if they benefited from the ACA\u2019s gradual closing of the gap in Part D drug coverage. But how many would benefit? Not as many as the ads imply.\n\nA Senate Majority PAC ad that began airing Sept. 29 against Tillis in North Carolina features the grandson and grandmother again, with the young man saying Tillis \u201csupports a plan that could end up costing seniors $1,700 more every year for prescription medicine.\u201d Some seniors could pay that much \u2014 or more \u2014 under the Ryan plan, because their drug spending reaches and surpasses the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d gap in coverage. But relatively few seniors reach the gap, and even fewer surpass it. The majority of those on Medicare wouldn\u2019t pay $1,700 more for their prescriptions.\n\nHere\u2019s how the doughnut hole works in 2014: Medicare covers prescription drug costs, minus a deductible and copays, until total costs reach $2,850 for the year for a beneficiary. A beneficiary would then have to pay the full drug costs out of pocket until total out-of-pocket expenses alone reach $4,550, or total drug costs (for both beneficiary and Medicare) reach $6,691. At that point, a senior\u2019s drug costs are again covered, minus a 5 percent copay.\n\nThe ACA now offers discounts on drugs purchased in that gap and slowly closes the doughnut hole until it\u2019s gone in 2020. At that point, drug costs that previously fell in the gap would be covered, but seniors would have a 25 percent copay.\n\nRyan\u2019s plan repeals the closing of the doughnut hole. But not all seniors have drug spending that reaches that gap.\n\nIn fact, 12 percent of the 35.7 million seniors with Part D drug plans reached the gap in 2013 and received discounts under the ACA. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said those seniors saved $911 on average. (There were about 52 million Medicare beneficiaries last year, but not all have Part D coverage.)\n\nWhere does the ad get its $1,700 figure? We tracked it down before, when a Patriot Majority ad used it to attack Tom Cotton in the Arkansas Senate race. It\u2019s the difference between the lower and upper threshold of the doughnut hole gap, as referenced in a 2011 National Journal article that both ads cite.\n\nTechnically, seniors whose drug spending completely spanned the gap would pay more than $1,700 out of pocket, though how much more depends on the particular plan and drugs purchased. (Medicare.gov has more on this here.)\n\nHow many would completely surpass the doughnut hole? Statistics from 2011 indicate that less than 2 percent of all those on Part D plans completely spanned the gap and did not receive a low-income subsidy, which effectively covers costs in the gap. That\u2019s slightly more than 500,000 people who would have fully borne the costs in the doughnut hole, according to a March 2014 MedPAC report to Congress (see pages 365-366).\n\nMore seniors could reach, and span, the gap now, of course. Some may have previously found ways to reduce their spending to avoid the gap. But seniors could face some higher costs under the ACA provision, too. The CBO has said that premiums would \u201cincrease slightly\u201d because drug manufacturers would raise prices to compensate for the discounts they now provide. However, CBO still said that seniors in the coverage gap \u201cwill probably pay less for their drugs overall\u201d under the law.\n\nAds like this one would be correct to say that prescription drug costs would increase for some seniors under the Ryan plan. But it\u2019s unclear exactly how much, and the Senate Majority PAC ad leaves the misleading impression that all \u2014 or at least most \u2014 seniors on Medicare would face the higher costs.\n\nA Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ad in Alaska uses a more accurate figure on drug costs, but still implies the higher costs would affect all seniors on Medicare. The ad features an elderly woman, who says: \u201cMy husband George has Alzheimer\u2019s. I\u2019m blessed to be able to care for him. I keep track of every doctor\u2019s appointment and every bill. Dan Sullivan supports a plan to slash Medicare benefits, costing many seniors an extra $900 a year in prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nThe figure applies to both the average savings for those who hit the coverage gap in 2013 nationwide and in Alaska. As we said, 12 percent of those on Part D plans \u2014 and 8.4 percent of all those on Medicare \u2014 saved that much on average due to the health care law, according to CMS. And in Alaska, 2,564 beneficiaries saved an average of $922 on prescription drugs. But all told, there were 69,301 Medicare beneficiaries in the state in 2012, so the savings pertain to a small percentage of Alaskans on Medicare.\n\nSullivan wasn\u2019t in Congress to vote for the Ryan plan, but he has said he supports repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCutting Medicare to Pay for Tax Cuts?\n\nDemocratic ads also frequently claim that Republican candidates want to cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires or corporations.\n\nIn Louisiana, a TV ad from Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s campaign says Rep. Bill Cassidy\u2019s \u201cprescription for seniors\u201d is to \u201cincrease Medicare costs by thousands of dollars to pay for a tax break for millionaires like himself.\u201d In North Carolina, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s ad titled \u201cMarie\u201d says Tillis \u201cwould give tax breaks to millionaires and to those who would ship jobs overseas. And he\u2019d do it by cutting Medicare.\u201d\n\nAnd in Montana\u2019s at-large congressional district, Democrat John Lewis is airing a TV ad titled \u201cLikes\u201d that unfavorably contrasts the plight of an elderly woman on Medicare, Donna Jean, with his Republican candidate, Ryan Zinke.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the Lewis ad, which went on the air Sept. 19 and has been running continuously since then, according to Kantar Media Intelligence\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nLewis Campaign TV ad: This is Donna Jean. And this is Ryan Zinke. Zinke is running for Congress on a plan to cut Donna Jean\u2019s Medicare. Not because he dislikes her; Zinke just likes the corporations and billionaires a whole lot more. They\u2019re trying to buy him a seat in Congress and he wants to give them another big tax break in return. Even at the expense of seniors like Donna Jean.\n\nViewers hear a chainsaw when the narrator says Zinke has a plan to cut Medicare, and they see the words \u201c$200,000 tax break for billionaires\u201d when the narrator talks about tax breaks for \u201ccorporations and billionaires.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ad\u2019s small print, Zinke\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d is a reference to Ryan\u2019s fiscal 2015 budget plan, and the $200,000 figure comes from an April 2 analysis of Ryan\u2019s plan by the liberal group Citizens for Tax Justice. The report says, \u201cThere is no way the plan could be implemented without providing millionaires with tax cuts averaging at least $200,000.\u201d\n\nThe ad\u2019s assumption, then, is that the Ryan plan would be paying for those tax cuts with its proposed reductions in the growth of Medicare spending. But that\u2019s speculation.\n\nCTJ\u2019s analysis is inherently handicapped because Ryan\u2019s budget resolution is an incomplete, nonbinding policy statement. It sets \u201cgoals\u201d and offers \u201cillustrative policy options,\u201d but it does not detail how those goals will be met.\n\nFor example, Ryan\u2019s plan calls for lowering the income tax rates \u201cwith a goal of achieving a top individual rate of 25 percent and consolidating the current seven individual income-tax brackets into two brackets with a first bracket of 10 percent.\u201d (Currently, the seven income tax brackets range from 39.6 percent to 10 percent.) It also calls for repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax and tax increases in the Affordable Care Act, and reducing the corporate rate from 35 percent to 25 percent.\n\nBut another goal of Ryan\u2019s plan is to make the tax overhaul revenue neutral \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t provide any specifics on how to raise the revenues needed to replace what the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said in 2013 would have been a loss of $5.7 trillion in tax revenue in the first 10 years. \u201cIn the end, the Ryan budget is only half-a-plan. It outlines politically attractive tax cuts but says nothing about the tax increases necessary to pay for them,\u201d Howard Gleckman at the Tax Policy Center wrote.\n\nThis has been the case with all of Ryan\u2019s budget plans, which leave the difficult tax decisions to the House tax-writing committee known as the House Ways & Means Committee. When Ryan came out with his latest plan in April, Gleckman again wrote that the tax plan is \u201cnot serious\u201d because it lacks details. He said: \u201c[T]o the surprise of absolutely no one, this budget includes no specific proposals for cutting any of those tax preferences. Not a single one.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Gleckman told us Ryan has devised a plan that \u201cseems tailored for maximum deniability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that Ryan supports major tax cuts. We know that he supports increasingly unidentified spending reductions; they get less and less specific all the time. And we know that he does support reducing the deficit,\u201d Gleckman said. \u201cThe problem is he doesn\u2019t answer the question that you and I and others want to answer.\u201d\n\nCitizens for Tax Justice fills in the yawning gaps in Ryan\u2019s plan with assumptions that may or may not happen. As Gleckman at the Tax Policy Center wrote in 2013, the Ways & Means Committee \u201ccould make major changes in the budget panel\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\nThis Democratic line of attack harkens back to what we wrote during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Republican nominee Mitt Romney offered a similarly vague revenue-neutral tax plan. As we wrote at the time, Romney offered an \u201cimpossible tax promise,\u201d citing the Tax Policy Center\u2019s conclusion that Romney could not cut income tax rates as deeply as he proposed without losing revenue or favoring the wealthy. At the time, Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Tax Policy Center, said Romney\u2019s plan \u201ccan\u2019t accomplish all his stated objectives.\u201d\n\nBut we also wrote that Democrats could not make the claim that Romney\u2019s plan would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, because Romney insisted his plan would not raise taxes on the middle class and, lacking details, there was no way to know the net impact of his plan on middle-income taxpayers.\n\nIn this case, Ryan calls for Medicare changes that are designed to slow the future growth of Medicare. But he says any savings from slowing future Medicare spending will be used to extend the life of the program, not on tax cuts or any other new spending. In a conference call on the day he announced his fiscal 2015 budget, Ryan told reporters, \u201cWe want to make sure that all the savings that come from Medicare go back to Medicare to shore up its program.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Obama has said about the projected $716 billion in Medicare savings in the Affordable Care Act. Nevertheless, Ryan himself has accused Obama of raiding Medicare to pay for Obamacare, even though the savings from those same cuts were included in Ryan\u2019s budget plans \u2014 proving again that serious suggestions for curbing entitlement spending too often becomes political fodder for both parties. It also provides a perfect segue to our next item.\n\n\u2018Obamacare Cuts Medicare by $716 Billion\u2019\n\nThis tired Republican claim made our list in 2012 when we complied a similar article called \u201cA Campaign Full of Mediscare.\u201d And we wrote about it again and again and again and again and again and again in 2012 to no avail.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s back \u2014 stronger and just as wrong as ever.\n\nJust in the month of September, the National Republican Congressional Committee alone has run 10 separate ads that mention Medicare a total of 78 times in eight House races, according to Kantar Media Intelligence\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\n\nIn West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, NRCC began running an ad titled \u201cMedicare\u201d on Sept. 23 that (correctly) says that fact-checkers, including us, have called Rep. Nick Rahall\u2019s ads \u201cmisleading and shameful.\u201d But then it goes on to make its own shamefully misleading claims.\n\nThe ad accuses Rahall of \u201ccutting Medicare for West Virginia seniors\u201d and features a senior citizen talking about the \u201ccuts.\u201d Fred Langille of Huntington, West Virginia, says: \u201cThey\u2019re hurting me. They\u2019re hurting my family. People can\u2019t afford this.\u201d\n\nThe ad displays text on the screen that says, \u201cObamacare cuts Medicare by $716 billion\u201d \u2014 which is taken verbatim from the headline of a Washington Post \u201cWonkblog\u201d item that ran in 2012. The NRCC uses the headline in TV ads against Rep. Ron Barber in Arizona\u2019s 2nd District and Gwen Graham in Florida\u2019s 2nd District. The NRCC ads display images of forlorn seniors sitting in wheelchairs, shuffling with walkers and staring blankly at medical bills to illustrate the pain of the \u201ccuts.\u201d\n\nDespite the alarming headline and the despondent images of seniors in the ads, the Post blog item says Medicare benefits is \u201cone area these cuts don\u2019t touch.\u201d\n\nWashington Post, Aug. 14, 2012: It\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s one area these cuts don\u2019t touch: Medicare benefits. The Affordable Care Act rolls back payment rates for hospitals and insurers. It does not, however, change the basket of benefits that patients have access to. And, as Ezra [Klein] pointed out earlier today, the Ryan budget would keep these cuts in place.\n\nAs we have been writing about since at least Aug. 30, 2010, when the \u201ccuts\u201d were estimated at $500 billion, the Affordable Care Act slows the future growth of Medicare spending (as opposed to cutting current spending). The latest estimate \u2014 the $716 billion figure \u2014 comes from a July 24, 2012, letter from the Congressional Budget Office to House Speaker John Boehner that said the Repeal of Obamacare Act would increase Medicare spending \u201cby an estimated $716 billion over that 2013\u20132022 period.\u201d\n\nAs we have explained before, the largest chunk of the $716 billion \u2014 about $415 billion over 10 years \u2014 comes from a reduction in the growth of future payments to hospitals through Medicare Part A. Before the law, Medicare Part A\u2019s trust fund was projected to be insolvent \u2014 paying out more than is taken in from payroll taxes \u2014 by 2017. That insolvency date would be delayed 12 years to 2029 because of the ACA, according to congressional testimony by Richard Foster, Medicare\u2019s chief actuary, at a House hearing on Jan. 26, 2011. In its 2014 annual report, the Medicare board of trustees says that date is now 2030.\n\nThe next biggest chunk of the $716 billion is an estimated $156 billion in payments to insurance companies that offer private plans to senior through the Medicare Advantage program. Roughly 15.7 million seniors \u2014 or 30 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 have MA plans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation fact sheet on the program. The MA plans offered extra benefits and cost the federal government about 10 percent more than traditional Medicare plans before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, according to a fact sheet by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The law is intended over time to bring the costs of the MA plans in line with traditional Medicare plans.\n\nWhether the reductions in future payments to hospitals and insurers have an impact on senior care remains to be seen. The Medicare board of trustees said in its 2014 annual report that the quality of care could \u201cfall over time relative to that received by those with [non-Medicare] private health insurance\u201d if the health care sector cannot provide care more efficiently.\n\nWe should note, too, that some provisions of the Affordable Care Act directly benefit seniors. As we already mentioned, the ACA provides a discount on prescription drugs for those in the so-called \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d and slowly closes that gap in coverage. It also eliminates cost-sharing for some preventive care, such as cancer screenings, as explained on Medicare.gov. It also increases the amount of tax revenue that will flow into Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund by imposing a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on certain high-income individuals.\n\nThe enhanced benefits, of course, are not mentioned in the ads.\n\n\u2014 by Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely\n\nCorrection, Oct. 28: We incorrectly referred to the NRCC as the National Republican Campaign Committee in the original article.\n\nSources\n\nJackson, Brooks. \u201cThe Whoppers of 2011.\u201d 20 Dec 2011.\n\nHolland, Steve. \u201cRomney, Ryan hit the road in an energized campaign.\u201d Reuters. 12 Aug 2012.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives.
