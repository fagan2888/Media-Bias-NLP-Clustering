Jimmy Centers is the communications director for the Branstad/Reynolds reelection campaign. Although Gov. Branstad has not officially announced his intention to run for reelection, Centers has moved from working in the statewide governor's office to working for Branstad on a reelection campaign. Centers has worked with Republican candidates running for office, like Congressman Steve King.

Centers said that King's new opponent for the fourth Congressional district, Jim Mowrer, will have his work cut out for him when he runs against King in the upcoming election. Centers said he thinks Mowrer has good ideas but will face national challenges in his campaign, like the fight over the Affordable Care Act.

Centers added that he believes the new jobs created by Gov. Branstad's jobs plan will also affect the results of the upcoming election.
