New York State Police are warning the public about a recent phone scam reported in the Troop K area, which encompasses Columbia, Dutchess, Putnam, and Westchester counties.



“A scam that has been brought to our attention is from a caller who claims to work for ‘ObamaCare,‘“ police said. “The callers state that they work in a local branch of the ObamaCare Services, and have options to discuss in order for the recipient to avoid tax concerns. An online inquiry into calls from the sources indicated that it is a scam. It’s noted that the Affordable Care Act would not be referred to as “ObamaCare.”



Police warn citizens to be cautious of solicitors who:



1. Do not provide a legitimate business address or phone number;

2. Demand immediate payment or payment in cash, wire transfer or money card;

3. Seem vague as to the circumstances;

4. Say that money has to be sent in to collect a prize;

5. Appear angry or impatient when asked reasonable questions about the organization they represent or the reasons for which money will be used. The caller may have threatened with arrest if a “fine” isn’t paid.





Callers should be mindful:





Never give your social security number, banking information, date of birth or other personal information to anyone over the phone. Banks do not call and ask for this information.

If there is any doubt as to the legitimacy of the phone call or e-mail, verify the allegations by contacting the business using a publicly listed telephone number.





State police say every year, victims report losing money to telephone scams. In addition to scamming money from an unsuspecting victim, scammers will say anything to obtain a victim’s personal information. They may claim to work for a company you trust, or claim to be calling on behalf of a loved one. However, you must remain vigilant to protect yourself.
