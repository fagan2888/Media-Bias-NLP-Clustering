The improbable champion advocating for a left-right alliance is none other than Ralph Nader.\n\nWhat was equally surprising was that Nader had chosen to discuss this alliance not at a forum conducive to his beliefs, but at the Cato Institute. His willingness to speak at the revered libertarian think tank took everyone by surprise.\n\nNader participated in a panel discussion on his new book, Unstoppable: The Emerging Left-Right Alliance to Dismantle the Corporate State. The other participants on this panel were Daniel McCarthy (Editor of the American Conservative) and Tim Carney (Senior Political Commentator at the Washington Examiner).\n\nThe panel was moderated by Brink Lindsey, Vice President of Research at the Cato Institute.\n\n\u201cYou heard that right. Ralph Nader is speaking at Cato,\u201d Lindsey remarked during his introduction of Nader. \u201cThe sound you are hearing is heads popping across D.C.\u201d\n\nDuring the discussion, Nader spoke about how he believes that there are \u201careas of convergence\u201d for citizens from across the political spectrum. He stated that he believes that this is the most promising alliance to bring about real change in Congress.\n\nNader cited the activities of the recent coalition that has formed in Congress against the Wall Street Bailouts to ending the warrantless wiretapping ability of the NSA.\n\nStopping crony capitalism\n\nNader\u2019s main focus was on the topic of crony capitalism. He explained that it is crony capitalists and corporatists that are the common foe of economic prosperity.\n\nIn addition, he explained that these individuals are quick to invoke the name of the free market economist, Adam Smith. He said that when crony capitalists and corporatists use Adam Smith to justify their actions that they are ignoring the most important tenants of Smith\u2019s philosophy.\n\n\u201cCorporatists misinterpret or conveniently avoided that Adam Smith was worried about corporate coercion as much as government coercion,\u201d said Nader. Smith, in Nader\u2019s opinion, was against government control because it would eventually lead to corporate control.\n\nIn unanimous agreement, all of the other panel members echoed Nader\u2019s sentiments of the emerging alliance.\n\nDaniel McCarthy also agreed that the issue of crony capitalism has the potential to bridge the divide between the political spectrum. \u201cProgressives are against abuses of capitalism,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cso are conservatives and libertarians.\u201d\n\nMr. McCarthy referred to the abuses of capitalism as those that benefit big business and leave small businesses without the ability to survive. He went further to say that he believes this alliance presents a \u201ctremendous alternative\u201d to the status quo politics in Washington.\n\n\u201cAre they trying to crush mom and pop?\u201d\n\nTim Carney added that conservatives became hypersensitive to crony capitalism in 2008. He explicitly mentioned that conservatives took notice when they saw that President Obama received $1 million in campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs employees and that the President allowed pharmaceutical companies to write Obamacare.\n\nHe stressed that there are too many institutions and outside groups that are lobbying for corporate welfare. Carney asserts that the supporters of corporate welfare operate under the premise that \u201cbecause there are good things, we must preserve that.\u201d\n\nCarney suggested that in order to help promote this alliance, that there needs to be an institution against corporate welfare.\n\n\u201cGovernment shouldn\u2019t be taking money from regular people and giving it to big businesses,\u201d said Carney. \u201cAre they trying to crush mom and pop?\u201d\n\nThe overall tone of the panel was very positive and the members believed that there is a growing alliance not only in Congress, but in main street America.\n\nNader closed in kind with the same attitude. \u201cWe must focus on where we agree to help our country and our economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving been once seen as the outlying political lightning rod, Mr. Nader now finds himself in a rare position to become a bridge builder in this divided country. Nader, whether he realizes it or not, has just made himself a unifying symbol against crony capitalism.\n\nBrian Walsh Brian is from New Orleans, Louisiana and graduated last fall from the University of New Orleans with a Bachelors in Political Science.
