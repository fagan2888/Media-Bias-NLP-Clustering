Gay marriage, lethal injection, freedom of speech, religious discrimination and the interpretation of the Affordable Care Act were subjects of landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions in its 2014-15 term, and the court faces an equally challenging lineup in its upcoming term.

Dr. Steven Brown, chair of the Auburn University Department of Political Science, will guide his listeners through those significant rulings and preview the upcoming term at a Brown Bag Lunch and Learn session presented by the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Auburn University (OLLI at Auburn).

The luncheon will be from noon to 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 28, at Clarion Inn & Suites, 1577 S. College St. The event is free and open to the public. Bring your own lunch; coffee and water provided.

Brown, who received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, received the National Communication Association’s Franklyn S. Haiman Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Freedom of Expression for his 2005 book “Trumping Religion: The New Christian Right, The Free Speech Clause and the Courts.” In 2006, he received the National Faculty of the Year Award from the National Society of Collegiate Scholars.

In addition to teaching courses at OLLI, Brown lectures on political and First Amendment issues throughout the state. He also helps provide professional education training to elections officials nationwide.
