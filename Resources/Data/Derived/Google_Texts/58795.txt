Fireworks flew Tuesday night on “The Kelly File” when host Megyn Kelly took on Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel over the Obama administration’s constantly shifting numbers on Obamacare’s success.

Emanuel, the brother of former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, and the man who claims the title of “architect” of Obamacare, spent four minutes shifting arguments as Kelly peppered him with questions. He also demonstrated a calculated ignorance of reality.

When Kelly pinned him down with a video from the fall showing Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius saying she would consider an enrollment of 7 million to be a success, Emanuel tried to shrug it off as the secretary simply quoting a Congressional Budget Office estimate when Sebelius’s language — from her own lips — is crystal clear.

As Kelly’s questioning persisted, Emanuel resorted to the Obama administration’s default answer: its critics are simply acting out of ignorance, and the real problem is communication.

“We have a lot of misinformation and lack of information out there,” he said. “We obviously have to go out and sell this better.”

Emanuel, a chairman of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, is no longer formally a member of the Obama team, but like the rest of the Obama administration he continues to pretend the biggest problem with Obamacare is Americans don’t know enough about it.

Exactly the opposite is the truth.

And no amount of dodging around hard questions is going to change that.
