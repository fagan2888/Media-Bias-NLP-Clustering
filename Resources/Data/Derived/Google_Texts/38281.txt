Bernie Sanders introduces bill to repeal 'Cadillac tax'

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and seven Democratic senators have introduced a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act's "Cadillac tax", according to The Hill.

Scheduled to take effect in 2018, the "Cadillac tax" is a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans some employers provide their workers. It is meant to reduce overall healthcare costs by encouraging employers to offer cost-effective health benefits.

Sen. Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, has been one of the leaders in the fight against the excise tax since 2009 when he first introduced legislation to repeal it, according to the report.

The bill's cosponsors include Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who leads the Senate's ACA Works campaign.
