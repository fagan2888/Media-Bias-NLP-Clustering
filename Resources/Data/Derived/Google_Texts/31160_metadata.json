Thus far, 23 co-ops have been established, and they are clearly taking the \u201cnonprofit\u201d part of their mandate seriously. According to the Daily Caller\u2019s Richard Pollock, \u201cnet losses for the co-ops reached a record $614 million in 2014\u201d \u2014 this despite $2 billion in initial federal funding plus additional \u201csolvency loans,\u201d including $317 million in such loans \u201cto one out of every three co-ops last year.\u201d As of the end of September, \u201cthe ratio of surplus notes outstanding to capital and surplus exceeded 100% for all of the co-ops,\u201d according to a January report from insurance ratings firm A.M. Best.\n\nThings have hardly improved since September. The co-ops suffered nearly 62 percent of last year\u2019s losses in the fourth quarter alone. One of them \u2014 Co-Opportunity Health, which served Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 was shuttered on Christmas Eve after losing $163 million in its lone year of operation, leaving over 120,000 customers in the lurch. The co-op had already received $145 million in low-cost loans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2012 and got another $32 million last year; a subsequent request for $55 million more was rejected.\n\nAnd this is for one of the supposed success stories of ObamaCare. Pollock reported:\n\nCo-op supporters hailed Co-Opportunity Health because it had initially enrolled 50,000 customers, the second highest in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the market response to our products,\u201d said David Lyons, Co-Opportunity\u2019s chief executive officer and a politically-connected former Iowa insurance commissioner.\n\nWhat Lyons failed to say was that Co-Opportunity slashed prices and offered very low, below-market premiums to attract new customers.\n\nThe low premiums came at a cost. Co-Opportunity\u2019s ratio of costs to premiums was 140 percent. That meant that for every dollar it collected in premiums, it had to pay out $1.40 in medical claims.\n\nThe ratio is not much better among the other remaining co-ops. According to Scott E. Harrington of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard David Institute of Health Economics, \u201cThe ratios for the first three quarters of 2014 produced\u201c a total ratio of costs-to-premiums of 116 percent.\n\nCo-Opportunity, in fact, wasn\u2019t even the biggest loser last year. Co-ops in Utah, Colorado, Michigan, Tennessee, Maryland, Oregon, and Connecticut actually lost more as a proportion of their remaining funds than did Co-Opportunity, according to a report from Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why the co-ops are in trouble. They are classic socialist enterprises. They were established by the government and get all their funding either from taxpayers or from premiums, which, as noted above, are often below market rates, while their medical costs are extraordinarily high because they\u2019re covering people private insurers don\u2019t want. They are prohibited from accessing private capital markets. And when they spend lavishly, as most people do when disbursing other people\u2019s money, \u201cthey don\u2019t have any other cushion except for taxpayers to bail them out or lend them more money,\u201d American Enterprise Institute resident healthcare fellow Thomas Miller told Pollock. \u201cWhen that\u2019s gone, so is the co-op.\u201d\n\nAmong the extravagant expenses incurred by the co-ops are their executives\u2019 salaries. \u201cMost of the Obamacare co-op executives are paid more than members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, U.S. cabinet secretaries and the governors of all 50 states,\u201d Pollock reported in another article. The salaries for top executives at 18 of the co-ops ranged from $263,000 to $587,000, according to 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings.\n\n\u201cBefore its collapse, David Lyons, Co-Opportunity\u2019s president and CEO[,] received $261,000 in compensation. Stephen Ringlee, Co-Opportunity\u2019s CFO, received $257,000, despite having failed in several previous startups. Clifford Gold, its COO, took in $288,00[0],\u201d penned Pollock. These salaries, he calculated, were seven times the average individual income in Iowa.\n\nOther executives have padded their bank accounts even more excessively.\n\nThomas Policelli, CEO of Massachusetts\u2019 Minuteman Health, topped the list with a whopping $587,000 salary. Minuteman had a net operating loss of $21 million last year and had enrolled just 1,700 people, one of the lowest enrollments in the nation.\n\nNumber two on the list is South Carolina\u2019s co-op president and CEO Jerry Burgess, who took home $490,000, or 14 times the average individual income in the Palmetto State. Burgess surely was not rewarded so handsomely because of his stellar performance: The co-op had a net $10 million operating loss last year and, according to A.M. Best, had spent half of its taxpayer cash-on-hand by the third quarter.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tom Zumtobell, CEO of Nevada Health CO-OP, who took in $414,000. Zumtobell is a former vice president of casino-workers\u2019 union UNITE HERE. Other ex-UNITE HERE officials also hit the jackpot as co-op employees: Treasurer Kathy Silver, the former board president of the local union chapter, scored $377,000; and secretary Bobbette Bond, former chief lobbyist for UNITE HERE, made $222,000. Her husband, Donald Taylor, is the union\u2019s national president and, perhaps not coincidentally, a director of the co-op. Nevada Health lost $20 million last year.\n\nAnd the list goes on, proving that, as always, socialism is a dismal failure at anything except enriching the politically connected.\n\nIt was not, of course, supposed to be like this. The co-ops were, according to CMS, intended to provide \u201caffordable, consumer-friendly and high quality health insurance options.\u201d They were not, the agency reminded them in 2011, supposed to expend taxpayer dollars on \u201cexcessive executive compensation.\u201d Moreover, \u201ca section of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 established limits for federal contractor executive compensation at $487,000,\u201d wrote Pollock. \u201cAt least five co-op executives were paid above those limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they have done is the worst of both worlds,\u201d Galen Institute president Grace-Marie Turner told Pollock. \u201cTheir organizations are failing and they\u2019re paying CEO\u2019s exorbitant salaries that are completely in contrast with the concept the co-ops were supposed to stand for.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t look for the situation to improve. Although some of the co-ops are trying to stay afloat by significantly hiking their rates \u2014 so much for \u201caffordable\u201d insurance \u2014 most are still burning through cash at rapid rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to have fewer co-op\u2019s by the end of the year,\u201d Miller told Pollock.\n\nOnce more, ObamaCare has failed to live up to its wildly unrealistic promises. But at least the co-ops\u2019 failure is instructive. If out-and-out healthcare socialism on such a small scale has gone belly up so soon, how much worse a disaster would \u201csingle-payer\u201d healthcare be?", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, insurance, co-ops, losses, money, executives, salaries", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/21173-obamacare-coops-lose-money-while-executives-get-rich", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/e5f352cca15c0243e169a2e2a868171b_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ObamaCare's insurance co-ops are fast running out of money, yet their executives are being rewarded with huge salaries. by Michael Tennant", "title": "ObamaCare Co-ops Lose Money While Executives Get Rich"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/e5f352cca15c0243e169a2e2a868171b_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9945\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen that\u2019s gone, so is the co-op.\u201dAmong the extravagant expenses incurred by the co-ops are their executives\u2019 salaries.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) created health insurance co-ops as nonprofit competitors to private insurers with the aim of serving the working poor and others in need of health coverage.\nThen there\u2019s Tom Zumtobell, CEO of Nevada Health CO-OP, who took in $414,000.\nObamaCare\u2019s health insurance co-ops are fast running out of money \u2014 one has already failed \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped their executives from fattening their own wallets at taxpayer expense, even when their salaries appear to exceed legal limits.\nThe salaries for top executives at 18 of the co-ops ranged from $263,000 to $587,000, according to 2013 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings."}
