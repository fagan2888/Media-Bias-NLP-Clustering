We see many folks coming back year after year to get help they trust from volunteers in their own neighborhood. We\u2019re always taking new clients as well.\u201d\n\nLast year, AARP Foundation Tax-Aide\u2019s 36,000 volunteers nationwide provided 2.6 million people with free tax help. Of these, more than 2,000 AARP volunteers and more than 162,000 taxpayers were Texans. The program is offered at approximately 284 sites in Texas including senior centers, libraries and other convenient locations.\n\nAARP Foundation Tax-Aide volunteers are trained and IRS-certified each year to ensure their knowledge of revisions to the U.S. tax code. In Texas alone, taxpayers who used AARP Foundation Tax-Aide received more than $106 million in income tax refunds and more than $22.8 million in earned income tax credits.\n\nPreparation of tax returns under the Affordable Care Act rules will require additional documentation from taxpayers this year.
