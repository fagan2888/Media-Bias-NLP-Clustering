But like so much else in the health law, it depends on how federal and state health officials choose to enforce it.\n\nSEE ALSO: CURL: Obamacare turns four, but still wetting the bed\n\nJon Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he believes it will be used only for \u201cextreme hardships\u201d and is unlikely to apply to many people.\n\n\u201cThis is not an imminent threat to the individual mandate,\u201d said Mr. Gruber, who helped shape health-care reform both in Massachusetts and nationwide.\n\nThe newest exemption joins a list of other ways people can get out of paying a penalty for not having health insurance in the months surrounding a personal setback, including homelessness, a death in the family or filing for bankruptcy.\n\nBut it was the way it was added \u2014 quietly tacked on as the 14th and final exemption in December \u2014 that unsettled Republicans.\n\nIn the days after the GOP spotted the new exemption earlier this month, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Virginia Republican, said the loose wording essentially excludes everyone from the individual mandate.\n\nAnd despite analysts\u2019 assurances that the exemption would be limited, Mr. Cantor stood by his claim it could apply to almost everyone.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of nuance here. Name generic hardship, no need for documentation. If the administration is using discretion to give out hardships, how can they do so without documentation?\u201d said Rory Cooper, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor.\n\nMr. Obama has described the individual mandate as essential to making the economics of Obamacare work. It is a way of forcing younger, healthier people to pay into the system in order to cover costs of older, sicker Americans.\n\nAnalysts were hard-pressed to come up with examples that would need the new exemption. But they said there\u2019s no reason to suspect it will be abused, and said it was likely added as a way for the administration to accommodate special cases they didn\u2019t anticipate in the original list of 13 exemptions.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is they included that provision to leave the door open if someone came up with a personal hardship of a sort they hadn\u2019t considered,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. \u201cIt was not their intent to leave the door wide open.\u201d\n\nMr. Jost said it will be up to the federal Health and Human Services Department to decide which cases qualify as true hardships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a catch-all exemption, but my understanding is you can\u2019t just write in and say, \u2018I can\u2019t find an insurance policy I like, please don\u2019t subject me to the penalty,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a better explanation than that. It\u2019s of course up to HHS to determine if someone\u2019s explanation is adequate or not.\u201d\n\nThough the exemption is part of federal law under the Affordable Care Act, states that run their own exchanges could be responsible for interpreting the law and deciding what is an acceptable hardship, said Matthew Lawrence, a fellow at the Harvard Law School Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation.\n\nThe federal government will make determinations for states that participate in the federal exchange and for many states that have deferred that authority to the government the first year of the program. But in the future, those states with their own exchanges who don\u2019t support the law could use the exemption to provide a lot of leeway.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a very vague term like this exemption 14, the devil could be in the details on how it is implemented,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. \u201cBut that is one place where a different administration or state with a more- or less-favorable view might take a different approach to implementing it.\u201d\n\nMr. Lawrence also said there\u2019s a precedent from Massachusetts, which enacted a universal health reform in the last decade. Very few people claimed a similarly loosely-worded exemption.\n\nWhile the state approved a large percentage of those who applied for a hardship exemption, few went through the trouble of applying, Mr. Lawrence said.\n\nBut that was in Massachusetts, where most people approved of those health reforms. Nationally, where Obamacare is less popular, more people might apply for exemptions in an effort to avoid compliance, he said.\n\nJoanne Peters, a spokeswoman from HHS, said the exemptions are meant to benefit a limited number of people who experience real hardships that make it difficult to get insurance.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act requires people who can afford insurance to buy it, so that their medical bills are not passed onto the rest of us, which drives up health care costs for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThis form, which was published last December, allows a limited number of individuals who are facing hardship to apply for an exception.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans this month seized on a new hardship exemption to Obamacare, saying it punches a hole in President Obama's health law \u2014 but analysts said they expect relatively few people to actually use it.", "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republicans this month seized on a new hardship exemption to Obamacare, saying it punches a hole in President Obama\u2019s health law \u2014 but analysts said they expect relatively few people to actually use it.", "title": "Few will use Obamacare hardship exemption, analysts say", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/23/few-will-use-obamacare-hardship-exemption-analysts/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/14/311d2fa7fc6ee901480f6a70670010c5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/14/311d2fa7fc6ee901480f6a70670010c5.jpg", "title": "Few will use Obamacare hardship exemption, analysts say", "description": "Republicans this month seized on a new hardship exemption to Obamacare, saying it punches a hole in President Obama's health law \u2014 but analysts said they expect relatively few people to actually use i", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Eric Cantor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6e01\"", "article_summary": "Republicans this month seized on a new hardship exemption to Obamacare, saying it punches a hole in President Obama\u2019s health law \u2014 but analysts said they expect relatively few people to actually use it.\nWhile the state approved a large percentage of those who applied for a hardship exemption, few went through the trouble of applying, Mr. Lawrence said.\nBut like so much else in the health law, it depends on how federal and state health officials choose to enforce it.\nAnd despite analysts\u2019 assurances that the exemption would be limited, Mr. Cantor stood by his claim it could apply to almost everyone.\n\u201cWhen you have a very vague term like this exemption 14, the devil could be in the details on how it is implemented,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said."}
