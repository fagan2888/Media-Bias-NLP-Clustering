Volume de\u00adterm\u00adines the cost.\n\nBut un\u00adder a pi\u00adlot pro\u00adject be\u00ading de\u00adveloped through the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment wants to com\u00adpletely change that sys\u00adtem, set\u00adting a price for doc\u00adtors to meet when they treat a can\u00adcer pa\u00adtient and re\u00adward\u00ading them for beat\u00ading it.\n\nThe hope is that such an over\u00adhaul will do two things at once: keep costs un\u00adder con\u00adtrol and im\u00adprove the qual\u00adity of care. Those twin goals are the aim of many ef\u00adforts to re\u00advamp the way doc\u00adtors are paid in the United States, and there is reas\u00adon to think it could work for chemo\u00adther\u00adapy.\n\nBut this kind of re\u00adform is also sure to draw con\u00adcerns that doc\u00adtors could be too thrifty and the ac\u00adtu\u00adal care might suf\u00adfer as they try to meet their cost goals. The pub\u00adlic dis\u00adcourse is just a few years re\u00admoved from the height of the Obama\u00adcare de\u00adbate, and the rhet\u00ador\u00adic about keep\u00ading your plan if you like it, and death pan\u00adels. The stakes couldn\u2019t be high\u00ader when the dia\u00adgnos\u00adis is can\u00adcer.\n\n\u201cThat re\u00adac\u00adtion of, \u2018Oh, my God, they\u2019re try\u00ading to cut can\u00adcer care?\u2019 It is a re\u00adac\u00adtion that you hear some\u00adtimes,\u201d said Erin Smith, who worked on the pro\u00adject while she was at the Cen\u00adters for Medi\u00adcare and Medi\u00adcaid Ser\u00advices; she is now a seni\u00ador as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adate at Avalere Health, an in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent con\u00adsult\u00ading firm.\n\nOp\u00adtim\u00adism ex\u00adists among some phys\u00adi\u00adcians and pa\u00adtient ad\u00advocacy groups that the pro\u00adject, called the On\u00adco\u00adlogy Care Mod\u00adel, will lead to a bet\u00adter ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence for can\u00adcer pa\u00adtients by bet\u00adter pre\u00adpar\u00ading them for chemo\u00adther\u00adapy and mak\u00ading sure they don\u2019t end up in the emer\u00adgency room be\u00adcause of its side ef\u00adfects\u2014which should in turn keep costs down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re tar\u00adget\u00ading to cut back care for on\u00adco\u00adlogy, but I think that what they\u2019re see\u00ading in the high spend\u00ading that\u2019s re\u00adlated to on\u00adco\u00adlogy care is waste rather than good care,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe goal here is if they put these prac\u00adtice re\u00adquire\u00adments in place and they trans\u00adform the way on\u00adco\u00adlogy care is provided, then they\u2019re really go\u00ading to see im\u00adprove\u00adments. So it\u2019s ac\u00adtu\u00adally go\u00ading to be\u00adne\u00adfit the be\u00adne\u00adfi\u00adciar\u00adies.\u201d\n\nThe On\u00adco\u00adlogy Care Mod\u00adel would set a tar\u00adget price for the total cost of care over a six-month peri\u00adod, which would start when the pa\u00adtient is pre\u00adscribed chemo\u00adther\u00adapy drugs. Prac\u00adtices will start by re\u00adceiv\u00ading a $160 pay\u00adment per month for the pa\u00adtient to help cov\u00ader the cost of man\u00adaging their care.\n\nAt the end of the six months, CMS will add up all the costs\u2014that $160 care-man\u00adage\u00adment pay\u00adment, the drugs, the tests, everything\u2014and com\u00adpare it to the tar\u00adget price, which will be set based on the prac\u00adtice\u2019s his\u00adtor\u00adic\u00adal costs for treat\u00ading sim\u00adil\u00adar pa\u00adtients. If the prac\u00adtice treated the pa\u00adtient for less than the tar\u00adget price, they are paid the dif\u00adfer\u00adence. So if the tar\u00adget price was $10,000 but the treat\u00adment cost only $9,000, the prac\u00adtice re\u00adceives $1,000.\n\nQual\u00adity of care will also be meas\u00adured, though, so if the prac\u00adtice beat the tar\u00adget price but the care wasn\u2019t as good as re\u00adquired, they won\u2019t keep all of that $1,000. That would hope\u00adfully pre\u00advent doc\u00adtors from skimp\u00ading on care just to meet their cost goals, one of the big con\u00adcerns about the pro\u00adject.\n\n\u201cRight now, our health care sys\u00adtem has evolved to pay-for-volume. The only way rev\u00aden\u00adue comes to a prac\u00adtice is for a phys\u00adi\u00adcian to do something. That gen\u00ader\u00adates some per\u00adversit\u00adies, and it\u2019s not just in on\u00adco\u00adlogy, it\u2019s throughout health care,\u201d said John Cox, a med\u00adic\u00adal on\u00adco\u00adlo\u00adgist at Texas On\u00adco\u00adlogy in Dal\u00adlas who has ap\u00adplied for the pro\u00adgram. \u201cThere is a bet\u00adter way; I think every\u00adbody knows that.\u201d\n\nThe pro\u00adject has gone through sev\u00ader\u00adal rounds of pro\u00adposed rules, feed\u00adback from in\u00adter\u00adested groups, and re\u00advi\u00adsions. The ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion is cur\u00adrently ac\u00adcept\u00ading ap\u00adplic\u00ada\u00adtions from on\u00adco\u00adlogy prac\u00adtices that want to par\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adate while it fi\u00adnal\u00adizes all the de\u00adtails. The pro\u00adject is set to launch in spring 2016 and last for five years. CMS said it wants to re\u00adcruit at least 100 prac\u00adtices that will treat 175,000 cases over the five years.\n\nBut the dev\u00adil, as al\u00adways, is in the de\u00adtails, and groups like the Amer\u00adic\u00adan So\u00adci\u00adety of Clin\u00adic\u00adal On\u00adco\u00adlogy, of which Cox is a mem\u00adber, and the phar\u00adma\u00adceut\u00adic\u00adal trade group PhRMA have ex\u00adpressed to CMS their con\u00adcerns about the pro\u00adject. How the tar\u00adget prices are set, what the qual\u00adity meas\u00adures will be, and what ser\u00advices count to\u00adward the cost are some of the is\u00adsues that are still be\u00ading re\u00adsolved.\n\nTo an\u00adswer one oth\u00ader ob\u00advi\u00adous ques\u00adtion: The $160 care-man\u00adage\u00adment fee would stop if the pa\u00adtient dies, but it would oth\u00ader\u00adwise be treated like a nor\u00admal six-month epis\u00adode. The agency has pledged to over\u00adsee the par\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adat\u00ading prac\u00adtices with a vari\u00adety of meas\u00adures, from site vis\u00adits to pa\u00adtient sur\u00adveys, to make sure qual\u00adity isn\u2019t suf\u00adfer\u00ading.\n\nAn\u00adoth\u00ader is\u00adsue loom\u00ading over the pro\u00adject is how it will deal with newly dis\u00adcovered can\u00adcer treat\u00adments. \u201cEs\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00ading pay\u00adment in\u00adcent\u00adives based on defin\u00adi\u00adtions of clin\u00adic\u00adal care that do not \u201c\u00a6 keep pace with med\u00adic\u00adal ad\u00advances will cre\u00adate sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adant dis\u00adin\u00adcent\u00adives for con\u00adtin\u00adued pro\u00adgress and may lead to some Medi\u00adcare be\u00adne\u00adfi\u00adciar\u00adies re\u00adceiv\u00ading a lower stand\u00adard of care than their co\u00adhorts simply be\u00adcause they are a part of a mod\u00adel test,\u201d wrote PhRMA, whose mem\u00adbers are the ones of\u00adten de\u00advel\u00adop\u00ading those med\u00adic\u00adal ad\u00advances, in an Oc\u00adto\u00adber let\u00adter to CMS.\n\nCMS has signaled it will work to ad\u00address those con\u00adcerns, per\u00adhaps by ex\u00adclud\u00ading a new treat\u00adment when cal\u00adcu\u00adlat\u00ading what it cost to care for a pa\u00adtient. But every\u00adone in\u00advolved ac\u00adknow\u00adledges it is one of the biggest out\u00adstand\u00ading ques\u00adtions.\n\n\u201cIdeally, doc\u00adtors are go\u00ading to do what\u2019s best for the pa\u00adtients, even if it\u2019s not best for their pock\u00adet\u00adbook,\u201d said Shel\u00adley Fuld Nas\u00adso, who heads the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Co\u00adali\u00adtion for Can\u00adcer Sur\u00adviv\u00ador\u00adship.\n\nCox, in turn, poin\u00adted to the phar\u00adma\u00adceut\u00adic\u00adal in\u00addustry, which he said some\u00adtimes makes \u201cun\u00adcon\u00adscion\u00adable\u201d pri\u00adcing de\u00adcision for new treat\u00adments. Whenev\u00ader pri\u00adcing comes up, the in\u00addustry ar\u00adgues that it needs to re\u00adcoup the cost of de\u00advel\u00adop\u00ading new drugs so that it can re\u00adin\u00advest in fur\u00adther re\u00adsearch.\n\nAnd the fact that new medi\u00adcines that im\u00adprove care and save lives are de\u00adb\u00adut\u00ading all the time is un\u00addeni\u00adable\u2014which is why this is such an acute is\u00adsue for the pro\u00adject.\n\n\u201cMy pro\u00adfes\u00adsion is be\u00ading re\u00admade right now by sci\u00adence,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt\u2019s re\u00admark\u00adable.\u201d\n\nDes\u00adpite all that un\u00adcer\u00adtainty, phys\u00adi\u00adcians, pa\u00adtient ad\u00advoc\u00adates, and the former CMS of\u00adfi\u00adcial all said that the On\u00adco\u00adlogy Care Mod\u00adel holds real prom\u00adise for can\u00adcer pa\u00adtients.\n\nIt would amount to little changes in the every\u00adday ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence, but they be\u00adlieve it could both im\u00adprove a pa\u00adtient\u2019s qual\u00adity of life and cut down on costs\u2014those twin goals of any change to the health care sys\u00adtem.\n\nPa\u00adtients would re\u00adceive a de\u00adtailed plan of what their care is go\u00ading to look like so they know what to ex\u00adpect. Chemo\u00adther\u00adapy comes with very pre\u00addict\u00adable side ef\u00adfects, so if pa\u00adtients are warned in ad\u00advance and doc\u00adtors make sure to be avail\u00adable to their wards at all times or even to be pree\u00admpt\u00adively check\u00ading in, a pa\u00adtient feel\u00ading naus\u00adeous or get\u00adting de\u00adhyd\u00adrated could be treated by a doc\u00adtor in\u00adstead of go\u00ading to the emer\u00adgency room. That would also save money by avoid\u00ading pre\u00advent\u00adable and ex\u00adpens\u00adive hos\u00adpit\u00adal stays.\n\n\u201cThe whole mod\u00adel,\u201d Fuld Nas\u00adso said, \u201cis based on do\u00ading a bet\u00adter job of man\u00adaging symp\u00adtoms so that pa\u00adtients don\u2019t end up in the hos\u00adpit\u00adal or emer\u00adgency room.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "The Oncology Care Model will help test how far the Obama administration can go in prioritizing quality over quantity in health care.", "title": "Should Doctors Get Paid More If Their Cancer Patients Live?", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/26994/should-doctors-get-paid-more-if-their-cancer-patients-live", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2015/05/15/160859004.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2015/05/15/160859004.jpg"}, "description": "The Oncology Care Model will help test how far the Obama administration can go in prioritizing quality over quantity in health care.", "site": "@nationaljournal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Should Doctors Get Paid More If Their Cancer Patients Live?"}, "description": "The Oncology Care Model will help test how far the Obama administration can go in prioritizing quality over quantity in health care.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8092\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s re\u00admark\u00adable.\u201dDes\u00adpite all that un\u00adcer\u00adtainty, phys\u00adi\u00adcians, pa\u00adtient ad\u00advoc\u00adates, and the former CMS of\u00adfi\u00adcial all said that the On\u00adco\u00adlogy Care Mod\u00adel holds real prom\u00adise for can\u00adcer pa\u00adtients.\nIf the prac\u00adtice treated the pa\u00adtient for less than the tar\u00adget price, they are paid the dif\u00adfer\u00adence.\nRight now, Medi\u00adcare pays doc\u00adtors by what\u2019s known as fee-for-ser\u00advice: They per\u00adform a ser\u00advice, pre\u00adscribe a drug, and they\u2019re paid for it.\n\u201cThe goal here is if they put these prac\u00adtice re\u00adquire\u00adments in place and they trans\u00adform the way on\u00adco\u00adlogy care is provided, then they\u2019re really go\u00ading to see im\u00adprove\u00adments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re tar\u00adget\u00ading to cut back care for on\u00adco\u00adlogy, but I think that what they\u2019re see\u00ading in the high spend\u00ading that\u2019s re\u00adlated to on\u00adco\u00adlogy care is waste rather than good care,\u201d Smith said."}
