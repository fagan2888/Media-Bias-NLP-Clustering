It was the first of three committees the bill must pass prior to a House floor vote.\n\nEven some anti-abortion legislators, along with the analysis of the bill by the legislative staff, said the bill as written would probably be ruled in court to violate the Florida Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court decisions.\n\nRep. Charles Van Zant, R- Keystone Heights, has filed the bill for the last seven years, but this was its first committee hearing. Some legislators said that was out of courtesy to Van Zant, who is term limited and in his final session.\n\n\u201cThat may have been part of it,\u201d he said when asked whether that\u2019s why his bill was heard.\n\nVan Zant argued that the bill is constitutional. He said the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion \u201cis not a law. If it were a law, it would violate the Constitution.\u201d\n\nBut the bill\u2019s odds of passage may still be slim.\n\n\u201cThe bill, probably, frankly, in all due respect, is never going to get a hearing in the Senate,\u201d said Rep. Ross Spano, R-Dover, who voted for it.\n\nSpano acknowledged he was voting for the bill despite concern it could cause him problems winning re-election in his Hillsborough County swing district. \u201cI have to act on what I believe, notwithstanding what the consequences might be.\u201d\n\nDebate was brief an d calm.\n\nRep. Dave Kerner, D-Lake Worth, praised Van Zant\u2019s dedication to principles before saying he was \u201ccompelled and required to vote against this bill. ... It\u2019s clearly unconstitutional. I think it violates the rights of women on so many levels.\u201d\n\nThe bill is one of several pieces of anti-abortion legislation now advancing in the Florida Legislature.\n\nOther bills that have received approval by at least one committee include measures that would prohibit Medicaid payments to any clinic where abortions are performed; require doctors who perform abortions to have local hospital admitting privileges; and require abortion clinics to meet the same construction standards and other licensing requirements as walk-in surgical centers; and prohibit use of fetal tissue resulting from an abortion for research.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "A House committee passed a bill Monday that would ban nearly all abortions in Florida, but even backers of the bill say its chances of passage, or of", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/bill-florida-house-would-ban-most-abortions", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201601/464464630.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A House committee passed a bill Monday that would ban nearly all abortions in Florida, but even backers of the bill say its chances of passage, or of", "title": "Bill In Florida House Would Ban Most Abortions"}, "story_id": 464425384, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Bill In Florida House Would Ban Most Abortions"}, "nid": 13381, "datePublished": "2016-01-26", "keywords": "Abortion, abortion ban, anti-abortion legislation, abortion legislation, Florida Legisature, Florida Legislature 2016", "wordCount": 517, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A House committee passed a bill Monday that would ban nearly all abortions in Florida, but even backers of the bill say its chances of passage, or of surviving a court challenge if it became law, likely are slim.\nSome legislators said that was out of courtesy to Van Zant, who is term limited and in his final session.\nRep.
