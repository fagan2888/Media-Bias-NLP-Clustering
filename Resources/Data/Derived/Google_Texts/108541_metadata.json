As employee data is centralized in Gusto, the new offerings are fully integrated with payroll and employees use dashboards to access and manage payroll and benefits information.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never agreed with the term \u2018Human Resources\u2019 because humans are not resources\u2014they are the most important part of every business. Gusto helps employers care for their teams and helps employees feel appreciated for what they do,\u201d stated Josh Reeves, CEO and co-founder of Gusto. \u201cWe\u2019ve transformed traditionally impersonal tools for employee onboarding, payroll, and health insurance into a service that connects companies with their teams in a more human way.\u201d\n\nBenefits of the integrated services include:\n\nFaster, automated enrollment in benefits and workers\u2019 compensation\n\nAccurate employee information and payroll deductions in the unified system\n\nAccess to a large selection of healthcare plans and expert advice from licensed brokers, with benefits that are compliant with the Affordable Care Act and HIPAA regulations\n\nPay-as-you-go workers\u2019 compensation that automatically calculates and pays premiums based on payroll data\n\nIn their personal Gusto accounts, employees can make changes to their health plans, contact Gusto\u2019s care team regarding benefits-related questions, and access paystub and plan data.\n\n\u201cFor many people today, health insurance is a burden or a hassle. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way,\u201d stated Reeves. \u201cHealth insurance is what makes it possible to take care of you and your family. We are automating all of the complex enrollment and administration, so that a business owner can offer this important service to their employees, without any headache.\u201d\n\nThe rebranding follows the company's to-date fundraising of $86.1, including the lastet Google Capital-led $60 million Series B round in April. Gusto also recently opened its second office in Denver to help support its current customer base of more than 20,000.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/accounting-technology/news/zenpayroll-rebrands-to-gusto-adds-benefits-workers-comp-75816-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Accounting Technology", "title": "ZenPayroll Rebrands to Gusto, Adds Benefits, Workers' Comp"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "description": "ZenPayroll announced a name change to Gusto and the launch of integrated health benefits and workers compensation into its unified service.", "news_keywords": "zenpayroll, gusto, health benefits, workers compensation, josh reeves, payroll", "title": "ZenPayroll Rebrands to Gusto, Adds Benefits, Workers Comp"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f6f\"", "article_summary": "ZenPayroll, online provider of payroll, benefits, HR, and personal finance solutions, announced a name change to Gusto and the launch of integrated health benefits and workers\u2019 compensation into its unified service.\nGusto\u2019s new benefits and workers\u2019 compensation capabilities have the same automation and services of the company\u2019s payroll and finance tools.\n\u201cFor many people today, health insurance is a burden or a hassle.\nAs employee data is centralized in Gusto, the new offerings are fully integrated with payroll and employees use dashboards to access and manage payroll and benefits information.\nGusto helps employers care for their teams and helps employees feel appreciated for what they do,\u201d stated Josh Reeves, CEO and co-founder of Gusto."}
