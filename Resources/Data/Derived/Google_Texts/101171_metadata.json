This was done as if were Russian mafia,\u201d said Dailey, who describes his company as the official tour operator of USA federations for curling, luge, bobsled and skeleton. He estimated 30 people in the Ludus traveling party are relatives of American athletes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years planning for this event and they\u2019ve thrown this at us in the 11th hour,\u201d said Dailey, who blamed the Sochi Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games for not notifying visitors of the problem until after they landed in Russia.\n\nClients who paid approximately $400 per day for room and board on a ship were relocated five miles west of the Olympic park, in apartment hotels that rent for $175 per night. In some cases, Dailey claimed, fans arriving early last week were forced to wait 24 hours before replacement lodging was located.\n\n\u201cJust because they overbooked a cruise ship doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a natural disaster,\u201d said Dailey, irked at a threat that lodging would be withheld from his clients if he complained too vigorously.\n\nCommunism is dead in Russia. But a large, sticky pile of bureaucratic red tape remains for Olympic tourists, whether the goal is to obtain something as essential as a visa or as simple as a spare key to a hotel room. Dailey feels their pain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent more than $1 million for all our accommodations in Sochi during the Games, and nothing is what we were promised,\u201d he said.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Russian bureaucracy now a \u201cnightmare\u201d for Sochi Olympics fans", "title": "Kiszla: Russian bureaucracy now a \u201cnightmare\u201d for Sochi Olympics fans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/09/kiszla-russian-bureaucracy-now-a-nightmare-for-sochi-olympics-fans/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-09T11:26:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:23:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18c0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe were moved off the cruise ship and forced to relocate our clients.\n\u201cIt has been a nightmare,\u201d Ludus Tours managing director Adam Dailey said Sunday, during a telephone interview.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent more than $1 million for all our accommodations in Sochi during the Games, and nothing is what we were promised,\u201d he said.\nIn some cases, Dailey claimed, fans arriving early last week were forced to wait 24 hours before replacement lodging was located.\nThis was done as if were Russian mafia,\u201d said Dailey, who describes his company as the official tour operator of USA federations for curling, luge, bobsled and skeleton."}
