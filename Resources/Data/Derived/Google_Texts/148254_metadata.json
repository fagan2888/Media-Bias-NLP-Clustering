That\u2019s hardly a small figure, as $5.6 billion amounts to more than 25 percent of all education credits given out by the government, an extraordinarily high level of inefficiency and waste. Not only that, but the IRS still hasn\u2019t found an effective way to stop more faulty credits from being claimed in the future.\n\n\u201cThe IRS still does not have effective processes to identify erroneous claims for education credits,\u201d says the report. \u201cAlthough the IRS has taken steps to help address some of our recommendations, many of the deficiencies [the inspector general] previously identified still exist. As a result, taxpayers continue to receive billions of dollars in potentially erroneous education credits.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the report finds that about $3.2 billion in credits was granted to about 2 million taxpayers who didn\u2019t file the proper form to claim it, and about $2.5 billion in credits was given to students who were attending academic institutions that do not qualify for them. Another $650 million was lost to about 400,000 taxpayers for claiming the American Opportunity Tax Credit for more than its maximum of four years.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t just fault the IRS, but also Congress, which it says should grant the IRS more authority to use government databases to check student\u2019s claims. The report also urges the government to increase IRS funding so that it can hire more personnel. The agency has lost several thousand employees since 2010, and the report argues that this has led to a manpower shortage and an inability to audit every questionable tax credit claim.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/05/irs_gave_out_56_billion_in_bogus_education_tax_credits.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: IRS gave out $5.6 billion in bogus education tax credits"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe IRS still does not have effective processes to identify erroneous claims for education credits,\u201d says the report.\nThat\u2019s hardly a small figure, as $5.6 billion amounts to more than 25 percent of all education credits given out by the government, an extraordinarily high level of inefficiency and waste.\nDaily Caller:A whopping 3.8 million students were allowed to claim about $5.6 billion in tax credits that, in hindsight, appear to have been questionable or outright fraudulent, the report found.\nNot only that, but the IRS still hasn\u2019t found an effective way to stop more faulty credits from being claimed in the future.\nThe report doesn\u2019t just fault the IRS, but also Congress, which it says should grant the IRS more authority to use government databases to check student\u2019s claims."}
