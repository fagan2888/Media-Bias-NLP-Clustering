The company rents out offices and desks to freelancers and entrepreneurs on a month-by-month basis and offers perks \u2014 free coffee, foosball and even a 5 o\u2019clock happy hour. Business and economics correspondent Paul Solman takes a closer look at the company as well as the larger trend of contingent work in the latest Making Sen$e segment, which airs every Thursday on the PBS NewsHour.\n\nPaul sat down with Richard Greenwald of Brooklyn College and the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Death of 9\u20135.\u201d As one might assume, Greenwald does not have the rosiest view of this contingent workforce. More independent contractors, he notes, put large corporations into a very powerful position.\n\nTune in tonight to watch this week\u2019s Making Sen$e report on the topic. The following transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.\n\n\u2014 Kristen Doerer, Making Sen$e Editor\n\nPaul Solman: So what\u2019s the problem with this new phenomenon of the contract worker?\n\nRichard Greenwald: We have 40 percent of the workforce working contingently without any safety net. They\u2019re holding all of the burdens, all of the risks that used to be carried by employers or institutions on their own shoulders. They don\u2019t have defined benefits. They don\u2019t have healthcare. They\u2019re working from gig to gig. And the system that we\u2019re operating under is still geared to a nine-to-five, permanent, full-time job economy. Our political system, our economic system hasn\u2019t caught up.\n\nMORE FROM MAKING SEN$E\n\nA perfect example is when a freelancer bills a company. If you\u2019re working a nine-to-five job, and you don\u2019t get paid, you can go to the Department of Labor, file a complaint and there\u2019s a process for that. If you\u2019re an independent contractor, and you don\u2019t get paid, you have to go to small claims court, because it\u2019s usually a small amount of money, which means you have to take time off of work, you have to sue, you have to represent yourself. One of the big complaints from freelancers is that there are huge delays in getting paid, and there are many clients who just don\u2019t pay them. Our system is not set up to provide any security for them. So they\u2019re taking on enormous risk without any safety net. And it looks the percentage of contingent workers is going to increase in the next decade. It\u2019s already gone from 30 percent to 40 percent. One could imagine it\u2019s going to 50 percent very soon.\n\nPaul Solman: Thirty percent to 40 percent in what period of time?\n\nRichard Greenwald: About ten years. It\u2019s enormous. And you could see it, because big companies that never would have thought about hiring freelancers are doing it. IBM for example, even NASA, are hiring consultants or freelancers at a large volume.\n\nPaul Solman: IBM and NASA are hiring consultants?\n\nRichard Greenwald: Yes. And NASA is actually using Freelancer.com to crowdsource engineering designs for some of the things for space travel. And they\u2019re not alone. The flood gates have opened. More and more companies are hiring freelancers when they might have hired full-time people. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s just escalating, and I don\u2019t see it slowing down right now.\n\nPaul Solman: You say that our system hasn\u2019t caught up, but Obamacare, for example, is a way of trying to get the uninsured \u2014 those working contingently \u2014 insured.\n\nMORE FROM MAKING SEN$E No boss, no office, no problem! The rise of the freelance workforce\n\nRichard Greenwald: And that has been very helpful, but it\u2019s still not enough. There are still thousands and thousands of freelancers, many of whom who don\u2019t realize that the economy is permanent this way. And they\u2019re imagining that, \u201cWell, in six months or a year, I\u2019ll get a full time job. One of these clients I\u2019m working freelance for will just hire me full time.\u201d And the trend shows that that\u2019s not going to happen. So we\u2019re in an economy right now where many young college graduates are going to wind up working for themselves. They don\u2019t have the skill set to do all the things that they need to do. This is going to be a permanent position for them, and they\u2019ve got to learn how to operate collectively and figure out ways to strengthen their economic position.\n\nPaul Solman: But then, it would seem like We Work or a company like We Work is a really good solution, because it\u2019s aggregating the freelancers so that they have volume buying power.\n\nRichard Greenwald: I mean their business model is too new to see whether or not it has true lasting power. They\u2019re big, and they grew very quickly. They\u2019re valued about $10 billion right now. They\u2019re in 52 locations, 16 cities and growing. But what they\u2019re doing is providing a needed service to freelancers who don\u2019t want to just work in a desk in their bedroom. The older places, like the Starbucks and cafes, have changed, and they\u2019re not as welcoming anymore. So going to a place that has a social component and that has a reasonable space is useful. They\u2019ve tied a social network and a job board of sorts to that, and they\u2019ve encouraged freelancers to join together so they can bid for larger clients.\n\nPaul Solman: They also get volume discounts, because there are dozens or hundreds of people. For example, on healthcare\u2026\n\nRichard Greenwald: They do. But the real concern I would have is that if you have an economy that\u2019s leading towards more and more independent contractors, it puts large corporations into a very powerful position. If you\u2019re an independent contractor, and you think that you\u2019re worth more than they\u2019re paying you for a gig, you\u2019re not going to renegotiate it, because the price keeps going down, right? One of the possible outcomes is an effort to try to organize whether it\u2019s through a union or guild of some sort.\n\nWhen you go to We Work, these are white collar creative economy jobs, right? They don\u2019t see that they have much in common with fast food workers, the janitors, the day laborers. But in fact, the economic system they\u2019re operating in is the same. They\u2019re just higher up on their food chain. As more and more people enter that economy, the competition\u2019s going to be fierce. And the wage level is going to drop. Competition will force things down.\n\nThis is the new normal. It\u2019s going to only intensify and then the question is: What do you do? What is the political system\u2019s response to that? What\u2019s the economic system\u2019s response to it? Because right now, there\u2019s very little economic incentive or even social or moral incentive for corporations to continually hire, train and invest in full-time employees when they can outsource whole sectors of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More independent contractors put large corporations into a very powerful position.", "pubdate": 20151105, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "More independent contractors put large corporations into a very powerful position.", "title": "What does the future hold for workers in a freelance economy?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Media_South_Lake3.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/fate-workers-freelance-economy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "More independent contractors put large corporations into a very powerful position.", "title": "What does the future hold for workers in a freelance economy?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Media_South_Lake3.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Making Sen$e", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Making-Sene-with-Paul-Solman-121926457817681/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, freelance workers, Making Sen$e"}, "article_summary": "Editor\u2019s Note: In May, a report by the Government Accountability Office alerted us to a new reality: Contingent workers \u2014 freelancers, part-time workers, self-employed workers and the like \u2014 make up 40 percent of workforce.\nThey\u2019re working from gig to gig.\nBut in fact, the economic system they\u2019re operating in is the same.\nAnd it looks the percentage of contingent workers is going to increase in the next decade.\nSo we\u2019re in an economy right now where many young college graduates are going to wind up working for themselves."}
