Making a home among New York\u2019s queer underground, rubbing shoulders with Allen Ginsberg and John Cage, Russell, an avant-garde cellist, journeyed far from his Iowa home. But Iowa lingered in his music. \u201cI close my eyes and listen to hear the corn come out,\u201d are the words that open his posthumous album, \u201cLove Is Overtaking Me.\u201d The song\u2019s speaker is waiting in the fields for an illicit tryst.\n\nI stand among a transfixed crowd in Smokey Row, a coffeehouse in Oskaloosa, with people who must have attended school with Russell. We listen to Ted Cruz, who happily disdains the kind of trysts Russell enjoyed. Cruz wears a powder blue gingham shirt and cowboy boots. Today, more than usual, he delivers a gleeful sneer.\n\n\u201cGod bless the great state of Iowa,\u201d says Cruz.\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d cries the man next to me, who wears a ball cap, jeans and a studded belt. Cruz, whose father is a baptist preacher, knows how to transform a political town hall into a religious revival. He modulates between breathy purrs and staccato exhortation. He deploys well-practiced pauses. He uses anaphora better than any other presidential candidate. Soon the crowd is punctuating his stump speech with amens and c\u2019mons and yeses.\n\nCruz is standing on a stage under a bright marquee with his name on it. Smokey Row\u2019s old-timey decorations\u2014sepia photos of vintage cars, an oversize Pepsi bottlecap, a sign for Kresge 5\u00a2 and 10\u00a2, the store that became Kmart\u2014match Cruz\u2019s folksy demeanor. The ceilings are high and the floors wood. Cruz makes a joke about how, when the pope was in town, Obama made things awkward by answering to His Holiness. The crowd is delighted.\n\nOther of Cruz\u2019s jokes have more sinister implications. He tells one where the punch line is about using pesticides on regulators, another about how, after his presidency, countless members of the media will have checked themselves into therapy. A favorite of his involves padlocking the IRS and relocating its employees to the southern border. \u201cThink about it, sir,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine you traveled thousands of miles in the blazing sun, you\u2019re swimming the Rio Grande, and the first thing you see is 90,000 IRS agents. You\u2019d turn around and go home, too!\u201d\n\nImagine it, indeed. One might pause to imagine the suffering endured by migrants under that sun, but Cruz has the crowd under his spell. These former neighbors and classmates of Arthur Russell burst again into cathartic laughter.\n\n2\n\nThirty miles north of Oskaloosa, a much quieter crowd listens to Marco Rubio. He speaks from a makeshift stage inside Brownells, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest supplier of gun parts. In 2012, after the Sandy Hook massacre, Brownells sold three-and-a-half years of ammunition for the AR-15\u2014the semi-automatic rifle used by Adam Lanza\u2014in three days.\n\nCEO Pete Brownell, introducing Rubio, tells us that the building we\u2019re in, a new facility, \u201cstands for support of firearm owners across the world.\u201d It is vast. We had to cross several hundred yards of cement to arrive at the event\u2019s scattering of folding chairs. Bobcats roam wide aisles stacked to the sky with inventory.\n\nBrownell gives the stage to Jack Whitver, the chairman of Rubio\u2019s Iowa campaign and a former star wide receiver for Iowa State University. He says, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for someone that can win, look to Marco Rubio.\u201d If Cruz exudes zealotry, Rubio\u2019s campaign sells pragmatism.\n\nRubio wears a blue campaign fleece over his white shirt and tie. He looks worn out. The crowd only applauds twice: once when Rubio mentions abolishing the Affordable Care Act, and once when he ends. But these aren\u2019t the same people who cheered for Cruz in Oskaloosa. A lot of the attendees here are dismayed with the state of the Republican Party. They especially dislike Donald Trump. They say that Trump is \u201ctoo aggressive,\u201d that \u201che\u2019s making things worse,\u201d that he \u201cseems a little far out.\u201d He embarrasses them. They tend to be upper-middle-class and, against Trump, they practice what we might call Republican respectability politics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Iowa, Cruz draws the zealots; Rubio, the disillusioned Trump-haters; and Trump, well, people love a celebrity", "title": "\u201cI\u2019ve had my fill of f**king intellectuals\u201d: Why the non-intellectual candidate fills this Trump supporter with hope", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Iowa, Cruz draws the zealots; Rubio, the disillusioned Trump-haters; and Trump, well, people love a celebrity", "title": "\u201cI\u2019ve had my fill of f**king intellectuals\u201d: Why the non-intellectual candidate fills this Trump supporter with hope", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/26/ive_had_my_fill_of_fking_intellectuals_why_the_non_intellectual_candidate_fills_this_trump_supporter_with_hope/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/cruz_trump_rubio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Iowa, Cruz draws the zealots; Rubio, the disillusioned Trump-haters; and Trump, well, people love a celebrity", "title": "\u201cI\u2019ve had my fill of f**king intellectuals\u201d: Why the non-intellectual candidate fills this Trump supporter with hope", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/cruz_trump_rubio.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dan Sinykin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, aol_on, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Iowa, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If he hadn\u2019t died in 1992 from complications related to AIDS, Arthur Russell, the poet-exile of Oskaloosa, Iowa, would be 64.\nCruz wears a powder blue gingham shirt and cowboy boots.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, aol_on, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Iowa, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Elections News, Life News, Politics News1.\nRubio wears a blue campaign fleece over his white shirt and tie.\nBrownell gives the stage to Jack Whitver, the chairman of Rubio\u2019s Iowa campaign and a former star wide receiver for Iowa State University."}
