(T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images)\n\nWhen Jason Furman was a freshman at Harvard in the fall of 1988, the brainy New Yorker had already earned thousands of dollars a month juggling in Washington Square Park, traveled to Africa and was teaching himself Swahili. He was so advanced in economics that he was considering petitioning to skip a required class.\n\nHis freshman-year roommate was a bit intimidated by this. All he was planning to do was make it big in the movie business.\n\n\u201cJason was the first person that I met at Harvard, and I literally almost turned around and went home,\u201d Matt Damon, the Hollywood A-lister, said recently. \u201cI thought, \u2018I don\u2019t belong here.\u2019 He remains one of the smartest people that I\u2019ve come across.\u201d\n\nSince rooming with People\u2019s onetime \u201cSexiest Man Alive,\u201d Furman has ascended to a star position himself in the Hollywood for the more statistically inclined: Washington.\n\nThe 43-year-old economist, who as the chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers seems to relish a day spent describing \u201cprincipal component analysis\u201d to a befuddled White House press corps, has long been the ultimate wonk for the nation\u2019s capital. His success in the Obama administration, ascending to the chief economist job in August, is a testament to how Washington celebrates nerds \u2014 and a lesson in what the president wants from his closest advisers.\n\nIn his White House role, in front of the television cameras, Furman plays a combination of offense and defense. He appeared during the government shutdown to explain why it was bad for the economy, taking a bit of pleasure in referencing the \u201cmathematical derivations of all of this.\u201d Last week, after budget analysts unexpectedly warned that the Affordable Care Act could lead millions of workers to quit their jobs or cut back on hours, he raced to brief the president and then to try to persuade reporters the analysis was being misinterpreted. \u201cNo surprise, Obama unleashed his economic nerd patrol to explain away the numbers,\u201d quipped Comedy Central\u2019s Stephen Colbert.\n\nBut behind the scenes, in many appearances around town, Furman has been making a deeply researched case for why the nation\u2019s safety net has achieved wonders at reducing poverty in the 50 years since Lyndon B. Johnson declared a \u201cwar on poverty.\u201d At the same time, he argues that it\u2019s time to focus on making changes in our economy so there are fewer poor people to begin with. It is the argument driving a big part of Obama\u2019s second-term agenda.\n\nA wonk from the start\n\nLike many Washington imports, Furman has never given up his New York City roots and the sense that, one day, he\u2019s going to move back. His father, Jay, made millions in real estate \u2014 but only after getting his law degree and partially pursuing a doctorate in economics. His mother, Gail, is a psychologist and social activist.\n\n\u201cYou combine the two,\u201d said his brother Jesse, a federal judge in Manhattan, \u201cand it\u2019s not terribly shocking to see him end up where he is.\u201d\n\nAs a child, Furman displayed all the signs of the prototypical wonk. At 11, he created a fake stock portfolio and tracked prices in the Wall Street Journal. At 13, he began reading the Economist. He volunteered for the Walter Mondale campaign in the ninth grade.\n\nFurman attended Dalton, a tony private school where most of the families lived uptown. But the Furmans lived in Greenwich Village, where Jason could pursue more eclectic interests. Under the tutelage of some of the neighborhood\u2019s best street performers, Furman learned to be a master juggler, sometimes tossing six balls at a time or burning torches. He\u2019d juggle on a unicycle and even indulged a bit of fire eating. It all had an economic rationale \u2014 he could earn $30 to $100 a show (inflation adjusted, as he\u2019d surely insist, that\u2019s $60 to $210) \u2014 and his parents\u2019 blessing.\n\n\u201cI remember my parents being pretty supportive of the whole juggling thing even if it involved juggling rusty sickles,\u201d Jesse Furman said.\n\nFurman arrived at Harvard intent on studying math or perhaps science. Over occasional shots of bad vodka, he would hang out with Damon and Damon\u2019s friend Ben Affleck, a year younger and still in high school. \u201cWe know where each other\u2019s skeletons are buried,\u201d Damon said, \u201cbut they\u2019re not too terrible.\u201d\n\nNot terrible, no, but a little embarrassing, for their dorm in Matthews Hall had no shortage of 18-year-old ego. When they met, Damon told Furman he would likely be leaving Harvard later in their freshman year to star in a major Hollywood film. And when Furman came back from an economics class with a grade of 97 on a test, Damon joked, \u201cYou\u2019re not so smart after all.\u201d Actually, Furman replied, he didn\u2019t miss anything. His score was reduced so that everyone else\u2019s seemed better by comparison. \u201cI was just ruining the curve.\u201d\n\nIn college, Furman moved away from the theory of math and toward the real-world applications of economics. He set out on an academic track, going to the London School of Economics and then returning to Harvard for his PhD.\n\nIn 1996, a Harvard professor suggested to Joe Stiglitz, then President Clinton\u2019s chairman for the Council on Economic Advisers, or CEA, that Furman come to Washington for a stint as a staff economist. The grad student had a unique incentive: He was in love with a Harvard Law student named Eve Gerber, who was coming down to join Clinton\u2019s reelection campaign and had helped revive Furman\u2019s interest in politics. \u201cI would have followed her anywhere,\u201d he told a Senate committee last year at his confirmation hearing, his wife, a writer, sitting behind him.\n\nAt the Clinton White House, Furman eventually joined the National Economic Council, where strategists aim to turn economic ideas into politically winning proposals.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I was struck by when I first met with Jason, and continue to be struck by, was that there are a certain number of people who are first-rate analytically, like economics professors at top schools,\u201d said Larry Summers, Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary. \u201cAnd then there are a certain number of people who are very shrewd about Washington. Jason is [just] about unique in being both.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the Clinton administration, Furman joined the Al Gore campaign as economic policy director, ultimately wrapping up that disappointing chapter of his life with a statistical analysis of hanging chad. He went back to Harvard to finish his doctorate. He felt he needed to spend a decade in academia and develop those credentials as a scholar. He got his PhD, and soon enough calls came to join the 2004 presidential campaign \u2014 first Wesley Clark\u2019s and then John Kerry\u2019s \u2014 and he couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nAfter the Kerry campaign, Furman joined the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and continued to fight against George W. Bush \u2014 this time arguing against the president\u2019s plans to partially privatize Social Security, which ultimately failed.\n\n\u201cI remember him wandering around with this laptop at the Center on Budget,\u201d said David Kamin, a research assistant whom Furman later recruited to the White House. \u201cIt sort of taught me the power [of] a nerdy guy wielding a laptop.\u201d\n\nPutting his knowledge to use\n\nFurman is used to being that data-driven guy, using an Excel spreadsheet as a weapon. So years after he caused problems for Bush, Furman, now CEA chairman, immediately recognized the problems his own boss could face when a study arrived a week before last month\u2019s State of the Union that threatened to generate headlines contradicting one of Obama\u2019s major second-term claims.\n\nThe president had suggested that the odds of Americans rising up the economic ladder were declining \u2014 calling it \u201ca fundamental threat to the American Dream.\u201d The new study showed that mobility was low but had been flat for 50 years.\n\nThe problem was that it wasn\u2019t Republicans behind the analysis but top economists such as Harvard economist Raj Chetty, whom Obama had met with and trusted. Sensing a potential problem, Furman worked behind the scenes to convey the White House\u2019s position to reporters the day before the study came out.\n\nThen he co-authored a memo to the president explaining that the study confirmed the essence of what the president was saying \u2014 that the negative consequences of being born to a poor family rather than a wealthy one were growing \u2014 even if it showed that it didn\u2019t make it less likely that any given poor child would ultimately be able to climb the income ladder.\n\n\u201cIt was a classic Jason Furman moment,\u201d said Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council. Furman knew the study was coming out and was \u201csavvy enough to know, if misinterpreted, it would be used against the president.\u201d\n\nFurman declined to comment on the record for this story. About two dozen current and former colleagues and others close to him were interviewed, some speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private moments.\n\nObama aides say one reason Furman has prospered in the White House is that he does something that the president looks for in his advisers: He concentrates mainly on his area of expertise.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of people who work in the White House are amateur legislative and communications strategists, and the president\u2019s someone who believes people should have a role and swim in their lane,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser. \u201cAnd while Jason has a good sense of those things, he focuses his advice to the president on the core economic issues.\u201d\n\n\u2018An economist all the time\u2019\n\nFurman has never had the personal relationship with Obama that some of the president\u2019s longest-serving advisers have, nor does he have the back-slapping rapport that aides who play basketball or golf with the president enjoy. But for someone who\u2019s often been criticized for being a little bit too much of an egghead himself, Obama has reserved a special place for the small number of advisers who are even wonkier than he is.\n\nIn one of Obama\u2019s maiden voyages on Air Force One, the president was asked which newspaper and magazine subscriptions he wanted on the plane. \u201cFurman\u2019s going to want to get Econometrics Daily,\u201d he replied. Four years later, at an inaugural ball, the president told his soon-to-be CEA chairman, \u201cYou dance well for an economist.\u201d\n\nIf he minds being typecast as a bit of a professional nerd, Furman hasn\u2019t shown it. He would have his assistant schedule time on his calendar so he could see, with Harvard professor and former administration official Cass Sunstein, almost every sci-fi and time-travel film that came out. He drops oft-quoted maxims like, \u201cIf you never miss a plane, you\u2019re arriving too early\u201d \u2014 a commentary on the fact that passengers should seek to minimize the amount of time waiting for takeoff. He has strong feelings on statistical software, showing a keen preference for Matlab over Stata.\n\nIn a discussion with his wife over whether he should chop firewood in the backyard of their Northwest Washington home, he argued that it wasn\u2019t his comparative advantage, and he\u2019d be better off outsourcing the task. His wife reminded him that, even if it makes most sense in an economics textbook, it\u2019s better sometimes just to do it yourself.\n\nEven his kids \u2013 Henry, 6, and Louisa, 5 \u2014 have fallen victim to his hyper-rational mind. In hopes of giving them a good scientific education, Furman told his children several years ago there\u2019s no such thing as fish. How could that be? It's actually true, because \u201cfish,\u201d as we think of them, don\u2019t actually have a common ancestor, and so they are not considered by scientists to be a cohesive biological unit.\n\nBut his kids weren\u2019t buying it, and a trip to an aquarium was all they needed to disprove their dad. It\u2019s been a source of perpetual teasing ever since. (A recent juggling performance involving apples and an egg at a school talent show, to howls from the other kids, may have won some points back in his favor.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always puzzled by these economists who are economists on the job and go home and are not economists anymore,\u201d said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cHe\u2019s an economist all the time.\u201d\n\nFurman, a member of the team that helped shape the Affordable Care Act, used his data savvy to begin his own personal health reform journey. Long hours, plentiful sweets and a slow metabolism had conspired to expand his girth over the years, and he had struggled to shed the pounds. Zeke Emanuel, a former White House health adviser, told him that he was the most unhealthy eater he had ever seen.\n\nAt the suggestion of his wife, Furman went on what she dubbed a \u201cdata diet,\u201d tracking every thing he eats on his iPhone and measuring every step he takes with an electronic pedometer. He dumped the data into a spreadsheet and calculated moving averages because, as he has told colleagues, recording his weight and calories every day can produce \u201cnoisy\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d data.\n\nHe dropped 50 pounds, and his colleagues have begun to compare his physique to that of a character in Mad Men. The president, a fitness addict himself, has also taken notice, remarking on how skinny he\u2019s gotten.\n\nA change in focus\n\nWhen rumors swirled last year that Obama would tap Furman as his top economist, something odd happened: Some on the left were angry, and some on the right were elated.\n\nAn activist liberal group blasted out a news release: \u201cThe Top 5 Reasons Jason Furman Shouldn\u2019t Be Obama\u2019s Top Economic Adviser.\u201d Greg Mankiw, a former professor of Furman\u2019s at Harvard who was CEA chairman under George W. Bush and an adviser to Mitt Romney, wrote: \u201cJason is smart, knowledgeable, and sensible.\u201d\n\nThe whiplash response came because Furman embraces a brand of Democratic economic thinking that stresses what\u2019s feasible over what\u2019s theoretical \u2014 and often involves compromises that frustrate the liberal wing of the party. He has drawn particular criticism for his advocacy of a cut in corporate tax rates and his argument that, by providing low-cost goods, Wal-Mart provides an important benefit for society.\n\nStill, some initial skeptics have come to value his role in the White House, saying he has been a strong advocate for using government policy to reduce poverty and inequality.\n\nJudith Conti, the federal advocacy coordinator for the National Employment Law Project, said that a number of people in the liberal community weren\u2019t quite sure about his \u201cbona fides.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI see Jason as one of the most progressive voices for economic justice in that White House.\u201d\n\nIn the first term, Furman focused on spending to help the economy, the Affordable Care Act and more generous tax credits for the poor and working class. Now he is shifting focus, saying it\u2019s time to defend those gains and make progress in new areas.\n\nIt is a wonky argument, but it also explains Obama\u2019s second-term economic policy, with his aggressive advocacy of a hike in the minimum wage and an expansion of education. And wherever Furman goes, the president\u2019s top economist tries to make this an urgent case.\n\nAt an event late last month in Washington, Furman displayed a chart showing how food stamps and other social programs had lowered poverty dramatically over the past half century. This was a big success, he said.\n\nBut the graph also showed that the economy itself had done nothing for the poor: Only government dollars had. Here he stressed that the economy needs to work better, so people can enjoy higher incomes without relying on the government\u2019s assistance.\n\n\u201cWhen a few of you are here 50 years from now to talk about the 100th anniversary of the War on Poverty, if they show a graph that looks a lot like that,\u201d Furman told the crowd, \u201c. . . we will have really failed as an economy and as a society.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economist and chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers shows how Washington celebrates nerds.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zgoldfarb", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The economist and chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers shows how Washington celebrates nerds.", "title": "Jason Furman is the biggest nerd in the White House.
