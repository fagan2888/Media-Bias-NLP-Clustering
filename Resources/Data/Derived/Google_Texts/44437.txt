Appearing on “Hannity” Monday night, Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul added his two cents on the recently-unearthed comments by MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, telling Sean Hannity the “deceptive and deceitful” actions by the economist and others who helped craft Obamacare are a “disgrace.”

The Kentucky Senator also told the host he plans to ask for an investigation from the investigator general and “ask that he return his pay” based on his aforementioned deceptive and deceitful behavior.
