Only about 3 percent of consumers actually switch banks, even though far more consumers are unhappy with their financial institution, according to a Javelin Strategy and Research report.\n\nA fifth of consumers with checking accounts would like to switch, found according to a survey last year by Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.\n\nSixty-three percent said they hadn\u2019t made the move because it was too much trouble to transfer their account from one bank to another, and 37 percent said the process takes too long. Twenty-eight percent said they didn\u2019t want to pay any fees to transfer their own money.\n\n\u201cSome banks will charge you $25 to move your own money and others will charge you if you close your account too soon,\u201d says Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union.\n\nAs a result, only about 3 percent of consumers actually switch banks, even though far more consumers are unhappy with their financial institution, according to a Javelin Strategy and Research report.\n\nWhile Consumers Union is now advocating for Congress to pass the Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act, which would prohibit various bank practices that make it difficult for consumers to transfer their money, Banks says that regardless of the law that in the meantime, \u201cYou should switch banks if you don\u2019t feel you are getting the service you want\u201d from your bank.\n\nRelated: 5 Years After the Crisis: What Banks Haven\u2019t Learned\n\nFollow these steps to say goodbye to your bank for good.\n\n1. Know when to move on. \u201cIf you see new fees that are not easily avoided, I would say it\u2019s time,\u201d says John Ulzheimer, a credit expert for SmartCredit.com. \u201cThat would apply to savings and checking, and you should apply that to credit cards as well.\u201d Other signs it\u2019s time to switch: your bank has a minimum balance requirement, poor customer service, or doesn\u2019t have the online or mobile banking features you\u2019d like. If you have good reasons to take your business elsewhere, don\u2019t let inertia take hold.\n\n2. See what other options are out there. Start with sites like Bankrate.com, FindaBetterBank.com, and SavingsAccounts.com, being sure to investigate online banks, which generally feature higher interest rates and will reimburse you your ATM fees.\n\nIn addition to looking at banks, see if there are any local credit unions that will fit your needs. Credit unions tend to have a more limited ATM network, but lower rates and fees and more personal customer service. \u201cFor a mortgage, a credit union is always going to be a better option than a bank,\u201d Ulzheimer says. \u201cThere are a lot of fees that you\u2019re not going to have to pay, and the interest rates will be competitive.\u201d\n\nRelated: Should You Choose a Community Bank?\n\nYou can search for community banks and credit unions at Kasasa and at creditunion.coop. Although credit unions are only open to people who are eligible, fields of membership have been expanded dramatically over the next decade or so. \u201cMany people might be eligible today that don\u2019t even realize it,\u201d says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\nOne must-have feature: federal deposit insurance, which protects accounts up to $250,000 in case of a bank failure.\n\n3. Compare your options. Ulzheimer suggests looking for a fee-free checking account with a fee-free debit card. Although that\u2019s getting harder; just 38 percent of banks offered free checking this year, down from 74 percent in 2009, according to a recent Bankrate report.\n\nOften you\u2019ll have to meet certain requirements in order to score free checking. If a bank account charges you for not staying above a minimum balance, the bank is essentially asking you to lock up part of your money. If you\u2019d rather have more flexibility, look for an account without a minimum deposit requirement.\n\nAlso consider whether the bank offers your particular needs, such as mobile capabilities or a large ATM network. For instance, an online bank isn\u2019t a good fit for someone who gets paid in cash, but might be perfect for someone paid by direct deposit who does all her banking by laptop and smartphone.\n\nFor savings, look for the best return available for the amount you have to deposit. It\u2019s also a good idea to get a savings account that allows you to have sub-accounts, so you can keep money for emergencies separate from money you are socking away for your next trip.\n\nRelated: The Sneaky Hidden Clause in Credit Card Agreements\n\n4. Give Your Bank One Last Chance. Visit your current bank, or call its customer service department to let the institution know that you\u2019re ready to cut ties. When you explain your reasons for cutting ties, your old bank may make you a counter offer that makes it worth staying.\n\nIf not, be sure to get detailed directions on how to end the relationship, so that you don\u2019t get hit with unexpected fees after you think you\u2019ve closed it.\n\n5. Open the new account. At the onset, you\u2019ll have to run both accounts in parallel as you gradually shift automatic deposits and payments from your old bank to your new one. This should take about two months, but you might want to run it a full quarter to make sure you\u2019ve got all transactions coming in and out.\n\nMove all your direct deposits to your new bank, and set up bill pay in your new account, so that all the bills you automatically pay get sent out from the new institution. Meanwhile, keep enough of a balance in your old account to fund any scheduled payments and checks remaining to be cashed.\n\n6. Cut ties for good. Once all the payments have been made and your migration is complete, ask your bank to cut you a check with the remaining funds. Then start thinking about what you\u2019re going to do with all the money you\u2019re saving by not paying unnecessary bank fees.\n\n6 COMMON BANK FEES\n\n\n\nMonthly maintenance fee on checking accounts . The average monthly fee for a checking account is $12.43, or almost $150 per year, according to an analysis in August by MoneyRates.com.\n\n.
