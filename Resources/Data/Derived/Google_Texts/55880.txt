Will Rick Santorum run for president again? The former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania doesn’t waste time denying his interest.

In between campaigning for fellow Republicans in the midterm elections, Santorum stopped Friday in Washington, D.C., to speak at The Heritage Foundation’s semiannual President’s Club meeting. Afterward, in an exclusive interview with The Daily Signal, Santorum discussed the state of religious liberty in America and the tension between some LGBT activists and those with deeply held religious beliefs.

“We need to continue to fight, and in fact to push back the other way,” Santorum said. “We’ve been too silent too long and we need to say, ‘Look, all of these thoughts are proper in the public square.’ We need real freedom in this country, not government-dictated adherence to a set of principles.”

He also didn’t mind being put on the hot seat about whether he’s considering another race for the White House.

“I’ve been very, very clear in our interest in looking at this again,” Santorum said. “We think we have something very unique to say.”

Steve Weyrich, manager of news video for The Daily Signal, co-produced the video.
