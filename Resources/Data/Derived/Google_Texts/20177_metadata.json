Officials said they do not yet have a reimbursement estimate for Anthem.\n\nBoth insurers will be required to report to DMHC the final number of enrollees who are reimbursed and the total amount. State officials said consumers should contact the insurers if they have questions or think they should receive reimbursement.\n\nAccording to the Times, DMHC is conducting a new survey of the insurers' provider networks to determine whether issues have been corrected.\n\nInsurers' Response\n\nAnthem and Blue Shield both acknowledged mistakes were made as they prepared their policies for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnthem spokesperson Darrel Ng said, \"During this time of unprecedented change and despite Anthem's continual efforts to improve the accuracy of the system, Anthem's provider directory inadvertently listed some providers,\" noting, \"In the last two years, Anthem has spent more than $4 million improving the provider directory to make it more user-friendly and to improve the accuracy of the data.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Shield in a statement said it \"believes this agreement is in the best interest of our members. The settlement addresses past issues raised in 2014, and our members should not be concerned about their current plan or its networks\" (Terhune, Los Angeles Times, 11/3).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yesterday, the California Department of Managed Health Care announced that it has fined Blue Shield of California and Anthem Blue Cross $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, over inaccurate provider directories for their plans sold through Covered California. <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Yesterday, the California Department of Managed Health Care announced that it has fined Blue Shield of California and Anthem Blue Cross $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, over inaccurate provider\u2026", "title": "Anthem, Blue Shield Fined Over Misleading Provider Directories", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/morning-breakout/dmhc-fines-anthem-blue-shield-over-misleading-provider-directories/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-11-04T06:07:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T06:07:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Anthem, Blue Shield Fined Over Misleading Provider DirectoriesOn Tuesday, the California Department of Managed Health Care announced that it has fined Blue Shield of California and Anthem Blue Cross over inaccurate provider directories for their plans sold through Covered California, the Los Angeles Times reports.\nAccording to the Times, Blue Shield already has reimbursed more than $38 million to consumers who had been charged out-of-network costs.\nMeanwhile, Blue Shield in a statement said it \"believes this agreement is in the best interest of our members.\nState officials said that Blue Shield faced a higher fine because it was less cooperative with regulators.\nInsurers' ResponseAnthem and Blue Shield both acknowledged mistakes were made as they prepared their policies for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act."}
