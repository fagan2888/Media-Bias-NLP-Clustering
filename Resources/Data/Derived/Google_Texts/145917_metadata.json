That has puzzled some of the top scholars, especially in light of reports from liberal, nonpartisan, and conservative organizations that have all shown that the country has a surplus\u2013and not a shortage\u2013of American high-tech workers.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, a Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) report found that, from 2007-2012, \u201cthe number of new immigrants with STEM degrees admitted each year [was] by itself higher than the total growth in STEM employment.\u201d That report was \u201cconsistent with research from Georgetown University, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the Rand Corporation, the Urban Institute, and the National Research Council, which have also found no evidence that America has a shortage of high-tech workers.\u201d\n\nIn addition, four nonpartisan scholars have also debunked the notion that there is a shortage of STEM workers. Ron Hira, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, \u201csaid there are 50% more graduates than job openings in the STEM fields.\u201d He has also repeatedly emphasized that the IT sector has been \u201can area of social mobility,\u201d and increasing the number of visas without questions takes jobs away from American workers and lowers the wages of those who do find STEM jobs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got people who come from working-class backgrounds who go into these sectors,\u201d Hira recently said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting into the middle class and the professional class, and that\u2019s being cut off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After the Census Bureau reported on Thursday that", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "After the Census Bureau reported on Thursday that", "title": "CBS: Census Data Show U.S. Doesn't Have Shortage of STEM Workers - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/07/12/High-Tech-Worker-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/12/cbs-census-data-show-us-doesn-t-have-shortage-of-stem-workers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After the Census Bureau reported on Thursday that", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/07/12/High-Tech-Worker-AP.jpg", "title": "CBS: Census Data Show U.S. Doesn't Have Shortage of STEM Workers - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CBS, Mainstream Media, Mark Zuckerberg,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Mark Zuckerberg", "published_time": "2014-07-12T12:24:53-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFinally, the mainstream media is realizing that the notion that there is a shortage of American high-tech workers is a myth.\nThat has puzzled some of the top scholars, especially in light of reports from liberal, nonpartisan, and conservative organizations that have all shown that the country has a surplus\u2013and not a shortage\u2013of American high-tech workers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting into the middle class and the professional class, and that\u2019s being cut off.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got people who come from working-class backgrounds who go into these sectors,\u201d Hira recently said.\nRon Hira, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, \u201csaid there are 50% more graduates than job openings in the STEM fields.\u201d He has also repeatedly emphasized that the IT sector has been \u201can area of social mobility,\u201d and increasing the number of visas without questions takes jobs away from American workers and lowers the wages of those who do find STEM jobs."}
