As the Senate moves to debate whether to end federal subsidies for the abortion industry leader, Susan Collins wonders where women will go to get \u201cwomen\u2019s health services\u201d:\n\nRepublicans have seized on a series of controversial undercover videos that show officials at the abortion rights organization discussing the price of fetal tissue to argue that all federal funding should be cut off from Planned Parenthood. But even members of McConnell\u2019s party have their doubts that community health centers and other public health groups could fill the gap. \u201cThe problem is, in my state and many others, Planned Parenthood is the primary provider of women\u2019s health services in certain parts of my state,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who said she is likely to vote against the bill. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know how you would ensure that all of the patients of Planned Parenthood could be absorbed by alternative care providers.\u201d\n\nThe Hill also mentions a study from George Washington University that raised the same question three years ago, when Republicans pushed to defund Planned Parenthood:\n\nA 2012 study by George Washington University professors examined five counties in Texas and found that Planned Parenthood was the \u201cdominant\u201d provider in those areas. The study found that other clinics would need to increase their capacity by \u201ctwo- to five-fold\u201d in order to handle Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients, but were already at or close to capacity.\n\nConsider this another version of static tax analysis, with a heaping helping of ignoring the obvious. The federal government spends over $280 million on Title X family planning services alone each year, plus the broader range of health care for the poor that comes through Medicaid, which ranks in the billions. Those funds won\u2019t disappear; the only change in the upcoming Senate bill will be to exclude Planned Parenthood from receiving those funds. The government will still spend the money.\n\nWhen markets have demand and resources to meet it, then suppliers will emerge. In fact, it may be that federal support and subsidies for Planned Parenthood has had the effect of squeezing smaller providers out the markets where they dominate. Furthermore, the passage of ObamaCare was supposed to offer even broader choices by forcing everyone either into a comprehensive insurance plan or onto Medicaid. Women, especially poorer women, shouldn\u2019t have only an abortion mill for their health care, and the government shouldn\u2019t subsidize them and crowd out other potential providers.\n\nThe GAO calls shenanigans on this argument even from a static perspective:\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, the roughly 1,200 community health centers in the U.S. serve over 21 million people per year. Planned Parenthood, by contrast, serves 2.7 million people. \u201cThese are comprehensive health care centers, something that Planned Parenthood is not,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nHaving access to hundreds of millions more in government contracts with the absence of Planned Parenthood on the contractor list will have other centers looking to fill the gap. The demand to provide subsidies for Planned Parenthood is another form of corporate welfare, only for abortionists in order to render their other operations more economically viable.\n\nNo corporation has an entitlement to federal subsidies. This particular organization\u2019s business practices make it unfit for taxpayer support. Let them survive on their own resources, and focus public support to those who truly focus on health rather than the destruction of human life.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Static thinking.", "title": "Congress wonders: Can the nation survive without Planned Parenthood?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/08/01/congress-wonders-can-the-nation-survive-without-planned-parenthood/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T21:31:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-02T02:17:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Susan Collins, Title X,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b06\"", "article_summary": "Congress wonders: Can the nation survive without Planned Parenthood?\nThose funds won\u2019t disappear; the only change in the upcoming Senate bill will be to exclude Planned Parenthood from receiving those funds.\n\u201cThese are comprehensive health care centers, something that Planned Parenthood is not,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for Susan B.
