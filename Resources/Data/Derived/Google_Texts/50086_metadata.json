But Connadio said the state has not yet implemented the 24-hour exemption due to \u201ctechnical issues.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit the county has authorized seeks reimbursement back to Jan. 1 for its cost for the medical care for inmates that should have been covered by Medicaid under the 24-hour exemption.\n\nHudson County Department of Corrections Director Oscar Aviles backs the lawsuit. He said the corrections department is asking for $1.9 million in the 2014 county budget for hospital care for inmates. He said implementation of the 24-hour exemption would shave more than $1 million from that amount.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to force the state to reimburse the county for something being funded by the federal government, why not?\u201d Aviles said. \u201cI think that makes economic sense for the county.\u201d\n\nHudson County Freeholder Bill O\u2019Dea said the counsel to the board of freeholders is preparing the lawsuit and expects to file it by the end of this week.\n\n\u201cI sponsored the resolution because on Jan. 1 we should have started to get this reimbursement from the state,\u201d said O\u2019Dea. \u201cWhen we are dealing with a difficult budget, a million dollars is a lot of money and we can\u2019t wait for the state to get its act together.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere was no reply to an email seeking comment from the office of Gov. Chris Christie.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','bayonne','hudson-county','kearny'", "title": "Hudson County to sue state for Obamacare funds for inmate hospital care", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hudson County to sue state for Obamacare funds for inmate hospital care\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/03/hudson_county_to_sue_state_for_obama_care_reimbursement_money_for_hospital_care_for_jail_inmates.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/13314561-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12488714\", \"pub_date\": \"\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"bayonne\",\"hudson-county\",\"kearny\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/13314561-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The Hudson County Board of Freeholders has authorized a law suit against the state seeking reimbursement retroactively for the cost of long term hospital care for inmates as established under the Affordable Care Act but not yet implemented by the state."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, March 25, 2014,  5:15 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/hudson-county-jail-5ebcaf0c8b03f25b.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Hudson County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Hudson County Board of Freeholders has authorized a law suit against the state seeking reimbursement retroactively for the cost of long term hospital care for inmates as established under the Affordable Care Act but not yet implemented by the state.", "title": "Hudson County to sue state for Obamacare funds for inmate hospital care", "url": "http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/03/hudson_county_to_sue_state_for_obama_care_reimbursement_money_for_hospital_care_for_jail_inmates.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, March 25, 2014,  1:11 PM", "article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "The Hudson County Board of Freeholders has authorized a law suit against the state seeking reimbursement retroactively for the cost of long term hospital care for inmates as established under the Affordable Care Act but not yet implemented by the state."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5ab\"", "article_summary": "The Hudson County Board of Freeholders has authorized a lawsuit against the state, seeking reimbursement retroactively for the cost of long-term hospital care for inmates.\nHe said the corrections department is asking for $1.9 million in the 2014 county budget for hospital care for inmates.\nGenerally, no inmate in state prisons or county jails was eligible for Medicaid coverage for long-term hospital care until the Affordable Care Act established a \u201c24-hour exemption,\u201d said executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties John Connadio.\nHe said implementation of the 24-hour exemption would shave more than $1 million from that amount.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to force the state to reimburse the county for something being funded by the federal government, why not?\u201d Aviles said."}
