So now it is time to start thinking seriously about what a Trump presidency would mean. Anyone who cannot imagine relatively benign outcomes simply lacks imagination. Here are three paradigmatic scenarios viewed from the end of Trump\u2019s first term. The question for voters as they begin to weigh Mr. Trump as a general election candidate is how they view the relative probabilities of each.\n\n1. America made great again: Trump succeeds as figurehead and negotiator\n\nAs Donald Trump steamrolled his way to the Republican nomination and then the presidency, many wise men warned of the end of the republic. The truth has been less sensational but more surprising: the Donald has been a success.\n\nTrump\u2019s famous bark is much worse than his bite. Yes, his crudeness is excessive, and yes, his forays into racism are an unfortunate misstep in our country\u2019s long, slow struggle for meaningful equality. But, as the man himself says, lighten up! By leading Congress to build the Great Southern Wall and sharply restrict low-skilled immigration, Trump has restored a sense of national solidarity bigger than any racial differences. Just as restricted immigration from 1920-1965 strengthened America\u2019s sense of itself, assimilation in the 2020s and beyond will be about growing together. Cosmopolitan elites are disappointed America won\u2019t be all things to all people, but our newfound appreciation of American greatness is good news for ordinary working class people of all races.\n\nOn domestic policy, Trump has taught America the art of the deal. He scrambled seemingly immovable partisan lines of conflict and forced seemingly unattainable compromises. Obamacare is dead, long live Trumpcare! Hardly diametric opposites, of course, but Trump\u2019s version can adapt with support from both parties far better than its predecessor. We have an overhauled tax code, and if it doesn\u2019t solve our long-term fiscal problems, well, Mr. Trump never claimed to be a miracle worker. Reasonably balancing the needs of business and low-income households is nothing to sneeze at. Across the administrative state, Trump has used a light touch and left the details to an able crew of pro-market economists, with fine results.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy record has been the biggest surprise for the naysayers. He has substituted epithets for drone strikes wherever possible, and the sky hasn\u2019t fallen. Precisely because other world leaders judged him crazy, our allies have done more to provide for global defense and containment of ISIS\u2014just as Trump said they should. Trump\u2019s swaggering engagement with Putin and others has sustained widespread peace, at least for now.\n\nAs President Trump likes to frequently remind us, \u201cHaters gonna hate.\u201d And our dear, unconventional leader gives his detractors plenty to pick on. But as he launches his reelection campaign, it seems hard to believe that anyone can mount a serious challenge. It\u2019s morning in America again\u2014a Great, Huge morning, if we\u2019re being honest. Despite the smart set\u2019s lingering reservations, we shouldn\u2019t look a gift-horse\u2019s ass in the mouth.\n\n2. Congress made great again: Trump\u2019s failure and the return of America\u2019s first branch\n\nAs Donald Trump rolled to victory over what seemed to be the corpse of the old Republican Party, he promised that nothing would slow him down in his quest to remake the country: no party, no faction, no intransigent Congress of losers. As Trump\u2019s reelection bid is overshadowed by his impeachment trial, the dominant mood is, understandably, schadenfreude. But, more importantly, the resurgence of the GOP and of America\u2019s Congress as forces to be reckoned with should inspire a renewed appreciation for the genius of America\u2019s Constitution, which has proven far stronger than even Trump\u2019s braggadocio.\n\nFrom his Inauguration Day onward, Trump\u2019s willingness to flout the limits on executive power proved too brazen for even the notoriously divided Congress to ignore. Whereas Presidents Bush and Obama at least offered fig leafs for their executive power grabs, Trump thought that his unconventional base of support put him above all that.\n\nThe First Branch begged to differ. Partisan differences took a back seat to institutional prerogatives\u2014and, wonder of wonders, Congress rediscovered its spine, passing a bevy of laws over Trump\u2019s vetoes and thereby diminishing his ability to dictate the agenda. Members of both houses made it clear they were ready to meet unlawful actions with impeachment, and we will soon see whether they make good on that threat. Whatever the result, Trump is now a wounded animal.\n\nHistorians will rightly rank Trump among the worst of America\u2019s presidents, alongside Andrew Johnson and John Tyler\u2014the only previous incumbent to try and fail to win his party\u2019s nomination, who will soon be glad for Trump\u2019s company. But as we look ahead to the 2020s, it is hard to avoid feeling that he has done America a great service by unjamming a stagnant government and providing an object lesson in the dangers of our past trajectory. Congress is great again, and that will last well beyond the failed reign of King Donald.\n\n3. Just sad: How Trump exploited American democracy\u2019s weaknesses\n\nSummer 2015 was an innocent time: many of us were outraged that media would give Donald Trump the time of day, so obvious was it that he was beneath even the degraded dignity of American politics. Now we know: if it screeds, it leads, and not only in irrelevant TV ratings. The country was hypnotized by Trump\u2019s showmanship, and he has been the ringmaster of American politics ever since. Nobody has yet discovered a way to dislodge him.\n\nDuring the Trump years, most of us have learned H.L. Mencken\u2019s definition of democracy by heart: \u201cDemocracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\u201d The humor has drained away as \u201cthe common people\u201d turn their anger toward a growing list of scapegoats when things go wrong. We all get it now, in both senses.\n\nOver and over again, Trump has proved capable of wielding his unconventional base of support to run over institutional barriers we previously thought sacrosanct. He has brought the trend of executive branch consolidation of power, which was clearly present during his predecessors\u2019 terms, to its logical end, and few of history\u2019s absolute monarchs could hold a candle to the power he now wields. Even as he has performed this evisceration of our constitutional structure, he has continued to nostalgically sing the praises of America\u2019s founders. Anybody who expected that he\u2019d eventually have to start making sense to retain his support has been sorely disappointed.\n\nAs Trump goads his supporters on in their occasional bursts of hatred and even violence, the Founders\u2019 fears that unmediated democracy would turn into mob rule ring in our ears. Any day now, our right to criticize the government may become just another parchment barrier to fall in the wake of Trump\u2019s overgrown FBI or his legions of unhinged supporters. Four years on, it isn\u2019t too late for America to wake up from this nightmare and return to its constitutional roots, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder to imagine how to do it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Donald Trump\u2019s historic Super Tuesday wins now in the books, it is getting very hard to see how anyone will stop him from winning the Republican nomination\u2014indeed, if he were a normal candidate who performed similarly, we would see him as the presumptive nominee.
