Jay Inslee today signed into law a bill that gives Washington State University the authority to create an independently accredited medical school in Spokane.\n\nHouse Bill 1559 amends a 98-year-old state statute that gave exclusive rights to provide medical education to the University of Washington. The bill was nearly unanimously approved March 25 by the Senate; that followed an 81-17 vote in the House earlier in the month.\n\nThe governor signed the bill during a ceremony in Olympia. The ceremony can be viewed at http://tvw.org/index.php?option=com_tvwliveplayer&eventID=2015040039.\n\n\u201cThanks to the Affordable Care Act, more people are now covered by health care,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that more people are covered \u2013 there are also more people in our state. We have depended on doctors trained in other states to come to Washington to practice. Yet the needs of our rural and underserved communities are not being met. In some areas, shortages are great.\n\n\u201cBy removing a historic prohibition, we allow Washington State University to begin planning for a new medical school,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will promote good family-wage jobs in the greater Spokane area.\u201d\n\nInslee was joined by WSU President Elson S. Floyd, who has worked to convince legislators of the need for a second publicly funded medical school in Washington.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a historic moment in the life of Washington State University,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cI deeply appreciate the support of Gov. Inslee, the Washington State Legislature, community leaders and the health care industry. We look forward to developing a medical school that will improve access to primary health care for Washingtonians and broaden opportunities for students seeking a medical education in state. It is an honor to serve the people of Washington.\u201d\n\nAlso at the signing ceremony was the bill\u2019s prime sponsor in the House, Rep. Marcus Riccelli (D-Spokane).\n\n\u201cWe have a growing need that isn\u2019t being met by today\u2019s medical education system, so the passage of this bill is a huge first step in addressing the physician shortage we see in rural and underserved communities,\u201d said Riccelli. \u201cA new generation of doctors will engage in cutting-edge community-based training to ensure Washington patients get the care they deserve.\u201d\n\nAn identical bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Michael Baumgartner (R-Spokane) and a bipartisan group of 17 colleagues.\n\n\u201cA new WSU medical school will help produce the doctors we need and will be an engine of economic growth creating thousands of jobs,\u201d said Baumgartner.\n\nBaumgartner and Riccelli worked closely with WSU administrators as they shepherded the bills through the legislative process.\n\n\u201cThis is an important validation of the long-term investment that WSU has made in the Spokane community,\u201d said WSU Spokane Chancellor Lisa Brown. \u201cOur full-service medical school will add to the great work that\u2019s already done by the colleges of Nursing and Pharmacy and the other allied health programs on our health sciences campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physician shortage grows every day. That is why there is urgency in addressing this problem and why we fully support WSU\u2019s effort to establish a medical school in Washington state,\u201d said Joseph Wilczek, retired CEO for the Franciscan Health System in Tacoma. \u201cWe look forward to the day we are training WSU medical students and hiring WSU medical school graduates.\u201d\n\nNext legislative phase underway\n\nNow that the medical school policy issue has been decided, attention has turned to the state budget. WSU has asked lawmakers for $2.5 million during the next two years to begin the accreditation process that could last as long as two years. Once preliminary accreditation is granted, the university can begin recruiting and accepting students. The goal is to admit the first WSU College of Medicine class to begin in August 2017.\n\nEditors:\n\nSeveral health care leaders in Washington have publicly expressed their support for a WSU medical school.
