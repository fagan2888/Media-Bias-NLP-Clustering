Burwell case was effectively the anti-healthcare forces\u2019 last real shot to undermine the law and take benefits from millions.\n\nB ut, skeptics might say, what about 2017? What about the not-at-all-fanciful possibility that, a year and a half from now, Americans will have elected a Republican president to work with a Republican Congress? It stands to reason that a GOP-dominated federal government might get to work dismantling the current American health care system.\n\nDemocrats believe the law is \u201chere to stay,\u201d however, because of the legislative process \u2013 Senate Dems would obviously filibuster any attempt to start taking benefits away from families. Unless GOP senators had 60 votes \u2013 an unlikely scenario \u2013 a Republican repeal plan would fail.\n\nUnless, that is, Republicans change the rules. Bloomberg Politics reported late last week:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Friday he\u2019s open to eliminating the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold if it helps Congress repeal Obamacare and enact \u201cfree-market oriented\u201d health care reforms. Appearing on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show, the former Florida governor was asked if he\u2019d support invoking the \u201cReid rule\u201d \u2013 also known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2013 to nix the legislative filibuster to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn fairness, the Florida Republican didn\u2019t explicitly endorse this path, but when pressed on the strategy, Bush told Hewitt, \u201cI might consider that.\u201d He added that if the GOP plan is strong enough, \u201cthen I would certainly consider that.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported over the weekend that Gov. Scott Walker (R) was even more enthusiastic about the strategy. Asked if he\u2019d call for the end of legislative filibusters in order to \u201crepeal Obamacare,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican replied, \u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d\n\nOf course, no matter what happens in next year\u2019s elections, neither Bush nor Walker would actually be a member of the Senate Republican caucus, so it really wouldn\u2019t be up to them to decide whether to do away with the filibuster altogether. It stands to reason that many GOP senators would question the value of such a plan, realizing that majorities come and go.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For some Republican leaders, there should apparently be two governing standards: an arduous one for Democrats, and an easier one for the GOP.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-walker-eye-new-nuclear-option", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "For some Republican leaders, there should apparently be two governing standards: an arduous one for Democrats, and an easier one for the GOP.", "title": "Bush, Walker eye new 'nuclear option'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-walker-eye-new-nuclear-option", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/gettyimages-477466452.jpg?itok=cU29j3_s", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-walker-eye-new-nuclear-option", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/gettyimages-477466452.jpg?itok=L3mcy3PF", "height": 553}, "title": "Bush, Walker eye new 'nuclear option'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For some Republican leaders, there should apparently be two governing standards: an arduous one for Democrats, and an easier one for the GOP."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-29T10:00:27-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Bush, Walker eye new 'nuclear option'", "tags": "affordable-care-act,election-2016,elections,health,health-care,health-care-reform,jeb-bush,obamacare,republicans,scott-walker,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "06/29/2015 10:00:27 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bush-walker-eye-new-nuclear-option"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "For some Republican leaders, there should apparently be two governing standards: an arduous one for Democrats, and an easier one for the GOP.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2016, Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Jeb Bush, Obamacare, Scott Walker"}, "article_summary": "Unless GOP senators had 60 votes \u2013 an unlikely scenario \u2013 a Republican repeal plan would fail.\nAppearing on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show, the former Florida governor was asked if he\u2019d support invoking the \u201cReid rule\u201d \u2013 also known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2013 to nix the legislative filibuster to replace the Affordable Care Act.\nIt stands to reason that a GOP-dominated federal government might get to work dismantling the current American health care system.\nAsked if he\u2019d call for the end of legislative filibusters in order to \u201crepeal Obamacare,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican replied, \u201cYes.\nIt stands to reason that many GOP senators would question the value of such a plan, realizing that majorities come and go."}
