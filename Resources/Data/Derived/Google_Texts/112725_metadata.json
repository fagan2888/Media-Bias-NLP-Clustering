As the 114th Congress begins, Michele Bachmann will no longer be a member of the House of Representatives, depriving the country of its foremost warrior against America-hating politicians, the totalitarian U.S. Census, and retardation-causing vaccines.\n\nSo it goes. Amid an investigation into her campaign finances, the Minnesota congresswoman opted not to seek a fifth term this year. And while she vows that she\u2019ll continue to play a role in America\u2019s political debate \u2014 as a conservative commentator or even a 2016 White House candidate \u2014 it\u2019s more likely than not that Bachmann\u2019s career as a public officeholder is finished.\n\nOf course, backbench representatives step down all the time, usually with nary a single valedictory piece from a national outlet. But over the course of her eight years in the House, Bachmann established herself as one of the most incendiary and demagogic Republicans on the national stage. Below, Salon remembers some of the moments that made Bachmann Bachmann.\n\nInvestigate \u201canti-American\u201d members of Congress\n\nFew Americans had any idea who Bachmann was until an October 2008 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball With Chris Matthews,\u201d during which she charged that then-Sen. and presidential candidate Barack Obama likely harbored \u201canti-American\u201d views. Channeling her inner Joseph McCarthy, the freshman congresswoman also called for the media to \u201clook at the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America?\u201d\n\nIs the census a Trojan horse for totalitarianism?\n\nIn 2009, as the federal government prepared to carry out its decennial census, Bachmann took to Fox News to attack the census, connecting it to the internment of Japanese-Americans in the Second World War.\n\n\u201cBetween 1942 and 1947, the data that was collected by the Census Bureau was handed over to the FBI and other organizations at the request of President Roosevelt, and that\u2019s how the Japanese were rounded up and put into internment camps. I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s what the administration is planning to do,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cBut I am saying that private personal information that was given to the Census Bureau in the 1940s was used against them to round them up in violation of their constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nLook at the camera, Michele!\n\nUnlike her first two terms in the House, when Democrats controlled the chamber, Bachmann entered her third term in 2011 as a member of a Republican majority. Emboldened by the victories of hard-right candidates, an assertive Tea Party challenged GOP graybeards, and in addition to the official Republican response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union, there was a Tea Party response, delivered by Bachmann. During her speech, Bachmann trained her focus on the camera recording her response for the Tea Party Express \u2014 not the camera recording her speech for the rest of the country.
