On Sunday, he also pulled in a reception for more than 40 yards with Robert Griffin III playing the position.\n\nJackson had four catches for 120 yards and a touchdown in the Washington Redskins\u2018 29-26 loss at Minnesota on Sunday, continuing to be the deep threat that the team sorely lacked when it added him as a free agent in the offseason.\n\nThe wide receiver caught a 45-yard pass in the first quarter, a 56-yard pass in the fourth quarter and also added a 13-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter.\n\nSEE ALSO: RG3 returns with mixed results in Redskins\u2019 loss to Vikings\n\nJackson has now had more than 100 receiving yards in five of the Redskins\u2018 nine games this season, including nine receptions of more than 40 yards and five of more than 50 yards.\n\nHe could have potentially had one more: Jackson was Griffin\u2019s intended target on the \u201cHail Mary\u201d attempt as time expired, but the pass fell incomplete.\n\n\u201cI mean, honestly, it\u2019s a heartbreaker situation,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe definitely felt good about coming into this game and winning it, but regardless, the same as any given Sunday, you still have to prepare and play 60 minutes. It was just one of the things that we didn\u2019t go wholehearted. It was definitely tough.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Teddy Bridgewater rallies Vikings past Redskins in second half\n\nRunning game back on track in loss\n\nRunning back Alfred Morris ran for two touchdowns, marking the first time since Week 2 he\u2019s had multiple rushing touchdowns in one game. The two touchdowns also pushed him past Earnest Byner and into seventh place for the most rushing touchdowns with the Redskins.\n\nAll told, the Redskins finished with 122 rushing yards, marking the first time they\u2019ve rushed for more than 100 yards in three consecutive games since last season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just taking it one game at a time, honestly, man,\u201d Morris said. \u201cJust trying to find ways to continue to get it going. We kind of got it going against Dallas [in the] second half and were able to get it going pretty much all-around this entire game. We\u2019ve just got to find ways to build on top of that.\u201d\n\nAnti-nickname protest draws thousands\n\nAccording to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, a protest organized at TCF Bank Stadium against the Redskins\u2018 nickname drew a police estimate of 3,200 people, with Minneapolis mayor Betsy Hodges at one point leading the crowd in a \u201cchange the name\u201d chant.\n\nMinneapolis has been the site of several anti-Redskins protests in recent years, including before the game last November at the now-demolished Metrodome. According to the newspaper, that rally only drew 700 protesters.\n\nThe University of Minnesota has objected to the use of the nickname and attempted to block it from being used in any fashion during the game, but lacked the legal authority to do so, the newspaper reported.\n\nReplay remains a challenge for Gruden\n\nJay Gruden fell to 0-for-6 this season in challenges when officials ruled that cornerback David Amerson did not intercept a pass from Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater with 2:18 remaining in the second quarter.\n\nBridgewater\u2019s pass, intended for wide receiver Cordarelle Patterson, overshot his target, and Amerson attempted to corral the pass and stay inbounds before he hit the ground.\n\nRoberts makes impact in return game\n\nWide receiver Andre Roberts returned a kickoff 45 yards in the third quarter, marking his longest kickoff return of the season and the longest he\u2019s had since a 47-yard return in 2010, his rookie season, when he played for Arizona.\n\nThat return set up a 7-play, 56-yard scoring drive for the Redskins, who took a 17-14 lead after a 13-yard touchdown reception by Jackson and an extra point from Kai Forbath.\n\nExtra points\n\nTight end Logan Paulsen left the game, but returned, after experiencing plantar fasciitis in his left foot. Two other players left the game, but returned: free safety Ryan Clark, who has been battling sprains in both ankles, as well as a torn biceps, as well as inside linebacker Keenan Robinson, who injured one of his shoulders. \u2026 Outside linebacker Trent Murphy, the Redskins\u2018 second-round draft pick in May, picked up his first sack when he dropped Bridgewater for a 9-yard loss with 3:31 remaining in the first quarter. \u2026 Strong safety Phillip Thomas, who was signed off the Redskins\u2018 practice squad on Saturday, made his debut in the second half and was limited to special teams. In his second year, Thomas missed all of his rookie season because of a Lisfranc sprain in his left foot and had not played in a regular-season game until Sunday. Defensive end Clifton Geathers, who played in the first six games but was inactive for the last two, was waived on Saturday to make room for Thomas. \u2026 Cousins was inactive for the first time in his two-plus seasons with the Redskins. Also inactive on Sunday were running back Silas Redd, right tackle Tyler Polumbus, wide receiver Aldrick Robinson, right guard Spencer Long, outside linebacker Jackson Jeffcoat and cornerback Greg Ducre. \u2026 Fullback Darrel Young and defensive end Jason Hatcher participated in the coin toss and were the designated game captains. \u2026 The Redskins and Vikings played for the fifth consecutive season, and a sixth remains possible: Washington\u2019s predetermined scheduling rotation has them playing on the road against the NFC North opponent with a similar finish in the standings next season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jackson has now had more than 100 receiving yards in five of the Redskins' nine games this season, including nine receptions of more than 40 yards and five of more than 50 yards.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jackson has now had more than 100 receiving yards in five of the Redskins\u2019 nine games this season, including nine receptions of more than 40 yards and five of more than 50 yards.", "title": "Redskins notes: DeSean Jackson continues run of big plays", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/2/redskins-notes-desean-jackson-continues-run-big-pl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/02/redskins-vikings-foot_lanc5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/02/redskins-vikings-foot_lanc5.jpg", "description": "Jackson has now had more than 100 receiving yards in five of the Redskins' nine games this season, including nine receptions of more than 40 yards and five of more than 50 yards.", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins notes: DeSean Jackson continues run of big plays"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Redskins, Jackson Jeffcoat, Minneapolis"}, "article_summary": "The two touchdowns also pushed him past Earnest Byner and into seventh place for the most rushing touchdowns with the Redskins.\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 DeSean Jackson had done it with Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy as his quarterback.\nHe could have potentially had one more: Jackson was Griffin\u2019s intended target on the \u201cHail Mary\u201d attempt as time expired, but the pass fell incomplete.\nOn Sunday, he also pulled in a reception for more than 40 yards with Robert Griffin III playing the position.\n\u2026 Fullback Darrel Young and defensive end Jason Hatcher participated in the coin toss and were the designated game captains."}
