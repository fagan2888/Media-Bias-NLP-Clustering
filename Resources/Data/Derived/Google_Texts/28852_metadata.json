It applies to individuals with adjusted gross incomes above $200,000 and joint returns with an AGI of more than $250,000. Capital gains on the sale of a primary home totaling less than $250,000 for an individual and $500,000 for joint filers are still exempted. But the Medicare tax has ruffled feathers even if it affects a small and affluent group of people and transactions.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s aware of it, and not everyone\u2019s happy with it,\u201d said Neil Sonenberg, a partner at Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company LLP. \u201cI think it negatively impacts the economy, to be honest. Also, it\u2019s supposed to fund Obamacare, which is already a major mess.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even get onto the site properly,\u201d he added.\n\nReal estate professionals are spared the pain, being exempt from the Medicare, net investment income and additional self-employment taxes on income from rental real estate. Of course, that\u2019s assuming they qualify. To do so, they must devote more than half of their professional time\u2014or 750 hours per year\u2014to real estate activities like managing, developing, operating and brokerage work. They must also \u201cmaterially participate\u201d in the rental real estate sector.\n\nThere are seven or eight thresholds that can determine material participation. One is spending more than 500 hours on a rental property or activity. Another is spending at least 125 hours on \u201cvery significant\u201d participation. A third criterion is that the individual spends more time than anyone else on the property or activity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Mr. Sonenberg of the qualifying process. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a phony or you\u2019ll get severely burnt. The exemption is not for hobbyists.\u201d\n\nBut despite the allure of evading the 3.8 percent tax, it\u2019s unclear what effect it will have on real estate transactions. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has an impact on real estate business decisions,\u201d Mr. Sonenberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s really felt it or focused on it,\u201d said Matthew Bonney, a partner at Citrin Cooperman.\n\nWhen a real estate professional\u2019s attention does shift to the tax\u2014or his exclusion from it\u2014the biggest change may have to do with the documentation required to stay in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s good graces. \u201cAnybody who does real estate thinks he\u2019ll qualify,\u201d said Mr. Bonney. \u201cAnd just telling the IRS you\u2019re a real estate professional ain\u2019t gonna cut it.\u201d\n\nOther real estate issues stemming from the tax affect triple-net leases, whose owners are unlikely to qualify as material participants. And real estate dynasties may be in for a surprise, since children who own property but don\u2019t actively manage it will have to pay up. Finally, sources said they\u2019d handled a rising tide of 1031 like kind exchanges, thanks in part to the 3.8 percent tax.\n\nWill the Medicare tax and its attendant exemptions become a long-term talking point in the industry? \u201cSome people say my crystal ball\u2019s cloudy, but I think [the tax is] here to stay,\u201d said Mr. Sonenberg. Other sources agreed, saying the tax should last until a return to Republican power in the White House.\n\nAs for the reaction to the changes, Ken Weissenberg, co-chair of the real estate services group atEisnerAmper LLP said, \u201cPeople haven\u2019t written the checks yet. When they do, you\u2019ll hear more fallout.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Billy Gray", "description": "Exempt: Real Estate Pros and the So-Called Medicare Tax", "og": {"site_name": "Commercial Observer", "description": "Somewhat lost in the welter of caterwauling and chaos surrounding the Affordable Care Act rollout was a 3.8 percent tax on certain investment income that included real estate and exempted qualified real estate professionals.
