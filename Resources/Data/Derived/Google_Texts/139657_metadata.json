Toomey is likely to face former Congressman Joe Sestak, who he defeated in 2010, or Katie McGinty, a former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and most recently chief of staff to Governor Tom Wolf.\n\nToomey is well known among pro-life advocates in Pennsylvania since his challenge to pro-abortion Senator Arlen Specter in the 2004 Republican primary. In that race, Toomey made the contrast between his and his opponent\u2019s position on abortion a focal point. He ultimately lost by less than 20,000 votes.\n\nIn his first term in the Senate, Toomey earned a 100% pro-life rating from the National Right to Life Committee. Key scored votes include limiting funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, blocking Obama abortion mandates, and repealing and blocking funding for Obamacare. He is also a cosponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would protect unborn babies 20 weeks and older from painful late abortions.\n\nBy contrast, both of Toomey\u2019s potential opponents support abortion on demand and oppose legal protection for unborn children. While serving in Congress, Joe Sestak earned a 0% rating from National Right to Life. He voted for Obamacare, continued federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and opposed the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which would have ensured parental notification when a minor crosses state lines seeking abortion.\n\nKatie McGinty is endorsed by EMILY\u2019s List, the radical pro-abortion PAC that only backs female Democratic candidates who support abortion without limits. As EMILY\u2019s List notes on their website, \u201cKatie is pro-choice, and supports Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nThe latest Franklin and Marshall poll shows Toomey holding solid leads over both pro-abortion Democrats. Even though he only defeated Sestak by two points in 2010, he leads by a 12 point margin in a rematch, 41%-29%. Against McGinty, Toomey leads by 7 points, 35%-28%.\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ\n\nThe Rothenburg and Gonzalez Political Report currently rates the Pennsylvania Senate race: Tilts Republican. Despite Toomey\u2019s current lead in the polls, Pennsylvania\u2019s trend toward Democrats in presidential election years is a cause for concern for his reelection prospects. A Republican presidential candidate has not won Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Toomey may likely have to rely on split-ticket voting to secure a second term in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats need five seats to retake the Senate in 2016. Besides Pennsylvania, many Democratic strategists view their best opportunities to be in Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. Republicans are working to defend those seats while building a firewall by flipping Sen. Michael Bennet\u2019s seat in Colorado and the open-seat in Nevada.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Life Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey Faces Tough Re-Election Bid Against Abortion Advocate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey kicked off his reelection bid this week in what many believe will be one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2016 cy", "title": "Pro-Life Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey Faces Tough Re-Election Bid Against Abortion Advocate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/09/16/pro-life-pennsylvania-senator-pat-toomey-faces-tough-re-election-bid-against-abortion-advocate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pattoomey.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "pro-life pennsylvania senator pat toomey faces tough re-election bid against abortion advocate", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95d7\"", "article_summary": "In his first term in the Senate, Toomey earned a 100% pro-life rating from the National Right to Life Committee.\nToomey is well known among pro-life advocates in Pennsylvania since his challenge to pro-abortion Senator Arlen Specter in the 2004 Republican primary.\nPennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey kicked off his reelection bid this week in what many believe will be one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2016 cycle.\nFollow @LifeNewsHQThe Rothenburg and Gonzalez Political Report currently rates the Pennsylvania Senate race: Tilts Republican.\nIn that race, Toomey made the contrast between his and his opponent\u2019s position on abortion a focal point."}
