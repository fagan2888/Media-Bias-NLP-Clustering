Wichita police are looking for a man who got away with cash after a Saturday night robbery at a north Wichita Dillons.

It happened at around 9 p.m. at the store located at 37th and Woodlawn.

Arriving officers spoke with an employee who told them a man entered the store, made a gesture indicating he had a gun and demanded money.

The robber fled in on foot after making off with an undisclosed amount of money. He was last seen climbing over a wall on the south side of the Dillon's property before being driven away in a white car eastbound towards Woodlawn.

No one was hurt.

The employee told police the suspect is a white or Hispanic man in his 20s, 5-foot-7, 140 pounds and wearing gray clothing.

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to call 911.
