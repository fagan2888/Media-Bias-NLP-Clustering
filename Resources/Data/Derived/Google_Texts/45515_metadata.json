The economy stinks. Q1 retail numbers were abysmal. Q1 GDP was -2.9%. The national debt continues to explode. Obamacare is forcing businesses to cut employee hours. Wages are stagnant while inflation moves higher.\n\nHowever, \u201cDon\u2019t fight the tape\u201d is one of the most famous Wall Street sayings, and that\u2019s the truth. When the market has momentum in a given direction, it is difficult to play the opposite side of that trade. Shorts can get wiped out when the market keeps moving higher. Longs can get slaughtered if the bears tear their eyes out.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s one- and three-year average total returns have been 14.2% and 13.1%. The S&P 500\u2019s one- and three-year average total returns have been 22.9% and 16.1%. These are pretty amazing returns, and if you think there\u2019s more to come \u2014 but want to hedge your bets somewhat \u2014 naked puts are for you.\n\nMy strategy: Sell naked puts against index ETFs for each of the three big indices. If the market moves higher, you\u2019ll have collected the premium and made some money without exposing yourself to the risk of intraday fluctuations. If the ETF gets put to you, you\u2019ve hedged your actual entry point thanks to the premium you\u2019ve collected. (Just remember, you have to have the funds available to purchase any ETFs should those funds get put to you.)\n\nTake a look.\n\nNext Page", "article_metadata": {"description": "Selling naked puts on the major indices' funds -- such as the QQQ, DIA and SPY ETF -- can help you enjoy the market's ride with less risk.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "InvestorPlace", "description": "Selling naked puts on the major indices' funds -- such as the QQQ, DIA and SPY ETF -- can help you enjoy the market's ride with less risk.", "title": "3 Naked Puts for a Puzzlingly Higher Market | InvestorPlace", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/big-question-630.jpg", "height": 427}, "updated_time": "2014-07-08T14:08:32-04:00", "url": "http://investorplace.com/2014/07/naked-puts-qqq-dia-spy-etf/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Selling naked puts on the major indices' funds -- such as the QQQ, DIA and SPY ETF -- can help you enjoy the market's ride with less risk.", "creator": "@InvestorPlace", "image": "http://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/big-question-630.jpg", "title": "3 Naked Puts for a Puzzlingly Higher Market | InvestorPlace", "site": "@InvestorPlace", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002035369734}, "yandex-verification": "7449d54f0a1869d7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/investorplace", "section": "Trading Advice", "published_time": "2014-07-08T08:45:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T14:08:32-04:00"}, "keywords": "markets, naked puts, SPY ETF, QQQ, DIA ETF", "google-site-verification": "5MtKaaO4K0OK-C2y-n9MKUc_WzF9GSkH0fLgruR0TKM", "pubdate": 20140708, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "markets, naked puts, spy etf, qqq, dia etf"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccef0\"", "article_summary": "My strategy: Sell naked puts against index ETFs for each of the three big indices.\nIf the market moves higher, you\u2019ll have collected the premium and made some money without exposing yourself to the risk of intraday fluctuations.\nThese are pretty amazing returns, and if you think there\u2019s more to come \u2014 but want to hedge your bets somewhat \u2014 naked puts are for you.\nIf the ETF gets put to you, you\u2019ve hedged your actual entry point thanks to the premium you\u2019ve collected.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s one- and three-year average total returns have been 14.2% and 13.1%."}
