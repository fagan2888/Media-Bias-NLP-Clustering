Vernon last weekend, for the annual Lincoln Day celebration hosted by the Lawrence County Republican Central Committee.\n\nThe event drew approximately 150 attendees who were treated to a catered meal, a silent auction, live entertainment and pro-party speeches from Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, U.S. Representative Billy Long and U.S. Senator Roy Blunt.\n\nLong humbly spoke at length about his recent absence from his job duties to be with his daughter, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. He thanked all those who had been praying for his family and assisting them in their journey, including Blunt. Following Long\u2019s personal testimonies, he touched on several governmental issues, most strongly the budget.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming out with our budget next week. It balances in eight years. The Democrats budget never ever balances. And that\u2019s job one for next week.\u201d\n\nBlunt, granted the lion\u2019s share of the time behind the podium, spoke for 20 minutes, touching on myriad issues, with Democrat shortcomings being the prevalent theme.\n\nBlunt pulled no punches, calling out the Democrats for unbalanced budgets, Iran missteps and the Affordable Care Act Blunt labeled \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\nBlunt continued his o n s l a u g h t , denigrat ing the absence of a balanced budget from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe law requires that we have a budget every year, the 15th of April we\u2019re supposed to have a budget \u2026 but for seven years the Senate has chosen not to have a budget. The Senate\u2019s chosen not to go on record,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cThe Harry Reid Senate has worked as far from the law as Barack Obama has worked from the Constitution. But it is a must pass for us \u2026 Have a budget. Have a budget that balances. We\u2019ve got to have a budget that 51 Republican Senators vote for and 218 Republican House members vote for because no Democrat will vote for a budget that balances in any foreseeable future. They just won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nBlunt\u2019s rail against Democrats was punctuated with audience laughter following his likening of Democrat voters to \u201cthe undead,\u201d more popularly known as zombies.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, Blunt was squarely back on point, demanding the return of his country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a country we need to take back,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cWe want our country back. We want the Constitution back. We want to be who we\u2019re supposed to be. We\u2019re not like just any other country in the world.\n\nBlunt added, \u201cThis is a great moment for us to get back to who we are supposed to be. In 2016 in our state, 2016 in our country, I can\u2019t think of a more pivotal time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://www.lawrencecountyrecord.com/news/article_71884860-d3cb-11e4-9140-0392719f64c3.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Lawrence County Record", "description": "Republican politicians and supporters alike, found their way to the MARC in Mt.
