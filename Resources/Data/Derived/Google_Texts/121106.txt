Meanwhile, Susana Martinez is totally crushing it in New Mexico

Joe Scarborough (I know, I know) wrote a column earlier this month noting that despite the public opinion woes of Congressional Republicans, many GOP governors are performing quite well and receiving stellar marks for their job performance. Much has been made of the party’s struggles with women and Latinos, so the glowing success of Gov. Susana Martinez in New Mexico merits some attention. According to the most recent statewide survey, Martinez earns an eye-popping 66 percent overall approval rating, including positive marks from 70 percent (!) of women. And since nearly half of the state’s population is comprised of Hispanics, it stands to reason that the governor is faring quite well among that demographic group, too (cross-tabs are unavailable). According to the poll, Martinez is extremely popular among Republicans, and gets thumbs-ups from roughly two-thirds of independents and almost half of self-identified Democrats. Heading into her 2014 re-election effort, Martinez is…well prepared:

Incumbent Republican Gov. Susana Martinez’s re-election campaign account has more than 20 times the amount in her Democratic opponent Gary King’s coffers. According to campaign finance reports filed with the Secretary of State’s Office on Tuesday, Martinez had more than $3,269,000 in the bank. King, who is the state’s attorney general, had $142,440. Martinez contributors included several top Republican figures in the country, which could be seen as an indication of her status as an emerging player in national GOP politics.

Martinez’s popularity has grated on Democrats for years. That frustration boiled over in an ugly way in 2011, when a liberal state legislator derisively referred to the governor as “the Mexican.”
