The public should know who the government is killing, and why it\u2019s killing them,\u201d Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director for the ACLU, told the Guardian.\n\nThe new lawsuit, reports Ackerman, describes how numerous agencies under Obama\u2019s authority\u2014including the State and Justice Departments, the Pentagon, as well as the CIA\u2014have been stonewalling the ACLU for nearly 18 months.\n\nWhile lawyers for the Obama administration have argued that national security prevents further disclosures and President Obama has said that internal changes have enhanced the safeguards surrounding the selection of targets and the execution of drone strikes, the ACLU argues the level of secrecy around a program of such profound importance is simply unacceptable in a representative democracy.\n\nJaffer told the Guardian there could be no \u201clegitimate justification\u201d for persistent official stonewalling on civilian casualties and the procedures by which people, including U.S. citizens, can find themselves on a secret government \u201ckill list.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe categorical secrecy surrounding the drone program doesn\u2019t serve any legitimate security interest,\u201d Jaffer told the Guardian. \u201cIt serves only to skew public debate, to obscure the human costs of the program, and to shield decision-makers from accountability.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Public should know who the government is killing, and why it\u2019s killing them,' says ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "'Public should know who the government is killing, and why it\u2019s killing them,' says ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer.", "title": "ACLU Targets Obama with New Lawsuit Over Drone Wars, 'Kill List'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/aclu-targets-obama-with-new-lawsuit-over-drone-wars-kill-list/203383/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kill_list.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Public should know who the government is killing, and why it\u2019s killing them,' says ACLU legal director Jameel Jaffer.", "title": "ACLU Targets Obama with New Lawsuit Over Drone Wars, 'Kill List'", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kill_list.jpg", "creator": "@jonqueally", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Obama", "published_time": "2015-03-16T08:19:37-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "ACLU Targets Obama with New Lawsuit Over Drone Wars, \u2018Kill List\u2019'Public should know who the government is killing, and why it\u2019s killing them,' says legal director Jameel Jaffer.\nThe public should know who the government is killing, and why it\u2019s killing them,\u201d Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director for the ACLU, told the Guardian.\nPresident Barack Obama working with senior staff on Air Force One in this file image.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union will file a new lawsuit against the Obama administration over continued secrecy surrounding its controversial use of armed drones to carry out lethal strikes and assassinations across the globe, the Guardian reports on Monday.\n\u201cIt serves only to skew public debate, to obscure the human costs of the program, and to shield decision-makers from accountability.\u201d"}
