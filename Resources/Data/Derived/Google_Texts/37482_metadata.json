The other top candidate dropped out of consideration, Benner said.\n\nIt\u2019s not a certainty that Nyquist will get the job, but Benner said: \u201cI am very hopeful we can put this together quickly.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are still working through all the logistics on this, in terms of how we get everything done and when.\u201d\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange in October 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. After a rocky rollout, the exchange has improved but still fallen short of enrollment goals.\n\nNyquist would be the fourth top executive at MNsure in about two years.\n\nExecutive Director April Todd-Malmlov resigned in a crisis atmosphere during December 2013 as MNsure struggled with a balky website and overwhelmed call center. She was succeeded by Scott Leitz, who ended his tenure as chief executive during calmer times in May 2015.\n\nSince then, Allison O\u2019Toole has served as interim chief executive. She did not seek the permanent job and will continue with MNsure during any transition period.\n\nAt Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth, Nyquist served as vice president of product management, and vice president of strategy and marketing. He worked in finance at Golden Valley-based General Mills.\n\nWith a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Harvard Business School, and a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Michigan, Nyquist also has worked as a freelance consultant in strategy and business development.\n\nMNsure launched its third open enrollment Sunday. The health exchange website has been stable, O\u2019Toole said, and the MNsure call center has fielded about 7,500 calls during its first three days of operation.\n\nMNsure did not release any enrollment figures Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAll of our metrics are showing great consumer interest,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cTraffic has been really good \u2014 a lot of accounts created, a lot of sessions.\u201d\n\nMinnesota has received about $189 million in federal grants to create MNsure, which Minnesotans can use to purchase individual health insurance from private companies and enroll in the Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare programs for people with low incomes. MNsure also is the new IT system for those public health insurance programs.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Rep. Greg Davids, R-Preston, released a letter he wrote to federal officials this week raising concerns about the operating budget at MNsure. Davids questioned whether MNsure has authority to use certain federal grant funds next year, and whether the lack of such funding would create a large hole in the exchange\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the indefinite reliance on federal funding that was originally scheduled to end almost a year ago,\u201d Davids wrote in a Nov. 3 letter to an official with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cIt seems unlikely that MNsure will ever be financially self-sustainable.\u201d\n\nMNsure spokesman Joe Campbell said the budget situation was being mischaracterized. The state\u2019s exchange previously applied for and received a \u201cno-cost extension\u201d so that existing grant funds to be used this year, Campbell said, adding that MNsure expects to have remaining funds at year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing to use these funds in accordance with federal guidance on allowable uses for remaining exchange funds,\u201d Campbell said in a statement. \u201cThis is not a new process and is something several states across the country continue to do to complete \u2026 exchange establishment activities.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Mark Nyquist would be health exchange's fourth top executive since 2013.", "title": "Former UnitedHealth executive is lone finalist for MNsure CEO", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/former-unitedhealth-executive-is-lone-finalist-for-mnsure-ceo/340460751/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Mark Nyquist would be health exchange's fourth top executive since 2013.", "title": "Former UnitedHealth executive is lone finalist for MNsure CEO", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/former-unitedhealth-executive-is-lone-finalist-for-mnsure-ceo/340460751/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Mark Nyquist would be health exchange's fourth top executive since 2013."}, "article_summary": "MNsure has named Twin Cities executive Mark Nyquist as the sole finalist for the job of chief executive at the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\nMNsure also is the new IT system for those public health insurance programs.\n\u201cWe are proposing to use these funds in accordance with federal guidance on allowable uses for remaining exchange funds,\u201d Campbell said in a statement.\nNyquist would be the fourth top executive at MNsure in about two years.\nThe health exchange website has been stable, O\u2019Toole said, and the MNsure call center has fielded about 7,500 calls during its first three days of operation."}
