Donald Trump heckled a reporter during a press conference Tuesday after he reportedly asked the Republican presidential front-runner to defend his harsh rhetoric on the campaign trail.

According to Time magazine’s Zeke Miller, NBC News reporter Peter Alexander asked Mr. Trump to elaborate on how parents should explain to their children some of the controversial language he’s used in the GOP race.

“Oh, you’re so politically correct. You’re so beautiful. Oh, look at you,” Mr. Trump taunted, according to a video clip obtained by The Daily Caller. “Oh, he’s so — oh, I know, you’ve never heard a little bad, a little off language.

“I know, you’re a perfect,” he continued. “Aren’t you perfect? Aren’t you just a perfect young man? Give me a break. You know what, it’s stuff like that that people in this country are tired of. OK? It’s stuff like that.”

This isn’t the first run-in Mr. Alexander has had with Mr. Trump. In late January, Mr. Trump repeatedly cut off Mr. Alexander as he tried to finish asking a question about the mogul’s past support for abortion, The New York Times reported.

“Excuse me, excuse me,” Mr. Trump said, talking over the reporter.

Later, when Mr. Alexander tried to ask again, Mr. Trump reportedly cut him off, saying, “Forget you.”
