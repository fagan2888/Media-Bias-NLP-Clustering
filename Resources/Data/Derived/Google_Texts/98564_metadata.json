We condemn both their actions and call out to everyone to help end this bloody conflict,\u201d the group said in a statement posted on the popular content sharing website Pastebin.\n\nAnonymous released a list of 22 Saudi and Syrian web domains that it would be launching attacks against, and vowed to add more targets in the coming days, according to its statement.\n\nThe first set of targets in Anonymous\u2019 crosshairs was a collection of websites belonging to the Saudi Arabian government and military, which has sided with America against Assad.\n\nThe hacking collective accused the Saudis of backing rebel fighters tied to the terror group al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cOppressed people of Syria you have our undivided attention,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFor the past couple of years your country has been the subject of attacks from enemies both foreign and domestic, from corrupted politicians clinging to power, to actual terrorists funded and backed by Saudi Arabia posing as peaceful protesters.\u201d\n\nWebsites purportedly belonging the Royal Saudi Army, the Saudi Intelligence Agency, and the Saudi Ministry of Interior were said to be inaccessible for a time on Sunday, according to a Twitter user named Anon First Response, who tweeted the attack in real time.\n\nSome of the websites could not be accessed at the time of this writing, while others appeared to be operating normally. The Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe group also vowed to go after corporations and governments that it claims have supported Assad\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cTogether we will fight back against the wrongdoings of the Assad regime,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhether it be in the field or in cyberspace we will do our best to fight back. We have launched multiple cyberattacks on corporations in support of the regime. Those in support of the regime will be targeted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, the people of this planet, have had it enough [sic],\u201d the statement said. \u201cStop the bloodshed, stop the violence, stop the hidden wars for control and resources or we will make you regret it.\u201d\n\nAnonymous tied the Syrian government\u2019s oppression to that of Saudi Arabia\u2019s, despite the latter country\u2019s support for deposing Assad.\n\n\u201cWe will no longer stand for this, neither the Saudi Arabian Government\u2019s interferance [sic] and their crude, barbaric way of treating their people, nor of Assad\u2019s current immoral and irresponsible agenda of killing citizens in cold blood,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe hackers vowed to continue their attacks in the weeks to come.\n\nAnonymous hinted in late August that it was gearing up to take action in Syria.\n\n\u201cFor far too long we have witnessed the barbaric, unjust, and brutal treatment of the Syrian people,\u201d the group said in a video statement posted August 28 on YouTube. \u201cIt is clear that whoever the citizens may rally behind, their safety and security is ultimately transient and not guaranteed.\u201d\n\nThe group promised to attack targets on both sides of the conflict.\n\n\u201cThe time has now come for us to take action,\u201d the group said, singling out both Assad and \u201copposition elements.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou now have the undivided attention of Anonymous,\u201d the group said. \u201cCease fire immediately and stop the violence towards the innocent or you will feel our wrath.\u201d\n\nAnonymous has attacked Saudi government sites in the past.\n\nThe Saudi Interior Minister in May admitted that hackers claiming association with Anonymous had successfully launched attacks on several websites.\n\nAssad told interviewer Charlie Rose on Sunday that he does not believe the United States will get involved in the conflict. He also \u201csuggested that there would be, among people that are aligned with him, some kind of retaliation if a strike was made,\u201d according to Rose, who discussed the interview with CBS News.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The hacking collective known as Anonymous claimed to have launched a cyberattack on the Syrian government and the Saudi Arabian government to punish both sides of the Syrian civil war for atrocities t", "title": "Anonymous Announces Hack Attack Against Syria, Saudi Arabia", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/anonymous-announces-hack-attack-against-syria-saudi-arabia/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/anonymous-facebook-AP-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The hacking collective known as Anonymous claimed to have launched a cyberattack on the Syrian gover", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/anonymous-facebook-AP-150x150.jpg", "title": "Anonymous Announces Hack Attack Against Syria, Saudi Arabia", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe81\"", "article_summary": "The Saudi Interior Minister in May admitted that hackers claiming association with Anonymous had successfully launched attacks on several websites.\nAnonymous said in a statement released on Sunday that the hack attack had been launched on behalf of the \u201cpeople of Syria,\u201d and it condemned both the Assad government and rebel fighters, which have received support from Saudi Arabia, for their violent acts.\nAnonymous released a list of 22 Saudi and Syrian web domains that it would be launching attacks against, and vowed to add more targets in the coming days, according to its statement.\nThe first set of targets in Anonymous\u2019 crosshairs was a collection of websites belonging to the Saudi Arabian government and military, which has sided with America against Assad.\nAnonymous hinted in late August that it was gearing up to take action in Syria."}
