It has sparked congressional investigations.\n\nThe capital area transit agency said it shut down service on the three lines that run from Northern Virginia to downtown Washington, D.C., to prevent a reoccurrence of the Jan. 12 incident.\n\n\"Please know that the actions taken this morning were with your safety as our highest priority,\" the agency said. \"Despite the fact that there was no significant smoke in any station, Blue, Orange and Silver line service was suspended between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom out of caution, resulting in significant delays in service on all three lines.\n\n\"We established limited shuttle bus service as an alternative, and ran a shuttle train between Rosslyn and Pentagon, enabling some riders to switch to the Yellow Line,\" the statement continued. \"Despite these alternatives, we know that many of you experienced extremely long, crowded trips this morning.\"\n\nMetro riders took to Twitter on Monday to vent about their frustration with the service interruption.\n\nOnce again, I paid rush hour fares for subpar service @wmata, walking miles to work because of delays at Foggy Bottom. Enough already #wmata \u2014 Eric Lund (@EricTLund) May 11, 2015\n\nMetro said it restored service on the shutdown lines by Monday afternoon, but the agency said it would be a while before it got back to normal levels.\n\n\"Rail service was restored shortly after 11 a.m. on a single track following the replacement of multiple third-rail insulators that were showing signs of electrical sparking (known as 'arcing'),\" the agency said. \"Additional repairs required that parts be brought to the location from Maryland, further contributing to the length of our response. We expect to have these repairs completed by mid-afternoon, with normal two-track service in time for this evening's rush hour.\"\n\nMetro offered an apology to customers on all three of the lines that were shut down.\n\n\"Again, we sincerely apologize for your experience this morning,\" the agency said. \"Should you wish to share feedback with us, please contact Metro Customer Service at (202) 637-1328 or online at wmata.com/contactus.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The agency suspended service on three subway lines during rush hour.", "description": "The agency suspended service on three subway lines during rush hour.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The agency suspended service on three subway lines during rush hour.", "title": "DC Metro apologizes for Monday shutdown", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241645-dc-metro-apologizes-for-monday-shutdown", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/metro_wmata_crowd_092203file.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241645-dc-metro-apologizes-for-monday-shutdown", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-11T15:46-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Washington Metro, Blue Line, Orange Line, Silver Line, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T15:46:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/241645-dc-metro-apologizes-for-monday-shutdown", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The agency suspended service on three subway lines during rush hour.", "card": "summary", "title": "DC Metro apologizes for Monday shutdown"}, "dcterms.title": "DC Metro apologizes for Monday shutdown"}, "article_summary": "\"Metro apologizes for the significant delays, crowding and inconvenience many of you experienced this morning,\" the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) said in a statement.\nOnce again, I paid rush hour fares for subpar service @wmata, walking miles to work because of delays at Foggy Bottom.\n\"Should you wish to share feedback with us, please contact Metro Customer Service at (202) 637-1328 or online at wmata.com/contactus.\"\nMetro offered an apology to customers on all three of the lines that were shut down.\n\"For your safety, both tracks were taken out of service while appropriate fire department personnel, along with Metro response crews, investigated and rectified the issue.\""}
