Larry Crowder (R-Alamosa County), to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nHB 1420 would establish the Colorado Healthcare Affordability and Sustainability Enterprise (CHASE) as a government-owned business to administer the state\u2019s HPF. HPF is the vehicle by which Colorado expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014 and by which the state collected almost $700 million in revenue the following year.\n\nCHASE\u2019s designation as an \u201centerprise\u201d would exempt the program from the state constitution\u2019s TABOR, which mandates voters shall decide at the ballot whether Colorado must refund to taxpayers surplus revenue collected by the state, except when the surplus comes from a state \u201centerprise.\u201d\n\nIf passed, CHASE will take effect on July 1, 2016, provided the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determine the program complies with federal law, according to the bill\u2019s fiscal note.\n\nWord Games\n\nLinda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute, says the bill manipulates the meaning of \u201centerprise\u201d in order to circumvent the state\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cIf an enterprise that forces taxpayers to put more into a fund run for the benefit of the state Medicaid program and its clients is a \u2018government business enterprise,\u2019 then what program run by government is not a government business enterprise?\u201d Gorman said.\n\nGorman says CHASE would perform no functions characteristic of business enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t selling goods or performing services; it\u2019s just deploying money to inflate Medicaid payments,\u201d Gorman said.\n\n\u2018Gangster Government Acting Greedily\u2019\n\nJonathan Lockwood, executive director of Advancing Colorado, called CHASE a \u201chospital provider tax scam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hospital provider fee \u2018enterprise\u2019 won\u2019t help change any outcomes for the better in health care,\u201d Lockwood said.\n\nLockwood says CHASE proponents are taking advantage of a legal loophole to evade constitutional limits on Colorado\u2019s authority to tax residents.\n\n\u201cThe legal loophole being exploited by Sen. Crowder\u2019s bill stands in direct contrast with Coloradans\u2019 constitutional rights,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cWhat we are seeing is gangster government acting greedily as usual, and elected officials, like Sen. Crowder and Speaker Hullinghorst, are literally scoffing at Coloradans for thinking government should be regulated by the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nMichael McGrady (mmcgrady@uccs.edu) writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nMatthew Glans, \u201cColorado\u2019s Hospital Provider Tax and TABOR Collide,\u201d Research & Commentary, The Heartland Institute, February 8, 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/research-commentary-colorados-hospital-provider-tax-and-tabor-collide\n\nImage via Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "HB 1420 would establish the Colorado Healthcare Affordability and Sustainability Enterprise (CHASE) as a government-owned business to administer the state\u2019s HPF.\nA bill that would exempt Colorado\u2019s Hospital Provider Fee (HPF) program from the state constitution\u2019s Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights (TABOR) has advanced to hearings on the House floor.\n\u201cThe legal loophole being exploited by Sen.
