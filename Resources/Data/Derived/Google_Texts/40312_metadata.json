Branding the junior senator from the U.S. state of Massachusetts with that term suggests to the rest of the world that she must be close to the camp of the Fidel Castros or some other anti-capitalist revolutionaries.\n\nJust what is Mrs. Warren\u2019s crime that warrants such castigation? Speaking up for the concerns of everyday Americans \u2014 consumers, debtors, working people, that\u2019s what.\n\nAs the founding spirit behind the long-overdue establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , Senator Warren saw to it that today\u2019s Americans are finally able to avail themselves of the same consumer rights that have been considered as givens by their counterparts in Europe since the 1970s.\n\nWhat makes the charge of labeling Warren a leftist almost comical is that, when Europeans started to pursue the issue of consumer rights, they were eager to emulate the world leader of the consumer movement at the time \u2014 the United States.\n\nSince that time, the United States has pretty much abandoned one of its smartest inventions \u2014 and left it to the Europeans to carry the flag of consumer rights forward . (Note that a key reason why the European Commission is so reflexively maligned in the U.S. media is precisely that it has established itself as the key body to provide a check on expanding corporate powers in Europe and beyond.)\n\nAre consumer rights \u201cleftist\u201d?\n\nIn modern mass societies, working on these issues is a truly vital matter.\n\nIt ensures that a nation\u2019s citizens do not become powerless automatons who are haplessly pushed around by big corporations, pretty much at the latters\u2019 free will.\n\nSadly, that is precisely what has happened in the United States ever since the days of the (mislabeled) \u201cReagan revolution.\u201d The goal of Reagan\u2019s backers was really the polar opposite of a revolution \u2014 moving the social progress achieved until then back as much as possible.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the large corporations of America have seen to it, in a close collaboration with an ever-pliable U.S. Congress, that any further spreading of that consumer rights movement got stopped in its tracks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives can label her a leftist all they want.
