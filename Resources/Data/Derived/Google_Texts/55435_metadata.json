If passed, they would be the first regulations on virtual currencies anywhere in North America to carry the full weight of the law.\n\nThe rules say that anyone conducting \u201cvirtual currency business activity\u201d needs to have a BitLicense. That sort of activity includes things like buying and selling virtual currency as a customer business, storing virtual currency on behalf of others, or issuing a virtual currency. Merchants and customers who use virtual currencies exclusively for the transactions of goods and services, however, are exempt.\n\nIf you want to start a virtual currency exchange or operate an online wallet service in the state of New York, you\u2019re going to need a BitLicense, but if you just want to buy or sell a pizza with virtual money, it\u2019s still possible to do so without first getting government approval.\n\nApplying for a BitLicense involves disclosing personal and financial information for top company officials, undergoing a background check, paying a fee, and providing details about the structure and business goals of the company. If the regulators see any shady behavior, licenses can be either suspended or revoked entirely following a hearing.\n\nThe proposal also introduces capital requirements, which are rules that nearly all financial institutions are required to follow requiring them to have a certain amount of cash (or other assets) on hand to ensure that a market downturn or bad business decision doesn\u2019t suddenly sink the whole company and its customers\u2019 investments with it. The minimum amount of capital each virtual currency financial firm will be required to carry will be determined by regulators on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn addition, all firms applying for BitLicenses will be required to comply with a set of policies\u2014 including the preservation of all financial records for at least a decade, the submission of quarterly financial statements, the verification of customers\u2019 real-world identities, and the logging all user transactions\u2014which are designed to combat fraud and money laundering, as well as rules designed to ensure against data breaches and protect customers\u2019 privacy.\n\nInteresting, the rules appear to technically prohibit virtual currency firms from taking the revenue they earn from virtual currencies and then investing that money back into virtual currencies. Earnings can only be sunk into \u201chigh-quality, investment-grade permissible investments \u2026 denominated in United States dollars.\u201d This is a category that includes investment vehicles like money market funds, state or municipal bonds, and government securities. Notably absent from this list: virtual currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of virtual currencies like Bitcoin for many early adopters was that they could be traded in relatively anonymity. However, as regulators around the globe have worked to incorporate virtual currencies into the traditional financial system, there\u2019s been a push for companies operating in the virtual currency space to collect the same type of information about their clients as is required for those operating with government-backed money.\n\nEven in New York, under these regulations that people will still be able to transfer bitcoins back and forth without revealing their real names,.
