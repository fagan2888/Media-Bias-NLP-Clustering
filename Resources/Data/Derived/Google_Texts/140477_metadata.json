I\u2019m glad that more Iowans are accessing care under the Affordable Care Act. As an Iowan, I want to make sure that when my loved ones and yours seek treatment, they get the best care possible.\n\nIowa is struggling to find enough nurses to care for the increasing number of patients. For the past decade, national predictions have been that the U.S. will suffer from a severe and prolonged nursing shortage. Such predictions range from 250,000 to 1 million nurses short by 2024. However, Iowa is suffering from a nursing shortage now due to a simultaneous increase in demand and constraints on the supply of nurses.\n\nHospitals around the state have been hosting \u201chiring fairs\u201d, offering sign- on bonuses and extra \u201cperks\u201d to attract nurses to fill vacancies. And certain factors have created this near-perfect storm including the fact that:\n\n\u2022 Iowa ranks dead last in the nation for RN pay for the most experienced nurses according to data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Occupational Employment Statistics.\n\n\u2022 46 percent of nurses in Iowa are 50 years or older according to a story on nursing shortage and education published in the Des Moines Register in May 2015.\n\n\u2022 Understaffing and stressful work environments lead to high turnover, a phenomenon that is well documented by Linda Aiken in the Journal of the American Medical Association. National Public Radio recently aired a piece that noted that nurses say stress interferes with caring for their patients.\n\nThis is a serious wake-up call for all Iowan\u2019s who will need health care services now and in the future. It\u2019s time hospitals raise wages, improve staffing and listen to what nurses need. I love being a nurse, and firmly believe Iowan\u2019s deserve the highest quality care possible. This Nurse\u2019s Week support your nurses. Contact your hospital and demand they fix the shortage, so we can deliver the care you deserve.\n\n\u2022 Lynnette Halstead of Marion has been a nurse in this community for 20 years.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | This week, nurses around the country will celebrate National Nurses Week.As an RN working in a local Emergency Room, I've seen firsthand the increasing number o", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "This week, nurses around the country will celebrate National Nurses Week.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnists/will-there-be-a-nurse-to-care-for-you-20160509", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160509/ARTICLE/160509675/AR/0/AR-160509675.jpg", "article": {"section": "Opinion"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnists/will-there-be-a-nurse-to-care-for-you-20160509", "description": "This week, nurses around the country will celebrate National Nurses Week.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Will there be a nurse to care for you?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2016-05-09T10:50:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_opinion", "pubDate": "2016-05-09T10:50:25-05:00", "title": "Will there be a nurse to care for you?"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Lynnette Halstead, guest columnistThis week, nurses around the country will celebrate National Nurses Week.\nI\u2019m glad that more Iowans are accessing care under the Affordable Care Act.\nI love being a nurse, and firmly believe Iowan\u2019s deserve the highest quality care possible.\nAs an RN working in a local Emergency Room, I\u2018ve seen firsthand the increasing number of patients who are seeking care.\nIowa is struggling to find enough nurses to care for the increasing number of patients."}
