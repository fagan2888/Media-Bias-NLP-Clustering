Last night, Saturday Night Live mocked CNN by creating a fake take-home pregnancy test branded by the network — for constant breaking news alerts on a woman’s pregnancy status that provide no news at all.

The CNN pregnancy test is a test that doesn’t just give a simple yes or a no. It’s a test that gives continual updates “for when you want to know that they don’t know.”

“When it comes to giving information, there’s only one name that we trust to give it to us constantly,” cast member Beck Bennett said in a fake commercial for the product.

“That’s why we use the new CNN take home pregnancy test,” cast member Vanessa Bayer continued. “It’s relentless breaking alerts let us know that it’s working hard to find out if we’re having a baby.”

The updates show up every ten minutes on the pregnancy test’s breaking news screen, providing all of the information the network can find “even if that information is no information.”

Sadly, the SNL skit isn’t far from the truth.

As investigators search for clues surrounding the missing Malaysian Airlines flight, CNN has devoted almost ’round-the-clock coverage to the mystery. This coverage, which often slipped into the entirely speculative and downright insane, has been widely mocked.
