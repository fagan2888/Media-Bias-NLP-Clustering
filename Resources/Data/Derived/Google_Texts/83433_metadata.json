They argued that opponents had no reason to fear the rule unless they intend to pollute.\n\n\u201cIt does not interfere with private property rights or address land use,\u201d EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy Gina McCarthyThe Clean Water Rule: One year later How Congress got to yes on toxic chemical reform Overnight Energy: Labor rift opens over green mega-donor MORE said at the time. \u201cIt does not regulate any ditches unless they function as tributaries. It does not apply to groundwater or shallow subsurface water, copper tile drains or change policy on irrigation or water transfer.\u201d\n\nThe Farm Bureau did not say whether it would sue the EPA to have the rule overturned.\n\nThe House has voted to block the rule\u2019s implementation, and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted Wednesday to block it and give instructions to re-write it.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The \"waters of the United States rule\" is the subject of fierce debate.", "description": "The \"waters of the United States rule\" is the subject of fierce debate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The \"waters of the United States rule\" is the subject of fierce debate.", "title": "Ag lobby: Final EPA water rule is worse than proposal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244750-agriculture-lobby-epa-water-rule-is-worse-than-proposal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/farm_pond_070914thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244750-agriculture-lobby-epa-water-rule-is-worse-than-proposal", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-11T17:11-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency, Waters of the United States, American Farm Bureau Federation,Gina McCarthy,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-11T17:11:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244750-agriculture-lobby-epa-water-rule-is-worse-than-proposal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The \"waters of the United States rule\" is the subject of fierce debate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ag lobby: Final EPA water rule is worse than proposal"}, "dcterms.title": "Ag lobby: Final EPA water rule is worse than proposal"}, "article_summary": "It does not apply to groundwater or shallow subsurface water, copper tile drains or change policy on irrigation or water transfer.\u201dThe Farm Bureau did not say whether it would sue the EPA to have the rule overturned.\nThe largest lobby group for farmers and ranchers declared Thursday that the Obama administration\u2019s new rule asserting power over small waterways is worse than what had been proposed.\nThe Farm Bureau said the EPA made its rule even more broad than what it put out for public comment in March 2014, echoing a criticism that congressional Republicans have made since the May 27 announcement of the final rule.\nObama administration officials sought to highlight with the rollout everything that is not regulated under the rule.\n\u201cOur analysis shows yet again how unwise, extreme and unlawful this rule is,\u201d Stallman said."}
