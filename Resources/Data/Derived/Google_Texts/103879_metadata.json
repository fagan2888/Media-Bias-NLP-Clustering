With Ted Cruz\u2019s withdrawal from the race on Tuesday, the GOP \u2014 and conservatives across America \u2014 lost the only constitutionally conservative candidate left standing. While we did not endorse any particular candidate, clearly Cruz not only understood our Constitution but also thought it worth following and fighting for \u2014 imagine that.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nWhen Cruz won Iowa, he looked poised to do well. When he won Wisconsin, it appeared as though he could really stop Trump. But his fall was precipitous.\n\nThe odds from the outset were not in Cruz\u2019s favor, and, frankly, it\u2019s a testament to his solid ground-game strategy that he made it as far as he did. Hardly beloved among the DC Republican elites, Cruz made a name for himself bucking the establishment, which he regularly called \u201cthe Washington cartel.\u201d Whether or not you cheered his \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d filibuster protesting ObamaCare funding, it didn\u2019t win him many friends among entrenched party leadership. As a result, not only former House Speaker John Boehner but actual conservatives in Washington were happy to sit on the sidelines and watch the Cruz campaign fail. Indeed, Boehner didn\u2019t call Cruz \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d as a term of endearment.\n\nCruz helped fuel the rebellion against the Beltway establishment, but when a better showman came along and Cruz needed that establishment\u2019s help, it was nowhere to be found.\n\nWhile petty playground games are unbecoming (if standard practice) for members of Congress, Republican vitriol undoubtedly affected Cruz\u2019s image. In the end, intraparty fighting within the halls of Congress may very well be credited with Trump\u2019s nomination.\n\nYet the Beltway isn\u2019t fully to blame for Cruz\u2019s downfall. With 17 candidates crowding the field for far too long, at some point they all began looking pretty much the same \u2014 bland, same-old-loser Republicans, establishment or not. All but one. And that one is now the presumptive nominee.\n\nAt first, Cruz tried to ride in Trump\u2019s slipstream. Cruz spent last summer praising Trump, saying the billionaire is \u201ca friend of mine.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cHe\u2019s bold and brash and he\u2019s willing to speak the truth.\u201d\n\nJust before Cruz left the race, he unloaded on Trump as \u201cthe biggest narcissist\u201d and a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d\n\nBut while Trump was appealing to everyone, Cruz was focused on only the most conservative voters. Turns out he lost many of them, too, in part because voters decided that \u201cLyin' Ted,\u201d Trump\u2019s favorite moniker, was an apt one.\n\nIn fact, the longer the campaign mayhem dragged on, and the more bizarre it grew, the more Trump supporters couldn\u2019t distinguish even Cruz from the establishment. To them, anyone not named \u201cTrump\u201d became establishment \u2014 and nothing would convince them otherwise.\n\nOf course, Trump himself was an attention-grabbing anomaly. He built his empire on the art of entertainment and the deal of paying for favors. Given the presidential race is the biggest stage of his life, naturally he put on a great show, with a script full of promises but few props of evidence to support them.\n\nAnd he won over much of the crowd.\n\nAny thoughts on Cruz\u2019s downfall and Trump\u2019s ascension would be incomplete without considering the role of the media. And no, we don\u2019t mean only the liberal mainstream media so often blamed (rightly) for its bias, which gave the billionaire billions of dollars in free air time. We mean conservative media who drank the Trump Kool-Aid and made it their mission to poison their audiences with the same. (See Fox News' sinking ratings for how this worked out for them.)\n\nExplaining the demise of the entire Republican field, National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty wrote, \u201cHow likely was it that Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, Sarah Palin, and Matt Drudge would not merely tolerate Trump\u2019s previous liberal views but excuse them or conclude they were irrelevant to the 2016 discussion? How likely was it that they would look at Trump\u2019s recent declaration that he\u2019s pro-life and pro-gun and they would believe him?\u201d\n\nTrump himself told Fox News' Neil Cavuto, \u201cI\u2019ve spent zero on advertising because you and Fox and all of the others \u2014 I won\u2019t mention names, but every other network, I mean they cover me a lot, to put it mildly. And in covering me, it\u2019s almost like if I put ads in on top of the program, it would be too much. It would be too much Trump.\u201d\n\nToo much Trump? Now there\u2019s something we can agree on.\n\nIn his exit speech, a gracious Cruz struck a tone of optimism, highlighting America\u2019s exceptionalism and promising to \u201cdefend the Judeo-Christian values that built America\u201d and to \u201ccontinue this fight with all of my strength and all of my ability.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Cruz, his own strategy and the persona he cultivated backfired. Had Trump never entered the race, it\u2019s still unlikely the Texas senator could have won the nomination. So in the end, he may only be able to blame himself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His own strategy and the persona he cultivated backfired.", "csrf-token": "pB9pbZvlPWBU24fRpbzX4FQmcvMB+u3ngc7egt51HF8=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "His own strategy and the persona he cultivated backfired.", "title": "Cruz Beat Himself", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/42380", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2016-05-05-48315a60.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d7c\"", "article_summary": "When Cruz won Iowa, he looked poised to do well.\nGovernment & Politics Cruz Beat HimselfIn a scenario largely unimaginable just nine months ago, Donald Trump, who has spent his life funding Democrats, is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nCruz helped fuel the rebellion against the Beltway establishment, but when a better showman came along and Cruz needed that establishment\u2019s help, it was nowhere to be found.\nIn fact, the longer the campaign mayhem dragged on, and the more bizarre it grew, the more Trump supporters couldn\u2019t distinguish even Cruz from the establishment.\nIndeed, Boehner didn\u2019t call Cruz \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d as a term of endearment."}
