Consider these developments just this month:\n\n\u2022 A judge in St. Paul \u2014 a city whose history and culture are inseparable from the Roman Catholic Church \u2014 refused to set aside a lawsuit\u2019s claim that the Twin Cities archdiocese and the Diocese of Winona had created a public nuisance with their handling of abusive priests. District Judge John Van de North said he is seeking more information on that charge as he allowed a suit to go forward on claims of negligence.\n\n\u2022 An affidavit by former archdiocesan canon law chancellor Jennifer Haselberger reported a \u201ccavalier attitude about the safety of other people\u2019s children\u201d at the archdiocese\u2019s top levels, leading to lax investigations and continued priestly service by suspected abusers. Haselberger resigned from her post in 2013 because, she said, she could no longer work for an organization that was not fully cooperating with an investigation of illegal activity within it.\n\n\u2022 The archdiocese confirmed to the Star Tribune that Archbishop John Nienstedt is the subject of a monthslong investigation of sexual misconduct with seminarians, priests and other men.\n\n\u2022 Minnesota Public Radio aired an hourlong documentary, \u201cBetrayed by Silence,\u201d detailing how three St. Paul/Minneapolis archbishops \u2014 Nienstedt and his predecessors John R. Roach and Harry Flynn \u2014 ignored or downplayed evidence and, until this year, concealed the names of priests credibly accused of molesting children.\n\n\u2022 An editorial in the New York Times said that if Pope Francis is serious about holding bishops accountable for the abuse scandal that has rocked the church, a \u201cgood place to start\u201d would be St. Paul and Minneapolis, with the removal of Nienstedt.\n\nRESPONSE The day the 107-page affidavit by Jennifer Haselberger was released, Auxiliary Bishop Andrew Cozzens released a three-paragraph statement saying: \u201cHer recollections are not always shared by others within the archdiocese. \u2026 Since Ms. Haselberger\u2019s departure, we have begun the implementation of the Safe Environment and Ministerial Standards Task Force Recommendations, which address some of the concerns she has raised. We continue to take concrete steps toward greater transparency and accountability in protecting children while offering hope and healing to victims.\u201d\n\nToday, with sadness, this newspaper joins that call. For the sake of one of this state\u2019s most valued institutions and the Minnesotans whose lives it touches, Nienstedt\u2019s service at the archdiocese should end now.\n\nIt will take months, and maybe years, for legal and ecclesiastical proceedings to sort out the charges that have been leveled by Haselberger and others who\u2019ve been wronged by the church and its leaders. Those cases should go forward with care and diligence. Minnesotans deserve assurance that in this state, justice is available even when \u201cthe least of these\u201d fall prey to people entrusted with power.\n\nBut the continued presence of the embattled Nienstedt in the chancery increases the likelihood that those matters will impede the work of the church in the larger community. Deservedly or not, Nienstedt has become the face of a coverup that has put children in harm\u2019s way. His credibility is in tatters. The archdiocese needs a different leader \u2014 a reformer \u2014 to have a reasonable chance of restoring its damaged reputation and sustaining its service to the community.\n\nWe\u2019ve been hesitant to make this call until now for two reasons. We consider it presumptuous for a secular news organization to advise a church about internal matters. And just two years ago, the Star Tribune Editorial Board and Nienstedt openly quarreled about the ballot question that would have constitutionally banned same-sex marriage in this state. Although that disagreement is unrelated to today\u2019s call for Nienstedt to depart, we know some readers will question our motivation.\n\nA larger concern now overrides those considerations, however. The Catholic name attaches not only to churches, but to schools, colleges, hospitals, homeless shelters, congregate dining, care for the elderly and a host of other good works that serve more than Catholics. The damage that brand name is suffering in Minnesota has become severe enough to put public support \u2014 and, crucially, donor support \u2014 of all things Catholic at risk. The abuse scandal has become more than an internal problem.\n\nCatholic organizations, including the annual fund drive formerly known as the Archbishop\u2019s Appeal, have gone to considerable lengths since the scandal broke to distance themselves from the chancery, both legally and in public perception. The distraction from core mission that those efforts represent is regrettable. The likelihood that they will also be insufficient if Nienstedt remains is growing, and worrisome. Minnesota needs the work that those church-affiliated entities do.\n\nThis state also has benefited since its founding from the calls for compassion, social justice and civic harmony that have emanated from this archdiocese. The moral authority that those calls once carried is now badly eroded, and Nienstedt is in no position to restore it.\n\nNeither does the chancery incumbent stand much chance of rallying support for new practices and attitudes that might prevent future scandals. The church is paying a high price for its misdeeds and misjudgment. But it is also being presented with a rare opportunity to bring in a new order of transparency and accountability, provided a leader emerges who can rally the faithful behind a reform agenda.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard from prominent Minnesota Catholics who have made quiet but urgent pleas to the Vatican for Nienstedt\u2019s replacement. Those pleas deserve heed. But we also hope Nienstedt takes to heart the example of Pope Benedict. Eighteen months ago, Benedict concluded that he was not up to the task of meeting the church\u2019s leadership needs, and broke with 600 years of tradition to resign from office. His decision was not a display of weakness, but of love for his church. Nienstedt\u2019s resignation would show the same.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Archbishop cannot be a force for reform in Twin Cities archdiocese.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Archbishop cannot be a force for reform in Twin Cities archdiocese.", "title": "To heal church, Nienstedt must go", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/to-heal-church-nienstedt-must-go/268669872/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140633128824172.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140633128824172.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Archbishop cannot be a force for reform in Twin Cities archdiocese.", "title": "To heal church, Nienstedt must go", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/to-heal-church-nienstedt-must-go/268669872/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140633128824172.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140633128824172.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Vatican"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "John Nienstedt,Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis,Catholic Church,Catholic clergy abuse,Vatican"}, "article_summary": "But the continued presence of the embattled Nienstedt in the chancery increases the likelihood that those matters will impede the work of the church in the larger community.\nAlthough that disagreement is unrelated to today\u2019s call for Nienstedt to depart, we know some readers will question our motivation.\nDeservedly or not, Nienstedt has become the face of a coverup that has put children in harm\u2019s way.\nThe moral authority that those calls once carried is now badly eroded, and Nienstedt is in no position to restore it.\n\u2022 The archdiocese confirmed to the Star Tribune that Archbishop John Nienstedt is the subject of a monthslong investigation of sexual misconduct with seminarians, priests and other men."}
