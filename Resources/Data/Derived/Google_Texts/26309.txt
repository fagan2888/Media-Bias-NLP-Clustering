Hillary Clinton campaigned at City Hall today in one final push before Georgia’s presidential primary on Tuesday. Mayor Kasim Reed, an ardent Clinton supporter, introduced her to the crowd.

Mayor Reed said Clinton is the only presidential candidate looking out for African-Americans. He also defended her reputation, saying her career has never been about money.

“I’ve been thinking about Secretary Clinton. Her life has been about helping other people, so I don’t know how anybody has gotten it confused," said Reed.

Clinton discussed gun violence, including shootings of unarmed black men by police. She stressed the need to educate law enforcement officers.

“We’ve got to help our police officers; to rethink that the first response can’t be reaching for a gun," said Clinton. "What can we do to de-escalate?"

Clinton also defended President Obama, saying she would protect and improve the Affordable Care Act when she becomes President.
