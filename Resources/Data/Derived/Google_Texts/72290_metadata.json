The president will sign legislation kicking in more economic sanctions, looking to force Putin to back down in Ukraine.\n\nDouble Ouch: Sen John McCain, R-Ariz., took to the floor today to blast Antony Blinken, Obama\u2019s choice for a top State Department job, as \u201cabysmally ignorant\u201d about Iraq and Afghanistan and by far the president\u2019s worst choice, ever, about anything: \u201cHe is not only unqualified but, in my view, one of the worst selections of a very bad lot that this president has chosen.\u201d\n\nNot Bristol Palin: Obama signed a memorandum banning oil drilling and exploration in Bristol Bay, Alaska \u2013 and let everyone know about it via a YouTube video on the White House channel:\n\nClose Enough: Director Rob Marshall, via actress Emily Blunt, says he was inspired to make his latest film, an adaptation of the Tony Award-winning play \u201cInto The Woods,\u201d by a speech Obama gave during the 9/11 10th anniversary memorial service: \u201cObama said, 'You are not alone, no one is alone,' which is the lyric, the actual lyric word for word [from the show].\u201d Only it doesn't appear to be what the president said, according to this transcript.\n\nDubious Achievement: Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post has weighed the evidence and concluded that, without a doubt, Obama had the Worst Year in Washington, \u201cfor losses at home and crises abroad.\u201d Given what happened in the midterms, it\u2019s hard to argue with Cillizza's logic.\n\nToday in Torture:\n\nNo Girls Allowed: 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who was allegedly waterboarded more than 100 times, is on trial at Guant\u00e1namo but facing a different kind of torture: being touched or escorted to court by female Gitmo guards, a practice against his religion.\n\nToday in 2016:\n\nYour Move, Jeb: No sooner had Jeb Bush announced he\u2019s exploring a possible run for president than potential GOP competitor Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky welcomed him to the party and spiked Bush\u2019s drink. He took out a Google search ad on Bush\u2019s name with a link to RandPAC, Paul\u2019s leadership super PAC, and a solicitation for emails.\n\nGlenn Doesn\u2019t <3 Elizabeth: While progressives are mooning over the chances \u2013 slim and fat \u2013 that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., might challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, don\u2019t count Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept as among the starry-eyed. Greenwald triggered some ire by hitting Warren over her somewhat conventional stance on Israel.\n\nToday in Hillary:\n\nFranken Sense: DemocraticSen. Al Franken of Minnesota declared today that he\u2019s ready for Hillary and heartily endorses her currently nonexistent campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Franken believes Clinton \u2013 who campaigned for him in his midterm re-election campaign \u2013 is good enough, smart enough and, doggone it, he likes her.\n\nToday in Everything Else:\n\nBailed Out: Rep. Kevin Yoder, an obscure Kansas Republican, is making a name for himself in a way he\u2019d probably prefer not to. He\u2019s the legislator who inserted the language gutting the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill into the \"CRomnibus.\" But he\u2019s been mum on why he did it.\n\nCorrected on Dec. 19, 2014: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Antony Blinken's name.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Obama Puts More Economic Hurt on Putin", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "More sanctions for Russia, John McCain is not impressed and Franken is Ready for Hillary when she is.", "title": "Last Call: Obama Puts More Economic Hurt on Putin", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/12/16/last-call-obama-puts-more-economic-hurt-on-putin", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/65/cf/cf8755cf4a508eaef7b1b867f564/141216-putin-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Last Call: Obama Puts More Economic Hurt on Putin", "description": "More sanctions for Russia, John McCain is not impressed and Franken is Ready for Hillary when she is.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
