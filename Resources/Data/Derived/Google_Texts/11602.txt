NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Most of the recent noise around Obamacare has been about the high-profile lawsuit King v. Burwell, which seeks to prove that the authors of the ACA intended to write a law that didn’t work. If the King plaintiffs succeed, insurance subsidies will only be made available to consumers on the state-run exchanges rather than the federal marketplace which covers most of the country.

Very quietly another story has been unfolding, however, as numbers roll in from the law’s second year of open enrollment. For all of Obamacare’s status as the political symbol of our time, improbably unseating even Iraq, it’s the people who actually use the program that tell the real story. How well is this law working, how consistently and for whom?

A new study out of Kaiser has broken down the results of the second enrollment period. It’s a subject we still don’t know enough about, according to Kaiser’s director of public opinion and survey research Liz Hamel, because implementation of the law is still remarkably young. With two enrollment periods down then, how is Obamacare doing?



It's stayed pretty much on track.

“I think that we found that things are pretty much the same in the second year as in the first year, but I think that was what was to be expected,” Hamel said. “What we saw was a lot of stability between the first year and the second.”

This is the second survey of its kind. After 2014’s open enrollment Kaiser gathered data on how consumers responded to their insurance and, with some variation; this year’s data look remarkably similar. This is good news for the law’s supporters, who have been fighting charges of price spirals and unsustainable markets since Obamacare first began to reform the industry.
