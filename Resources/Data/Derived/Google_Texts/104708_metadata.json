Kate Brown a measure that would jettison Cover Oregon and fold the operations of the agency into the state Department of Consumer and Business Services.\n\n\"We can put an end to an unfortunate chapter in our history,\" Rep. Nancy Nathanson, D-Eugene, said in support of Senate Bill 1.\n\nThe measure won bipartisan backing although some lawmakers were opposed because they said they weren't sure the consumer services agency had a valid plan for managing the insurance program.\n\nCover Oregon was created to manage Oregon's health insurance exchange under the federal Affordable Care Act, also often known as Obamacare. After the Cover Oregon website failed to work, the state last year began using the federal website to provide health insurance options for people seeking coverage under the new law.\n\nOracle America, the California software firm that had the contract to develop the Cover Oregon website, has threatened to go to court to block the legislation. The company, which is involved in a high-stakes legal battle with the state, says it's an attempt by the state to gain additional legal immunity.\n\nBrown has praised the bill and indicated she would sign it.\n\n-- Jeff Mapes\n\njmapes@oregonian.com\n\n503-221-8209\n\n@Jeffmapes", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Jeff  Mapes | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "2015 oregon legislature, cover oregon, sb 1, news", "title": "Bill to abolish Cover Oregon and move functions to state agency heads to governor's desk", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Bill to abolish Cover Oregon and move functions to state agency heads to governor\\u0027s desk\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/mapes/index.ssf/2015/02/bill_to_abolish_cover_oregon_a.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/2014/12/19/16608407-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15334505\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-27T20:10:05Z\", \"author\": \"Jeff  Mapes | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"2015 oregon legislature\",\"@breaking-news\",\"@health\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@politics\",\"cover oregon\",\"sb 1\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/2014/12/19/16608407-standard.jpg", "title": "Bill to abolish Cover Oregon and move functions to state agency heads to governor's desk", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A bill to fold the functions of Cover Oregon into the State Department of Consumer and Business Services was approved by the state House Friday on a 42-14 vote.
