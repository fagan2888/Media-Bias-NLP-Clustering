Michael Sefcik did not have health insurance in mid-December when he had a stroke, but luckily he qualified for Medicaid, which retroactively covered his hospital bills.\n\nMelissa Sefcik keeps her husband\u2019s mounting medical bills in a two-pocket purple folder \u2014 and she\u2019s nearly running out of room.\n\nTo donate Michael Sefcik, who collapsed at home when he suffered a stroke on Dec. 15, can\u2019t walk very well and has trouble using the right side of his body. He also lost much of his memory and vision. To read more about Michael or to donate any amount of money to offset some of the Sefciks\u2019 expenses, visit www.gofundme.com/j89hnc.\n\nThere\u2019s the $1,078 bill for one night Michael Sefcik spent at Trident Medical Center after he suffered a stroke in December and another one, $2,374, for two subsequent nights at Medical University Hospital. There are a handful of others \u2014 $940 for a short emergency room stay; $150 for an echocardiogram to take pictures of his heart; $365 for X-rays; $239.32 for few minutes with a Trident neurologist, who Melissa only remembers saying, \u201cYes, there\u2019s been some damage to his brain. I\u2019m going to call MUSC to see if they can take him.\u201d\n\nShop for insurance Visit HealthCare.gov or call the federal health insurance marketplace, 1-800-318-2596, to compare plan prices.

He had no health insurance.\n\nLegislative update A bill filed by conservative lawmakers that would have penalized state employees for enforcing the Affordable Care Act in South Carolina has been tabled in the state House of Representatives, The State newspaper reported this week. Similar bills, including one that would have nullified the federal health care law in this state, have been introduced for consideration in prior years, but have never been passed into law.\n\n\u201cYoung people just don\u2019t think about needing it,\u201d said Melissa Sefcik, 35, who lives in Summerville with her husband. \u201cWe didn\u2019t. We never thought about it.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know how much all these medical bills will ultimately cost \u2014 they keep coming in the mail \u2014 but the couple recently received a financial lifesaver.\n\nBecause Michael Sefcik hadn\u2019t worked on a construction site for more than a month before he collapsed on the living room floor on Dec. 15, and because the couple shares a 17-year-old son and had no savings, they received a letter in mid-January explaining he temporarily qualifies for a Medicaid policy, which will retroactively cover his medical bills back to Dec. 1.\n\nThat\u2019s especially good news, considering hundreds of thousands of adults in this state, especially the ones who hold low-paying jobs and have no children, can\u2019t get Medicaid.\n\nEligibility rules for the low-income health insurance program in South Carolina are relatively strict and conservative state leaders have refused to loosen those rules with federal funds available through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNevertheless, Obamacare now requires most adults to prove that they have health insurance \u2014 through their employer, through a government-subsidized plan, or through some private policy \u2014 and time to sign up for an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov is running out.\n\n\u201cThe deadline to sign up for coverage is just a few weeks away,\u201d said Sylvia M. Burwell, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a recent press release. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do before Feb. 15, but are encouraged by the strong interest we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d\n\nSince insurance enrollment opened on HealthCare.gov on Nov. 15, more than 7 million people in the United States and more than 170,000 in South Carolina have bought or renewed a plan. Open enrollment closes on Feb. 15.\n\nMost South Carolina residents who don\u2019t have health insurance in 2015 will be fined hundreds of dollars next year if they can\u2019t prove they purchased a policy.\n\nThe Sefciks now have to submit additional paperwork in order to retain Michael\u2019s Medicaid coverage. Eventually, Melissa said they can pay for a policy through her new employer.\n\n\u201cInsurance might not seem like something you need, but then look what can happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was perfectly healthy. All he did was smoke. And it\u2019s changed our lives.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Uninsured couple faces financial hardship following medical emergency, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Medicaid,Medicaid expansion,MUSC,Obamacare,Trident Health", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Melissa Sefcik keeps her husband\u2019s mounting medical bills in a two-pocket purple folder \u2014 and she\u2019s nearly running out of room.", "title": "Uninsured couple faces financial hardship following medical emergency", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150208/150209505/uninsured-couple-faces-financial-hardship-following-medical-emergency", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150208/PC16/150209505/AR/0/AR-150209505.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150208/PC16/150209505/AR/0/AR-150209505.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Melissa Sefcik keeps her husband\u2019s mounting medical bills in a two-pocket purple folder \u2014 and she\u2019s nearly running out of room.", "title": "Uninsured couple faces financial hardship following medical emergency", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150208/PC16/150209505/AR/0/AR-150209505.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150209505}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Uninsured couple faces financial hardship following medical emergency , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Medicaid,Medicaid expansion,MUSC,Obamacare,Trident Health", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-08T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T16:57:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Melissa Sefcik keeps her husband\u2019s mounting medical bills in a two-pocket purple folder \u2014 and she\u2019s nearly running out of room."}, "article_summary": "Michael Sefcik did not have health insurance in mid-December when he had a stroke, but luckily he qualified for Medicaid, which retroactively covered his hospital bills.\nI\u2019m going to call MUSC to see if they can take him.\u201dShop for insurance Visit HealthCare.gov or call the federal health insurance marketplace, 1-800-318-2596, to compare plan prices.\nThere\u2019s the $1,078 bill for one night Michael Sefcik spent at Trident Medical Center after he suffered a stroke in December and another one, $2,374, for two subsequent nights at Medical University Hospital.\nHe had no health insurance.\nAll told, 41-year-old Michael Sefcik spent 15 days in two hospitals."}
