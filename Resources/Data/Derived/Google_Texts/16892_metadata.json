Donations to nonprofits are allowed to be kept confidential,\u201d Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, told The Daily Signal. \u201cHaving gone through the [IRS] targeting [of conservative groups] because our name is Tea Party Patriots, I\u2019m very sensitive to anything that expands the IRS\u2019 reach into nonprofits and who their donors are.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s campaign will push the grassroots to post comments opposing the proposed rule to the public record. Tea Party Patriots will also be launching its own page where visitors and supporters can express their opposition to the regulation.\n\nThe IRS proposed the rule in September, and the agency will accept comments from the public until Dec. 16.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that the IRS has successfully targeted organizations, and employees of the IRS have abused the power of the agency against people they perceive as political opponents,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHaving more information about who supports those organizations would give them the potential to continue the abuse of power and hurt the individuals, not just the groups. That\u2019s the danger of it.\u201d\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, joined Martin in opposing the proposed rule. In an interview with The Daily Signal, von Spakovsky cited a lawsuit the National Organization for Marriage filed against the IRS alleging that an official with the tax agency leaked a copy of confidential tax information listing the group\u2019s donors. The IRS paid the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 to settle the suit.\n\n\u201cJust think if they had leaked not only the names of the donors, but Social Security numbers,\u201d von Spakovsky said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the government to have that information, and there\u2019s no reason for them to have that information.\u201d\n\nThe proposed regulation from the IRS would make it optional for nonprofits to collect the Social Security numbers of donors of more than $250. However, Martin fears that the regulation would eventually become mandatory and affect not just nonprofits with political leanings, but also smaller groups located outside the political arena.\n\nSuch increased regulations on those smaller groups, she said, could have negative consequences.\n\n\u201cSmall Junior Leagues or civic organizations around the country would also wind up being affected, and not just Tea Party groups, but civic groups have to keep information secure,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt adds to the bookkeeping process and would have a negative effect on organizations that are designed to help make communities better.\u201d\n\nThe push for opposition to the IRS\u2019 proposed rule comes as Congress confronts a slew of deadlines. By mid-December, lawmakers are expected to pass a reconciliation bill repealing parts of Obamacare, extend the Highway Trust Fund, and pass a $1.1-trillion omnibus spending package.\n\nDespite the focus on the trio of bills, Martin urged members of the conservative movement to \u201ctake a stand and make their voices heard on this important issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This Tea Party group is fighting back.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This Tea Party group is fighting back.", "title": "IRS Wants Nonprofits to Collect Donors\u2019 Social Security Numbers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151201_TPPIRSRule_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-02T06:50:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OE1Pv5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This Tea Party group is fighting back.", "title": "IRS Wants Nonprofits to Collect Donors\u2019 Social Security Numbers", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151201_TPPIRSRule_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2015-12-02T03:01:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T06:50:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Internal Revenue Service, Tea Party, Tea Party Patriots, IRS, Jenny Beth Martin, Hans von Spakovsky, donor disclosure"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca40e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cJust think if they had leaked not only the names of the donors, but Social Security numbers,\u201d von Spakovsky said.\nTea Party Patriots will also be launching its own page where visitors and supporters can express their opposition to the regulation.\nThe IRS proposed the rule in September, and the agency will accept comments from the public until Dec. 16.\nDonations to nonprofits are allowed to be kept confidential,\u201d Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, told The Daily Signal.\nThat\u2019s the danger of it.\u201dHans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, joined Martin in opposing the proposed rule."}
