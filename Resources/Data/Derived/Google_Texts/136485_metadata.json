A detailed look at who they are is expected to be released Thursday.\n\nNationally, two-thirds of Americans had private insurance, while 36.5 had some form of government insurance - whether Medicaid (19.5 percent) or Medicare (16 percent.)\n\nThe largest source of insurance, however, was employers, with 55.4 percent of Americans acquiring coverage through their jobs. Another 14.1 percent bought insurance themselves, directly through their carrier.\n\nThe report had some good news for the state, said Ray Castro, senior policy analyst for the New Jersey Policy Perspective.\n\n\"After more than a decade of businesses dropping health insurance for their workers, the number of New Jerseyans with employer-based coverage increased by 42,000 in 2014,\" he said. At least in New Jersey, fears that Obamacare would trigger a wave of employers ending coverage of their employees has not come to pass, he said.\n\nSo who are the New Jersey residents who remain without health insurance, despite the tax penalty for that approach?\n\nMiddle-class people who felt they couldn't afford health insurance before the ACA went into effect might have qualified for a federal subsidy to offset some of the cost, \"But they'd still have to pay money for that,\" Castro said. \"And from the beginning, that was never a priority on how to spend their money.\"\n\nLatinos remain under-represented in their coverage. While some of this is because of their immigration status, some of it also reflects a fear that if a legal resident applies for Obamacare, it might draw attention to another household member who is here illegally, Castro said.\n\nNew Jersey's rate of uninsured may be still high compared to its neighbors because our rate here was higher even before the Affordable Care Act, Castro said.\n\n\"In New Jersey, people were dropping private insurance in droves for years,\" he said. \"So we were always behind the eight ball because private insurance was so expensive.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "New Jersey, United States Census Bureau, health, living", "title": "Since Obamacare, N.J.'s number of uninsured keeps falling, Census says", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Since Obamacare, N.J.\\u0027s number of uninsured keeps falling, Census says\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2015/09/since_start_of_obamacare_njs_number_of_uninsured_c.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/18766420-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16964396\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-16T17:52:36Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@news\",\"@nj-politics\",\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/18766420-standard.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The estimated number of New Jersey residents who still have no health insurance has dipped below 1 million for the first time in years, according to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, September 16, 2015,  3:48 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"N.J\\u0027s number of uninsured keeps falling, Census says\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/7-aca0929photos-sciarrino-535c6cb2902011b7.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The estimated number of New Jersey residents who still have no health insurance has dipped below 1 million for the first time in years, according to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau.", "title": "Since Obamacare, N.J.'s number of uninsured keeps falling, Census says", "url": "http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2015/09/since_start_of_obamacare_njs_number_of_uninsured_c.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/18766420-thumb_square_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/OBrienLedger"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, September 16, 2015,  1:52 PM", "article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "The estimated number of New Jersey residents who still have no health insurance has dipped below 1 million for the first time in years, according to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau."}, "article_summary": "Nationally, two-thirds of Americans had private insurance, while 36.5 had some form of government insurance - whether Medicaid (19.5 percent) or Medicare (16 percent.)\n\"So we were always behind the eight ball because private insurance was so expensive.\"\nSo who are the New Jersey residents who remain without health insurance, despite the tax penalty for that approach?\n\"In New Jersey, people were dropping private insurance in droves for years,\" he said.\nIn total, 965,000 New Jerseyans remain without health insurance - which means 195,000 residents acquired insurance in 2014, the first year the Affordable Care Act went into effect."}
