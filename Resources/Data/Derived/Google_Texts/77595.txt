Mississippi Insurance commissioner Mike Chaney is reminding South Mississippi homeowners to get an insurance check-up before hurricane season starts.

Chaney was in Oak Grove Tuesday, speaking at a meeting of the Forrest/Lamar Republican Women.

He said now is the time to make sure you have enough homeowners insurance to make repairs after a storm.

"Do it now, don't put it off," said Chaney. "Check your insurance to be certain that things are covered. Look at your deductibles, if you have automobiles that you're worried about in a low area, park them where they are dry."

He added, "Have an evacuation plan, and most of all, be certain that you have an evacuation kit to get out if you need to get out."

Chaney also spoke about Obamacare premiums, rural fire protection, and workers compensation issues.
