Fire caused a small amount of damage to the Andover Taco Bell.

It happened just before 4 p.m. Sunday in the 200 block of North Andover Road, just north of Kellogg. Andover Fire Chief Chad Russell says when crews arrived on scene, they found heavy flames coming from a sign on the front of the business. Crews were able to quickly put the fire out.

Russell says the fire was mainly on the outside, but there is some minor fire and smoke damage inside of the restaurant. He says he believes the restaurant will be back open by Monday.

The cause is still under investigation, but appears to be electrical in nature. A damage estimate wasn't available at the scene.
