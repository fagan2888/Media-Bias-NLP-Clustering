I don\u2019t even know where to start. But as it's Constitution Day, let me unswervingly uphold the ideal of political and economic chaos, because it\u2019s enshrined in that noble document.\n\n\n\nI am tired of pundits blaming our political and economic ills on politicians\u2019 inability to get along. If lawmakers would only \u201cget together and work things out,\u201d their line of thinking goes, the economy would improve, unemployment would evaporate, and Americans could move on with their more prosperous, more fulfilled lives\n\nProgressives have a point when they argue that refusal to compromise on principle helped to end slavery, gain women the right to vote, and extend civil rights protections to all Americans. How, they ask, can you compromise on moral questions? And the question posed to that infamous gathering in 1789 was decidedly a moral one.\n\nOur Founders did not pledge to each other their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor simply to read Shakespeare while sipping low-tax East India Company tea.\n\nThe Founders did not value compromise for its own sake. Rather, they put their trust in distrust. All those \u201cshall nots\u201d in the Bill of Rights sprang from the Madisonian premise that human nature, and its resulting political institutions, are prone to sin, rather than virtue. Sound political and economic institutions, the Founders believed, should provide an arena for healthy debate, not work toward some trumped up \u201cconsensus.\u201d\n\nOur history books talk of the Great Compromise that led to our constitutional republic. But that same compromise also led to a Civil War that almost destroyed our nation and cost us nearly another century of slavery.\n\nNow, unanimity\u2014or something close to it\u2014may be important within a political system when it comes to serious matters like waging war. But that doesn\u2019t translate into a need for \u201cconsensus\u201d or \u2018\u201ccompromise\u201d in all aspects of the nation\u2019s life.\n\nAs a result, our political culture faces an interesting dichotomy. We tell our children never to compromise their principles, but we revere it when it comes to the political arena. And that reverence is divorced from reality. Consider a few examples.\n\nIn 1798, Rep. Matthew Lyon spit in the face of Rep. Roger Griswold after Lyon called Griswold a crook and Griswold called Lyon a coward.\n\nIn 1832, Texas Governor Sam Houston beat Rep. William Stansberry with a cane right on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. Stansberry tried to shoot Houston, but his gun misfired.\n\nIn 1850, the Senate adjourned for the day after Sen. Henry Foote pointed a pistol at Sen. Thomas Hart Benton. And in 1857, Preston Brooks of South Carolina beat Charles Sumner of Massachusetts with a cane within inches of his life.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the simmering hatred between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, or the irrevocably shattered relationship between George Washington and George Mason. Their feuds were not predicated on personal injury or theft, but in passionate beliefs about the role of central government in the lives of its citizenry.\n\nI\u2019m not saying bring back the duel. I\u2019m saying those who think today\u2019s political climate is particularly poisoned have neglected their history.\n\nToday, we argue with op-eds, policy papers, debates, and media appearances, trying to sway public opinion. The Founders would be pleased.\n\nPolitics is not about settling arguments; it\u2019s about winning them. But winning should be hard.\n\nThe process of adding laws ought to be cumbersome and difficult and clunky. That\u2019s one machine that does not need to be efficient.\n\nYes, this makes it difficult to pass big, comprehensive legislation. But considering the legislation that has passed in recent years\u2014the Affordable Care Act, the stimulus that didn\u2019t stimulate, the Dodd-Frank financial \u201creform\u201d law that launched a thousand regulations\u2014this ought not be viewed as a bad thing. When it comes to our political system, its propensity to catch sand in the gears is a feature, not a bug.\n\nAs for Wheeler\u2019s proposal, I\u2019m going with Ben Franklin\u2019s republic on this one. And, yes, I believe we can still keep it.\n\nLawson Bader is president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values,/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/First Amendment,/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Bill of Rights", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-01 06:43:50 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Today, on Constitution Day, and every day, we argue with each other through op-eds, policy papers, debates, and media appearances, trying to sway public opinion. \u00a0The Founders would be pleased.", "twitter": {"description": "Today, on Constitution Day, and every day, we argue with each other through op-eds, policy papers, debates, and media appearances, trying to sway public opinion. \u00a0The Founders would be pleased.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/17/on-constitution-day-reminder-that-political-economic-chaos-are-good-thing.html", "title": "On Constitution Day, a reminder that political, economic chaos are a good thing", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/First Amendment\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Bill of Rights\"],\"author\":\"Lawson Bader\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"On Constitution Day, a reminder that political, economic chaos are a good thing\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-17T14:34:21Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/17/on-constitution-day-reminder-that-political-economic-chaos-are-good-thing.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"2c3d69c9-b375-4abc-a49e-4b0631833a80\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Today, on Constitution Day, and every day, we argue with each other through op-eds, policy papers, debates, and media appearances, trying to sway public opinion. \u00a0The Founders would be pleased.", "dc.identifier": "2c3d69c9-b375-4abc-a49e-4b0631833a80", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "values,firstamend,rights", "description": "Today, on Constitution Day, and every day, we argue with each other through op-eds, policy papers, debates, and media appearances, trying to sway public opinion. \u00a0The Founders would be pleased.", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "On Constitution Day, A Reminder That Political, Economic Chaos Are A Good Thing", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-01 06:43:50 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Today, on Constitution Day, and every day, we argue with each other through op-eds, policy papers, debates, and media appearances, trying to sway public opinion. \u00a0The Founders would be pleased.", "title": "On Constitution Day, a reminder that political, economic chaos are a good thing | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/17/on-constitution-day-reminder-that-political-economic-chaos-are-good-thing.html", "image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-09-17", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/First Amendment\",\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Bill of Rights\"],\"author\":\"Lawson Bader\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"On Constitution Day, a reminder that political, economic chaos are a good thing\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-17T14:34:21Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/09/17/on-constitution-day-reminder-that-political-economic-chaos-are-good-thing.html\",\"post_id\":\"2c3d69c9-b375-4abc-a49e-4b0631833a80\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "dc.creator": "Lawson Bader"}, "article_summary": "But as it's Constitution Day, let me unswervingly uphold the ideal of political and economic chaos, because it\u2019s enshrined in that noble document.\nWhen it comes to our political system, its propensity to catch sand in the gears is a feature, not a bug.\nNow, unanimity\u2014or something close to it\u2014may be important within a political system when it comes to serious matters like waging war.\nIn 1798, Rep.
