(Photo: Daily Advertiser file photo)\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell has joined a group of 17 states\u2019 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.\n\nThe suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, asserts that the Obama administration violated the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the federal Administrative Procedure Act when it implemented the president\u2019s deferred action plan concerning the immigration status of millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe Take Care Clause mandates that the president take care that the laws be faithfully executed \u2014 not rewrite them or ignore them under the guise of some type of executive discretion,\u201d Caldwell said in a news release. \u201cWe will not tolerate this blatant violation of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nStates joining Louisiana and Texas in the lawsuit are Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal has sued Obama for allegedly forcing states to adopt Common Core State Standards.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2014/12/03/caldwell-joins-suit-obama-immigration-order/19864337/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell has joined a group of 17 states\u2019 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.", "og": {"site_name": "shreveporttimes.com", "description": "Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell has joined a group of 17 states\u2019 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.", "title": "Caldwell joins suit over Obama immigration order", "url": "http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2014/12/03/caldwell-joins-suit-obama-immigration-order/19864337/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/shreveporttimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell has joined a group of 17 states\u2019 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.", "title": "Caldwell joins suit over Obama immigration order", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d936361c9a477b4765892133018244693b106c4b/c=211-0-1389-1178&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Shreveport/2014/12/03/B9315364280Z.1_20141203194045_000_GN29AEC10.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@shreveporttimes", "site": "@shreveporttimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898368928", "fb": {"app_id": 170028863032820}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Louisiana Attorney general candidate James D. \" Buddy\" Caldwell has joined a lawsuit against President Barack Obama for his executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.\nBobby Jindal has sued Obama for allegedly forcing states to adopt Common Core State Standards.\n(Photo: Daily Advertiser file photo)Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell has joined a group of 17 states\u2019 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders allowing undocumented immigrants a chance to stay in the United States.\n\u201cThe Take Care Clause mandates that the president take care that the laws be faithfully executed \u2014 not rewrite them or ignore them under the guise of some type of executive discretion,\u201d Caldwell said in a news release.\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2014/12/03/caldwell-joins-suit-obama-immigration-order/19864337/"}
