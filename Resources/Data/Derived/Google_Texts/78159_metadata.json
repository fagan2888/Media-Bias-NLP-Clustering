Jordan has been among Washington\u2019s staunchest allies in the Middle East for decades, and this move makes them not only an ally of Russia in the fight against ISIS, but also of Iraq and Iran. Jordan is also part of the coalition the U.S. leads to carry out air strikes against Islamic State positions.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s pants just dropped a few more inches below its knees. It\u2019s now perfectly evident that its default position is non-cooperation with Russia on any question and in any circumstance.\n\nIt\u2019s not because of a Russia policy, a Syria policy or even a foreign policy of any kind. It\u2019s the plot line in a black hats-white hats Hollywood Western; even old friends aren\u2019t sitting still for it.\n\nWhen Russia began its air campaign in Syria a few weeks ago, the pundits in Washington, egged on by administration officials, all wrung their hands as to President Putin\u2019s true motives. The working assumption was they were sinister and, one-way or another, malevolent.\n\nThis view was always (1) simplistic and (2) embarrassingly wrong, as argued in this space from the first. Now consider Putin\u2019s remarks last week at the Valdai Club, a Russian variant of the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos.\n\nThe Russian leader ranked the Syria crisis as the third significant chance to build a wide-ranging strategic partnership between Russia and the West\u2014the first two being the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse and the post-September 11 fight against Islamic extremism. Lamenting those failures, he said, \u201cWe should not miss the chance again.\u201d\n\nRelated: Now We Know What Putin Is Up To In Syria\n\nAt this point, the more Russia reveals of its thinking on Syria, the more the more cringe making it is to watch the Obama administration cling to the line that if it\u2019s Russia\u2019s idea it\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nSergei Lavrov, Putin\u2019s foreign minister, gave an eventful speech as he convened with Secretary of State Kerry and the foreign ministers of Turkey and Saudi Arabia in Vienna last Friday. In an interview broadcast on Russian television Saturday, he repeated his two most startling points\u2014both of which put the U.S. administration squarely on the spot.\n\nOne, he said Syria should begin now to prepare for national elections\u2014presidential and parliamentary\u2014as early as next year. This is in keeping with Moscow\u2019s long-stated position that Syria\u2019s future must finally be left to Syrians once some semblance of order is restored.\n\nNote: Lavrov\u2019s point on elections followed by a couple of days Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s unannounced visit to Moscow for talks with Putin. While the Kremlin has long backed new Syrian elections, \u201cLavrov\u2019s comments were its most specific call for political renewal yet,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Syria Strategy: \u2018Scrambling\u2019 and \u2018Desperate\u2019 as Putin Takes Charge\n\nTwo, Lavrov also stated that Russian warplanes, which have so far flown nearly 900 sorties in Syria, are prepared to support rebels claiming membership in the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army\u2014if only the U.S. would tell the Russians where these rebels are. So far it refuses, and possibly for good reason.\n\nThe U.S. believes that the Russians are targeting the rebels purposefully in support of Assad. On September 30th, Russian aircraft bombed Syrian opposition fighters, some trained by the CIA.\n\nThe Reuters report described this as \u201ca shift in Russia\u2019s position,\u201d but I don\u2019t think so. Moscow still stands with many who maintain that there is little distinction between the FSA\u2014such as it may be, and this is unclear\u2014and any other Islamist militia active in Syria.\n\nAt this early moment, the offer to support the FSA appears to be more of a gesture to Washington. Or to put it another way, part of Moscow\u2019s apparent determination to call Washington\u2019s bluff.\n\nAnd so it has. What a position the administration is in as of this weekend.\n\nAre Obama\u2019s people now going to stand against a proposal for internationally supervised elections in Syria? Are they going to object that Russia\u2019s bombing America\u2019s guys while declining to tell the Russians where these guys are?\n\nRelated: Putin Begins Bombing in Syria, but ISIS Isn\u2019t His Only Target\n\nThe pundits and wise men, meantime, shift into high gear on the Syria question. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. National Security Advisor, thinks we should \u201cdisarm\u201d\u2014read attack\u2014Russian naval and air facilities in Syria because \u201cAmerican credibility is at stake.\u201d David J. Kramer, a former human rights expert in the State Department writes in The Washington Post that we should freeze the RT broadcasting network\u2019s assets in the U.S. And Pavel K. Baev at The Brookings Institution wants to bomb Hezbollah, which is part of the anti-ISIS alliance.\n\nIt amounts to flailing on the opinion pages.\n\nBy contrast, consider Stephen M. Walt\u2019s piece in the new edition of Foreign Affairs. Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard, points out that the Islamic State controls a GDP roughly equal to Barbados\u2019s and is too weak to pose a serious, prolonged threat. A patient policy of containment is thus the wise policy, in Walt\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cThis hands-off approach requires American leaders to remain cool in the face of beheadings, terrorist attacks, the destruction of antiquities, and other provocations,\u201d Walt concludes.\n\nSound thinking\u2014somewhere, finally.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Russia\u2019s advance into Syria proceeds, apparently with some early successes against", "title": "How Putin Put Obama in a Bind on Syria", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/26/How-Putin-Put-Obama-Bind-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-assad-putin_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/26/How-Putin-Put-Obama-Bind-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-assad-putin_2.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As Russia\u2019s advance into Syria proceeds, apparently with some early successes against", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not because of a Russia policy, a Syria policy or even a foreign policy of any kind.\nAs Russia\u2019s advance into Syria proceeds, apparently with some early successes against key targets, it starts to look as if Moscow is using the Syria crisis to force the Obama administration into a bind.\nRelated: Putin Begins Bombing in Syria, but ISIS Isn\u2019t His Only TargetThe pundits and wise men, meantime, shift into high gear on the Syria question.\nThe Reuters report described this as \u201ca shift in Russia\u2019s position,\u201d but I don\u2019t think so.\nOn Saturday, Jordan agreed to cooperate with Russia on their various air and ground campaigns against Islamic terrorists in Syria."}
