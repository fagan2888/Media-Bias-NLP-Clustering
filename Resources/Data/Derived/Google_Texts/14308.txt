Federal agents searched a Frontier Airlines plane at Denver International Airport on Saturday night in response to a possible security threat.

Shortly before Flight 552 arrived in Denver from San Diego at 8:45 p.m., someone reported a possible security threat, DIA spokesman Heath Montgomery said Sunday.

The plane was parked in a remote part of the airport while emergency responders searched the plane, Montgomery said.

“The airport provided buses for passengers, who were deplaned and brought back to the terminal,” Montgomery said.

The plane was held on a taxiway for several hours before it returned to a gate.

Montgomery referred questions about the nature of the threat to the FBI and Transportation Security Administration.

Representatives of both agencies said they had no information.

No one was hurt, and airport operations were unaffected.
