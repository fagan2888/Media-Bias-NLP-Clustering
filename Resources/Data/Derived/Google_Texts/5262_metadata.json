(Photo: Jim Matthews/Press-Gazette Media)Buy Photo\n\nAs Packers fans descend on Green Bay for the start of training camp, they undoubtedly will make Lambeau Field part of their visit.\n\nSome of them will be there for the first time; many others will be returning. What they\u2019ll find are renovations and changes to a stadium that has become a bucket list destination for many sports fans from Wisconsin as well as inside and outside the United States.\n\nFans this year will notice the renovated and improved entrance to the stadium and the expanded Packers Pro Shop. Parts of the Packers Hall of Fame are on loan to the Neville Public Museum in downtown Green Bay while a new hall is being built, but it\u2019s a necessary part of a bigger plan.\n\nThat bigger plan is to make Lambeau Field a viable, money-making professional football stadium for years to come.\n\nThe Packers front office is to be congratulated for appearing to be close to realizing that.\n\nThe work of the last several years has been funded without taxpayer money, though, we should point out that the 2003 renovation that made today\u2019s construction possible was partially funded through a Brown County 0.5 percent sales tax.\n\nIt has increased Lambeau Field\u2019s capacity to 80,750 \u2013 the second largest in the National Football League. While a team like the Jacksonville Jaguars is removing 9,000 seats, the team in the smallest NFL market has the second largest stadium, a season-ticket waiting list of 112,000, ranks ninth in total revenue and seventh in operating profits, and has an economic impact of $13.5 million per home game.\n\nThe actual construction work at Lambeau has had an added economic impact. Of the $166 million spent on the expansion project, about half of it was spent in Brown County, 89 percent in Northeastern Wisconsin and 95 percent in Wisconsin. The $144 million South End Zone project resulted in 3,000 jobs and $130 million in wages.\n\nThe Packers have not only turned Lambeau Field into an ultimate game-day experience, but they have made it a year-round destination.\n\nWhen the expansion project is complete, the Packers will be in a good position stadium-wise for the foreseeable future because of the wise decisions in the past \u2013 renovating Lambeau in 2003 \u2013 and the present \u2013 continued expansion and improvements.\n\nThe Packers and their fans are unique to the NFL, and maintaining a professional team in the smallest market of perhaps any professional sports league in the world is not easily duplicated.\n\nIt takes a storied tradition \u2013 which the Packers have, which the front office has nurtured over the years and which the team must continue to honor \u2013 and a devoted fan base.\n\nThe fans are integral to continued success. As they arrive in Green Bay over the next month to catch training camp, we believe they will be as impressed by the changes at Lambeau Field as we are with by their devotion.\n\nWHEN THE DUST SETTLES ...\n\nThe Green Bay Packers will have added 7,000 seats to Lambeau Field, added new video boards and sound system, completed new players facilities and improved behind-the-scenes infrastructure, expanded the Oneida Nation Gate, added the American Family Insurance Gate on the east side, expanded the Pro Shop, renovated Harlan Plaza, expanded the Packers Hall of Fame, and relocated and re-conceptualized the restaurant.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1rHYZME", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Renovation and expansion at Lambeau Field enhance it as a bucket-list destination", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Renovation and expansion at Lambeau Field enhance it as a bucket-list destination", "title": "Packers upgrade fans\u2019 experience at Lambeau", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/07/26/packers-upgrade-fans-experience-lambeau/13208229/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Renovation and expansion at Lambeau Field enhance it as a bucket-list destination", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/da8dac9621775e2cd770a90d3f780638d64992b6/c=746-0-3155-2409&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/07/26/-lambeau5.jpg20140722.jpg", "title": "Packers upgrade fans\u2019 experience at Lambeau", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ff8\"", "article_summary": "The Packers have not only turned Lambeau Field into an ultimate game-day experience, but they have made it a year-round destination.\n(Photo: Jim Matthews/Press-Gazette Media)Buy PhotoAs Packers fans descend on Green Bay for the start of training camp, they undoubtedly will make Lambeau Field part of their visit.\nFans this year will notice the renovated and improved entrance to the stadium and the expanded Packers Pro Shop.\nBuy Photo The new north face of Lambeau Field with the new Packers Pro Shop entrance, left, the Miller Gate, top, and the stadium bowl, right.\nThat bigger plan is to make Lambeau Field a viable, money-making professional football stadium for years to come."}
