Too wet, and the water pumped to Lake Granby fills the lake past capacity and it flows back to Windy Gap. The Windy Gap Firming Project proposes to \"firm\" this water supply by building Chimney Hollow Reservoir, which will hold water in wet years to use in dry years.\n\nThe project is about to enter preliminary design phase in which all the invested entities need to firm up their level of involvement. The project is planned to go out to bid in 2019. Construction would begin in 2020 and last until 2023.\n\nDollars and cents\n\nThe Windy Gap Firming Project is expected to yield on average 48,000 acre-feet of water.\n\nAn acre-foot of water is slightly less than 326,000 gallons, or enough water to cover an acre of land one foot deep.\n\nThe city of Longmont needs to decide whether to participate at the 6,000, 8,000 or 10,000-acre-feet level, with projected costs ranging from $28.2 million to $47 million if the city pays cash.\n\nThe City Council in the future could instead choose to issue debt to fund the project. Paying cash saves the city money in the long-term but would mean increasing water rates at higher levels sooner. Debt would incur slower, steadier rate increases, Longmont utilities financial analyst Becky Doyle said.\n\nTo date, Longmont has already spent about $2.96 million total on the project from two different water funds.\n\nWater rates are currently approved to rise 9 percent in 2017, 2018 and 2019. At 6,000 acre-feet of participation the rate increases wouldn't change and Longmont should have enough water to get through a 1-in-100-year drought, according to a city staff report.\n\nAt an 8,000 or 10,000 acre-feet participation level, rates would need to rise more than 9 percent per year over the next three years but the city would have more security in case demand increases beyond projections.\n\nA 2012 report titled the Water Demand Evaluation determined that 6,000 acre-feet of the Windy Gap Firming Project would meet Longmont's future needs.\n\nThe Longmont Water Board, meanwhile, recommended at its February meeting the city participate at the 10,000 acre-feet level.\n\nJohn Caldwell, a long-time Water Board member and former city councilman, said the Water Board felt 10,000 acre-feet is a sound investment.\n\n\"Looking down the road we need to have as much flexibility and as much water as possible,\" Caldwell said. \"In this part of the world, water is everything. This project is looking 25, 50, 100 years down the road. It's not just looking at tomorrow or the next day.\"\n\nCaldwell compared making the multi-million-dollar project decision to buying a house.\n\n\"If you've bought a house, then you know there's a certain size house or a house at a certain price point that you can comfortably afford. Or are you going to reach a little bit more and push a little farther in terms of investment?\" Caldwell said. \"We're not going to be reckless, but how aggressive or how hard are we going to push when the decision time comes?\"\n\nWater storage\n\nBoth Caldwell and Dale Rademacher, general manager of Longmont Public Works and Natural Resources, said the financing decision is up to the council, but water security is also an important piece of the discussion.\n\n\"From the Longmont staff's perspective, we are really wanting this to be a discussion between the water board and the City Council regarding the city's water supply needs and not get bogged down prematurely in the issue of cost,\" Rademacher said. \"The decision should be grounded first and foremost in what are the water supply needs of the city.\"\n\nLongmont currently has 31,700 acre-feet of raw water supply annually. The 2012 Water Demand Evaluation study said the city will need 32,720 acre-feet of raw water per year assuming no new high water users, no climate variability impacts and other factors.\n\nIncluding the Windy Gap Firming Project, Longmont has five remaining viable options for increasing the raw water supply. Of those five, water conservation is the most cost-effective and is ongoing.\n\nOut of the other four \u2014 raising the Ralph Price Reservoir, raising Union Reservoir, purchasing more Colorado Big Thompson units and the Windy Gap Firming Project \u2014 the firming project is the most cost-effective per acre-foot. Additionally, Windy Gap is the only one of the major projects to have completed permitting. The Windy Gap Firming Project started the federal permitting process in 2003 and has all but one necessary permit from the Army Corp of Engineers.\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29660166/longmont-council-decide-commitment-level-windy-gap-firming", "modificationDate": "2016-03-19T12:09:41-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2016/0319/20160319_120900_wind table_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Karen Antonacci \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "It's time for  Longmont to decide how much of the massive $387.36 million Windy Gap Firming Project it wants to fund.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29660166:view"}, "startDate": "2016-03-19T12:07:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29660166/longmont-council-decide-commitment-level-windy-gap-firming", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2016/0319/20160319_120900_wind table.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It's time for  Longmont to decide how much of the massive $387.36 million Windy Gap Firming Project it wants to fund.", "title": "Longmont council to decide commitment level to Windy Gap Firming Project"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "It's time for  Longmont to decide how much of the massive $387.36 million Windy Gap Firming Project it wants to fund.", "title": "Longmont council to decide commitment level to Windy Gap Firming Project", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29660166/longmont-council-decide-commitment-level-windy-gap-firming", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2016/0319/20160319_120900_wind table.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-19T12:07:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2026-03-19T12:07:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont council to decide commitment level to Windy Gap Firming Project", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Karen AntonacciStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2016/0319/20160319_120900_wind table.jpg", "pubDate": "2016-03-19T12:10:19-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Out of the other four \u2014 raising the Ralph Price Reservoir, raising Union Reservoir, purchasing more Colorado Big Thompson units and the Windy Gap Firming Project \u2014 the firming project is the most cost-effective per acre-foot.\nIncluding the Windy Gap Firming Project, Longmont has five remaining viable options for increasing the raw water supply.\nThe Windy Gap Firming Project started the federal permitting process in 2003 and has all but one necessary permit from the Army Corp of Engineers.\nThe Windy Gap Firming Project aims to make the water supply for 10 Front Range municipalities, a power authority and two water districts more reliable.\nDollars and centsThe Windy Gap Firming Project is expected to yield on average 48,000 acre-feet of water."}
