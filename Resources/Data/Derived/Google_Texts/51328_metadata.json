Others say the low wages have not actually caught up with inflation and the cost of living has long surpassed the wage.\n\nCompanies in Arkansas with more than four employees and $500,000 in annual revenue were already required to pay at least the federal minimum of $7.25.\n\nWith the passage of Issue No. 5 during Tuesday\u2019s general election, the state minimum wage for employees will rise from $6.25 an hour to $7.50 on Jan. 1. This will be followed by increases to $8 an hour on Jan. 1, 2016, and $8.50 on Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nShowing just how slippery the issue is, neither the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce nor the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce took an official stance on the minimum-wage issue.\n\nHowever, if the number of job applications to McDonald\u2019s is any indication of how well the economy is doing, Fort Smith\u2019s job market has rebounded and it is a non-issue.\n\nApplications to area McDonald\u2019s restaurants have come to a halt, which leads local franchise owner/operator Michael Hadley to believe the Fort Smith market is offering more higher-paying jobs. Hadley said his franchise\u2019s average wage was over $8.50 an hour.\n\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s pays quite a bit above the minimum wage already,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cSo, those who were making more than minimum wage now will be barely above it.\u201d\n\nHadley, who owns four McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Fort Smith after building a new one on Old Greenwood Road, talked about the \u201cdomino effect\u201d of raising the minimum wage to touch off the need for raises on a sliding scale. He is crunching numbers to make adjustments for the Affordable Care Act, so he said he still does not know if the minimum-wage increase will raise restaurant prices.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is raise prices,\u201d Hadley added. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to stay competitive.\u201d\n\nStarting Jan. 1, restaurant owners paying tip pay of $2.65 an hour to servers will also need to bring pay up to meet the $7.50 mark on Jan. 1 if their servers don\u2019t receive at least that much in tips and base pay per hour, says Denise P. Oxley, legal counsel with the Arkansas Department of Labor.\n\nMiles Crawford, CEO of Go Ye Employment Services in Fort Smith, said the new wage rule\u2019s tiered increase will help small businesses with five to 10 employees more easily adjust to the higher wages, but it could lead to some negative consequences.\n\n\u201cGenerally, companies that are this small do not have enough existing clients to be able to minimally spread the increased labor cost among their clients,\u201d Crawford wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for their price increase to result in a small business, with five to 10 employees, losing a contract to other companies who more capable to spread the cost more efficiently.\u201d\n\nThe federal minimum wage was last raised in 2006 from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 in annual steps as part of a package deal to cut inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor for President Bill Clinton, stated in April at his website RobertReich.org that if the minimum wage of 1968 had stayed even with inflation, it would be more than $10 an hour today.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arkansas employers will find out over the next year how much raising the state minimum wage will affect their balance sheet, but opinions vary on the move as a tool of inflationary adjustment.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "Arkansas employers will find out over the next year how much raising the state minimum wage will affect their balance sheet, but opinions vary on the move as a tool of inflationary adjustment.", "title": "Election 2014: Arkansas Minimum-Wage Increase Draws Varied Views", "url": "http://swtimes.com/elections/election-2014-arkansas-minimum-wage-increase-draws-varied-views", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_EarlyVoters4_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/elections/election-2014-arkansas-minimum-wage-increase-draws-varied-views", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_EarlyVoters4_0.jpg"}, "title": "Election 2014: Arkansas Minimum-Wage Increase Draws Varied Views", "description": "Arkansas employers will find out over the next year how much raising the state minimum wage will affect their balance sheet, but opinions vary on the move as a tool of inflationary adjustment.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1264377", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1264377", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Elections,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-06T04:35:07-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "5 during Tuesday\u2019s general election, the state minimum wage for employees will rise from $6.25 an hour to $7.50 on Jan. 1.\nSome say that while increasing the minimum wage puts more money in the hands of low-wage workers who need it, it also can push up prices for consumers.\nShowing just how slippery the issue is, neither the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce nor the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce took an official stance on the minimum-wage issue.\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s pays quite a bit above the minimum wage already,\u201d Hadley said.\nThis will be followed by increases to $8 an hour on Jan. 1, 2016, and $8.50 on Jan. 1, 2017."}
