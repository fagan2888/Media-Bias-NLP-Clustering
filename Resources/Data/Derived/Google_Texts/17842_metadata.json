It was like taking a 28-0 halftime lead at the Super Bowl.\n\nA couple more racers came down to fill the gap, but Ligety still has a commanding lead of 0.93 seconds going into the second run. At this point the race is his to lose in a second run that begins at 3:30 a.m. Denver time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of races where I\u2019ve had this kind of lead, and a pretty good track record maintaining that and winning those,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to take the mega-risks. If I was only winning by two-hundredths, you\u2019d have to take big risks on some of those rolls in order to gain every 10th of time. A 10th isn\u2019t super important right now, but it\u2019s really important to still go as hard as you can the sections that you can.\u201d\n\nLigety said the course isn\u2019t difficult technically, but it is a tactical challenge because of some terrain changes that have to be skied intelligently.\n\n\u201cI was trying to be smart over those big tactical terrain changes,\u201d Ligety said, \u201cand then push as hard as I could in the sections where I knew I could take some risks and knew I had to push hard.\u201d\n\nAt one point he hit his edges hard in what appeared to be a possible mistake, but he was deliberately sacrificing speed there to set himself up for the terrain that followed.\n\n\u201cI was trying to ditch some speed coming over those rolls, because snow contact is super key in order to be able to look for speed down those pitches,\u201d Ligety said. \u201cI maybe ditched a little more than I\u2019d like to, but it was definitely advantageous from the standpoint of not being too risky.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ted Ligety has commanding lead in giant slalom going into second run", "title": "Ted Ligety has commanding lead in giant slalom going into second run", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/18/ted-ligety-has-commanding-lead-in-giant-slalom-going-into-second-run/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219__ted-ligety-gsp1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140219__ted-ligety-gsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-19T02:54:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:20:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca575\"", "article_summary": "A couple more racers came down to fill the gap, but Ligety still has a commanding lead of 0.93 seconds going into the second run.\nAt this point the race is his to lose in a second run that begins at 3:30 a.m. Denver time.\nWith his top four pursuers already in the finish, Ligety blew them away by 1.3-1.4 seconds, an enormous margin in GS.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of races where I\u2019ve had this kind of lead, and a pretty good track record maintaining that and winning those,\u201d Ligety said.\nIt was like taking a 28-0 halftime lead at the Super Bowl."}
