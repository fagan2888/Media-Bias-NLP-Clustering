And investors responded by sending the stock soaring.\n\nHow Deutsche Bank got into trouble is an interesting story. But the assumption that their government would find a way to help them out of it suggests that the largest global banking institutions remain dependent on taxpayer support. And the best way to fix that is to make giant banks a thing of the past.\n\nRelated: How the Government Is Rolling Over for Big Banks Again\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s suffering has roots in the recent global market turmoil, which has particularly affected bank stocks. Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price has fallen over 40 percent since the beginning of the year, as commodity prices and emerging market woes made for a brutal start to 2016. The market plunge comes right when the firm is reorganizing its investment banking unit, and lower returns make that costly. Continued litigation over various incidents \u2014 mortgage-backed securities fraud, foreign exchange rate manipulation, money laundering \u2014 also hampers Deutsche\u2019s outlook.\n\nOn Monday, the company released a short statement insisting that it would be able pay 350 million euros of contingent convertible capital (known as CoCo) interest payments by April 30. Since nobody was really asking the firm whether it would have the capacity to pay those debts, the insistence signaled significant nervousness.\n\nCoCo bonds actually grew out of the financial crisis. European regulators created them to give banks flexibility in times of trouble. The bonds convert into common equity, or get written down, if a bank doesn\u2019t have enough capital on hand to satisfy the interest payments. This way, investors take some of the haircut, rather than getting paid in full after government bailouts.\n\nDespite the logic, no bank has skipped CoCo payments before. And the experience of Deutsche Bank suggests that banks don\u2019t want to, probably because failure to pay would signal disastrously low capital levels, leading to a panicked run on their funding sources. That\u2019s especially true because CoCos have become a prolific asset class, with 91 billion euros invested since mid-2013 (Deutsche Bank itself was issuing new CoCo bonds as recently as last October). Until this market stress on banks, they produced a healthy return, higher than the current low-yield environment. But now much of that return has been wiped out.\n\nRelated: Banks Eye More Cost Cuts Amid Global Growth Concerns\n\nSo Deutsche went to great lengths to try and restore market confidence. Their co-CEO called the firm \u201cabsolutely rock solid\u201d in a memo to employees a day after the assurance on the CoCo payments. Investors didn\u2019t get the message until word leaked that Deutsche would consider buying back bonds to reduce debt and make their capital ratio look better, thus ensuring the CoCo payments. The bank announced Friday morning that it would buy back $5.4 billion in debt. In response, its stock price shot up more than 11 percent. As Bloomberg View\u2019s Matt Levine pointed out before the move was announced, it's kind of crazy that Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan \u2014 including using euros to buy back bonds, thereby reducing liquidity or the ability to immediately pay back debts \u2014 would relieve investor concerns.\n\nMaybe investors were thinking something more akin to what John Mack, the former CEO of Morgan Stanley, had to say on Bloomberg on Wednesday. \u201cThis idea that I heard yesterday, the possibility of not making their interest payments, it\u2019s just absurd,\u201d Mack said. \u201cThe government will not let that happen.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s basically a straight-up case for too big to fail, from the former leader of one of America\u2019s too-big-to-fail banks. And Mack posited that Germany would never abandon its largest bank. \u201cThe bank\u2019s name is Deutsche Bank. It\u2019s the German bank,\u201d he concluded. \u201cPolitically, they will stand up, if they need a safety net, and give it to them.\u201d\n\nThat backstop \u2014 the idea that governments would never let a major bank fail \u2014 was supposed to be dissolved in this round of financial regulation. And you can point to many studies and analyses claiming that it\u2019s gone. But those facts and figures only mean something in a moment of crisis. And at least for Deutsche Bank, we\u2019re in that moment.\n\nIn fact, this is not just a Deutsche problem. It\u2019s become a symbol in recent days for a more generalized stress in bank stocks. That stands to reason, because the financial system remains hopelessly interconnected, and damage at Deutsche Bank is sure to produce collateral damage in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Bank Sell-Off Casts Shadow on Europe's Fragile Recovery\n\nThe threat of tougher sledding for the global economy makes more interest rate hikes unlikely, which hurts banks. And the oil price collapse is causing a wave of energy-related defaults on bank loans. But the counter-party risks from Deutsche Bank and its European colleagues are real. And if Europe is in another \u201cdoom-loop,\u201d with bank stress and government debt stress playing off each other, that can bleed out to the American economy.\n\nIf the CoCo bonds that European regulators set up to tamp down panics aren\u2019t working, the parties involved are forced to look at alternatives. And sitting out there, as whispered by John Mack, is the potential of a bailout. This is supposed to be impossible under new European banking rules, but maybe the chaos of a run on Deutsche Bank is seen as more impossible. And that picture is broadly similar in the United States.\n\nThe banking industry remains extremely profitable. And the rules put in place to try to make the system more stable and secure may work to a certain extent. But the only way to truly know about their strength is when they\u2019re tested, not in theories and postulates but in the real world. The Deutsche Bank lesson suggests that the only way to truly ensure that a bank isn\u2019t too big to fail is not to let banks become too big.\n\nThis article was updated to reflect Deutsche Bank's debt buyback announcement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every confident prediction from Dodd-Frank boosters that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is a thing", "title": "The Deutsche Bank Saga Proves We Haven\u2019t Fixed Too Big to Fail", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/12/Deutsche-Bank-Saga-Proves-We-Haven-t-Fixed-Too-Big-Fail", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/germany-deutsche-bank_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/12/Deutsche-Bank-Saga-Proves-We-Haven-t-Fixed-Too-Big-Fail", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/germany-deutsche-bank_2.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Every confident prediction from Dodd-Frank boosters that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is a thing", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a9d\"", "article_summary": "Every confident prediction from Dodd-Frank boosters that \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is a thing of the past must contend with what happened to Deutsche Bank this week.\nThe Deutsche Bank lesson suggests that the only way to truly ensure that a bank isn\u2019t too big to fail is not to let banks become too big.\nHow Deutsche Bank got into trouble is an interesting story.\nBut the counter-party risks from Deutsche Bank and its European colleagues are real.\nThis is supposed to be impossible under new European banking rules, but maybe the chaos of a run on Deutsche Bank is seen as more impossible."}
