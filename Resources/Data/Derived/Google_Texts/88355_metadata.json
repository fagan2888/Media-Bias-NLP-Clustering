The concept of a \"central event\" featuring one of the composer's major vocal works has remained, but the \"festival week\" has essentially disappeared.\n\nThis year, that major work will be the St. Matthew Passion: It will be performed April 23 in an unprecedented collaboration with the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra, University of Colorado Choirs and Central City Opera in what promises to be the marquee classical event of the year.\n\nThe organization's own chorus, described by Carrettin as its \"heart and soul,\" also collaborates with the Phil in selections from Handel's \"Messiah\" on Dec. 20, in addition to taking part in the \"Passion.\"\n\nAnd Carrettin himself will serve as guest violin soloist with the Boulder Chamber Orchestra Dec. 4-5, a concert being cross-promoted between the groups.\n\nBut these collaborations, new and exciting as they are, form only a part of the festival's expanding process, which is also a sort of rebranding process. Five chamber-style programs are planned between October and May. With the demise of the \"festival week,\" the term \"festival\" itself is being de-emphasized, but not retired. Marketing has begun to refer to simply Boulder Bach.\n\n\"We're thinking about what we are and who we are becoming,\" Carrettin said. \"Part of the concept of Bach as a compass means thinking about the music that directly influenced him, and then his reach onward.\"\n\nJosefien Stoppelenburg created this painting to commemorate the Boulder Bach Festival's 35th season.

Harpsichordist and Bach expert Matthew Dirst plays solo pieces by Johann Jakob Froberger. Michiko Theurer, a Festival 2015-16 Artist-in-Residence, violinist and University of Colorado doctoral student Michiko Theurer. She and Dirst will play a \"stunning\" sonata by Dario Castello, and Carrettin will join Theurer in Biagio Marini's Sonata \"Sopra la Monica\" for two violins.\n\nMatthew Dirst will play harpsichord during the BBF's season-opening concerts. (Darren Sabino / Courtesy photo)\n\nSelect singers, dubbed the \"Boulder Bach Chamber Singers,\" will open with a 16th century madrigal by Jacob Arcadelt and will close the first half with a four-voice motet by J.S. Bach's older relative Johann Christoph Bach.\n\n\"He was revered before the Bach we know, and the piece is extremely powerful,\" Carrettin said.\n\nThe second half includes music by J.S. Bach himself.\n\nDirst joins BBF string players in the familiar D-minor Harpsichord Concerto. And, finally, soprano Josefien Stoppelenburg, who amazed audiences in February's B-minor Mass, sings the masterful Cantata 82, one of the composer's most beloved vocal works. Like the piece by the older Bach, it has a powerful text on the theme of death and its transcendence. Flutist Ysmael Reyes also plays a large part in the cantata.\n\nThe other four concerts are all in 2016. A Boulder-only, all-Bach event will be performed Jan. 22 at First Congregational Church on modern instruments.\n\nPianist David Korevaar plays three preludes and fugues from the second book of the \"Well-Tempered Clavier.\" Each pair will be followed by a piece for two or three instruments in the same key, including the great Trio Sonata from the late \"Musical Offering.\" Joining Korevaar are flutist Christina Jennings and violinist Harumi Rhodes, along with violist Matthew Dane. Rhodes is a new appointee to the CU faculty.\n\n\"Venice on Fire\" follows on March 18 at The Dairy Center Performance Space and March 19 at Stewart Auditorium. It is an all-Venetian baroque program played on electric string instruments. Carrettin said the electric instruments \"try to capture the acoustic of a stone chapel, an authentic acoustic space.\" Another thing they can do, he said, is \"blow the roof off.\"\n\nIn addition to instrumental works by Merula, Uccellini and Legrenzi, soprano Szilvia Schranz sings two vocal works, including an aria by Barbara Strozzi (one of the great female composers of the age) and a motet by Venice's greatest baroque composer, Antonio Vivaldi. That composer's concerto for two cellos is featured, and the concert concludes with a Sinfonia by his contemporary Tomaso Albinoni.\n\nThese Italians influenced Bach, Carrettin said. The other side, Bach's enduring influence, is explored in \"Romanticism Unveiled,\" a program to be played only in the Longmont auditorium on May 15. At the center is the 1895 Erard piano owned and played by Mina Gajic, Carrettin's wife and the BBF's director of education and outreach. The two are joined by hornist Thomas Jostlein in the 1865 Trio for Horn, Violin and Piano by Johannes Brahms. Jostlein specializes in the natural horn without valves and will play an instrument from Brahms's lifetime.\n\nThe performance of this tremendous trio on all-authentic 19th century period instruments is rare. It will be preceded by three songs by Brahms, performed by Gajic and soprano Amanda Balestrieri. She also sings an aria from a Bach cantata. Carrettin and Gajic open with a 19th century transcription of Bach's famous \"Air for the G String.\"\n\nThe season closes with a special event May 28 at Longmont's historic Ryssby Church, where many memorable Bach Festival concerts of the past took place.\n\n\"We are honoring the festival's past and future,\" Carrettin said.\n\nFeatured works are the D-minor Partita for violin, including the famous Chaconne finale, played by Theurer, along with the 4th Suite for Solo Cello, played by Featured Young Artist Robert Erhard, son of bassist and longtime BBF ensemble member Paul Erhard.\n\nAt Ryssby, Carrettin has invited Don Jaeger, the festival's founder and first conductor, to speak about his life with Bach and share special memories. Carrettin will in turn speak about the future of the Festival, \"looking in all directions, like a compass.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_28912662/boulder-bach-festival-35th-season-preview-2015-16", "sailthru.author": "By Kelly Dean Hansen \n \n  Camera Classical  Music Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28912662:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-04T06:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What was a concentrated event, with two or three concerts and other ancillary events within a week, is now a full-season classical organization.
