For the fourth quarter of 2014, the Dallas-based company posted $61 million in net income and earnings of $1.03 per share.\n\nWith full-year revenue increasing 48 percent to $16.6 billion, it was Tenet\u2019s strongest year in a decade, said president and CEO Trevor Fetter. \u201cOur strategies to capture incremental market share, combined with an improving economy and expanded health coverage, generated admissions growth that was among the highest in the industry.\u201d\n\n[Also: Fitch Ratings bullish on for-profit healthcare]\n\nInpatient admissions increased 2.4 percent year-over-year across Tenet\u2019s 80 hospitals and 200 outpatient sites, while total admissions including outpatients grew 3.5 percent. Last quarter, Fetter said, the company saw one of the strongest increases in same-hospital commercial volumes in more than a decade, with paying admissions increasing 6.1 percent.\n\nAlso, charity-related and uninsured admissions fell 18 percent from 2013 to 2014. In five of the 14 states where Tenet operates, Medicaid eligibility has been expanded under the Affordable Care Act and uninsured and charity admissions have dropped 62 percent. Across all of Tenet\u2019s states, Medicaid has also grown as a percentage of net patient revenue, from 9 percent in 2013 to 9.4 percent last year.\n\nAnother driver of revenue growth was Tenet\u2019s Conifer Health Solutions subsidiary, selling revenue cycle and value-based care management services. Conifer, a provider-agnostic service at use in Tenet and other facilities, saw revenue grow nearly 20 percent to $1.1 billion.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nConifer is being positioned as a service to help providers manage value-based initiatives, information technology problems like ICD-10 and quality reporting. Catholic Health Initiatives is one of the largest Conifer clients, with more than 90 of its hospitals using the company\u2019s patient access and financial services in a deal that runs through 2032.\n\nBut Tenet is also putting a major focus on partnerships, currently managing a dozen joint venture deals.\n\nLate last year, Tenet inked a joint-venture with Baptist Health System, in Birmingham, Alabama, with the company\u2019s Brookwood Medical Center and Baptist facilities.\n\nAs Fetter said in a conference call with investors, this kind of joint venture strategy could be a good alternative to simply acquiring more hospitals, which can bring regulatory and debt uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIf you want to end up owning, either a piece or the majority of really high quality assets that are going to be transformative in a market, that\u2019s going to increasingly require a JV approach,\u201d said Fetter, now in his 12th year as Tenet CEO. The Baptist hospitals \u201cwere not available for purchase.\u201d\n\nIn fact, one of Tenet\u2019s full acquisition plans recently went bust. The company was in talks to acquire the five hospital Eastern Connecticut Health Network, but ultimately decided not to move forward after concluding that state regulators conditions for the takeover were too strict -- including continuing all jobs, pay levels and services for five years.\n\nThe \u201cturnaround acquisition business market is still very much there,\u201d Fetter said, but \u201cthe ability to get into high-quality successful assets really requires a more creative approach.\u201d\n\nAmong other deals, Tenet is expanding its presence in Arizona through a joint-venture with Dignity Health and Ascension Health, the latter being the largest Catholic and nonprofit health system in the country.\n\nIn this joint venture, Fetter said, Tenet will be the \u201cmajority partner of management responsibility for all operations\u201d for the three hospitals in the Carondelet Health Network in Tucson. The deal connects the company to a larger state-wide health system in Arizona, including an accountable care organization that\u2019s already in the works with Dignity.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, this is a unique opportunity to extend our presence beyond Phoenix into the attractive Tucson market, and it\u2019s consistent with our strategy to create new, innovative models for patient care,\u201d Fetter said.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/tenet-makes-2014-turnaround-plans-more-joint-ventures-future", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tenet-Healthcare-HQ-google-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Inpatient admissions increased 2.4 percent year-over-year across Tenet's 80 hospitals and 200 outpatient sites.", "title": "Tenet makes 2014 turnaround, plans more joint ventures in future"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tenet-Healthcare-HQ-google-feature.gif"}, "title": "Tenet makes 2014 turnaround, plans more joint ventures in future", "description": "Inpatient admissions increased 2.4 percent year-over-year across Tenet's 80 hospitals and 200 outpatient sites.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Tenet Healthcare, the country\u2019s third largest for-profit hospital system, said it posted a profit in 2014 after losing $134 million in 2013, and intends to find new sources of revenue in joint ventures.&#13; After posting a $134 million loss 2013, Tenet Healthcare posted $12 million in profit for 2014.
