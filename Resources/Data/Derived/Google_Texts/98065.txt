Mary Burke

EDITOR: Would you like to meet the next governor of the state of Wisconsin in person? You can have this opportunity on Saturday. From 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., Mary Burke will be at the Elizabeth Inn & Convention Center in Plover (at the intersection of Interstate 39 and Highway 54). Join me there at the wine and cheese fundraiser to meet her and listen to her presentation.

Charlene Figge,

Stevens Point
