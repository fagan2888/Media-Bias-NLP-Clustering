If he wins in November, he would be transformed overnight into a Republican conquering hero, locally, nationally, and especially in Washington. After all, Wasserman Schultz is not your average member of Congress. She is the polarizing, gaffe-prone and currently embattled chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nPeople in the know doubt Kaufman can pull off a victory. \u201cEven with her history of gaffes and missteps, Joe Kaufman needs a miracle in this district to catch Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and it simply isn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d Kevin Derby, Senior Political Writer for the respected Florida political website, Sunshine State News, tells National Review Online. \u201cThis is a district where Democrats have an almost 2-to-1 registration advantage over Republicans and most voters simply aren\u2019t following what Wasserman Schultz said about Scott Walker or her problems leading the DNC.\u201d\n\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s 23rd District is gerrymandered in a way that defies geographic and community logic to produce that 2-to-1 registration ratio. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s congressional website poetically describes the district \u201cfrom the saw grass to the sea grass.\u201d\n\nIn non-Floridian terms, that translates west from the Everglades heading east to the Atlantic Ocean. Then, to ensure an over-abundance of Democrat voters and extra sea cash, the district heads south to a narrow barrier island known as Miami Beach.\n\nIn 2012, Wasserman Schultz won reelection for the fifth time with 63.2 percent of the vote. This November, the respected Cook Political Report projects her victory to be by a nine-point margin,\n\nBut Joe Kaufman rejects the conventional wisdom.\n\n\u201cPeople mistake her high name-ID for popularity,\u201d Kaufman says. \u201cWasserman Schultz is a huge figure nationally, but locally, she has stepped on toes.\u201d\n\nKaufman continues, \u201cThis year Democrats have no reason to come out and vote, and if they do, it will be to support Republicans.\u201d Kaufman bases that prediction on his door-to-door conversations with Democrat voters. He says voters who over the years have consistently supported Wasserman Schultz are now having a change of heart. \u201cI never hear the words, \u2018I like Debbie Wasserman Schultz,\u2019 Kaufman says. \u201cThere is no passion for her, only passion against her.\u201d\n\nKaufman\u2019s optimism is based on inroads he has made \u201cpeeling off votes\u201d from members of the two largest ethic groups in the district, Jewish and Hispanic residents.\n\nAnd there is another important variable at play. According to Kaufman, turnout could be especially low because the top two ballot races \u2014 the race for governor and Wasserman Schultz\u2019s congressional re-election \u2014 generate little enthusiasm.\n\nIn a move that perpetuates Florida\u2019s reputation for political wackiness, Charlie Crist, a one-time very popular former Republican Governor, is now running as a Democrat against the current and not-very popular Republican governor, Rick Scott.\n\nThe Scott-Crist faceoff is the most contentious of all the nation\u2019s gubernatorial races this cycle with the exception of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s re-election bid. No surprise that Hillary Clinton will be in Miami October 2 for a Crist fundraiser and Wasserman Schultz will be front and center hoping to benefit from the media after-glow.\n\nWasserman Schultz should be concerned about the likelihood that low Democrat turnout might hurt Crist\u2019s election prospects, and that the subsequent down-ballot fall-off might harm her sixth reelection bid.\n\nIn addition to the potentially negative effects stemming from the gubernatorial race, Kaufman thinks he holds an edge over Wasserman Schultz due to the unpopularity of Obamacare. Kaufman says he used to be \u201caccused of telling false information about the effects of Obamacare\u201d but now has been vindicated by the district\u2019s mostly Democrat voters, who are not pleased with how they have fared under President Obama\u2019s signature program.\n\nAlthough Kaufman is convinced he will be the next congressman from Florida\u2019s 23rd district, he has yet to persuade Republican Party chieftains in Washington \u2014 and he says they have not offered him any support or funding.\n\nThe race \u201cis not a priority with the National Republican Congressional Committee,\u201d Kaufman tells NRO, but that has not stopped him from formulating an innovative argument to earn the party\u2019s support.\n\nKaufman hopes to persuade the NRCC that if Wasserman Schultz were forced to focus more attention on her own reelection bid, that would reduce the time she could spend in her capacity as DNC Chairwoman, raising money and traveling to whip up support for embattled Democratic candidates. Distracting Wasserman Schultz with a real fight at home base might just help the GOP win control of the Senate, according to Kaufman\u2019s pitch.\n\nThough the NRCC has yet to buy that logic, Kaufman believes all the \u201canti-Debbie national stuff is weighing her down.\u201d\n\nNo debates have been scheduled, but Kaufman says he is pushing to make that happen.\n\nEven without debates, Kaufman is very proud of his efforts, saying that this is the first election where Wasserman Schultz \u201chas been challenged\u201d. The proof Kaufman offers is that Wasserman Schultz mentions his name \u201cin her e-mails and speeches.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaufman is a scrappy campaigner who will take the fight to her, but Wasserman Schultz has the edge when it comes to name recognition, constituent outreach, fundraising, and organization,\u201d Sunshine State\u2019s Derby tells NRO. \u201cThis is a secure Democratic district and Wasserman Schultz\u2019s recent problems aren\u2019t nearly enough to come close to sinking her. She\u2019ll win big in November.\u201d\n\nBut Kaufman is undeterred. \u201cWhen I win I will not be surprised,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember that guy who won against Eric Cantor; people said he had no chance too.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Myra Adams is a media producer and political writer.
