They include the Temple Hoyne Buell Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Denver Foundation, Rose Community Foundation, Chambers Family Fund, and the Cydney and Tom Marsico Family Foundation.\n\nJennifer Stedron, the group\u2019s executive director, compared Early Milestones\u2019 mission in the early childhood world to the Colorado Education Initiative\u2019s mission in the K-12 world. The latter group collaborates closely with the Colorado Department of Education and local school districts to incubate innovative programs.\n\nPHOTO: Micaela Watts\n\nBill Jaeger, vice president for early childhood initiatives at the Colorado Children\u2019s Campaign, said one of the challenges of early childhood work is that it touches on many different domains, including early learning, physical health, mental health, and family support.\n\n\u201cThat makes it incredibly difficult to work across the siloes we\u2019ve built,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMilestones has the opportunity to serve as this hub of information and a sort of conduit across these siloes.\u201d\n\nNational context\n\nIntermediary organizations like Early Milestones are relatively new. One of the country\u2019s first in the early childhood arena was the North Carolina\u2019s Partnership for Children, founded in 1994.\n\nLeaders from other states soon become so interested in the partnership\u2019s work that the group secured foundation dollars to provide technical assistance grants to states that wanted to improve their own early childhood systems. Colorado was one of the grantees.\n\nOne of the recommendations that emerged from that technical assistance process here in the early 2000s was the creation of an early childhood intermediary organization.\n\n\u201cI really see this type of organization as a partner with government, but it also plays a unique role in questioning the system and requiring accountability for children,\u201d said Karen Ponder, former president of the North Carolina Partnership.\n\nPonder estimated that 20 states have some kind of early-childhood intermediary organization, though they differ significantly in size, scope and structure.\n\nElsa Holgu\u00edn, president of the Early Milestones board and a senior program officer at Rose Community Foundation, said, \u201cThis whole concept of creating intermediaries is going to make more and more sense as time goes by.\u201d\n\nBruce Atchison, executive director of policy and operations at the Education Commission of the States, said while some other states have or are launching similar efforts, it\u2019s not widespread.\n\n\u201cI think what Colorado is doing is kind of in the forefront, in that it\u2019s a separate (non-profit). I think that\u2019s kind of exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be a nice model for other states if they\u2019re successful.\u201d\n\nThird leg of the stool\n\nEarly Milestones leaders describe the group as the critical third leg on the three-legged stool of early childhood infrastructure. In other words, without that leg the stool tips over.\n\nWhile there are different versions of the stool analogy, the other two legs are often state agencies and the local early childhood councils across the state.\n\nIn Colorado, one of the key state agencies overseeing programs for young children is the Office of Early Childhood, which was created in 2012 within the Department of Human Services. Meanwhile, the top of the stool is the Early Childhood Leadership Commission, a state advisory panel established in 2010.\n\nHolgu\u00edn said the creation of those two entities, along with an influx of early childhood funding in 2012 from the federal Race to the Top grant, were promising developments, but not enough.\n\nThere needed to be a non-profit group that could work as a convener and collaborator. Not only would it bring together government, philanthropy, the business community and other early childhood stakeholders, it would serve as a place to test ideas and programs.\n\nSince state government can\u2019t typically experiment with promising but unproven practices, Early Milestones can help fill that gap.\n\nStarting last fall, Holguin and other foundation leaders presented the concept to groups around the state. While some groups wanted more concrete details, she said there was near universal interest.\n\n\u201cEvery time we met with somebody\u2026at the end of every meeting, they would say, \u201cOh, and I have a project that I need you to do.\u201d\u2019\n\nThree projects underway\n\nWhile Early Milestones won\u2019t have its official unveiling until later this year, Stedron and her team already have three projects underway.\n\nFirst is an update of the Early Childhood Colorado Framework, which was first published in 2008. Since then, state and national developments like the Affordable Care Act and a new rating system for child care providers have come along, rendering the original version out of date.\n\nThe framework, which outlines the state\u2019s vision and strategy for achieving a strong early childhood environment, is meant to guide the work of local, regional and state leaders.\n\nSheryl Shusan, manager of the Early Childhood Leadership Commission, said Early Milestones played a vital role in facilitating the revision process.\n\nEarly Milestones has also developed an expansion plan for Project LAUNCH, a federally-funded program to improve early childhood mental health. That effort came out of a push by several health and early-childhood foundations to use local philanthropy dollars to expand the program\u2019s reach in Colorado.\n\nStedron said the organization\u2019s work to help plan Project LAUNCH\u2019s expansion is \u201ca great example of the intermediary\u2019s role as a thought partner\u2026someone to help accelerate what is a really good idea.\u201d\n\nThird, Early Milestones is conducting a national scan of state models for educating parents about the importance of and their role in their children\u2019s earliest years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been thrilling to embark on some of these projects as we\u2019re in development,\u201d said Stedron.\n\nChalkbeat Colorado is a grantee of the Walton Family Foundation, the Denver Foundation and the Rose Community Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chalkbeat", "description": "A new non-profit, called Early Milestones Colorado, launched recently with the goal of improving the state\u2019s early childhood systems.", "title": "New statewide early childhood non-profit launches", "url": "http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/co/2015/06/05/new-statewide-early-childhood-non-profit-launches/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/McGlone-kids-building-a-road.jpg?fit=500%2C300", "height": 300}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T17:15:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T17:15:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/McGlone-kids-building-a-road.jpg?fit=500%2C300&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd66ab\"", "article_summary": "A new non-profit backed by several influential foundations launched this spring with the goal of improving the state\u2019s early childhood systems.\nEarly Milestones has also developed an expansion plan for Project LAUNCH, a federally-funded program to improve early childhood mental health.\nSheryl Shusan, manager of the Early Childhood Leadership Commission, said Early Milestones played a vital role in facilitating the revision process.\nThey include the Temple Hoyne Buell Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Denver Foundation, Rose Community Foundation, Chambers Family Fund, and the Cydney and Tom Marsico Family Foundation.\nJennifer Stedron, the group\u2019s executive director, compared Early Milestones\u2019 mission in the early childhood world to the Colorado Education Initiative\u2019s mission in the K-12 world."}
