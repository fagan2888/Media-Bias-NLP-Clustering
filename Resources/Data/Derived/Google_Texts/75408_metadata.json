In his new release, Lewis, the bestselling author of \u201cThe Blind Side,\u201d Moneyball\u201d and \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d writes about what the book describes as \u201ca small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that, post-financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but less, and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what the reviews are saying about \u201cFlash Boys.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u201dBecause Mr. Lewis is at the helm finding clear, simple metaphors for even the most impenetrable financial minutiae, this tawdry tale should make sense to anyone. And so should its shock value. \u201cFlash Boys\u201d is guaranteed to make blood boil,\u201d The New York Times.\n\n\u2013\u201d\u201dFlash Boys\u201d is not as larky as \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d (1989), Mr. Lewis\u2019s memoir of working at Salomon Brothers during the lead-up to the 1987 crash, or as accessible as \u201cThe Big Short\u201d (2010), his jaw-dropping take on the subprime meltdown. It may end up more important to public debate about Wall Street than either, however, in exposing what one of his central characters calls the \u201cPandora\u2019s box of ridiculousness\u201d that financial exchanges have become,\u201d The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u2013\u201dHFT [High-Frequency Trading] is dangerous, I\u2019d like to see less of it, and I hope that Michael Lewis will help to bring it to wider attention. But my tentative verdict on Flash Boys (I\u2019ll write something longer once I\u2019ve finished the book) is that it actually misses the big problem with HFT, in the service of pushing a false narrative that it\u2019s bad for the little guy,\u201d Reuters.\n\nFollow me @cjfarley on Twitter and check out my new book \u201cGame World.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "\"Flash Boys,\" the new book by Michael Lewis, hit bookstores Monday after a surge of anticipation as powerful as a stock market rally.
