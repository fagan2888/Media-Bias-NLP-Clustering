They say the video offers no training and they wonder if what they were promised by city leaders was a lie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a training video, that\u2019s a whitewash,\u201d said Rice.\n\nDarold Killmer, the family\u2019s attorney in Emily\u2019s case, said the video directs the blame at Denver Health nurses and doctors, instead of deputies.\n\nThe video highlights at least six deputies by showing their photos, and claims they all went into the area where Emily was held the night she died.\n\nThe narrator says, \u201cAt least six different officers went into the north cluster on at least 25 occasions where Emily was held.\u201d\n\nThe video makes no mention of the four deputies disciplined after an investigation by the city\u2019s Independent Monitor in 2008 found they had falsified records to cover up their failure to make rounds on the night of Emily\u2019s death.\n\nTwo years after her death, her parents won a $7 million settlement from Denver Health and the city, but for the family it was about more than the money. Implementing policy changes, known as \u201cEmily\u2019s Protocols,\u201d in the Denver jail and \u201cEmily\u2019s Rights\u201d at Denver Health were a key part of the settlement.\n\n7NEWS obtained a copy of the video after a brutality lawsuit, filed by former inmate Jamal Hunter, appeared to show Emily\u2019s Protocols weren\u2019t being followed.\n\nRead the full story at 7News.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emily Rice\u2019s parents outraged by Denver sheriff training video \u2018whitewash\u2019", "title": "Emily Rice\u2019s parents outraged by Denver sheriff training video \u2018whitewash\u2019", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/24/emily-rices-parents-outraged-by-denver-sheriff-training-video-whitewash/", "image": {"width": 536, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__emily-ricep1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__emily-ricep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T21:41:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:19:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc3a\"", "article_summary": "A training video used for the last five years has been pulled by the Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department after a 7NEWS Investigation questioned its effectiveness.\nYet Emily\u2019s parents, Sue Garber and Roy Rice, are outraged after they watched the training video obtained by 7NEWS reporter Jennifer Kovaleski.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a training video, that\u2019s a whitewash,\u201d said Rice.\nImplementing policy changes, known as \u201cEmily\u2019s Protocols,\u201d in the Denver jail and \u201cEmily\u2019s Rights\u201d at Denver Health were a key part of the settlement.\nTwo years after her death, her parents won a $7 million settlement from Denver Health and the city, but for the family it was about more than the money."}
