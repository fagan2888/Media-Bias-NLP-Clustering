Legislation to repeal the Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 was introduced yesterday by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio.

The Keep Our Pension Promises Act of 2015 would prohibit trustees of multiemployer pension plans from reducing retireesâ€™ monthly benefits.
