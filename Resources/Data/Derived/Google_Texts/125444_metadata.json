His own bias against Republicans, he admits, prevents him from fully enjoying a Republican actor\u2019s performance. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 hard,\u201d said Affleck, \u201cto get people to suspend disbelief.\u201d\n\nAffleck said: \u201cWhen I watch a guy I know is a big Republican, part of me thinks, I probably wouldn\u2019t like this person if I met him, or we would have different opinions. That (bleep) fogs the mind when you should be paying attention and be swept into the illusion.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But how do you think conservatives feel?\n\nNearly every actor who cuts loose about politics, let alone campaigns for or donates to causes or politicians, almost always supports Democrats and liberal causes. Nothing wrong with this. But it\u2019s not even close to a fair fight. Of America\u2019s stars \u2013 old, young and in-between \u2013 the many who speak out are invariably Democrats.\n\nA Clint Eastwood is more than offset by the many performers like Cher, who said: \u201cIf you\u2019re black in this country, if you\u2019re a woman in this country, if you are any minority in this country at all, what could possibly possess you to vote Republican? \u2026 You won\u2019t have one f\u2013-ing right left.\u201d Or like Julia Roberts, who said, \u201cRepublican comes in the dictionary just after \u2018reptile\u2019 and just above \u2018repugnant.'\u201d Or Ed Asner, from Disney\u2019s film \u201cUp,\u201d who contributed his name and voice to a cartoon political ad showing a dastardly rich man literally urinating on the poor.\n\nSean Penn drips with contempt toward the awful guys on the other side.\n\nTea partiers, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says Penn, have a \u201cmental health problem\u201d which \u201cwould be solved by committing them\u201d to a psychiatric facility with an \u201cexecutive order\u201d from the president.\n\nWhy such a microscopic number of outspoken conservatives? Fear. Cuban-born actress Maria Conchita Alonso, for example, is a recent cautionary tale. Cast to star in the Latino version of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues,\u201d Alonso cut an ad for a California tea party \u201csecure the borders\u201d candidate. Big mistake. The play\u2019s theater, located in the heavily Hispanic Mission District of San Francisco, received threats to disrupt the performance \u2013 if Alonso remained in the cast.\n\nWhen Alonso \u201cquit,\u201d the play\u2019s producer shrugged: \u201cWe really can\u2019t have her in the show, unfortunately. Of course she has the right to say whatever she wants. But we\u2019re in the middle of the Mission. Doing what she is doing is against what we believe.\u201d Against what we believe?! How far is this from \u201cAre you now, or have you ever been \u2026 ?\u201d\n\nHow do you think conservatives feel?\n\nAffleck and his buddy, fellow A-lister Matt Damon, held fundraisers for the successful Senate races of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and for the election and re-election of President Barack Obama. Democrats all, or people who \u2013 to conservatives \u2013 are \u201cagainst what we believe.\u201d\n\nOf Hollywood\u2019s political contributions in the last two presidential election cycles, 86 percent went to Democrats in 2008 and 79 percent in 2012. More than 90 percent of contributions by celebrities to the 2012 presidential race went to Obama over Republican opponent Mitt Romney. The Wall Street Journal said, \u201c(DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey) Katzenberg wrote a $2 million check to jump-start Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting the president. His fundraising work has yielded as much as $7 million over the past five years.\u201d\n\nMiramax\u2019s Harvey Weinstein is another Democratic Hollywood power player and fundraiser. He, too, shows no reluctance to show his contempt toward the very people Weinstein counts on to pay to see his movies. His take on the congressional Republicans who opposed Obama during the government shutdown? \u201cSome of them are, you know,\u201d said Weinstein, \u201cunfortunately (racist).\u201d\n\nFor his book \u201cPrimetime Hollywood,\u201d conservative talk show host Ben Shapiro interviewed several major Hollywood primetime television producers \u2013 the people who make the fare we see. One after another, they saluted \u2013 even cheered \u2013 their hostility toward conservatives. Some bragged about injecting liberal messages in programming, while admitting they refuse to knowingly hire a conservative. One, Susan Harris, who created \u201cGolden Girls,\u201d called conservatives \u201cidiots\u201d with \u201cmedieval minds.\u201d\n\nMSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, formerly a \u201cWest Wing\u201d writer, explained why the show lacked sympathetic Republican characters: \u201cYou\u2019ll never, ever, get the Republican TV show. The Writers Guild of America, my union, is, at a minimum, 99 percent leftist liberal. \u2026 And we don\u2019t know how to write it. We don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGot that? Affleck can\u2019t stomach watching a Republican. \u201cWest Wing\u2019s\u201d O\u2019Donnell can\u2019t stomach writing about one. But Hollywood expects the audience to stomach them.\n\nDo bigmouth lefty actors think their skills override the audience\u2019s politics, that conservatives can \u201csuspend disbelief\u201d \u2013 even as Affleck admits he can\u2019t when the actor is a \u201cbig Republican\u201d?\n\nIf audiences gave left-wing actors, producers and studios the Maria Conchita Alonso treatment, half the country would never set foot in a theater. Hollywood, after all, oozes with \u201cbig Democrats\u201d whose politics, for much of the country, go \u201cagainst what we believe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/01/ben-affleck-i-cant-watch-big-republican-actors/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Democratic fundraiser/actor Ben Affleck \u2013 and the next big-screen \u201cBatman\u201d \u2013 recently gave an interview to Playboy.
