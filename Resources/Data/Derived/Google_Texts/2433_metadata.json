After all, 20 years ago, Republicans launched ludicrous witch hunts about alleged ancient Clinton misdeeds in Arkansas and even impeached a president over a sexual indiscretion. In other words, they attempted to overturn a legal election by abusing the oversight power of Congress. That\u2019s pretty extreme. And they so inured the country to their zealotry that, by the 2000 election, their \u201ctake no prisoners\u201d tactics in Jeb Bush\u2019s Florida were accepted with barely a protest. The media sagely advised everyone to get over it. And they did.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened ever since is an inexorable slide toward right-wing fanaticism, so much so that the House of Representatives is now paralyzed by a group of reactionary zealots who simply will not budge, no matter how many people disagree with them or how loathed they are by a majority. It\u2019s a very odd position for the GOP to be in. It has always been known as the more disciplined and mature of the two parties, devoted to hierarchy and order. Those days are long gone.\n\nThe modern conservative movement has been on the march since the late 1960s, and it reached the highest levels of power with the election of Ronald Reagan. But it wasn\u2019t until the mid-\u201990s and the election of Bill Clinton that they started to go a little mad. They had been led to believe that the Reagan era was going to be a 1,000 year reign, and they simply couldn\u2019t accept that a Democrat would once again be president. That it was some baby boomer hippie was simply more than they could bear.\n\nAnd yet the sad fact remains that, two full decades later, they have yet to pay a price for any of their acts of extremism. So why would they stop?\n\nSure, since 1995, they have only won the presidency twice (and the popular vote once). But after many decades of being in the minority in the Congress, they have cracked that nut and are now looking at decades of dominance in the House, and probably winning at least half the time in the Senate. Even though they\u2019ve only had two presidential terms out of the last six, they\u2019ve managed to keep the courts much more conservative than liberal. At the state level they are a juggernaut, dominating the majority of them and using their power to turn the laboratories of democracy into little political Manhattan Projects all over the country. They have transformed the media landscape with the help of deregulation and big money devoted to the right-wing cause. Their inability to legitimately win the White House and hold it isn\u2019t something they want exactly, but it isn\u2019t the worst outcome in the world. After all, it\u2019s not as if their agenda has been stymied. Tax rates are still low, the military is still powerful and the religious right is one the move. And after the Bush debacle, they may have realized that only having some of the power means never having to say you\u2019re sorry.\n\nHow did they go from being swashbuckling, conservative Reagan warriors wanting to \u201cmake America great again\u201d to mutinous revolutionaries determined to bring down the state by any means necessary? There are, no doubt, many reasons for it, from a highly influential demagogic media to the final realignment of the two parties after the civil rights movement. Certainly the ascension of the young Reagan backbenchers, led by Newt Gingrich, put the revolution in warp drive before it careened out of control.\n\nBut the recent emergence of the Tea Party right and the intransigent \u201cFreedom Caucus\u201din the House evinces an anarchistic spirit that even Gingrich couldn\u2019t have imagined. (And he has quite an imagination.) No this slash-and-burn style was modeled elsewhere, by an ultra-successful right-wing institution which continues to flex its muscle today: the NRA.\n\nThe NRA had once been a sportsman and safety organization, which took a turn toward the political back in the \u201970s, just as the conservative movement was gaining steam. By the \u201990s it had transformed itself into a potent political institution which perversely thrived when it was attacked, and built its clout by never giving an inch.
