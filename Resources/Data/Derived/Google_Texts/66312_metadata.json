More circular firing squad.\n\nFormer administration officials and Democratic operatives say President Obama is ill-served by his current White House staff and must reboot his second term team following the disastrous ObamaCare rollout. First-term insiders argue the White House\u2019s weakness was defined by a lack of preparedness, messaging blunders and failure to keep the president informed. They say Obama\u2019s team lacks depth after the departures of longtime advisers David Axelrod, David Plouffe, Robert Gibbs and Patrick Gaspard, and suggest new people must be brought on. \u201cYou basically have [White House senior adviser Dan] Pfeiffer and [deputy chief of staff] Rob Nabors running the show politically, and that\u2019s it,\u201d one former administration official said. In their place are a host of officials, including White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, senior adviser David Simas, Pfeiffer and Nabors, all of whom have been involved in trying to navigate a political storm first triggered by the launch of a website that was not ready.\n\nThere's no denying that it's amateur hour out there. McDonough was a CAP stooge rolled out to fill half a dozen roles none of which he appears to have any particular aptitude for. Pfeiffer's best skills are sneering and more sneering.\n\nBut that's really typical. Axelrod and Plouffe were experienced operators, but let's not pretend that the ridiculous Gibbs had anything to bring to the table. Or that the same arrogance wouldn't have led to the same results. On Axelrod's watch, Obama gave a speech defending a violent racist, said enough stupid things to pack an encyclopedia, including talking openly about wealth redistribution. They didn't fix anything. The media did. The media is slightly less eager to fix things now. Though it's still doing its part. But mostly the issue is that people have been hit in their pocketbooks now. The first former official singled out Pfeiffer for criticism in the handling of that blunder, which led to repeated apologies by Obama as the White House struggled with the story. \u201cThe thing that I hold Pfeiffer accountable for is, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep it,\u2019 \u201d the former official said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the breakdown occurred on that, but it\u2019s Obama\u2019s \u2018no new taxes\u2019 moment,\u201d the official said, referring to the broken promise that is widely seen as having cost President George H.W. Bush a second term. The official said it was \u201chard to be polite\u201d about the rollout: \u201cIt still escapes me how they f---ed up this badly on the president\u2019s and the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest legacy item in 20 years.\u201d\n\nSo throw Pfeiffer under the bus. But let's not pretend that there was a stable of geniuses that could have averted this. Team Obama was always arrogant and heedless of consequences. It may have just run out of road.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "\"It\u2019s Obama\u2019s \u2018no new taxes\u2019 moment,\u201d the official said", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "\"It\u2019s Obama\u2019s \u2018no new taxes\u2019 moment,\u201d the official said", "title": "Obama Operatives Begin Turning on Each Other", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/212133/obama-operatives-begin-turning-each-other-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:27-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/212133/obama-operatives-begin-turning-each-other-daniel-greenfield", "description": "\"It\u2019s Obama\u2019s \u2018no new taxes\u2019 moment,\u201d the official said", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Operatives Begin Turning on Each Other"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-02T05:35:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Former administration officials and Democratic operatives say President Obama is ill-served by his current White House staff and must reboot his second term team following the disastrous ObamaCare rollout.\nTeam Obama was always arrogant and heedless of consequences.\nThe first former official singled out Pfeiffer for criticism in the handling of that blunder, which led to repeated apologies by Obama as the White House struggled with the story.\nOn Axelrod's watch, Obama gave a speech defending a violent racist, said enough stupid things to pack an encyclopedia, including talking openly about wealth redistribution.\n\u201cYou basically have [White House senior adviser Dan] Pfeiffer and [deputy chief of staff] Rob Nabors running the show politically, and that\u2019s it,\u201d one former administration official said."}
