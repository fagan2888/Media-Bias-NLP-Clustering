The justice department said then that the decision to release Pistorius to house arrest was taken too early.\n\nThe review will take place a day after the deadline for Pistorius' lawyers to submit papers to the Supreme Court. Those papers will be in response to a separate appeal by prosecutors seeking a murder conviction. Prosecutors want a panel of judges to overturn Pistorius' culpable homicide, or unintentional killing, conviction and find him guilty of the more serious charge of murder.\n\nThat Supreme Court appeal will be heard in November.\n\nThe parole review board is made up of a judge, a member of the correctional services department, a state prosecutor, two members of the public and a person regarded as an expert in the correctional system, according to the Department of Correctional Services.\n\nUnder South African law, an offender is eligible for release after serving one-sixth of a jail sentence of five years or less \u2014 10 months in Pistorius' case.\n\nSouth Africa's justice minister blocked Pistorius' release because the parole board approved it in June when it should have waited until last Friday to meet.\n\n___\n\nChutel reported from Johannesburg.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "sports/articles", "keyword": "Collections: Sports", "title": "Pistorius parole board review set for Sept. 18", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/08/27/pistorius-parole-board-review-set-for-sept-18", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Oscar Pistorius' parole board review will take place on September 18, meaning the athlete will have to spend at least another three weeks in jail.", "title": "Oscar Pistorius parole board review set for Sept. 18"}, "twitter": {"description": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Oscar Pistorius' parole board review will take place on September 18, meaning the athlete will have to spend at least another three weeks in jail.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Pistorius parole board review set for Sept. 18"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: World,Collections: Top News,Associated Press,Collections: Sports", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Oscar Pistorius' parole board review will take place on September 18, meaning the athlete will have to spend at least another three weeks in jail."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b15\"", "article_summary": "South Africa's justice minister blocked Pistorius' release because the parole board approved it in June when it should have waited until last Friday to meet.\nBy GERALD IMRAY and LYNSEY CHUTEL, Associated PressCAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Oscar Pistorius' parole board review will take place on September 18, meaning the Olympic athlete will have to spend at least another three weeks in jail.\nThe justice department said then that the decision to release Pistorius to house arrest was taken too early.\nThe review will take place a day after the deadline for Pistorius' lawyers to submit papers to the Supreme Court.\nPistorius' family said in a statement Thursday that they had taken note of the date but would not comment further."}
