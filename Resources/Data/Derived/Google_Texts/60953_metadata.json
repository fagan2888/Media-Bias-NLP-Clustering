Her son, Kasey, is a deputy in the White County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It was not too long ago, Cpls. Kevin Holbrook and Joe Britte said, that a young Kasey would come and walk through the criminal investigations division of the Gainesville Police Department.\n\n\u201cI go home and I hear his rookie stories and I come back to work and I hear the stories here,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin was named as the sole finalist for the post Dec. 23 after serving since September in an interim role. It was not until seeing that story in The Times that the realization kicked in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it really became real that, \u2018Wow, this just happened.\u2019 It was very surreal,\u201d she said.\n\nMartin said she imagined and hoped to reach the ranks of lieutenant and then captain, but never head of the department. The first month has flown by, she said, as the department preps its budgets for the next year.\n\nThe chief post came open when Martin\u2019s predecessor, Brian Kelly, resigned in August under reported pressure from city officials over concerns of low morale in the department. Martin said she hoped to open up the lines of communication to allow officers to tell executive staff about such problem.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been told if they want to come up and talk, just let their sergeant or lieutenant know. ... Some people are not quite as comfortable doing that,\u201d she said.\n\nFor those workers, a suggestion box has been added. Tasks as simple as putting in recycling bins or re-marking parking spots have been accomplished, Martin said, as a way to take care of small issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s back to that family atmosphere once again,\u201d Holbrook said of the Gainesville force.\n\nNorma Hernandez has known Martin for about 20 years since the time Hernandez worked as a Municipal Court clerk. She attests to the chief\u2019s approachable and down-to-earth nature.\n\n\u201cShe never changed,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cShe has been like that forever, and now with her new position, it\u2019s incredible, and I\u2019m really proud of her.\u201d\n\nTo help a fresh crop of new officers get better acquainted, the department held a holiday meal to meet everyone\u2019s significant others and kids.\n\n\u201cIt was a win-win for all of us because we\u2019re all able to sit down and enjoy a meal and talk about other things than law enforcement, just be in a family atmosphere,\u201d Britte said.\n\nThat family atmosphere is how Martin views the department: a group of 100 or so in a second family.\n\n\u201cThis is 28 years of my family. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people come and go. A lot of people retire, grow. You watch them go through the ranks and it\u2019s like watching your family members,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo large technological developments took place during Martin\u2019s interim stint: a digital records management system and the expansion of body cameras for officers. Martin said she hopes to have the rest of the cameras by March, and said there are no other big technology changes on the horizon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always changes you want to make, but you can\u2019t go in and just change everything right off the bat. You have to take a little bit at a time,\u201d Martin said.\n\nAmong her goals are to stay connected to the community. She participated in a recent roundtable community discussion hosted by Gainesville Councilwoman Myrtle Figueras. Martin wants to keep lines of communication open, similar to recent chats held at Mount Zion Baptist Church involving law enforcement and residents.\n\nHernandez said the Hispanic community in Gainesville and Hall County feels more embraced by law enforcement as a result of the work by Martin and Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch.\n\n\u201cWe feel more supported,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe feel more in touch with law enforcement, which is very needed.\u201d\n\nThe deputy chief position, Martin said, should be filled in the coming months from within the department.\n\nWith her two families of law enforcement by her side, there\u2019s one person missing: her mother Sue Thomason, who died last summer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one bad thing,\u201d Martin said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get to see any of this happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/107284/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A math teacher, an accountant or a police chief \u2014 of those career options, Carol Martin said she never imagined herself becoming the third.", "title": "The 2 police families of Carol Martin"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "The 2 police families of Carol Martin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce586\"", "article_summary": "With her two families of law enforcement by her side, there\u2019s one person missing: her mother Sue Thomason, who died last summer.\nFriends in law enforcement whom Martin had met around her time at Brenau initiated the change from her previous math emphasis.\nAfter 28 years in the business, law enforcement has become a family affair for Martin.\nA math teacher, an accountant or a police chief \u2014 of those career options, Carol Martin said she never imagined herself becoming the third.\nMartin wants to keep lines of communication open, similar to recent chats held at Mount Zion Baptist Church involving law enforcement and residents."}
