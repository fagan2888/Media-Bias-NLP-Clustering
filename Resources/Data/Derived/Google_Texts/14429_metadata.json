Humphrey, then the young mayor of Minneapolis and a rising star in national politics, was imploring delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to endorse equal rights for blacks. Mr. Humphrey \u2014 who went on to become a United States senator of Minnesota and Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s vice president \u2014 delivered the call with such vigor that Southern segregationists stalked out of the hall, and the party.\n\nTwenty-four years later, Mr. Pinkney was Mr. Humphrey\u2019s deputy campaign manager in a race to win the Democratic presidential nomination for the second time and unseat the man who had defeated Mr. Humphrey in 1968, Richard M. Nixon.\n\nThe relationship between Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Pinkney deepened as they traveled from primary to primary, and after Mr. Humphrey, then a senator again, lost the California primary, he publicly promised that if his campaign revived and he won the general election, he would bring Mr. Pinkney into his administration.\n\n\u201cIt was the greatest moment of my life,\u201d Mr. Pinkney told The Plain Dealer in Cleveland in 1997, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Humphrey went on to lose the nomination to Senator George S. McGovern.\n\nLast week, Mr. Jackson said of Mr. Pinkney, \u201cWith his passing, a huge part of history goes with him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was born in Youngstown, Ohio, on Jan. 6, 1931. His father died three months before he finished high school, so he worked in steel mills to help his family make ends meet.\n\nHe graduated from Albion College in Michigan, where he won letters in football, track, baseball and basketball. During a stint in the Army, he played baseball with major leaguers. Paul O\u2019Dea, a scout for the Cleveland Indians, told him that he had a shot at making the big leagues by his late 20s, but advised him to go to law school instead. \u201cYour race needs more lawyers than baseball players,\u201d Mr. Pinkney recalled Mr. O\u2019Dea saying.\n\nHe took the advice and attended what is now Case Western Reserve University School of Law, but he dropped out for financial reasons. He then became one of the first black agents hired by the Prudential Insurance Company of America and later opened a successful insurance agency. As a civil rights activist, he led a membership drive for the N.A.A.C.P. and joined the picketing of a Cleveland supermarket that had refused to hire blacks.\n\nHe began his political career by helping out on local campaigns for judges, then volunteered for Carl Stokes\u2019s mayoral campaign. Louis Stokes tapped him to be his paid campaign manager in 1968. Mr. Pinkney was later president of the Cleveland Board of Education and twice sought the city\u2019s mayoralty, losing in a three-man race in 1971 and again in 1975. After the second defeat, he moved to Shaker Heights, a Cleveland suburb.\n\nMr. Jackson said he had chosen Mr. Pinkney to run his 1984 campaign because he was experienced in national campaigns as a \u201cvoice of pragmatism.\u201d When he took over, Mr. Pinkney set about righting a campaign that was listing: Field offices had not been set up, phones were not being answered, and Mr. Jackson was often showing up late for appearances.\n\nHe also had to contend with problems outside his control. The Jackson forces were buoyed when Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the black separatist Nation of Islam, announced his support. But then a recording surfaced in which Mr. Farrakhan made remarks widely interpreted as anti-Semitic. Amid a storm of outrage, Mr. Pinkney helped draft a statement calling Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s words \u201creprehensible.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge came when Mr. Jackson made diplomatic forays to Latin America, meeting with Nicaragua\u2019s leftist leaders and leftist rebels in El Salvador to try to steer them toward peace and winning the release of more than 20 political prisoners in Cuba. Mr. Pinkney worried that with the race for the nomination nearing its end, Mr. Jackson was absent, squandering a chance to attract maximum attention on domestic issues at a crucial time. In his absence, The Washington Post said, Mr. Pinkney would \u201clook after his interests.\u201d\n\nMr. Jackson unsuccessfully sought the nomination again in 1988 with Gerald F. Austin as his campaign manager.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pinkney\u2019s death was announced by his family. His survivors include his wife, Betty, and their daughter, Traci.\n\nMr. Pinkney liked to say the changes in America that led to Barack Obama\u2019s election as president in 2008 began with Carl Stokes\u2019s victory in Cleveland four decades earlier. On the night of Mr. Obama\u2019s victory, Mr. Pinkney told a crowd of celebrators that blacks could no longer justifiably refuse to fight in foreign wars for a country that treated them as second-class citizens.\n\n\u201cThis wipes all that out,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can accuse the country of that again. It\u2019s a magnificent night.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140118225521, "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Pinkney, a strategist who ran the campaigns in landmark races for black politicians, also advised Hubert H.
