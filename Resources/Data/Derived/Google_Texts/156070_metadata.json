Bill Young (R-Fla.) has become a political soap opera that could jeopardize Republicans\u2019 hold on the seat.\n\nIt has all the makings of a daytime drama: a widow disavowing her son due to opposing primary allegiances and a secret family kept hidden for decades only to surface a week before the contentious primary.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd with an important swing district at stake, it\u2019s the messy, public family feud that\u2019s another added worry for the party ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary, for which GOP leaders, and the Young family, are far from unified.\n\nDemocrats quickly cleared the field for former Florida Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, but Republicans have endured weeks of infighting between lobbyist David Jolly, a former Young staffer, and state Rep. Kathleen Peters that will culminate when primary voters head to the polls on Jan. 14.\n\nJolly has raised twice as much as Peters for the race, and with the state legislator\u2019s campaign floundering, state and national observers expect it\u2019s Jolly who will be victorious Tuesday.\n\nStill, the Young family drama and their split allegiances between Jolly and Peters have only shifted focus away from Democrats while, Sink, their likely nominee, \u201csits back, raises money, eats popcorn, and watches the fireworks explode,\u201d as one Florida GOP operative put it.\n\nA salacious weekend report from the Tampa Bay Times revealed a family Young had built in his youth and subsequently kept secret after marrying his former secretary Beverly Young.\n\nThe story threatens to tar the late congressman\u2019s legacy in the state, and some in the district speculate the fallout could hit Jolly, who\u2019s run as Young\u2019s chosen candidate. Jolly received a glowing endorsement from Young\u2019s widow, even featuring her in campaign ads.\n\nIn the Times\u2019s report, Beverly Young is portrayed in a less-than-positive light, and Republicans in the district implicitly acknowledge the report could have some fallout for Jolly \u2014 though he insists it won\u2019t have an impact on his race.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a family issue. It\u2019s not an issue for my campaign,\u201d he told The Hill. \u201cI am proud to have the endorsement of a lot of people in this race.\u201d\n\nBeverly Young has claimed her husband said on his deathbed he wanted Jolly to replace him. When Bill Young Jr. announced he was backing Peters, his mother publicly lashed out at her son.\n\n\u201cYou have hurt me beyond belief,\u201d she said to her son after a candidate forum, later stating when asked about the remarks, \u201cI have no relationship\u201d with him.\n\nBut since the story published over the weekend and became the buzz of Florida political circles, those loyal to Young questioned why the details of his messy divorce and first family have only just emerged.\n\nTony DiMatteo, a former Pinellas County GOP chairman and Jolly supporter, suggested the timing of the report was suspicious and that sometimes when people \u201cget desperate, they get negative.\u201d\n\nMany in Washington initially saw Peters as the better GOP prospect for a general election; she doesn\u2019t carry lobbyist baggage and could neutralize any attacks focused on women\u2019s issues that Democrats might lob against Jolly.\n\nBut Peters likely has little time \u2014 and even fewer resources \u2014 to make up lost ground. Peters currently only has $18,000 left in her campaign coffers.\n\nPeters herself appears to be stretched thin. She\u2019s her father\u2019s primary caretaker and suffered a personal loss when her brother died from throat cancer during the holiday season. A major misstep came, sources say, when she accused Jolly of benefiting from ObamaCare through his lobbying work, a claim that was discounted by multiple sources and derided by Jolly himself.\n\n\u201cThe advantage was initially hers, and then she made the mistake. We came back from the holidays and, boom, the election was on her,\u201d said Florida GOP strategist Alex Patton. \u201cWhen you make a blunder that was that big, it\u2019s hard to recover from.\u201d\n\nJolly, for his part, has been working to turn what both Democrats and his GOP opponents have seen as his greatest liability, his background as a lobbyist, into an advantage. In a district where Young was always lauded for bringing federal funds home, Jolly and his supporters have touted his lobbying work as helping to create jobs.\n\n\u201cWe got in this race on a message of qualifications and experience, and I think it\u2019s resonating with voters,\u201d said Jolly.\n\nWhoever emerges, Democrats see GOP drama as a boon to their chances in the March special election.\n\n\u201cThe expensive, divisive primary slugfest between Washington lobbyist David Jolly and Tallahassee Rep. Kathleen Peters is turning off the independent swing voters who want to see an end to politics-as-usual,\u201d said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman David Bergstein.\n\nDemocrats have sought to neutralize expected attacks from Jolly focused on ObamaCare by pointing to the campaign contributions he gave to Democrats who supported the law.\n\nAnd Republicans point to Sink\u2019s record as CFO, which they say hasn\u2019t come under proper scrutiny yet. But they admit holding the seat will be a difficult \u2014 and expensive \u2014 battle.\n\n\u201cI think any Republican coming out of the primary is facing a significant challenge against Alex Sink. I don\u2019t think any perceived advantage really exists,\u201d Patton said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The GOP race in Florida has become a political soap opera.", "description": "The GOP race in Florida has become a political soap opera.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The GOP race in Florida has become a political soap opera.", "title": "Drama roils race to replace Rep.
