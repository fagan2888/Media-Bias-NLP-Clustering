The fee generally is imposed on covered entities that provide health insurance for U.S. health risks.\n\nThe IRS said the definition would be similar to that of a medical loss ratio in previous heath insurance provider fee regulations. According to that definition, expatriate policies are defined as predominately group health insurance policies that provide coverage to employees \u201csubstantially all\u201d of whom are (1) working outside their country of citizenship, (2) working outside their country of citizenship and outside the employer's country of domicile, or (3) non-U.S. citizens working in their home country.\n\nThe IRS emphasized that the definition in the notice applies \u201csolely and for this limited purpose\u201d in 2016 to assist in complying with the new expatriate health coverage legislation. The government is developing proposed regulations on the legislation that will address the definition of an expatriate health plan, the agency said.\n\nGuidance on Direct Premiums\n\nThe notice offered guidance for a covered entity\u2014including controlled group members, if any\u2014that has already reported direct premiums written for expatriate health plans for 2016.\n\nIf so, the entity must exclude those direct premiums written for expatriate health plans from the direct premiums written (column f) on its 2016 Form 8963, Report of Health Insurance Provider Information, the IRS said.\n\nNotice 2016-14 is scheduled to be published in Internal Revenue Bulletin 2016-7, dated Feb. 16.\n\nFor More Information For more information, see Compensation and Benefits Library\u2019s Tax Aspects of Health Plans Under the Affordable Care Act chapter.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alison Bennett in Washington at abennett@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brett Ferguson at bferguson@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/expatriate-health-plans-n57982067038/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service provided interim guidance on how the definition of an \u201cexpatriate health plan\u201d applies for purposes of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance...", "title": "Expatriate Health Plans Get IRS Guidance on ACA Fee"}, "csrf-token": "CguHOwSKgOzLrU9ChSQvNoZI0xysqhHSBlkXn2jJ319TeNz8HAh8E-zWCKLBgeLEcwW1MP75T0fcli-e9WFho1MhuqBFHS9WMonbDO-G7hs1:YYtjJwCYEpkVMoCyBVZvfOjkJGeuHdjjnaCr8RfnWqqHoXuQ6FA_hzSlfzNY_hBw8uKtTPe_m6N5mZuHrIW6-FH6T--Ap_Mba3yQ7bLtvZA1", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service provided interim guidance on how the definition of an \u201cexpatriate health plan\u201d applies for purposes of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "The guidance, Notice 2016-14, issued Jan. 29, addressed questions on how the fee applies to expatriate plans under the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014, which exempted these plans from the fee beginning in 2016.\nGuidance on Direct PremiumsThe notice offered guidance for a covered entity\u2014including controlled group members, if any\u2014that has already reported direct premiums written for expatriate health plans for 2016.\nIf so, the entity must exclude those direct premiums written for expatriate health plans from the direct premiums written (column f) on its 2016 Form 8963, Report of Health Insurance Provider Information, the IRS said.\nFor More Information For more information, see Compensation and Benefits Library\u2019s Tax Aspects of Health Plans Under the Affordable Care Act chapter.\nThe fee generally is imposed on covered entities that provide health insurance for U.S. health risks."}
