House lawmakers had rejected the Senate bill, which authorizes funding for six years but only pays for three years of spending.\n\nLawmakers have passed a series of temporary extensions of federal highway funding in recent years, much to the chagrin of transportation advocates who have complained that it has been a decade since Congress has passed an infrastructure bill that lasts longer than two years.\n\nCongress has been struggling for years to come up with a way to pay for a long-term extension.\n\nThe traditional source for transportation funding is revenue collected by the federal gas tax, which is currently set at 18.4 cents per gallon. The federal government spends about $50 billion per year on roads, but the gas tax take only brings in $34 billion annually.\n\nCongress has turned to other areas of the federal budget to close the gap, and lawmakers on the committee negotiating a potential compromise on the the highway bill are working to identify a set of offsets for the new multiyear transportation bill before it can move forward.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated it will take about $100 billion, in addition to the annual gas tax revenue, to pay for a six-year transportation funding bill.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Federal transportation funding is set to expire on Friday.", "description": "Federal transportation funding is set to expire on Friday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Federal transportation funding is set to expire on Friday.", "title": "Congress has five days to finish highway talks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/261467-congress-has-five-days-to-finish-highway-talks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/highway.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/261467-congress-has-five-days-to-finish-highway-talks", "dcterms.date": "2015-11-30T09:34-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-30T09:34:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/261467-congress-has-five-days-to-finish-highway-talks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Federal transportation funding is set to expire on Friday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress has five days to finish highway talks"}, "dcterms.title": "Congress has five days to finish highway talks"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers are scrambling to finish negotiations on a bicameral multiyear transportation funding bill by Friday to prevent an interruption.\nADVERTISEMENTLawmakers are trying to finish talks on a multiyear highway bill that would be the first transportation funding legislation to last longer than two years since 2005.\nCongress has five days to prevent a highway-funding shutdown, with federal transportation spending currently set to expire on Dec. 4.\nThe talks began after the House passed a bill to spend up to $325 billion on transportation projects over the next six years.\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated it will take about $100 billion, in addition to the annual gas tax revenue, to pay for a six-year transportation funding bill."}
