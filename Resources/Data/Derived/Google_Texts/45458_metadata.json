Bowe Bergdahl in May of last year has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in Qatar, CNN has learned exclusively.\n\n\n\nThe development has led to an ongoing debate inside the administration about whether there is a new threat from this man, and potentially the other four.\n\n\n\nThe officials would not say which of the five men is suspected. But an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has \"reached out\" to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details.\n\n\n\nUnder current law, this act placed the man in the category of being \"suspected\" of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the \"suspected\" classification. Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as \"confirmed\" for returning to illegal activities. All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, the Taliban 5 were supposedly going to be monitored and kept from returning to the battle field, either traditionally or through radicalizing future fighters over the internet.\n\nOver to you, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"As long as they're in Qatar, they\u2019re not a threat to the United States...in Qatar with an agreement that has been entered into, they are supposed to be constrained from what they can do, and certainly they are not supposed to be permitted to travel, that is as my understanding, tells me what the deal is and in that situation, they are not a threat.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is still trying to clarify how exactly the Taliban isn't a terrorist organization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of course. .05/25/2016 20:24:37PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Of course.", "title": "- Surprise: Taliban Leader Obama Swapped For Alleged Deserter Bergdahl Suspected of Going Back to Fight", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/01/29/surprise-taliban-leader-obama-swapped-for-bergdahl-went-back-to-fight-n1950252", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/353/2014-12-19T172325Z_1_LYNXMPEABI0T2_RTROPTP_3_USA-AFGHANISTAN-BERGDAHL-PRESIDENT.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Of course.", "title": "- Surprise: Taliban Leader Obama Swapped For Alleged Deserter Bergdahl Suspected of Going Back to Fight", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/01/29/surprise-taliban-leader-obama-swapped-for-bergdahl-went-back-to-fight-n1950252", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/353/2014-12-19T172325Z_1_LYNXMPEABI0T2_RTROPTP_3_USA-AFGHANISTAN-BERGDAHL-PRESIDENT.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Surprise: Taliban Leader Obama Swapped For Alleged Deserter Bergdahl Suspected of Going Back to Fight, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf446\"", "article_summary": "Bowe Bergdahl in May of last year has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in Qatar, CNN has learned exclusively.\nAll five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.\nUnder current law, this act placed the man in the category of being \"suspected\" of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.\nHowever, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the \"suspected\" classification.\nThe development has led to an ongoing debate inside the administration about whether there is a new threat from this man, and potentially the other four."}
