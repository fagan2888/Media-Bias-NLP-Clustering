REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n3968813\n\nPresident Barack Obama will ask his most ardent followers on Monday evening to help bail out his rapidly sinking Obamacare project.\n\nThe 8:15 p.m. online speech will be delivered to Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action supporters, and Obama is expected to ask them to save the Obamacare program, which has eliminated health insurance plans of at least four million Americans.\n\nObamacare\u2019s launch has been so politically painful that many Democratic legislators have threatened to abandon ship even before it becomes operational on Jan. 1.\n\nObama will also try to go on the political offensive by urging his followers to push for the Senate-passed, business-backed immigration reform bill.\n\nDemocrats say the bill is popular and will help Americans. But GOP leaders in the House have temporarily stalled it because of opposition from voters who are already worried about unemployment, outsourcing and automation.\n\nIf it becomes law, the bill would provide a work permit to one extra Democratic-leaning immigrant or guest-worker for every American who turns 18 during the next 10 years.\n\nOn Friday, Obama held an emergency Obamacare meeting with his allies in the health-benefit companies, including the CEOs of Aetna, Humana, CareFirst and Cigna Healthcare.\n\nThat meeting came one day after Obama tried to blame the companies, not his regulations, for the millions of policy cancellations. In a White House press conference, he announced he would not prosecute executives who violate the 2010 Obamacare law by selling popular, low-profit pre-Obamacare insurance policies during 2014.\n\nObamacare requires the low-cost plans be cancelled, and be replaced by higher-cost plans, which generate steady profits for companies that cooperate with the government.\n\nSo far, no company has announced that they want to sell the low-profit plans, and none have announced a reversal of the Obamacare-mandated cancellations.\n\nThe political pain caused by the cancellations is made worse by the inability of many people to buy the more expensive replacement policies via Obamacare website.\n\nThere\u2019s growing doubt that the website will be fixed b Nov. 30, as Obama and his deputies have predicted.\n\nWhite House officials didn\u2019t provide a transcript of Obama\u2019s Friday meeting with the executives, but did release a so-called \u201creadout\u201d of the meeting.\n\nThe readout did not include any mention of the president\u2019s Thursday request, which was widely seen in Washington as a p.r. move to prevent Democratic legislators from voting against the Obamacare project.\n\nSo far, the PR move has been partly successful.\n\nOn Friday, only 39 Democratic legislators backed a successful GOP-drafted bill that would allow insurance companies to sell the low-profit policies until the end of 2014.\n\nThe GOP bill will be blocked by the Democratic-majority Senate.\n\nIn the Friday, meeting, \u201cthe President led a discussion with industry leaders about the best pathways for consumers to enroll in coverage,\u201d said a vague White House readout.\n\n\u201cAdministration officials are working closely with insurance companies on both consumer education as well as fixing the technical issues with HealthCare.gov so that consumers can obtain the coverage they need,\u201d it stated.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "President Barack Obama will ask his most ardent followers on Monday evening to help bail out his rapidly sinking Obamacare project.
