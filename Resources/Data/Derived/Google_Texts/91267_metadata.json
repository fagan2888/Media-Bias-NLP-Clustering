The teams met on Oct. 1 when Air Academy won 4-3 in double overtime.\n\n\u201cAir\u2019s a phenomenal team. They\u2019re definitely the most talented team in the state and deserves to be No. 1,\u201d Cheyenne Mountain coach Tomas Martinez said. \u201cBut I told the guys they had to be better than them today and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nThis match didn\u2019t have the spectacular offense the earlier meeting featured, but it showcased two of Class 4A\u2019s finer defenses, which combined for 24 goals allowed in 2013. The Kadets dominated possession throughout the first, but were unable to capitalize, getting just one shot on goal in the final minute of the half.\n\nForward John Herd got the Indians on the board first with a goal in the 38th minute of the game. For Herd, the team\u2019s leading scorer, it was his 13th goal of the season.\n\nAir Academy put the pressure on in the final 15 minutes of the game getting three shots on goal. With 6:09 remaining in the game, Kadets midfielder Alex Granados was awarded a penalty kick after being tripped in the box. Granados scored with a strike in the top right corner of the goal to tie the game.\n\n\u201cThey were bringing pressure, bringing pressure, bringing pressure. Everybody felt it was inevitable they were going to get that goal somehow,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nJust a little more than two minutes later, Nehme was able to break through the Kadets defense and get a goal on goalkeeper Matthew Pipan.\n\n\u201cWe just told our team we\u2019re not losing our heads. These next six minutes, we\u2019re going to get one and it\u2019s ours,\u201d Nehme said.\n\nAir Academy finishes the season with a record of 18-2. Cheyenne Mountain is 17-3.\n\n\u201cThey can say they dominated possession, everybody outplayed us \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. We got the better score today,\u201d Martinez said. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019re not the most talented team, but we\u2019re the most hard-working team and I\u2019ll take that any day.\u201d\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byjoenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cheyenne Mountain tops Air Academy to win 4A boys soccer title", "title": "Cheyenne Mountain tops Air Academy to win 4A boys soccer title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/09/cheyenne-mountain-tops-air-academy-to-win-4a-boys-soccer-title/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109_040259_cheyenne-mountain-4A.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109_040259_cheyenne-mountain-4A.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T14:38:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:03:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09a0\"", "article_summary": "1 Air Academy 2-1 to win the Class 4A state boys soccer title Saturday at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park.\n\u201cThey were bringing pressure, bringing pressure, bringing pressure.\nAir Academy put the pressure on in the final 15 minutes of the game getting three shots on goal.\nNehme scored his 10th goal of the season in the 77th minute to reclaim the lead for good for the Indians.\nForward John Herd got the Indians on the board first with a goal in the 38th minute of the game."}
