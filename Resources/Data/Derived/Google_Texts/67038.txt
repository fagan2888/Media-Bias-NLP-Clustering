“My amendment is not related to this bill but I have to bring it up now because it’s very time sensitive since it will go into effect on Oct. 1,” Vitter said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “I think this is a special exemption for Washington.”

Last month, the Office of Management and Personnel (OMP) issued a ruling on ObamaCare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, to allow congressional staff members to continue to receive subsidized healthcare coverage.

Vitter said the OMP does not have the “statutory authority” to make that ruling. His amendment would prevent members of Congress from exempting any of their staff from entering the ObamaCare health exchanges, require all executive branch appointees to participate in the healthcare exchanges and end subsidies for congressional staff to pay for insurance.

Several senators came to the floor to speak about their noncontroversial bipartisan amendments, but they were prevented from making them pending because of Vitter’s objection.
