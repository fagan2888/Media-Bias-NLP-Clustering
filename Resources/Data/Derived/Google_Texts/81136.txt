The family of a 20-year-old man missing since February will host a vigil Saturday afternoon to celebrate his life.

Jules Mappus was last seen on peninsular Charleston around 11 p.m. Feb. 26, according to Mount Pleasant police. His vehicle was found unoccupied on the Ravenel Bridge an hour-and-a-half later, police said.

Family and friends plan to gather at 2 p.m. Saturday at James Island County Park’s Wando Shelter, his mother, Butler Mappus, said.

“It’s a celebration of his life. Everyone’s welcome to come,” she said.

Few details are known about Mappus’ disappearance, his mother said, and a police investigation is ongoing.

“We’re not sure exactly what happened. The police are asking anyone who saw Jules on that night to please contact them,” she said.

Mappus’ mother, father and sister are taking things “day by day” while they continue to wait for news, she said.

“Family and friends continue to hold us up. We are surrounded by the love of our family and God,” she said.

In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to One80 Place, a homeless shelter in Charleston. Donations can also be made to Pet Helpers, the Charleston Animal Society and to a restoration fund for St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church on King Street, she said.

Mappus is described as 5-foot-11 with blond hair, blue eyes and weighing 165 pounds.
