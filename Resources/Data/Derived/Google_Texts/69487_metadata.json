No, apparently the multi-million dollar ObamaCare marketing campaign signing up new Medicaid recipients by the millions will come with an unexpected bonus for fans of the entitlement state. Lots and lots of people finding out for the first time that in addition to free healthcare they are also eligible for a shiny new EBT card. Via Politico.\n\nThe Obama administration has ordered a study to determine whether the Affordable Care Act, by increasing the number of people eligible for Medicaid, will also increase the number of people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program based on how states enroll people. The outcome of the study could show an increase of 3 percent to 5 percent in food stamp recipients in some states from people who were already eligible for SNAP benefits but had not enrolled in the program \u2014 which could translate to millions or even billions more in federal spending, Greg Mills, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who is conducting the study, told POLITICO. \u201cSo in percentage terms, it\u2019s not going to be very large, but we\u2019re talking about a very large program,\u201d said Mills, who is investigating the effects of the health care law on SNAP on behalf of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Nutrition Service, the agency that monitors food stamps.\n\nHow large? Well, we spent over $78 billion on the program last year so the expected increase would be something in the range of $1.5 to $4 billion. Which, surprise, would go a long way towards offsetting the cuts the GOP thought they had won in the recent budget deal. But here\u2019s what I want to know: is a study on this really necessary? With the ObamaCare enrollment deadline looming, seems to me the bills for any new SNAP enrollees will start rolling in soon enough. Why doesn\u2019t the White House commission something more useful instead? Like a study forecasting the number of employers likely to drop insurance coverage in the next couple of years, or how many part-time employees will have their hours reduced due to the employer mandate. The White House says there is no data to support these \u201canecdotal\u201d claims, so let\u2019s hop to it guys \u2013 prove us wrong.\n\nOf course it wouldn\u2019t be a food stamp story in a liberal rag without a quote from someone praising the proactive effort to sign-up even more people, and Politico doesn\u2019t disappoint. I\u2019m all for a helping hand-up to those in need but is it too much to expect we at least wait until they\u2019ve made a conscious decision to reach out for help first? If our modern day Jeff Spicoli\u2019s are going to get free check-ups now to go along with their sushi, I say we at least make them get off the couch before we sign \u2019em up.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThis is a favorable byproduct of the Affordable Care Act\u201d", "title": "Surprise: ObamaCare will likely increase food stamp enrollment", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/06/surprise-obamacare-will-likely-increase-food-stamp-enrollment/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "food stamps, ObamaCare,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-06T13:41:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T12:51:01+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceed1\"", "article_summary": "Of course it wouldn\u2019t be a food stamp story in a liberal rag without a quote from someone praising the proactive effort to sign-up even more people, and Politico doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nSurprise: ObamaCare will likely increase food stamp enrollmentposted at 8:41 am on November 6, 2013 by Morgen RichmondOnce all of the new ObamaCare mandates, regulations, and taxes are fully priced into the healthcare market we may all be lining up for government butter and cheese, but that\u2019s not the story here.\nWith the ObamaCare enrollment deadline looming, seems to me the bills for any new SNAP enrollees will start rolling in soon enough.\nNo, apparently the multi-million dollar ObamaCare marketing campaign signing up new Medicaid recipients by the millions will come with an unexpected bonus for fans of the entitlement state.\nWell, we spent over $78 billion on the program last year so the expected increase would be something in the range of $1.5 to $4 billion."}
