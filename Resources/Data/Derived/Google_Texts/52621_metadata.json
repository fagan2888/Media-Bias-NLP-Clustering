Among the overwhelmingly clueless, the ACA won. A year later, such confusion has largely dissipated, and Obamacare has lost some of its linguistic sting. But the label still plays badly among certain groups, particularly Republicans. It also reinforces the link between the law and an unpopular president, says George Lakoff, an expert on the language of political discourse. A few state-run exchanges figured out early how to minimize the name negatives. In fact, Kentucky\u2019s kynect did such a good job of branding itself that even Sen. Mitch McConnell seemed to forget it was part of a law he detests. Repeal the ACA, McConnell said last month, but kynect can stay. \u201cWe made kynect about an individual and their family obtaining health insurance here in Kentucky,\u201d Exchange Director Carrie Banahan said. And neither Obamacare nor ACA appears anywhere on kynect\u2019s homepage. Qualifying life event \u21d2 Getting hitched, turning 26 or graduating college: Last fall, many Americans struggled to grasp the sometimes complex specifics of \u201cqualifying life event,\u201d \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d and other insurance terminology. A year later, the organization Young Invincibles has ditched that shoptalk. As it pushes enrollment among the under-35 crowd, Campaign Director Erin Hemlin says the group just asks people if they\u2019ve recently graduated from college, turned 26, gotten married or moved. That\u2019s a simple vernacular instead of a technical mouthful. Premium tax credits \u21d2 Financial help: Last fall, many low- and moderate-income Americans had no idea that financial assistance was available to help them afford health insurance. Blame terms like \u201cpremium subsidies\u201d and \u201ctax credits.\u201d (Premium\u2019s a kind of ice cream or a really good cut of beef. It\u2019s not readily equated with health insurance, said Jill Midkiff, communications director at Kentucky\u2019s Cabinet for Health and Family Services.) A year later, experts like Mike Perry, a partner at the opinion research firm PerryUndem, recommend talking about \u201cfinancial help\u201d when trying to reach the target population. But that alone doesn\u2019t cut it, he added. The message must include real numbers. A family of four earning $40,000, for example, needs to know that it\u2019s eligible for about $7,000 toward premiums. \u201cLow cost\u201d also works, he noted. Plus it\u2019s more definite than \u201caffordable.\u201d Navigators \u21d2 In-person help: Last fall, consumers complained that it took them too long to learn about in-person assistance. Not only that, \u201cnavigators\u201d was an unfamiliar term, at least in the context of health insurance. Did these people work for health plans, like some brokers? Did they charge a fee? Was their advice slanted? A year later, the message is simpler: Consumers can get free, unbiased, in-person help during enrollment season. \u201c\u2018Help\u2019 is a powerful word to use,\u201d Perry said. Individual mandate \u21d2 A fine: Last fall, Obamacare advocates shied away from talk about the detested individual mandate. Better to focus on things that people liked, they thought \u2014 like coverage for pre-existing conditions and young adults staying on a parent\u2019s plan until age 26. A year later, Americans will hear more about the mandate. Research has found that it does motivate people to enroll. But the groups doing the outreach and messaging won\u2019t necessarily use that legal term. They won\u2019t say \u201cpenalty\u201d either; that\u2019s too harsh. Listen instead for talk about a \u201cfee\u201d or a \u201cfine.\u201d HealthCare.gov has already picked up on this. \u201cIf you can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it, you must pay a fee,\u201d the website begins. Only then does it elaborate: \u201cThe fee is sometimes called the \u2018penalty,\u2019 \u2018fine,\u2019 \u2018individual responsibility payment,\u2019 or \u2018individual mandate.\u2019\u201d\n\n( CARTOONS: Matt Wuerker on Obamacare)\n\nIt\u2019s a slower, quieter buildup for Obamacare sign-ups in year two, a reflection of a more cautious administration lowering expectations after last year\u2019s disastrous HealthCare.gov rollout. But in year two, officials can be more focused on the mechanics of enrollment and spend less time introducing Americans to the law.\n\nFor example: The hashtag #bornin88 did well the first year in getting 26-year-olds to sign up; expect a #bornin89 successor, aimed at people who turn 26 and can\u2019t stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance. Officials now know that radio spots are better for reaching Latino audiences in need of sign-up assistance. Digital ads last year drove the creation of 4 million accounts, and they are less expensive than poorly targeted broadcast spots.\n\nThe administration is focusing less on the front end of the health care sign-up period and more on the back end, when procrastinators are likely to log in to HealthCare.gov.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services officials aren\u2019t saying how much they are spending this enrollment season on advertising, marketing or outreach or how that compares with last year. They never released a 2014 total of federal and state spending either. House Republicans complain they didn\u2019t get full answers to questions about how many millions have been spent.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Ted Cruz out on a limb on Obamacare repeal)\n\nThe administration rolled out the message last fall in several stages. This fall, officials say the decision was made not to start a big push before the website opens on Saturday; there\u2019s no sense priming people to sign up before they can get online to do so.\n\nThe revamped HealthCare.gov itself is in better though not perfect shape; millions did eventually use the website for 2014. Still, backers of the law are just as happy to see a quiet beginning, rather than a huge crush of people going online, either to get an early start on 2015 coverage or just because they are curious to see whether the site crashes all over again.\n\n\u201cJob one has been to make sure all the mechanisms work and are in place,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, who isn\u2019t bothered by the relatively subdued walk-up to open enrollment. If it melts down, \u201cno hype will make up for that problem.\u201d\n\nJob two is getting 7 million people to re-enroll, 3 million to sign up and more to join the nearly 9 million who have gone on the Medicaid rolls.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obamacare and the low expectations game)\n\nObama squeezed in a pep talk to health insurance enrollment helpers just before leaving on his Asia trip last week; Michelle Obama will address young adults on Friday, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by POLITICO. The White House hasn\u2019t said when the president\u2019s next appearance will be.\n\nThe themes this year, for the administration and its allies, are affordability and assistance, a more clearly defined zone than the general \u201cgo get yourself health insurance\u201d message of the opening year.\n\nNumerous polls and surveys have found that many people still don\u2019t know they can get subsidies, in the form of tax credits, to buy a health plan on the Obamacare exchanges. That financial help is available on a sliding scale to people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $95,000 for a family of four in 2014. That point will be more explicit in the outreach this enrollment season.\n\nMessaging will also explain how people can get hands-on help as they go through the daunting process of getting insured \u2014 which is particularly unnerving for people who haven\u2019t had coverage for a while and don\u2019t really understand deductibles, co-pays, networks or formularies.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The relaunch of HealthCare.gov)\n\nBut for all the new savvy, the administration still has to deal with an ambivalent public, a newly energized all-Republican Congress that\u2019s hellbent on repealing the law and an uncertain legal future as yet another Obamacare challenge goes to the Supreme Court.\n\nWith those aspects partly out of Obama\u2019s control, his staff is working on the retail politics of Obamacare. Labor Secretary Tom Perez headed to Cleveland Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack goes to Missouri Friday. New HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell went to Philadelphia last weekend; on Thursday, she heads to Columbus, Ohio, and Cincinnati.\n\nUsing Obama himself sparingly at this point may not be a bad idea. Critics of the health care law \u201cwant this to be a war about ideology, left versus right, about the president,\u201d said Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, who tracks health politics closely. \u201cA quiet focus on implementation\u201d might do more to highlight the benefits people are getting.\n\nCommunity and advocacy groups are also readying their ground game. They also hadn\u2019t gone all out this fall but this weekend they kick in.\n\nEnroll America, for instance, will hold more than 100 events. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment to make a splash,\u201d said the outreach group\u2019s president, Anne Filipic.\n\nYoung Invincibles, which has refined to an art how much food and entertainment to offer to get under-30s to pay attention to enrollment education events, just started hosting sessions. It will intensify efforts closer to the Feb. 15 deadline. \u201cWe know young people do procrastinate no matter how much we work to educate them at the start,\u201d said Sarah Lovenheim, the communications director.\n\nThe insurance industry is focusing first on the 7 million who need to re-enroll. People who don\u2019t take steps to re-enroll \u2014 or to specifically opt out \u2014 by Dec. 15 will get automatically re-enrolled. But they can often get a better deal \u2014 and a more accurate subsidy \u2014 if they update their information and shop around. Health plans have been mailing letters, sending emails and using social media to explain that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different marketing year than it was last year, \u201c said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the lead health insurance trade group, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\nA lot more insurers are taking part in the health insurance exchanges in 2015, about 25 percent more than this year. They see a chance to grow their business, and they\u2019ll be trying to reach new customers through techniques ranging from social media campaigns to brick-and-mortar retail insurance shops.\n\nStates running their own exchanges are also stepping up. Covered California is doing a nine-day 21-city bus tour; the Minnesota exchange MNsure is beginning a multiplatform ad campaign \u2014 though not until the day after enrollment opens \u2014 with the slogan \u201c95% of Minnesotans Now Have Health Insurance. 100% Need It.\u201d\n\nNatalie Villacorta and Rachana Pradhan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The W.H. is launching a more precise strategy that uses, among other things, targeted digital ads.", "title": "The selling of Obamacare 2.0", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/obamacare-enrollment-2015-112846.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/12/141112_obamacare_lede_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Barack Obama,Health Care,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The W.H. is launching a more precise strategy that uses, among other things, targeted digital ads.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a different marketing year than it was last year, \u201c said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the lead health insurance trade group, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\nIndividual mandate \u21d2 A fine: Last fall, Obamacare advocates shied away from talk about the detested individual mandate.\n\u201cWe made kynect about an individual and their family obtaining health insurance here in Kentucky,\u201d Exchange Director Carrie Banahan said.\nIt\u2019s not readily equated with health insurance, said Jill Midkiff, communications director at Kentucky\u2019s Cabinet for Health and Family Services.)\nAffordable Care Act \u21d2 Obamacare: Last fall, Jimmy Kimmel dispatched a camera crew to ask people strolling down Hollywood Boulevard whether they supported Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act."}
