Half a million people, around a quarter of the state\u2019s population, got coverage as a result.\n\nDemocrats have aggressively highlighted this in commercials and on the stump leading up to today\u2019s off-year gubernatorial election, suggesting that the Republicans would \u201ccallously\u201d eliminate the exchange if they won. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the defensive posture that Democrats largely took on the issue in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014.\n\nKentucky has seen the largest drop in its uninsured rate of any state in the country. It\u2019s currently 9 percent, down from 20.4 percent before Obamacare, according to the Louisville NPR affiliate. Open enrollment for next year began over the weekend, and the Kaiser Family Foundation says there are 285,000 uninsured Kentuckians who could still enroll using the so-called Kynect program.\n\nGOP gubernatorial nominee Matt Bevin has backtracked on repeal since he won a four-way primary in May. In the spring, he said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d reverse Beshear\u2019s executive order \u201cimmediately.\u201d In the final debate of the race, he suggested he would narrow eligibility to below 138 percent of the poverty line and try to get participants to have some \u201cskin in the game,\u201d in essence forcing people to pay some kind of deductible.\n\nPolling shows the Medicaid expansion playing to Democrats\u2019 advantage: The final Bluegrass Poll put Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway up 5 points. The Lexington Herald-Leader\u2019s Sam Youngman reported that Bevin\u2019s opposition to the expansion \u201cappears to be hurting him\u201d: 54 percent said they want the state\u2019s next governor to maintain the expansion; 24 percent say they would like to see it repealed; 22 percent were not sure. One-third of Republicans support maintaining the expansion.\n\nFor years, Gov. Beshear has publicly urged national Democrats to run on the health care law, regardless of whether they\u2019re from a red or a blue state. \u201cYou can tell there\u2019s a pent-up demand and a craving for access to health care,\u201d he said in an interview here. \u201cPeople came out of the woodwork in droves wanting to find about this. \u2026 This is a winner for our people, and because it\u2019s a winner for our people, it\u2019s going to be a winner politically.\u201d Beshear has been publicly attacking Bevin for saying he\u2019d roll back his signature initiative. \u201cHe understands that this is now a popular issue for Kentuckians and he\u2019s trying to somehow find a way out of it.\u201d\n\nExpressing confidence that Conway will win today, Beshear told me: \u201cIn 2016, I predict the Democratic nominee will make this a major issue and will pound the Republicans into the dust with it.\u201d\n\nSteve Beshear, pictured here with Nancy Pelosi, addressed the House Democratic Caucus in Dec. 2013, urging them to pitch healthcare.gov harder to their constituents.

Once these folks get insurance, it becomes politically untenable to take it away. It\u2019s more evidence, if any was needed, that Obamacare, for better or worse, is not going away, no matter who the president is in 2017 or what happens today in Kentucky.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n\u2014 An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Hillary Clinton slightly expanding her national lead. She gets 62 percent of Democrats, to 31 percent for Sanders. Martin O\u2019Malley received just 3 percent. Their last poll has Clinton up 58 to 33.\n\nMarco Rubio has popped from 4 percent last month to 13 percent now in a Monmouth University poll of New Hampshire. It\u2019s his best score in a poll of that state.\n\nPPP, the Democratic firm, released an Iowa poll showing that Donald Trump and Ben Carson are essentially tied (22-21), with Ted Cruz on the rise (14) and Rubio at 10. Bobby Jindal (6) now leads Jeb Bush (5) among Iowa caucusgoers\u2026\n\n\u2014 The company constructing the Keystone XL pipeline asked the State Department to halt its review, potentially delaying the final decision on the project until after President Obama leaves office. Juliet Eilperin has the latest on the zombie project.\n\n\u2014 New books pull back curtain on Vatican. Catholic Church authorities arrested two officials yesterday, accusing them of leaking damaging internal information for two books coming out this week. The Post obtained an early copy of one overnight. It highlights lavish spending by the cardinals, including a $26,400 helicopter ride taken by the former Vatican secretary of state, as well as numerous \u201csuspect accounts\u201d that still exist in the Vatican Bank (even though the church has said that practice stopped). The AP got ahold of the second book, which has Pope Francis ripping into officials over millions of euros in lost revenue and a break-in at the Vatican.\n\n\u2014 Ahmed Chalabi died of a heart attack at 73. The former deputy prime minster of Iraq, who strongly advocated for the U.S. to invade the country, gave some of the most-cited false intelligence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u2014 John Kerry urged Tajikistan\u2019s president not to go too far in cracking down on political Islam and religious beliefs. Yesterday, on his trip across the so-called Stans, he also warned Kazakhstan that repressing political opponents only invokes more extremism.

The man, Horace Muhammad, claimed that the police had manhandled him and that paramedics had mishandled his care before he got to the hospital. At the trial, the city\u2019s lawyers brought out the perfect expert witness to vouch for the paramedics: an internationally renowned surgeon and a revered local celebrity, Dr. Benjamin S. Carson. During two hours on the stand, Dr. Carson held the jury in thrall with careful medical explanations of spinal injuries, a quietly self-assured tone and even one reference to God as he undercut Mr. Muhammad\u2019s claims. Only the police had caused Mr. Muhammad\u2019s paralysis, Dr. Carson said. The paramedics had not hurt him \u2014 they had helped him. \u2026 Dr. Carson\u2019s testimony seems intriguingly resonant now, as he campaigns for president in a country shaken by a series of cases in which black men have died after encounters with the police, including Mr. Gray, who died in April of a spinal cord injury sustained in police custody. It also provides a window into Dr. Carson\u2019s stature in the community at the time, his understated confidence, and the way he was viewed by African-Americans whose lives were markedly less prosperous and accomplished.\u201d\n\n\u2014 USA Today, \u201cHow Trump is helping Clinton: Latino mobilization takes place,\u201d by Heidi M.
