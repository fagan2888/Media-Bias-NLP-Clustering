Sioux Falls, SD

A Sioux Falls man is headed back to jail after he was caught cruising Craigslist looking for women while he was serving a sentence for soliciting sex online.

Robert Corsini Junior was given a 90-day jail sentence after he was caught with a prostitute in his house in August.

Corsini was caught in two different online sex stings in the span of two weeks last fall. Now, he's headed back to jail for not following the rules of his jail sentence for those crimes.

"Certainly this defendant had no business going on a website and contacting a female to come over to his house while serving a jail sentence," Minnehaha County State's Attorney Aaron McGowan said.

Prosecutors say Corsini was serving a seven-day jail sentence for soliciting sex online on August 21. While he was on work release, he went on Craigslist and contacted a woman to come over to his house. Corsini is self-employed and works from his home.

The 21-year-old woman was caught later that night as part of a prostitution sting and says she and Corsini agreed to exchange money for sex.

"It was extremely aggravated by the fact that the defendant was serving a sentence for soliciting commercial sex and engaged in the exact conduct that was supposed to be prohibited by his jail sentence," McGowan said.

Corsini denied having sex with the woman in court and said he never gave her any money. He says he was simply looking at the 'casual encounters' portion of Craigslist and did not intend to solicit a prostitute.

However, the judge didn't buy that argument, saying its 'implausible' that Corsini didn't know she was a prostitute. He sentenced Corsini to 90-days in jail without the option of work release.

"This defendant has done it time and time again and supports that very dangerous industry so it was an appropriate sentence today," McGowan said.

Before being sentenced, Corsini told the judge he put himself in a 'very bad and stupid position.'
