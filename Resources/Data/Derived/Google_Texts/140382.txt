Happy Friday! TOP TALKER -- “Politico Hires Brad Dayspring, Veteran G.O.P. Operative” as its first Vice President of Communications, beginning Dec. 14 -- N.Y. Times’ Nick Corasaniti: “The growing news organization has hired Brad Dayspring, the outspoken and occasionally combative Republican political operative with a notorious Twitter feed … ‘We have always thought of Politico like a political candidate,’ Kim Kingsley, Politico’s chief operating officer, said in a memo … to the staff … ‘One that needs a carefully managed and consistent message, a great offensive strategy and a clear path ahead. … Brad was born for this job.’ …

“The position is a new one at Politico, one that … Jim VandeHei, chief executive and co-founder of Politico, said was necessary as the organization evolves into a global media company. Mr. Dayspring will oversee the entire communications portfolio and operation at Politico: promotion, booking, publicity and, yes, defending the brand against attacks. …

“Dayspring described the opportunity as an amalgamation of his loves – politics and policy … Dayspring will still be expected to maintain the quick response that drives his constant presence on social media. ‘I think one of his many tricks in his bag is he does understand the speed and different dimensions of communication now, and you’ve got to be quick and smart on all those platforms,’ Mr. VandeHei said in an interview.” http://nyti.ms/1OiLDzt ...

SCOOP DU JOUR -- “GOP group plans most aggressive anti-Trump campaign yet,” by Alex Isenstadt: “[Kasich’s] super PAC is planning to invest $2.5 million in the most aggressive takedown of the poll leader yet — on behalf of an increasingly anxious GOP establishment. The attack ... will play out over the next two months on radio, TV, mail and online in New Hampshire. Strategists with the pro-Kasich group, called New Day for America, say the budget for the anti-Trump campaign is likely to grow.” http://politi.co/1MY2Qih

--“Trump threatens to sue pro-Kasich super PAC,” by Alex Isenstadt: “[A] Trump lawyer, Alan Garten, sent two top strategists from the group, Matt David and Fred Davis, a letter on Trump Organization letterhead. A letter was also sent to Kasich himself. ‘Please be advised that in the event your ads contain any false, misleading, defamatory, or otherwise tortious statements or representations regarding Mr. Trump’s businesses or his brand, we will not hesitate to seek immediate legal action to prevent such distribution and hold you and your organizations jointly and severally liable.’” http://politi.co/1PDqcfp

ARTICLE OF THE DAY -- Zack Stanton, editor-in-chief of the Wilson Quarterly, on Politico, “The Page Who Took Down the GOP: Why I leaked the scandalous Mark Foley messages—and what I regret about it”: “I was a congressional page in 2001 and 2002. During that year, Foley sent sexual instant messages to at least three of my classmates. The messages weren’t flirtatious—though some started that way—but out and out lewd. ... [H]ow the conversations went public, and who gave them to reporters and started the avalanche that ended Foley’s career and dealt a blow to the Republican congressional majority, has never come out.

“It was me. I didn’t do it to sink the Republicans, though as an aspiring Democratic politico, I wasn’t sorry to see it happen. I did it because I realized just how easily Congressman Foley had been evading accountability for repeat offenses, and that the House leadership was either unwilling or unable to solve the problem.” http://politi.co/1kK9zCa

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- “How Ted Cruz is locking up the evangelical vote,” by Katie Glueck: “[E]vangelical leaders and political operatives who work with the Christian conservative movement say it’s the well-funded Cruz who has made the bigger organizational effort with politically active churchgoers. He’s rounding up the very grassroots leaders who wield influence with this crucial Republican voting bloc.” http://politi.co/1OUnkuC

THE POLITICO CAUCUS, our weekly insider poll from the early states -- “Insiders: Foreign policy blunders threaten Carson candidacy,” by Steve Shepard: “71 percent of Republicans said Carson was the most vulnerable among the 14 GOP hopefuls on foreign policy — far more than any other candidate. ‘He clearly has no idea what he’s talking about,’ said one South Carolina Republican. ‘Ben Carson's complete ineptitude makes you long for the days of “Uz-beki-beki-stan-stan,”’ added an Iowa Republican, referring to a disastrous Herman Cain interview four years ago.” http://politi.co/1SKXgA2

MAUREEN DOWD’s blockbuster inaugural piece for the Times Magazine – Cover story: “The Women of Hollywood Speak Out … All around Hollywood, women are ready to run studios, direct blockbuster pictures and write stories that go beyond dinosaurs and superheroes. What will it take to dismantle the pervasive sexism that keeps them from doing it?”: “In both 2013 and 2014, women were only 1.9 percent of the directors for the 100 top-grossing films. Excluding their art-house divisions, the six major studios released only three movies last year with a female director. ...

“When I phoned [a] powerful Hollywood player to ask about the issue, he said dismissively, ‘Call some chicks.’ So I did. I talked to more than 100 women and men at all levels of Hollywood. What I heard was an avalanche of previously pent-up fears, regrets, recriminations and recommendations.” http://nyti.ms/1NFOEqu See the cover, which features 63 portraits of women in Hollywood. http://bit.ly/1S7ossE

MARCO’s ISIL plan, written for Politico -- “We Asked Marco Rubio to Lay Out His ISIL Strategy. Here It Is” – Politico: “This is now more than a mere military battle; it is a civilizational struggle … First, I would protect the homeland by immediately stopping the flow of Syrian refugees into the United States—not because refugees fleeing conflict are unwelcome, but because it is currently impossible to verify their identities or intentions. ... Next, I would reverse defense sequestration so we have the capabilities to go on the offense...

Lack is in talks with Bloomberg Television to simulcast Heilemann and Halperin’s politics show With All Due Respect on MSNBC. One scenario being discussed is to air WADR at 6 p.m., filling the slot formerly occupied by Al Sharpton. The novel programming arrangement would conceivably benefit both sides.
