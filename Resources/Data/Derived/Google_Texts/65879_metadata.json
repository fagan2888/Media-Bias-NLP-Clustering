The UFC\u2019s biggest star arrived in Rio as the overwhelming favorite against Correia (9-1) after winning her previous three title defenses in a combined 96 seconds. She needed only 14 seconds to beat Cat Zingano at UFC 184 earlier this year.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of how I expected it,\u201d Rousey said. \u201cI planned to instead of trying to force a clinch, overwhelm her (by) striking first so that she would want to clinch first, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nRousey, who has been UFC\u2019s most dominant champion and is redefining the sport, has won 11 of her fights in the first round while being taken to the third round once. Her last five wins had come through her signature armbar, but this time it was her striking force that made the difference.\n\n\u201cI guess she can\u2019t really say anything about my hands anymore,\u201d Rousey said.\n\nRousey said she was fighting in memory of Hall of Fame wrestler Roddy Piper, whose death was confirmed Friday. Piper was one of Rousey\u2019s greatest idols and inspired her to take the \u201cRowdy\u201d nickname.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a really close friend, \u2018Rowdy\u2019 Roddy Piper, who gave me his permission to use his name as a fighter, so I hope he and my dad had a good time watching this today,\u201d Rousey said.\n\nRousey\u2019s next opponent will likely be fellow American Miesha Tate.\n\nIn the second-to-last fight on the main card on Saturday, Mauricio Rua topped Rogerio Nogueira with a unanimous decision in a fight between veteran Brazilian light heavyweight fighters. It was a rematch of fight between the two in 2005, when Rua won a contest that lasted 38 minutes.\n\n\u201cI knew he was going to be well prepared, but I won, I got the victory,\u201d Rua said.\n\nIn other fights Saturday, top-ranked strawweight fighter Claudia Gadelha of Brazil defeated Mexican-born Jessica Aguilar with a unanimous decision after three rounds; heavyweight Antonio Silva of Brazil beat Soa Palelei of Australia with a second-round knockout; Stefan Struve of the Netherlands beat Brazil\u2019s Minotauro Nogueira with a unanimous decision.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ronda Rousey crushes Bethe Correia to defend her title at UFC 190", "title": "Ronda Rousey crushes Bethe Correia to defend her title at UFC 190", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/01/ronda-rousey-crushes-bethe-correia-to-defend-her-title-at-ufc-190/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__rouseyp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150802__rouseyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T00:00:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:48:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf59e\"", "article_summary": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014Ronda Rousey defended her bantamweight title by knocking out Bethe Correia only 34 seconds into the first round at UFC 190 on Saturday night.\nIt was a rematch of fight between the two in 2005, when Rua won a contest that lasted 38 minutes.\nIn other fights Saturday, top-ranked strawweight fighter Claudia Gadelha of Brazil defeated Mexican-born Jessica Aguilar with a unanimous decision after three rounds; heavyweight Antonio Silva of Brazil beat Soa Palelei of Australia with a second-round knockout; Stefan Struve of the Netherlands beat Brazil\u2019s Minotauro Nogueira with a unanimous decision.\nIt was yet another impressive performance by Rousey, who improved to 12-0 in her incredible MMA career.\nRousey said she was fighting in memory of Hall of Fame wrestler Roddy Piper, whose death was confirmed Friday."}
