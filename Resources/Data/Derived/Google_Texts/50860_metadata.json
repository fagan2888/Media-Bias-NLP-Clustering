Brown has appointed a task force to comprehensively review the University\u2019s employee benefits program\u2014among them health care, retirement, tuition remission, and long-term disability. Brown will announced the initiative in an email to faculty and staff this morning.\n\n\u201cOur obligation is to ensure that Boston University can continue to thrive\u2014long into the future\u2014as an institution that offers excellent education and one where new ideas, inventions, and solutions are created and incubated,\u201d Brown writes. \u201cTo meet this obligation, we need to recruit and retain excellent faculty and staff. Simultaneously, we need to deploy our financial resources prudently, with sober assessments of economic realities and the evolving competitive landscape for higher education.\u201d\n\nThe goals of the task force, stated in Brown\u2019s letter, are to ensure that University benefits support the recruitment and retention of faculty and staff, are competitive with peer institutions, are cost-effective, and are sustainable over the long term. Beginning April 16, task force members will meet twice a month, with a September 1 deadline for delivering their initial report. At that time, the report will be made available to the University community, whose members will be encouraged to comment via their respective representatives. Implementation of any changes would begin in January 2016.\n\nBrown has appointed Robert Meenan, dean of the School of Public Health, as the task force chair and a special assistant on his staff. The task force comprises a dozen representatives chosen from faculty, staff, Human Resources, and Alumni Relations.\n\nThe president says he chose Meenan (MED\u201972, GSM\u201989), who announced in November that he would step down as SPH dean once a successor is chosen, for his understanding of the importance of benefits programs in the recruitment and retention of employees. The dean, who is also a physician, led a similar review at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, where he serves on the board of directors.\n\n\u201cBenefits are basically a critical success factor for any organization, BU included,\u201d Meenan says. \u201cOn the plus side, we\u2019re always competing to retain and attract faculty and staff. On the resources side, we need to use all our resources effectively,\u201d and that means taking a critical look at health care and retirement plans.\n\nHealth insurance is changing dramatically with the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) and with recent economic trends.\n\n\u201cHealth care continues to grow more than most other costs,\u201d says task force member Diane Tucker, the University\u2019s chief human resources officer. \u201cWe need to bend the curve on that. We can\u2019t sustain continued growth.\u201d\n\nOf great concern for the University, she says, are the ACA\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax and the rapidly rising cost of BU\u2019s prescription drug plan. Under the ACA, the federal government has the authority to impose a tax on health care plans priced at what it deems to be above-market value. Based on the value of the University\u2019s current health plans, BU would pay an excise tax of approximately $2.8 million in 2018 and a total of $31.6 million from 2018 through 2024. \u201cWe would be sending a lot of money to the government,\u201d Tucker says, instead of using those funds around campus.\n\nMeenan says the task force will also look at the University\u2019s retirement plan and will consider whether the current two-year waiting period for new employees to sign up should be reduced. Other considerations are whether the University should adjust the percentage of the amount it matches and whether the current plan equitably addresses the retirement options of lower- versus higher-paid employees.\n\nTuition remission, a signature benefit of employment at many institutions of higher education, will also be studied. Meenan points out that as BU\u2019s student admissions standards become more selective, fewer employees can enjoy the benefit. Also under review is the University\u2019s pension program for employees, which is considered less competitive than those at peer institutions, Tucker says. The two-year waiting period for all new employees is a particular sticking point.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s potential for some major changes, and we will need to begin to think about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that there\u2019ll be some changes that will be very positive for faculty and staff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Boston University", "og": {"site_name": "BU Today", "description": "Health, retirement, tuition remission among items being considered", "title": "Task Force to Review BU\u2019s Employee Benefits Program | BU Today | Boston University", "url": "http://www.bu.edu/today/2014/task-force-to-review-bus-employee-benefits-program/", "image": "http://www.bu.edu/today/files/2013/11/t_09-1300-PARADE-0159-332x221.jpg", "type": "article"}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "keywords": "Robert Meenan, Boston University, Employee Benefits Task Force", "last-updated": "2014-04-03T18:10:25-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc013\"", "article_summary": "Task Force to Review BU\u2019s Employee Benefits Program Health, retirement, tuition remission among items being consideredPresident Robert A.\nBrown has appointed a task force to comprehensively review the University\u2019s employee benefits program\u2014among them health care, retirement, tuition remission, and long-term disability.\nBeginning April 16, task force members will meet twice a month, with a September 1 deadline for delivering their initial report.\nThe task force comprises a dozen representatives chosen from faculty, staff, Human Resources, and Alumni Relations.\n\u201cHealth care continues to grow more than most other costs,\u201d says task force member Diane Tucker, the University\u2019s chief human resources officer."}
