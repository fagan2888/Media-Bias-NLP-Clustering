In private conversations and in meetings around the Capitol and on the House floor, top House GOP figures say most of DHS\u2019s 280,000 employees will stay on the job even without a new funding bill because they are considered essential employees \u2014 though their paychecks would stop coming in the meantime.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s not the House Republican leadership\u2019s goal \u2014 they passed their own bill this month. But that line of thinking \u2014 discussed privately by multiple lawmakers and aides \u2014 illustrates how the debate over Homeland Security funding is beginning to look like an awfully familiar crisis, filled with distrust, sniping, and the same kind of back and forth that has dominated GOP governance for the past few years.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how this immigration fight was supposed to unfold. When House Republican leaders decided to put DHS on a short funding leash in December, they were betting that even their unpredictable and restless rank and file would blink when it came to national security. With emboldened majorities on Capitol Hill, Republicans planned to put up a fight to gut President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions, but many of them vowed they would not allow the department\u2019s funding to lapse at the end of February. The House has passed its bill, with language aimed at gutting Obama\u2019s policies \u2014 language that won\u2019t make it into the Senate\u2019s version.\n\nEven as the Senate gears up to pass its bill, the path forward seems very murky.\n\nSenior sources in House Republican leadership are now saying they will not bring up a so-called \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill. They hope the Senate can insert some language to change part of Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration and are privately warning that a \u201cclean bill will not fly in the House,\u201d as one senior leadership aide put it. Several GOP aides said they were hoping the White House intervenes soon and accepts some changes to Obama\u2019s immigration actions to avoid a showdown.\n\nAnd, illustrating the flux and uncertainty within the House Republican Conference, the border security bill that the House was slated to bring up this week could now be delayed until sometime in late February or March or later this year \u2014 a victim of the distrust that the some of the conservative rank and file feel toward leadership.\n\nThat bill, penned by House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas), was meant to quell conservative concerns about the border \u2014 but now, many Republicans view it as a back-door way to enact immigration reform and are rejecting attempts to bring it to the floor until well after DHS is funded. In other words, Republicans are rejecting the piecemeal immigration reform they once clamored for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do the vote until after Feb. 27,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), who says he opposes the border bill. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be some bargaining chip on something that I believe needs to be dealt with by the Senate first.\u201d\n\nNow, to quiet concerns from some corners that Republicans aren\u2019t doing enough to challenge the White House, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is beginning to talk about suing the Obama administration over the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\n\nNext week, the House is moving onto more comfortable ground: legislation dealing with regulatory flexibility and a measure to defund Obamacare.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what Republican control was supposed to look like. When Republicans were on the precipice of power, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said they would end the legislative cliffhangers that have come to dominate Washington. Instead, they\u2019re heading into one.\n\nOf course, the debate isn\u2019t over. The House has done its part on DHS funding, and the Senate still has to produce a bill of its own. But what the Senate will do \u2014 and whether the House can accept it \u2014 is in doubt. Senate Democrats released a letter Tuesday calling for a so-called \u201cclean\u201d Homeland Security bill, a united front that would strip Republicans of the votes they would need to advance a funding measure that includes attacks on Obama\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nNot even the Republican leadership is entirely sure what the Senate will do. Some GOP sources said Tuesday that they expect Senate Republicans to release a funding bill that includes some modest change to immigration policy. One idea that\u2019s been discussed is attaching language to beef up immigration enforcement and detention in local communities.\n\nLessening the urgency, in some minds, of passing a Homeland Security funding bill is the fact that DHS\u2019s operations wouldn\u2019t necessarily shut down if funding expires after Feb. 27. In the October 2013 federal government shutdown, roughly 85 percent of DHS employees continued to work because their jobs were considered essential. However, their paychecks were withheld until the shutdown was over.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it\u2019s not the end of the world if we get to that time because the national security functions will not stop \u2014 whether it\u2019s border security or a lot of other issues,\u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said, though he stressed that Congress shouldn\u2019t ignore that deadline. \u201cHaving said so, I think we should always aspire to try to get it done.\u201d\n\nBlowing past the deadline would raise ire among national security hawks, who want DHS funding restored immediately, especially given the recent violence in Paris.\n\nThe internal rifts that are surfacing over immigration have been building since the beginning inside the House Republican conference. Earlier this month, more than two dozen House Republicans defected from the rest of their party to oppose a measure that would kill a 2012 Obama administration initiative for young undocumented immigrants \u2014 which would effectively leave more than 600,000 so-called Dreamers open to deportation.\n\nThe Republicans who theorize the House is moving forward on piecemeal immigration reform might be onto something. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in a brief interview Tuesday that his committee is \u201cworking on all the bills that we did last Congress,\u201d which would include interior enforcement, E-Verify, a program for agriculture workers and a separate program for high-skilled workers.\n\nThis mess has many Republican lawmakers shaking their heads, and more red-faced with anger. Republicans like Salmon think the Senate should \u201ccome up with creative ideas to do the job\u201d if they cannot pass the House bill. And Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), a supporter of immigration reform, said bluntly, \u201cWe are not going to miss our deadline.\u201d\n\nHe called the situation \u201cfrustrating\u201d and said it makes it \u201cdifficult to move on to the next issue when you can\u2019t deal with the deadline in front of you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Congress fights over immigration, top Republicans are increasingly unworried about missing DHS\u2019 February deadline.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "As Congress fights over immigration, top Republicans are increasingly unworried about missing DHS\u2019 February deadline.", "title": "Homeland Security funding on the brink", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/homeland-security-funding-cliff-114670.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/27/150127_us_mexico_border_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Matt Salmon,Senate,Republicans,Michael McCaul,Department Of Homeland Security,Immigration,Jeh Johnson,Homeland Security", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf508\"", "article_summary": "Lessening the urgency, in some minds, of passing a Homeland Security funding bill is the fact that DHS\u2019s operations wouldn\u2019t necessarily shut down if funding expires after Feb. 27.\nSenior sources in House Republican leadership are now saying they will not bring up a so-called \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill.\nSome GOP sources said Tuesday that they expect Senate Republicans to release a funding bill that includes some modest change to immigration policy.\nThe House has done its part on DHS funding, and the Senate still has to produce a bill of its own.\nTop Republicans are increasingly unworried about missing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s funding deadline."}
