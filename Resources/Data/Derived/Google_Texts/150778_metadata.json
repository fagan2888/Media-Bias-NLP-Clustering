Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., which would require the administration to explain decisions not to enforce laws when those decisions are rooted in policy concerns rather than just constitutional concerns (which the Justice Department is already required to do).\n\n\"The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why,\" DeSantis said when introducing his bill.\n\nOMB said DeSantis' law is too burdensome. \"The bill would inordinately expand current law, which already requires reports to Congress when non-enforcement of federal law is based on constitutional grounds,\" Obama's team said in a statement of administration policy.\n\n\"Federal agencies are continually engaged in the process of determining how to concentrate limited enforcement resources most effectively. ... The vastly expanded reporting scheme required by the bill would be unduly burdensome and would place the Attorney General in the unprecedented position of having to be kept informed of and report on enforcement decisions made by every other Federal agency,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe House is scheduled to vote on both bills Wednesday.\n\nOn the same day that DeSantis introduced his bill, Attorney General Eric Holder told Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that he thought Obama was \"probably at the height of his constitutional power\" when issuing the delays of Obamacare mandates, though he acknowledged that he couldn't explain the precise legal analysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama is threatening to veto a law that would allow Congress to sue him in federal courts for arbitrarily changing or refusing to enforce federal laws because it violates the separation of powers by encroaching on his presidential authority.\n[T]he power the bill purports to assign to Congress to sue the President over whether he has properly discharged his constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed exceeds constitutional limitations, the White House Office of Management and Budget said Wednesday in a statement of administration policy.
