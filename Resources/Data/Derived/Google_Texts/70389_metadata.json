Cannon - May 18, 2014\n\nAlex Baldwin has been in the news again, this time for berating NYPD officers instead of the paparazzi, Republicans, Rachel Maddow\u2014or others on his lengthy hit list.\n\nIt can be hard to defend the cantankerous \u201c30 Rock\u201d star, especially when he\u2019s doing things like berating his then-11-year-old daughter for missing a phone date with her dad, getting tossed off an American Airlines flight for tormenting flight attendants, or calling a British tabloid reporter \u201ca toxic little queen.\u201d As for punching photographers who stalk him and his family, well, that must be frustrating\u2014so let\u2019s withhold judgment for the moment.\n\nBut as for his run-in with the bicycle police, it\u2019s easy to defend Baldwin, regarding both his alleged traffic transgression and the larger issues he raised about living in New York. To recap: The 56-year-old actor was stopped for riding his bike the wrong way on Fifth Avenue, a one-way street. He was given a second citation, disorderly conduct, for the strenuous way he objected to the first. This entailed handcuffs and a ride to the station house.\n\nIt seems that Baldwin\u2019s objections to the bike citation stem from a legitimate public policy concern. Is the NYPD enforcing traffic laws against bicyclists because it cares about safety or, as Baldwin suggested, to feed the city\u2019s rapacious appetite for taxes and new revenue? The New York Post, no friend of the man it calls The Bloviator, found merit in his argument. \u201cWe never thought we\u2019d say so,\u201d the tabloid wrote the following day, \u201cbut Alec Baldwin has a point.\u201d\n\nAnd as one might expect, Baldwin phrased that point more colorfully than that. \u201cNew York City,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cis a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.\u201d\n\nOne could read the last part of that quote in two ways. First, that biking has previously been thought harmless. Second, that forcefully expressing one\u2019s opinion\u2014even to peace officers\u2014is any New Yorker\u2019s God-given right. Perhaps Baldwin took this concept too far, but \u201cf-bombs\u201d freely escape this man\u2019s lips when he\u2019s agitated. Moreover, he was reported to have used the line cops like least: \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d\n\nRecent DYKWIA offenders include Joe Biden\u2019s niece, Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon, and former NBA hotshot Allen Iverson. All of these cases have interesting variables, but the same constant. The variables are the precise circumstances of each arrest and the exact language employed. The constant is the notion that fame or notoriety should shield a celebrity\u2014or, worse, the relative of a celebrity\u2014from the consequences of their actions.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be handcuffed,\u201d Caroline Biden said after being arrested for a row with a roommate over unpaid rent. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re doing this to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to be on national news!\u201d Witherspoon hollered at a Georgia state trooper handcuffing her husband for driving under the influence. \u201cDo you know my name?\u201d\n\nWhen his car was pulled over for changing lanes improperly and he was found to be driving with expired tags, Iverson not only invoked \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d but taunted the officer. \u201cTake the vehicle, I have 10 more,\u201d he said. \u201cI make more money than you will in 10 years.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t what Baldwin was doing. He was riding his bike without any identifying information on him, and only got into the don\u2019t-they-recognize-me thing while trying to establish his identity so he could accept a citation and be on his way. No such luck.\n\nPerhaps this is the last straw. In a February piece for New York magazine, the Amityville, N.Y., native said NYC has changed since he moved there in 1979, and not for the better. \u201cIt was a place [where] they gave you your anonymity, and not just if you were famous,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t leave each other alone. Now we live in a digital arena, like some Roman Coliseum, with our thumbs up or thumbs down.\u201d\n\nHe added that he\u2019d \u201cprobably\u201d leave New York for California. \u201cI just can\u2019t live in New York anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I hated about L.A. I\u2019m beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that. But New York has changed.\u201d\n\nThis new Alec Baldwin, with his live-and-let live sensibilities, disdain for government shakedowns, and desire for privacy\u2014this libertarian-leaning Alec Baldwin\u2014is an intriguing character. Moreover, if he actually does relocate, he\u2019d be going to a state where many actors have successfully sought political office. George Murphy, Ronald Reagan, Sony Bono, Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Clint Eastwood\u2014Republicans all\u2014were performing artists before they were politicians. Although he\u2019s a Democrat, Baldwin would fit right in.\n\nMoreover, he\u2019s needed in California. Here, state and local governments are even more overextended than in New York\u2014and more creative at bleeding the citizenry dry. If a cop in the Golden State sees you make a \u201cCalifornia stop,\u201d i.e. rolling through a stop sign, the typical ticket is $238\u2014eight times what is was in 1992 when Baldwin, as the malevolent \u201cBlake,\u201d was getting them to sign on the line which is dotted in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d And God forbid an otherwise law-abiding Californian runs a red light: The fine is $490, plus another $59 for traffic school.\n\nNow there\u2019s a regressive tax for you, one that hits the poor and working class particularly hard. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see Baldwin fight one of those tickets in front of someone such as Oakland traffic commissioner Taylor Culver, who\u2019s been known to bellow to defendants who ask for a reduction in their fine, \u201cNobody here is special or better than anybody. There\u2019s nobody here special but me.\u201d\n\nSo, yes, Californians could definitely use Alec Baldwin. But much as I\u2019d love him to move to my native state, I feel obliged\u2014in case he sees this column\u2014to issue him, well, a warning ticket. In that New York magazine interview, Baldwin singled out TMZ founder Harvey Levin for special disdain. \u201cHarvey Levin exists in his own universe,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s this kind of cretinous barnacle on the press.\u201d\n\nBut Levin is a Los Angeles native who operates extensively in Southern California. He\u2019s not a guy dissuaded by gated communities. (Just ask Donald Sterling, who delivered his whacky ruminations on race relations in his own home.) Also, there are more paparazzi in L.A. than New York, and punching them in the face isn\u2019t legal in California, either.\n\nSo, Alec: Montana, maybe?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alex Baldwin has been in the news again, this time for berating NYPD officers instead of the paparazzi, Republicans, Rachel Maddow\u2014or others on his lengthy hit list.\nIt can be hard to defend...", "title": "Alec Baldwin's Troubled State | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/05/18/alec_baldwins_troubled_state_122644.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/110916_2_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Alex Baldwin has been in the news again, this time for berating NYPD officers instead of the paparazzi, Republicans, Rachel Maddow\u2014or others on his lengthy hit list.\nIt can be hard to defend...", "title": "Alec Baldwin's Troubled State | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Alec Baldwin's Troubled State | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "alec baldwin,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceff2\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s nobody here special but me.\u201dSo, yes, Californians could definitely use Alec Baldwin.\n\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d say so,\u201d the tabloid wrote the following day, \u201cbut Alec Baldwin has a point.\u201dAnd as one might expect, Baldwin phrased that point more colorfully than that.\nBut New York has changed.\u201dThis new Alec Baldwin, with his live-and-let live sensibilities, disdain for government shakedowns, and desire for privacy\u2014this libertarian-leaning Alec Baldwin\u2014is an intriguing character.\nMoreover, if he actually does relocate, he\u2019d be going to a state where many actors have successfully sought political office.\nHere, state and local governments are even more overextended than in New York\u2014and more creative at bleeding the citizenry dry."}
