Participating state and local agencies partner with the federal government, and law enforcement agencies keep up to 80 percent of the proceeds from property and money seized.\n\nLast year, California law enforcement agencies received more than $89.6 million through the federal government\u2019s Equitable Sharing Program.\n\nIn an email to Lee Carter, Santa Barbara\u2019s senior deputy district attorney, Melissa Nasrah, legal counsel for the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, expressed concern about the proposed reforms to California\u2019s civil asset forfeiture laws.\n\n\u201cI highly doubt our federal agencies can figure out whether a conviction occurred in any timely manner,\u201d Nasrah wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they would have the resources, desire, or technical capability even [if] they have the first two.\u201d\n\nNasrah went on to tell Carter that the \u201clegislation, in effect, takes decision-making authority away from the Treasury.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccordingly,\u201d she continued, \u201cI think I would still advise our policy officials here that it would be prudent to not share with CA agencies should this law be passed.\u201d\n\n>>> In 12 Oklahoma Counties, Millions Seized From Property Owners Who Were Never Charged With Crimes\n\nIn a similar email to Carter, Alice Dery, deputy chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, warned that if the proposed legislation is passed, California\u2019s state and local law enforcement agencies will not be able to participate in the Justice Department\u2019s Equitable Sharing Program.\n\n\u201cA transfer to a state-controlled fund would not be a permissible use of funds, especially when that central fund would redistribute money to all law enforcement agencies in the state, regardless of their eligibility or participation in the program,\u201d Dery wrote.\n\nThe California legislature is currently debating legislation that would reform the state\u2019s civil asset forfeiture laws. If signed into law, law enforcement would be allowed to forfeit property and money only if a property owner is convicted of a crime. The legislation also prohibits law enforcement agencies from transferring seized property and cash to the federal government.\n\nUnder the proposed reforms, law enforcement agencies are entitled to the proceeds from cash or money seized through Equitable Sharing only if the property owner is convicted of a crime.\n\nThe California Senate passed the proposed reforms, 38-1, and the state Assembly is set to debate the changes this week.\n\nHowever, members of the law enforcement community are pushing back on the legislation.\n\nIn an August letter to California state senators obtained by the Institute for Justice, the California District Attorneys Association spoke out against the reforms.\n\n\u201cThe current version of the bill would essentially deny every law enforcement agency in California direct receipt of any forfeiture assets,\u201d Sean Hoffman, director of legislation for the California District Attorneys Association, wrote in the letter. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s asset forfeiture law will be changed for the worse, and it will cripple the ability of law enforcement to forfeit assets from drug dealers when arrest and incarceration is an incomplete strategy for combatting drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nCivil asset forfeiture is a tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize property and money if they are suspected of being tied to a crime. Asset forfeiture was originally intended to combat money laundering and drug trafficking, but police departments have been increasingly using the tool to pad their budgets in difficult fiscal times.\n\nIn addition to California, state lawmakers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma have been debating changes to their state civil asset forfeiture laws.\n\nEarlier this year, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez signed legislation reforming the state\u2019s forfeiture laws. New Mexico\u2019s law now requires proceeds from federal forfeitures to be deposited into the state\u2019s general fund.\n\nIn response to the reforms, New Mexico is no longer eligible for the federal government\u2019s Equitable Sharing Program, according to emails from the Treasury Department.\n\n\u201cThese emails make it clear that the [Department of Justice] is trying to make an example of New Mexico and ward off other states from curtailing the federal government\u2019s ability to forfeit private property without first obtaining a criminal conviction,\u201d McGrath said.\n\n>>> How California Cities Are Making Millions Seizing Property and Money From Law-Abiding Citizens", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is trying to deter California from reforming its laws governing how police can seize cash and property.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The federal government is trying to deter California from reforming its laws governing how police can seize cash and property.", "title": "How the Government Is Deterring This State From Reforming Forfeiture", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150908_CalifForfeiture_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-08T22:59:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OvFWgF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The federal government is trying to deter California from reforming its laws governing how police can seize cash and property.", "title": "How the Government Is Deterring This State From Reforming Forfeiture", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150908_CalifForfeiture_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-09-08T16:14:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-08T22:59:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "civil asset forfeiture, California District Attorneys Association, Institute for Justice, criminal justice, Equitable Sharing, Justice Department, Susana Martinez"}, "article_summary": "In addition to California, state lawmakers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma have been debating changes to their state civil asset forfeiture laws.\nIn an email to Lee Carter, Santa Barbara\u2019s senior deputy district attorney, Melissa Nasrah, legal counsel for the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, expressed concern about the proposed reforms to California\u2019s civil asset forfeiture laws.\nIn an August letter to California state senators obtained by the Institute for Justice, the California District Attorneys Association spoke out against the reforms.\nLast year, California law enforcement agencies received more than $89.6 million through the federal government\u2019s Equitable Sharing Program.\n\u201cI highly doubt our federal agencies can figure out whether a conviction occurred in any timely manner,\u201d Nasrah wrote."}
