Certainly from reading SWPL from beginning to end I\u2019m fairly certain he shares my politics, that he sees himself as a leftist commenting on his fellow leftists. I have no personal beef with him, or with the creators and cast of \u201cPortlandia\u201d or \u201cGirls,\u201d the spiritual sequels to SWPL. (OK, I have kind of a problem with Lena Dunham, but that\u2019s a whole other column. One that, in fact, several other people have already written, so I won\u2019t bother with it here.)\n\nIf Mr. Lander reads this, I apologize profusely. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d get along great if we met in real life. It pains me to say it, but I think Christian Lander \u2014 and his colleagues in the \u201cmocking effete white liberals\u201d business \u2014 are seriously damaging the culture at large.\n\nBecause whether he meant to or not, the SWPL formula updated the old \u201climousine liberal\u201d stereotype for the digital age, and it\u2019s an extremely powerful, tenacious stereotype once invoked. He made a formula out of shaming the powerful for giving a shit about the powerless. He made being a white person who gives a shit about their own racism seem pathetic, and self-serving, and fake.\n\nBefore the sneering term \u201cSJW\u201d (\u201cSocial Justice Warrior\u201d) went viral, the Internet version of putting down elitist out-of-touch liberals was frequently just calling people a \u201cSWPL.\u201d\n\nChristian Lander gave a great gift to the right. He made giving a shit seem silly. He popularized a rhetorical stance that makes people feel worried about caring too much about their values in public lest they get mocked as vain blowhards. And nothing makes proponents of the status quo happier than that.\n\nLike most effective mudslinging, it\u2019s rooted in truth. Lander was criticizing something genuinely problematic he saw among white anti-racist liberals \u2014 or male feminists, or wealthy people who fight against poverty, or straight allies of LGBT people.\n\nPrivileged allies tend to be motivated by their own subjective feelings of discomfort and guilt from witnessing oppression. Which isn\u2019t itself a bad thing \u2014 oppression should make us feel uncomfortable and guilty \u2014 but it\u2019s a very superficial emotion compared to what people feel whose lives have been defined by oppression. As a superficial emotion, it invites a superficial response.\n\nAnd so you get people investing a great deal of earnestness in very shallow gestures. Turning your profile photo green to support dissidents in Iran. Wearing a rainbow flag pin as a show of \u201csupport\u201d for suicidal closeted gay teenagers. Proudly displaying a bumper sticker saying you voted for Obama in 2008. Hovering around members of oppressed groups with a hungry look on your face, desperate for affirmation and absolution, generally being annoying and getting in the way while doing little that\u2019s of actual use.\n\nWe know that stereotype. I\u2019ve been on both ends of it: rolling my eyes with well-meaning white people trying to \u201chelp,\u201d and being the clueless guy thinking I can \u201chelp\u201d in conversations about feminism. I\u2019ve written before, at length, about why being a male feminist is really hard and prone to constant fuck-ups.\n\nBut you know what? Yes, it\u2019s really, really hard to be a \u201cgood ally.\u201d It\u2019s quite a bit easier to pretend to try to be a \u201cgood ally\u201d and get brownie points. But even that amount of effort of being a fake ally is still more effort than sitting back, lifting your lip in a sneer and indulging in ironic mockery of other people\u2019s fakeness.\n\nBut the fact that people who prattle endlessly about their \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d and \u201ccarbon offsets\u201d can be obnoxious doesn\u2019t change the fact that the ocean levels are rising and the planet warming. The insufferable arrogance of many of the college kids who mouthed Occupy Wall Street jargon doesn\u2019t change the way the recession ruined millions of American lives and real income inequality grows every single day. And the fact that white people engaging in absurd circumlocutions and signaling behaviors to try to appear not racist is funny doesn\u2019t change the fact that racism is real, racism is bad, and trying to be less racist is a noble and worthy goal even if it is often pursued by ignoble means.\n\nLook, I\u2019ll be blunt. People of color need white allies. Women need male allies. LGBT activists need straight allies. Allies matter.\n\nNot in the sense that a movement is only legitimized if a white person joins it or that we need white people to be cool-headed leaders because we\u2019re \u201ctoo close to the issue\u201d or any of that BS. But in the simple practical sense. Oppressed and marginalized groups already deal with the burden of being oppressed and marginalized. A fight to redress an imbalance of power in society can\u2019t succeed for long if 100 percent of the burden falls on the people who lack power.\n\nSo what\u2019s a really, really effective way to strangle any movement for change in the crib? The two-pronged approach of mocking privileged people for their pious hypocrisy in joining it and then letting marginalized people, once they have to stand alone, sink under the weight of being marginalized.\n\nTake the Gamergate debacle. (Yes, you knew I was going there eventually).\n\nUnfortunately, there are few relationships in our society more fraught with muddled signals and ulterior motives and bad faith than the way men and women who don\u2019t know each other well interact. Yes, there are way too many \u201cmale feminists\u201d who see spouting their feminist bona fides as a way to boost their status, assuage their guilt and, yes, get laid. Yes, the term \u201cwhite knight\u201d was invented to describe a real behavior \u2014 men barging in to defend women and then take ownership of the interaction so they can get all the credit for \u201crescuing\u201d them \u2014 that is negative and worthy of being mocked.\n\nBut when women in the gaming industry are being viciously attacked and harassed by an angry mob and men who try to meet the basic lower bound of human decency by speaking up against it get slammed as \u201cwhite knights\u201d who are \u201cjust trying to get in her pants,\u201d well \u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're so used to skewering dopey progressives who try too hard that we forget what it takes to create real change", "title": "From Stuff White People Like to #NotYourShield: How irony is killing activism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We're so used to skewering dopey progressives who try too hard that we forget what it takes to create real change", "title": "From Stuff White People Like to #NotYourShield: How irony is killing activism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/from_stuff_white_people_like_to_notyourshield_how_irony_is_killing_activism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/swpl.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're so used to skewering dopey progressives who try too hard that we forget what it takes to create real change", "title": "From Stuff White People Like to #NotYourShield: How irony is killing activism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/swpl.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Arthur Chu", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #notyourshield, arthur chu, Editor's Picks, Race, stuff white people like", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde50b\"", "article_summary": "So what\u2019s a really, really effective way to strangle any movement for change in the crib?\nYes, it\u2019s really, really hard to be a \u201cgood ally.\u201d It\u2019s quite a bit easier to pretend to try to be a \u201cgood ally\u201d and get brownie points.\nPeople of color need white allies.\nHe made being a white person who gives a shit about their own racism seem pathetic, and self-serving, and fake.\nIt pains me to say it, but I think Christian Lander \u2014 and his colleagues in the \u201cmocking effete white liberals\u201d business \u2014 are seriously damaging the culture at large."}
