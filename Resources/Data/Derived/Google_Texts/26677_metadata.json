She\u2019s still setting up or project, \u2018Too Small to Fail\u2019 \u2013 a children\u2019s effort through our foundation, and we\u2019re having a lot of fun \u2013 going to movies and restaurants, and taking walks \u2014 being a normal person,\u201d former President Clinton said. \u201cI mean, you know, at our age, that counts for something \u2013 being able to have a little fun.\u201d\n\nFormer President Clinton said there are more important issues to focus on, including the threat of a government shutdown, the possibility that President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act may be stalled, and possible cuts to food stamp assistance. But ultimately, he said he truly did not know if former Secretary Clinton was planning a run for the White House.\n\n\u201cYou know that if I did know, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. But I honestly don\u2019t know. Chelsea doesn\u2019t know, and Hillary doesn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing for America. We should be focusing on these big challenges now, and talking about how to get this country back on track.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Clinton recently gave her first interview since stepping down.\n\nWhen asked whether she wrestles with running, Clinton responded: \u201cI do, But I\u2019m both pragmatic and realistic.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady went on to say: \u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry\u2026. I think it\u2019s a serious decision, not to be made lightly, but it\u2019s also not one that has to be made soon.\u201d\n\nClinton spoke to reporter Joe Hagan.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s come out for the first time here and said, you know, I\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cSo she\u2019s weighing it.\u201d\n\nAll three Clintons now work for the newly-renamed Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton told David Letterman Monday that he does not know whether his wife will be running for president in 2016.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/23/bill-clinton-on-letterman-i-honestly-dont-know-if-hillary-is-running/", "image": {"width": 838, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bill_clinton_on_letterman_0923.jpg?w=838", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bill_clinton_on_letterman_0923.jpg?w=838", "height": 472}, "type": "article", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton told David Letterman Monday that he does not know whether his wife will be running for president in 2016.", "title": "Bill Clinton On Letterman: 'I Honestly Don't Know' If Hillary Is Running"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/bill_clinton_on_letterman_0923.jpg?w=838", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton told David Letterman Monday that he does not know whether his wife will be running for president in 2016.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bill Clinton On Letterman: 'I Honestly Don't Know' If Hillary Is Running"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "campaign 2016, local, news, ny news, politics, radio.com - news, syndicated local, syndication, bill clinton, david letterman, former president, former president bill clinton, hillary clinton, president bill clinton, presidential run, secretary of state", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "bill clinton, david letterman, former president, former president bill clinton, hillary clinton, president bill clinton, presidential run, secretary of state"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton told David Letterman Monday that he does not know whether his wife will be running for president in 2016.\nBut ultimately, he said he truly did not know if former Secretary Clinton was planning a run for the White House.\n\u201cShe\u2019s come out for the first time here and said, you know, I\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d Hagan said.\n\u201cIf she\u2019s running, to your knowledge, blink twice,\u201d Letterman said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff out there, and she\u2019s just \u2013 she\u2019s still finishing her book."}
