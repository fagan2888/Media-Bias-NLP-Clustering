(Photo: Rob Schumacher/The Republic)\n\nIt's only April but already fists are flying \u2013 anonymously, of course -- in the cagefight that will be the Republican gubernatorial primary.\n\nA dark money group called the Legacy Foundation Action Fund is spending $275,000 on ads linking Mesa Mayor Scott Smith to President Barack Obama. Smith is president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which supports the Affordable Care Act and background checks on gun sales.\n\n\"Obama's favorite mayor Scott Smith is president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. What does his organization support?\" the ad says, while showing pictures of Smith, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe ad urges viewers to call Smith's office.\n\n\"These policies are wrong for Mesa. Tell Scott Smith to make his organization more like Mesa, not the other way around,\" the ad says.\n\nWho knew the Iowa-based Legacy Foundation Action Fund was so concerned with what goes on in Mesa?\n\nOr could it be that Smith's a Republican running for governor, one seen as stiff competition for state Treasurer Doug Ducey?\n\nDon't look to find the ties that bind Legacy Foundation Action Fund to a gubernatorial candidate. This group is calling its ad \"issues advocacy\" rather than an election piece, a sweet move that allows it to duck what few requirements there are in Arizona for disclosure of who is actually behind the ad.\n\nSmith -- who says, by the way, that he opposes Obamacare -- is claiming that Ducey is behind the anonymous attack.\n\n\"The issue-advocacy television ad linking Smith to Obama by virtue of his leadership role in the US Conference of Mayors was designed by Ducey's media consultant, Larry McCarthy,\" Max Fose, Smith's campaign adviser, said in an email.\n\nTeam Ducey says not so and asks where's the proof.\n\nOf course, there isn't any, which is the whole point of dark money.\n\nIt's worth noting that McCarthy produced a recent ad for the Legacy Foundation in another state.\n\nBut that is, apparently, just one giant coincidence.\n\n\"Our firm did one ad for the Legacy Foundation, one time, in Nebraska and that's it,\" McCarfthy told the Arizona Capitol Times. \"We had nothing to do with the ad currently running in Arizona. We didn't know it was coming or who produced it.\".\n\nSo is Team Ducey involved in this anonymous smear? Beats me. That's the problem with dark money. There are no fingerprints to be publicly found on the hands hurling the mud.\n\nOur leaders must like it that way because the Arizona Legislature, once again this year, has declined to do anything to compel disclosure.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/PV2GOQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Laurie Roberts: The first of the dark money attacks ads has begun in this year's governor's race.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Laurie Roberts: The first of the dark money attacks ads has begun in this year's governor's race.", "title": "Who's behind the anonymous smear on Scott Smith?", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/laurie-roberts/2014/04/10/arizona-governor-smith-ducey-dark-money-campaign-finance/7551739/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Laurie Roberts: The first of the dark money attacks ads has begun in this year's governor's race.", "title": "Who's behind the anonymous smear on Scott Smith?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47fd768a4c2b7f282ada655d6a57385b3251a7d3/c=0-818-3238-4056&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurie.roberts1?fref=ts"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Scott Smith", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Scott Smith", "title": "Who's behind the anonymous smear on Scott Smith?", "author": "Laurie Roberts", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed/laurie-roberts", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/869ae2e23c4535747f07fc75e1364a40b300b4d3/c=0-119-3238-4448/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2de399ce37652c9ec81ce2b6059460b8c99ba60/c=0-818-3238-4056/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2500a0f6436b4c4573646c4bf48ccaa79bf0340c/c=0-925-3238-3357/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8cde36c5d76cc5b981d44ed04e42928bfa48ac20/c=0-1079-3238-2906&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-10T17:12:54.257000-07:00", "shorthed": "Who's behind the anonymous smear on Scott Smith?", "articleid": 7551739, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3651c5ad99e499c79c0326b64cd3ba4c9e6c15a/c=0-1079-3238-2906/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/74c41d3770bd0c60774fdf62fdfb770a7f72c5ff/c=261-0-2918-4736/local/-/media/Phoenix/LaurieRoberts/2014/04/10//1397159098000-scott-smith.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "dark money, arizona governor's race, doug ducey, scott Smith, campaign finance, attack ads"}, "article_summary": "A dark money group called the Legacy Foundation Action Fund is spending $275,000 on ads linking Mesa Mayor Scott Smith to President Barack Obama.\n\"Obama's favorite mayor Scott Smith is president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\nMesa Mayor Scott Smith at his office on Monday, Mar.\nTell Scott Smith to make his organization more like Mesa, not the other way around,\" the ad says.\nDon't look to find the ties that bind Legacy Foundation Action Fund to a gubernatorial candidate."}
