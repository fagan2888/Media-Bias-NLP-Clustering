For them, the ruling keeps coverage affordable.\n\nFor the state as a whole, the ruling has important benefit as well.\n\nArizona needs healthy people to succeed. A healthy workforce translates into productivity and lower costs for employers, ultimately benefiting us all.\n\nArizona needs affordable health coverage to keep its workforce productive. Luckily, AHCCCS \u2014 Arizona\u2019s health care program for low-income and disabled individuals \u2014 is a national leader in providing cost-effective, quality care while also controlling costs.\n\nStill, the debate continues over the Affordable Care Act, and whether to continue to restore and expand Medicaid coverage for thousands of Arizonans who lost it during the Great Recession.\n\nWith all this debate, it is easy to lose sight of how increased access to affordable health coverage is helping our state. Consider the following:\n\n-- Over 470,000 Arizonans, nearly seven times the population of Flagstaff, have gained coverage since 2014 through AHCCCS or the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n\n-- Arizona hospitals are seeing a decline in uncompensated care. Since costs associated with unpaid bills are shifted to those who have insurance, this benefits us all.\n\n-- We are beginning to see improvements in people seeking and obtaining needed, preventive health care nationally. In the long run, this should translate into a healthier (and less costly) population.\n\n-- Restoration and expansion of AHCCCS coverage has helped leverage millions of federal dollars for the state, boosting our state\u2019s overall economic health as we continue our still slow economic recovery.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s Health Initiatives has seen this state come together like never before to help realize these coverage gains. Our foundation has helped convene Cover Arizona, a coalition comprised of more than 900 individuals representing health providers, businesses, faith-based organizations and community members to help people connect to coverage.\n\nArizonans are seeing the benefits in nearly every community in this state. Coalition members talk about how health coverage is making a difference in the lives of individuals and families, from allowing a mother to purchase her child\u2019s medications to enabling a sole proprietor to get the health care he needs to stay employed.\n\nAs Arizona weathers the insurance coverage controversies, let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that access to affordable health coverage matters, both to our citizenry and to Arizona\u2019s overall health.\n\nSuzanne Pfister is CEO of St. Luke's Health Initiatives.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1S67Gya", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "My Turn: It\u2019s not just Arizonans receiving coverage who are seeing benefits", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "My Turn: It\u2019s not just Arizonans receiving coverage who are seeing benefits", "title": "Obamacare making big difference in Arizona", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/07/27/obamacare-works-arizona/30648357/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "My Turn: It\u2019s not just Arizonans receiving coverage who are seeing benefits", "creator": "@azcentral", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0816535dead1a3b43aca597a5b60fa81497a8edd/c=0-91-728-819&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg", "title": "Obamacare making big difference in Arizona", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Preventive care", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Preventive care", "title": "Obamacare making big difference in Arizona", "author": "Suzanne Pfister", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b6fea679bf0486d1757c855c3b58d6d090e6aeb2/c=23-0-705-910/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/51e17ec472f517240f6b1512a1d19eee4a383234/c=0-91-728-819/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a201e79c88f174980ab174011a9fddb044c07648/c=0-182-728-728/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12ebb41b4740d31bd51224c9ab77becd6a124f9b/c=0-250-728-660&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-26T22:41:15.723000-07:00", "shorthed": "My Turn: Obamacare making big difference in Arizona", "articleid": 30648357, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9c982bd94eafd8174e7479e048799887480be2bc/c=0-250-728-660/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71934073b4f72d796aa719cddd2ac17717e59651/c=108-0-620-910/local/-/media/2015/07/24/Phoenix/B9318214968Z.1_20150724195702_000_GV5BEMCGC.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, obamacare arizona, affordable care act arizona"}, "article_summary": "Arizona needs affordable health coverage to keep its workforce productive.\nAs Arizona weathers the insurance coverage controversies, let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that access to affordable health coverage matters, both to our citizenry and to Arizona\u2019s overall health.\nLuckily, AHCCCS \u2014 Arizona\u2019s health care program for low-income and disabled individuals \u2014 is a national leader in providing cost-effective, quality care while also controlling costs.\n-- We are beginning to see improvements in people seeking and obtaining needed, preventive health care nationally.\nWith all this debate, it is easy to lose sight of how increased access to affordable health coverage is helping our state."}
