"I want Republicans to embrace innovation and technology," George Pataki said. | Getty Pataki: Republicans are afraid of science

George Pataki vented some frustration at the Republican Party during Wednesday's debate, hinting that there's at least a handful of things that frustrate him about his political brethren.

"One of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question the science that everyone accepts," he said, when asked about his position on climate change. He said Republicans often question the science on vaccines and climate, despite nearly incontrovertible proof. And he said they do it because they're scared acknowledging climate change will lead to more government regulation.

"I want Republicans to embrace innovation and technology," he said.

Though earlier in the debate he said he would largely do away with tax loopholes, He suggested he would implement R&D tax credits to let the private sector address climate change.
