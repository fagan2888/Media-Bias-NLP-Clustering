Though it didn\u2019t cause any serious problems, the children were sent to the hospital immediately to be checked. The hospital staff announced that there were no life-threatening complications and the children were released to be taken home.\n\nAccidental ingestion of bleach \u2014 particularly among children \u2014 occurs every so often, and poison centers recommend different treatments depending on how much bleach is ingested. Hospitalization usually isn\u2019t required when the consumed amount is smaller than 100 ml. Fortunately, none of the children from the downtown Jersey City day care were injured, and were returned home safely that day with no adverse symptoms.\n\nThe day care was set to open again on Friday, and parents were given a letter explaining what happened. The employee who mistakenly gave children bleach to drink was fired, and the remaining day care staff will have a re-training session, according to ABC 7.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bleach, new jersey day care", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "28 children were rushed to the hospital after a new day care employee accidentally gave them a mix of bleach and water to drink, assuming it was water.", "title": "Kids In Day Care Mistakenly Drink Bleach, Thinking It Was Water [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/day-care-employee-gets-fired-after-kids-accidentally-drink-bleach-milk-container-302980", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/13/kids.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "28 children were rushed to the hospital after a new day care employee accidentally gave them a mix of bleach and water to drink, assuming it was water.", "title": "Kids In Day Care Mistakenly Drink Bleach, Thinking It Was Water [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/day-care-employee-gets-fired-after-kids-accidentally-drink-bleach-milk-container-302980", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/13/kids.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/13/kids.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-13T17:15:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T17:20:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "28 children were rushed to the hospital after a new day care employee accidentally gave them a mix of bleach and water to drink, assuming it was water."}, "article_summary": "The employee who mistakenly gave children bleach to drink was fired, and the remaining day care staff will have a re-training session, according to ABC 7.\nThe day care was set to open again on Friday, and parents were given a letter explaining what happened.\nA newly hired employee at a New Jersey day care accidentally poured drinks from a re-purposed gallon milk container filled with a mix of bleach and water to young children, assuming it was water.\nChildren at a New Jersey day care were accidentally given bleach instead of water to drink, but all ended up well and were released from the hospital without any issues.\nFortunately, none of the children from the downtown Jersey City day care were injured, and were returned home safely that day with no adverse symptoms."}
