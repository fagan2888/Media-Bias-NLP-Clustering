And then some suggested we have Jeb [Bush's] people on a month or so ago, but we held to the same policy.\"\n\n\n\nThe same goes for everyone in the race, Scarborough explained. On the Republican side, Ben Carson, John Kasich and Marco Rubio have yet to appear, so until then, the host said, none of their campaigns will have a chance to speak for their candidate.\n\nThe \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts haven\u2019t exactly been very flattering of Clinton. After hearing reports that her campaign had basically manufactured a campaign event in April, Mika Brzezinski criticized Hillary for her lack of authenticity. Then, in September, Joe and Mika picked apart Clinton\u2019s \u201capology\u201d video as flat and forced. Oh and then there was that time the panel mocked Hillary for wearing what looked like an \u201corange jumpsuit\u201d to a press conference on her emails.\n\nI don\u2019t get the Clinton campaign strategy. I mean, are her proxies really any better?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Media blackout..05/26/2016 1:43:00AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Media blackout.", "title": "Wonder Why No Clinton Campaign Staff Have Appeared on 'Morning Joe?'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/07/report-clinton-campaign-not-allowed-on-morning-joe-until-hillary-agrees-to-appear-n2062331", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/6/24/6.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Media blackout.", "title": "Wonder Why No Clinton Campaign Staff Have Appeared on 'Morning Joe?'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/07/report-clinton-campaign-not-allowed-on-morning-joe-until-hillary-agrees-to-appear-n2062331", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/6/24/6.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Report: Clinton Campaign Not Allowed on 'Morning Joe' Until Hillary Agrees to Appear, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd401e\"", "article_summary": "Wonder why no Clinton campaign staffers have appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe?\u201d It is an intentional blackout until Hillary agrees to come on the show herself, Joe Scarborough told Politico.\nI don\u2019t get the Clinton campaign strategy.\nThe \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts haven\u2019t exactly been very flattering of Clinton.\n\"The rule was put in place for Hillary's campaign because while just about every other candidate came on, the Clinton team kept trying to put out surrogates and staffers,\u201d host Joe Scarborough told POLITICO.\nAfter hearing reports that her campaign had basically manufactured a campaign event in April, Mika Brzezinski criticized Hillary for her lack of authenticity."}
