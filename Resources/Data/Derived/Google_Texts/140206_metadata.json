We don\u2019t care if you\u2019re in this group or that group. We don\u2019t care. We just want you to get involved and play with us.\u201d\n\nThe come-one, come-all message of ambassadors like Bullock is a major reason rugby is one of the fastest-growing sports in the United States. From 2008-13, youth participation rose 81 percent in the United States, according to a study commissioned by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association \u2014 and it has continued to grow.\n\nLast year, 61,500-seat Soldier Field in Chicago was sold out for a rugby match between the United States Eagles national team and the world-famous New Zealand All Blacks. The sport will take on an even bigger spotlight when it debuts at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 and NBC will regularly televise rugby nationally in the buildup to Brazil.\n\nLocally, the University of Denver will host the 2015 College 7s national championships May 23-24 \u2014 an elite tournament arriving in the Mile High City at a time when youth rugby participation in the city is at an all-time high.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s an exciting time for the sport.\n\nBullock sees numerous reasons for rugby\u2019s growth in popularity in America. For one, it has shed much of the stigma that had long labeled it as a dangerous game. As more data surfaces about head trauma suffered by football players, families are searching for other options.\n\n\u201cSome people still think rugby is more dangerous than football, when in reality it\u2019s just the opposite,\u201d said Bullock, who pointed out that Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll employs rugby technique when teaching his players tackling form. \u201cIt\u2019s because we don\u2019t wear pads. Your head is up. You see the people around you.\u201d\n\nBut rugby\u2019s growing reputation as a safer alternative to football isn\u2019t the only reason the sport is rising in Colorado, which features perhaps the country\u2019s finest rugby facilities in Glendale\u2019s Infinity Park. Since the Raptors club was founded a decade ago, its leaders have left no stone unturned in introducing the sport to young people in every community.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when Geraldolyn Horton-Harris, a community organizer in the Five Points neighborhood, told Bullock she was looking for ways to engage kids in Mestizo-Curtis Park, the rugby guru was quick to put a team together.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018If you need a program, I\u2019ve got your program,\u2019 \u201d said Bullock, who met Horton-Harris through a leadership program at the University of Denver.\n\nSo a half-dozen members of the Raptors organization, including youth programs manager Jenna Anderson, made their way to Denver\u2019s oldest park on a Saturday morning this month to teach a group of roughly a dozen neighborhood kids a game many of them had never seen.\n\n\u201cThe thing I love about what we do when we come to events like these is seeing kids who don\u2019t know anything about our sport, and then they leave with something new and different,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt gets their brains going in a different direction, getting them interested in something else.\u201d\n\nAnderson, who has worked with the Raptors since 2008, said the after-school program the organization runs has seen more participants this year than ever before, and she and Bullock are constantly searching for new places to bring their sport \u2014 no matter how many people are there to play.\n\n\u201cWe provide them all the same things that kids need \u2014 inclusion, teamwork, discipline,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWe play for each other, All of the things that kids need, rugby provides. Rugby is fairly unique. It doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money to do. You don\u2019t need a lot of equipment. You just need a ball and some shorts and a shirt. It\u2019s an easy thing for people to get involved in.\u201d\n\nAs the Raptors worked with the kids that Saturday morning, Bullock\u2019s eye was drawn to Toryian Tubbs, a middle-schooler who was darting around the field, tossing the oblong ball with precision.\n\n\u201cHe could be a good rugby player,\u201d Bullock said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s fast, he moves well. He\u2019s got a knack for it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also got a pulse.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Glendale Raptors bring rugby to Denver\u2019s children", "title": "Glendale Raptors bring rugby to Denver\u2019s children", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/10/glendale-raptors-bring-rugby-to-denvers-children/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510__BN20150511_B1_BNSP11RUGBYp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150510__BN20150511_B1_BNSP11RUGBYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T21:54:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T01:01:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5b36\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe accept everybody,\u201d said Bullock, who founded the Glendale Raptors rugby club in 2005.\n\u201cWe play for each other, All of the things that kids need, rugby provides.\n\u201cWe provide them all the same things that kids need \u2014 inclusion, teamwork, discipline,\u201d Bullock said.\nYou don\u2019t need a lot of equipment.\nLocally, the University of Denver will host the 2015 College 7s national championships May 23-24 \u2014 an elite tournament arriving in the Mile High City at a time when youth rugby participation in the city is at an all-time high."}
