The City of New Bern is in need of a new finance director.

Mayor Dana Outlaw says as of Friday, December 5th, Finance Director Keith Fiaschetti no longer works for the city.

No reason for Fiaschetti's exit was given Saturday.

Outlaw says the matter will probably be discussed at Tuesday night's Board of Aldermen meeting in a closed session.

Outlaw says Fiaschetti has done a great job for New Bern in the last 3 years. "He came in when we had some tough financial times and we appreciate what he's done. The financial well-being of the city at this time versus when he came in speaks for itself," Outlaw said.
