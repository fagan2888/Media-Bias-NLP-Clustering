Stephen Chow\u2019s Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons grossed $106 million in its first seven days.\n\nIt is is shaping up to be a big year for Hollywood in China, the world\u2019s second largest market.\n\nLIST The Hollywood Reporter Reveals Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films\n\nThe stunning performance of Transformers: Age of Extinction could potentially have implications for the import of Hollywood movies, as the government is keen to foster local talent, and there could be tougher controls on foreign movies coming into the Chinese market.\n\nBut for the time being, the glory is all about Michael Bay\u2019s cyborg smash-\u2018em-up, which have dominated the legions of new screens in China's shopping malls -- currently more than 25,000.\n\nTickets were sold out at cinemas across Beijing \u2013 when The Hollywood Reporter visited a local multiplex at lunchtime on Sunday, we told the first available seat would be at 10 p.m.\n\nPHOTOS 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Thelma & Louise' Stars Reunite\n\nJust last week, Zhang Hongsen, a director at the powerful regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT), said 2014 was \u201cthe year when the battle between Hollywood and China really begins.\u201d\n\nHe called on theater chain owners not to give Age of Extinction 100 percent of the screening time and encouraged them to help boost locally made products.\n\nHowever, theater chain owners seem happier to reap the rewards of the growing popularity of the Transformers franchise.\n\nMany multiplexes showed Age of Extinction in all their theaters. Based on a trawl of Beijing venues, The Break-up Guru was seemingly the only Chinese movie available -- with just a couple of showings at that.\n\nThe movie\u2019s success was boosted by the decision to weave strong Chinese elements into Transformers: Age of Extinction, such as using popular actress Li Bingbing and heartthrob Han Geng, and choosing young actors in the fourth installment via a Chinese reality TV show.\n\nIt also premiered in Hong Kong and closed the Shanghai International Film Festival, and also opened day-and-date with the rest of the world.\n\nPHOTOS 10 Highest Grossing Movie Sequels\n\nIt also used many highly visible sites in Beijing and Hong Kong. In the run-up to the movie\u2019s launch, Chinese partner Pangu, whose dragon-shaped hotel features in the film, threatened to pull out of a partnership over their profile in the film, but a last-minute deal was reached with Paramount.\n\nMaleficent and Edge of Tomorrow also appear to have been sidelined in many theaters.\n\nIMAX reported a three-day weekend gross of almost $10 million in China, which more that doubles its previous three-day high of $4.55 million for Peter Jackson\u2019s The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug at $4.55 million, and beats a previous weekend record of $6.9 million for a six-day weekend for Iron Man 3.\n\nThe 150 screens, which beats by three screens a previous record opening number, delivered a per-screen of $65,000, compared to the previous best, Titanic 3D\u2019s $51,000.\n\nOf the top 20 locations in China, 19 had IMAX screens.\n\nThe Film Bureau chief\u2019s comments also prompted an online outcry, with people saying censorship by the Film Bureau was one of the reasons why local industry was suffering, not Hollywood imports.\n\nPHOTOS Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films\n\n\u201cIf you people from SAPPRFT didn\u2019t trap filmmakers\u2019 feet, stuff filmmakers\u2019 mouths and ears, and use a cloth to cover the filmmakers\u2019 sky, Chinese films would not be like this today,\u201d wrote one.\n\nYiran Shiwo wrote: \u201cAs long as SAPPRFT exists, Chinese films will not free themselves.\u201d\n\nOthers were ironic \u2013 \u201cIf there were no limitations on Chinese films, Chinese audiences\u2019 intelligence will be hurt,\u201d wrote Shou\u2019er Xiansheng.\n\nShuixin Suoyu said: \u201cI support the promotion of domestic films, but the domestic films must be good enough.\u201d\n\nChinese movies came out just ahead of foreign films in box office last year, largely boosted by Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons, which grossed $215 million.\n\nDonnie Yen's The Monkey King and reality TV adaptation Dad, Where Are We Going? did well during the Lunar New Year holiday in February, but since then Hollywood tentpoles have put in strong performances --Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, has taken $116.49 million so far, and many believe Transformers 4: Age of Extinction is on track to best Avatar\u2019s $221.9 million all-time China box office record.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Clifford Coonan", "description": "The Michael Bay film's $93 million haul makes it the biggest ever three-day opening in the country.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "The Michael Bay film's $93 million haul makes it the biggest ever three-day opening in the country.", "title": "What 'Transformers 4's Huge China Opening Means for Hollywood", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/what-transformers-4s-huge-china-715668", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "//cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/2014/05/transformers.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 730}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-29 22:24:12", "sailthru.title": "What 'Transformers 4's Huge China Opening Means for Hollywood", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Movies", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Michael Bay,Peter Jackson,Iron Man 3,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 3D (2013),Titanic 3D: Ghosts of the Abyss,Transformers: Age of Extinction,Asia,Box Office,International", "sailthru.description": "The Michael Bay film's $93 million haul makes it the biggest ever three-day opening in the country.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03e9\"", "article_summary": "Yiran Shiwo wrote: \u201cAs long as SAPPRFT exists, Chinese films will not free themselves.\u201dOthers were ironic \u2013 \u201cIf there were no limitations on Chinese films, Chinese audiences\u2019 intelligence will be hurt,\u201d wrote Shou\u2019er Xiansheng.\nIt is is shaping up to be a big year for Hollywood in China, the world\u2019s second largest market.\nThe $93 million haul in just three days makes it the biggest ever three-day opening in China.\nThe Michael Bay film's $93 million haul makes it the biggest ever three-day opening in the country.\nHowever, theater chain owners seem happier to reap the rewards of the growing popularity of the Transformers franchise."}
