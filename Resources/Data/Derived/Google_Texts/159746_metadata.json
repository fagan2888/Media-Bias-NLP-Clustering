Since one of the stated goals of Obamacare was to reduce preventable medical mistakes \u2013 which cost billions annually \u2013 the new report is good news. With the current error rate still well below the federal government\u2019s goal, however, a great deal of work remains to be done.\n\nThe study found that roughly 1.3 million fewer incidents of harm occurred in the last four years than would have occurred before the ACA.\n\nThough health officials touted that number as a major victory, it\u2019s still well below HHS\u2019s earlier stated goal of reducing the hospital-acquired conditions rate by 40 percent over three years.\n\nThe report also said the causes of decline may not be fully attributed to the ACA. HHS first began an effort to reduce hospital mistakes in 2005, when it launched the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. The department continued to roll out patient safety rules until 2008, two years before Obamacare became law.\n\nRelated: Doctors Leave Primary Care as More Patients Need Them\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell called the new study \u201cwelcome news for patients and their families.\u201d She told a health care conference in Baltimore on Tuesday that \u201cthese data represent significant progress in improving the quality of care that patients receive while spending our health care dollars more wisely. HHS will work with partners across the country to continue to build on this progress.\u201d\n\nHHS combed through 18,000 to 33,000 medical records each of the last four years and analyzed the error rate for each year. It found that over that time period, the reduced error rate saved the health care system an estimated $12 billion and about 50,000 lives that would have otherwise been lost to preventable errors.\n\nSome 40 percent of the total error reductions had to do with medication \u2013 meaning fewer people suffered from drug overdoses or fewer patients were prescribed the wrong medication. About 20 percent of the error reductions involved fewer patients getting bedsores while about 14 percent of the reductions were from fewer patients getting infections from catheters.\n\n\u201cA 17 percent reduction in hospital-acquired conditions is a big deal, but it\u2019s only a start,\u201d Burwell said Tuesday morning. \u201cNo American should ever lose his or her life, or spend the holidays in the hospital because of a condition that could have been prevented.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Catch Costly Errors on Your Medical Bills\n\nThe report credited some of the error reductions to provisions in the health care law that reward or penalize hospitals for the quality of care. One in particular refunds hospitals less money through Medicare if they have high readmission rates.\n\nAnother is the Partnership for Patients initiative, which started in 2010 between HHS and hospitals to reduce preventable conditions.\n\n\u201cThis has been a bold project with significant success,\u201d a senior hospital industry representative told reporters on a press call Tuesday.\n\nBurwell said the Obama administration still has plenty of work to do to continue encouraging hospitals to prioritize preventative care.\n\n\u201cWe waited until patients got sick in order to treat them, rather than focusing on prevention. Our payment models incentivized volume rather than value,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that as Americans, we will receive better care \u2013 and spend our dollars more wisely \u2013 if we find better ways to deliver care.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Preventable medical errors and hospital-acquired infections have long plagued the U.S.", "title": "Drop in Hospital Error Rate Saves $12B Since 2010", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/02/Drop-Hospital-Error-Rate-Saves-12B-2010", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Hospital_Error_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/02/Drop-Hospital-Error-Rate-Saves-12B-2010", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Hospital_Error_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Preventable medical errors and hospital-acquired infections have long plagued the U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With the current error rate still well below the federal government\u2019s goal, however, a great deal of work remains to be done.\nAbout 20 percent of the error reductions involved fewer patients getting bedsores while about 14 percent of the reductions were from fewer patients getting infections from catheters.\nSince one of the stated goals of Obamacare was to reduce preventable medical mistakes \u2013 which cost billions annually \u2013 the new report is good news.\nPreventable medical errors and hospital-acquired infections have long plagued the U.S. health care system and led to thousands of unnecessary deaths, serious injuries and billions in health care costs each year.\nSome 40 percent of the total error reductions had to do with medication \u2013 meaning fewer people suffered from drug overdoses or fewer patients were prescribed the wrong medication."}
