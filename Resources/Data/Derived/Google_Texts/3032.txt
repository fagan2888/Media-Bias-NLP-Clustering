Monday is expected to be the busiest delivery day for holiday packages, cards and letters.

The Postal Service anticipates that more than 30 million packages will be delivered on the peak delivery day alone.

Postal officials expect to deliver nationwide about 15.5 billion cards, letters, flats, and packages during the 2015 holiday season.

They also project about 600 million packages will be delivered between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve, which is an increase of 10.5 percent over last year’s volume.
