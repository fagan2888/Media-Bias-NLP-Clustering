NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NFP, a leading insurance broker and consultant that provides employee benefits, property & casualty, retirement, and individual insurance and wealth management solutions, today announced the expansion of NFP Marketplace, a private exchange designed to manage costs for employers and offer competitive benefit options for employees. Through new partnerships with GetInsured and HealthPlanOne, NFP Marketplace enables employers to offer affordable health insurance options to retirees, COBRA-eligible individuals and employees who do not qualify for sponsored plans.

Ed O’Malley, president of NFP's Corporate Client Group, commented, “GetInsured and HealthPlanOne are valuable additions to NFP Marketplace and bring innovative health insurance solutions to our clients who are continuing to explore new approaches to administering benefits programs. Private exchanges, which include sophisticated decision-support tools and defined contribution capabilities, have introduced new ways for employers to make affordable health coverage a reality for their entire workforce. As a result, our clients can more effectively recruit and retain talent in a competitive marketplace, while at the same time reducing costs.”

GetInsured, a cloud-based health insurance exchange platform, helps employers offer non-sponsored employees, early retirees and COBRA-eligible individuals access to a broad array of Affordable Care Act-compliant health insurance options, including access to federally-subsidized coverage. Employees can shop for and enroll in a health insurance plan in a variety of ways, including a user-friendly web or mobile shopping experience, or working with a licensed broker through the GetInsured customer care center, which serves customers in more than 200 languages. GetInsured is licensed nationally, fully certified to enroll employees in subsidized health insurance and appointed with more than 200 insurance carriers.

“NFP is a trusted partner to employers who want innovative solutions for complex benefits needs,” said Chini Krishnan, GetInsured co-founder and CEO. “We are proud that GetInsured is the NFP Marketplace platform of choice for individual coverage. It is incredibly relevant, as more employers are realizing the benefits of private exchange offerings for their part-time, early retiree and COBRA-eligible populations.”

HealthPlanOne (HPO), a national provider of private healthcare exchange services for retirees, will enable employers to offer their retirees either a defined contribution or access-only program, which can provide significant cost savings to both employers and retirees. HPO’s web-based, proprietary platform lets retirees view plan details, compare individual plans, utilize decision support tools and maintain a link to their former employer, while their licensed advisors provide knowledgeable and objective guidance and enrollment support. HPO represents over 80 insurance carriers and offers more than 7,500 plans nationally.

“We are delighted to be the preferred provider of healthcare exchange solutions to retirees in the NFP Marketplace,” said Bill Stapleton, CEO of HealthPlanOne. “Our exchange solution has been shown to expand choice and reduce cost and, together with NFP, we will provide their clients a comprehensive benefits solution that meets the needs of both current and former employees.”
