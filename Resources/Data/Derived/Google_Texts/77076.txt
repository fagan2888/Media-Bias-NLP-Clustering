DE BEQUE, Colo. (AP) — Interstate 70 is closed in both directions through De Beque Canyon east of Grand Junction.

KKCO-TV reports that the discovery of a suspicious item prompted Tuesday’s closure of the 10-mile stretch of I-70 along the Colorado River.

Dan Chermok of the Colorado State Patrol says the item was found on a bridge.
