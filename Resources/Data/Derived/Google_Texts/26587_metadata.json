Ad Policy\n\nThe bizarre circus that the GOP presidential primary has become is not a freak occurrence. Regardless of the eventual nominee, the rise of Donald Trump (\u201cI would bomb the shit out of [ISIS]\u201d), the ascent of Ted Cruz (\u201cTo God be the glory\u201d), and the endurance of Ben Carson (\u201cPutin is a one-horse country: oil and energy\u201d) do not contradict the general trajectory of the party, but rather confirm it. This fact-free, bigoted populism awash in money and drowning in misanthropy may illustrate the GOP at its most brazen, but it\u2019s hardly in any way aberrant.\n\nIn this regard, Trump is the party\u2019s most obvious emissary. His blatant xenophobia emerges from the GOP\u2019s half-century of race-baiting since Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy was first conceived. The initial idea was to woo Southern whites, who were angry about the advances of the civil-rights movement, with coded racial messaging that wouldn\u2019t alienate the party\u2019s Northern supporters. \u201cYou have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\u201d Nixon once explained to his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. \u201cThe key is to devise a system that recognizes that while not appearing to.\u201d This method was once very effective. Ronald Reagan launched his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi, not far from where three civil-rights activists had been murdered in 1964, by talking about states\u2019 rights. George H.W. Bush had his infamous Willie Horton ad in 1988, while Bush Jr. spoke at Bob Jones University in 2000, where interracial dating was banned at the time.\n\nBut with white people heading toward minority status and becoming a lower percentage of the voting public every cycle, the message necessarily gets cruder\u2014particularly with the presence of a black president. In the 2012 GOP primaries, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum told a crowd in Iowa that \u201cI don\u2019t want to make black people\u2019s lives better by giving them somebody else\u2019s money,\u201d while Newt Gingrich branded Obama the \u201cfood-stamp president.\u201d\n\nSo by the time Trump came on the scene, the party had done away with the dog whistle in favor of a police whistle\u2014no codes necessary. The Mexicans are sending us \u201crapists\u201d; the Chinese are \u201ccheating\u201d; America needs \u201ca total and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims coming into the country.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bush_rubio-trump_debate_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Gary Younge", "description": "Three years ago, as the Republican-led House of Representatives engineered a brief government shutdown, Congressman Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) explained the strategy underpinning the protest. \u201cWe have to get something out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what that even is.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Three years ago, as the Republican-led House of Representatives engineered a brief government shutdown, Congressman Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) explained the strategy underpinning the protest. \u201cWe have to get something out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what that even is.", "title": "It\u2019s the Racism, Stupid", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/its-the-racism-stupid/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bush_rubio-trump_debate_img1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2016-02-10T19:01:27+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three years ago, as the Republican-led House of Representatives engineered a brief government shutdown, Congressman Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) explained the strategy underpinning the protest. \u201cWe have to get something out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what that even is.", "title": "It\u2019s the Racism, Stupid", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/its-the-racism-stupid/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bush_rubio-trump_debate_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bush_rubio-trump_debate_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 907}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "February 11th, 2016", "sailthru.title": "It\u2019s the Racism, Stupid", "sailthru.tags": "Election 2016,Racism and Discrimination,Republicans,Beneath the Radar,Column", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 202414, "keywords": "beneath the radar, column, election 2016, racism and discrimination, republicans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "republicans", "published_time": "2016-02-11T09:09:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-10T19:01:27+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/smccroskey/"}, "sailthru.description": "The GOP establishment can\u2019t freak out about Trump now.
