DES MOINES, Iowa — Polk County homeowners could soon expect their property taxes to go down, but there’s a debate over whether those cuts should be even bigger.

Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines wants to drop its tax levy.

The board of trustees held a public meeting on the budget Wednesday afternoon. The hospital is considering a 15-percent reduction in the tax levy, which could generate $10 million in tax relief to Polk County property owners.

Broadlawns had a budget surplus in 2015. Hospital leaders say it was due to cost-saving initiatives, the addition of specialty services and the Affordable Care Act, which provided care for previously uninsured people.

Some groups say Broadlawns can afford to lower its tax rate even more — the story tonight on Channel 13 News at 10.
