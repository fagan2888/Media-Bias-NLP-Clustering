The soft, welcoming blues of painted shutters in the south of France are made from indigo. The golds of Provence are from ochre. And from the American Southwest, those dazzling reds and fuchsias are made from cochineal, a parasite that lives on cactus.\n\n\u201cI try to stay open and think of colors when I look around me. I collect lots of different things, like Osage orange, pecans and walnuts, onions and pomegranates,\u201d said Maura Ambrose, who makes hand-stitched quilts of naturally dyed fabrics in her Folk Fibers studio in Austin, Texas.\n\nOnion skins (yellows), walnut hulls (browns), avocado peels and pits (pale pink), marigolds (yellows), sumac leaves (brown), mushrooms and lichens (with their rainbow of possibilities), cochineal (fuchsias and reds) and madder root (oranges and reds) are traditional favorites. Coffee grounds and old tea bags also are great for shades of tan and brown. Nettle yields greenish tints.\n\nEven succulent plants can be used to make dyes, said Duerr, who recommended aloe for pinks and yellows and jade plants for purples and black. Wild fennel, abundant in northern California, yields fluorescent yellows \u201cso bright they hurt your eyes\u201d if harvested while in bloom.\n\nLike cooking, the results depend as much on the chef as on the recipe, Duerr said. \u201cThe beauty of it is that you can take something from the back of your closet and give it new life using just the waste from your dinner.\u201d\n\nAny plants containing sufficient tannins can be used to achieve colorfast fabrics without additives, known as mordants. But there are also natural mordants, such as rhubarb, sumac, pomegranate rinds, lemon juice or vinegar.\n\nWith a mordant, sumac fruit yields red pigment and indigo yields its classic shades of blue. Cream of tartar can be used to brighten colors, and salt to intensify them.\n\nTo be safe, designate a pot specifically for dyeing projects, and use gloves to protect your skin. If you\u2019re dyeing in the kitchen, work in the sink and avoid surfaces used for preparing foods. Although natural-dyeing books from the \u201960s, \u201970s and \u201980s are plentiful, experts warn that books from that period often recommend using toxic substances like chrome, copper or even lead as mordants.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to be inhaling that kind of thing,\u201d said Duerr.\n\nWrapping the natural materials in muslin or putting them in some old pantyhose makes projects neater and easier.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Home craft: Natural dyes offer a burst of spring color", "title": "Home craft: Natural dyes offer a burst of spring color", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/21/home-craft-natural-dyes-offer-a-burst-of-spring-color/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140321__20140322_C3_fe22ahdyesp1.jpg", "height": 410}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140321__20140322_C3_fe22ahdyesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-21T17:14:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:06:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda169\"", "article_summary": "The Rocky Mountain guild is even working on creating a dye-plant garden at the Denver Botanic Gardens at Chatfield.\nWild fennel, abundant in northern California, yields fluorescent yellows \u201cso bright they hurt your eyes\u201d if harvested while in bloom.\nWrapping the natural materials in muslin or putting them in some old pantyhose makes projects neater and easier.\nEven succulent plants can be used to make dyes, said Duerr, who recommended aloe for pinks and yellows and jade plants for purples and black.\nAt a time when focus is returning to locally produced goods, these sustainable natural colors reflect their surroundings."}
