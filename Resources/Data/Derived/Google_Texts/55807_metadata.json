Gov: Critz Announces 54 Endorsements\n\nWritten by Nick Field, Contributing Writer\n\nAnything Brad Koplinski can do, Mark Critz can do better. At least that\u2019s what the Critz campaign would like you to believe.\n\nEarlier today the Koplinski campaign trumpeted the backing of 20 Democratic state officials, now just hours later the Critz campaign unveiled 54 officials and organizations that are endorsing his candidacy. Both men are fighting to become the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor.\n\n\u201cI am honored to be endorsed by a diverse group of leaders and activists,\u201d Critz said. \u201cThey know that I have a record of fighting to strengthen the middle class and working to create jobs that pay a livable wage.\u201d\n\nIt should also be noted that these campaign releases are likely targeted towards the annual PA Society weekend which begins tonight. The PA Society events provide a prime venue for leading politicos to gossip about and chew over the latest political news. For instance, this morning Attorney General Kane made headlines by expressing her interest in a 2016 race for the Senate against incumbent Pat Toomey.\n\nThe full list of endorsements is included below:\n\nCampaign Co-Chairs\n\nJoyce Murtha, Honorary Co-Chair\n\nEd Cernic, Sr., Honorary Co-Chair\n\nLabor\n\nUnited Steelworkers\n\nPlumbers & Pipefitters Local 354\n\nAmalgamated Transit Union Local 1279\n\nJohnstown Building and Construction Trades Council\n\nBeaver County\n\nMike Sisk, Chair, Beaver County Democratic Committee\n\nJoe Spanik, Beaver County Commissioner\n\nTony Amadio, Beaver County Commissioner\n\nCarol Fiorucci, Beaver County Register of Wills\n\nNancy Werme, Beaver County Prothonotary\n\nJudy Enslen, Beaver County Clerk of Courts\n\nGeorge Quay, City of Beaver Falls Mayor\n\nCambria County\n\nHeath Long, Chair, Cambria County Democratic Committee\n\nTom Chernisky, Cambria County Commissioner\n\nHelen Whiteford, Cambria County Jury Commissioner\n\nSue Kuhar, Cambria County Clerk of Courts\n\nPatty Sharbaugh, Register of Wills\n\nDebbie Martella, Prothonotary\n\nBob Kolar, Sheriff\n\nLisa Kozorosky, Treasurer\n\nKelli Callihan, Disctrict Attorney\n\nEd Cernic, Jr., Cambria County Controller\n\nFayette County\n\nFayette County Constable Association\n\nFred Lebder, Chair, Fayette County Demorcatic Committee\n\nVince Zapatosky, Fayette County Commissioner\n\nAl Ambrosini, Fayette County Commissioner\n\nGary Brownfield, Fayette County Sheriff\n\nRobert Yatsko, Supervisor, Menallen Twp.\n\nA.J.
