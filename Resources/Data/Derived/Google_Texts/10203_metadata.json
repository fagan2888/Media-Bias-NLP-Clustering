It turned out that the predictable little \u201cbumps and glitches\u201d were instead wholesale information-system failures.\n\nFederal officials and their contractors worked furiously around the clock, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress that the government\u2019s website would be working properly by November 30. We\u2019ll see.\n\nMeanwhile, HHS unveiled the first month\u2019s results, and they were poor. While the states administer seventeen exchanges, the federal government is fully or partially responsible for thirty-six state and territorial exchanges. Though more than 27 million Americans visited federal and state websites, only 1.5 million completed applications to enroll in a health plan.\n\nWorse, only 106,185 persons have thus far taken a health plan. Of these, only 26,391 enrolled through the federal exchanges, while 79,391 enrolled in the state exchanges. Altogether, that\u2019s only 1.5 percent of the total projected enrollment of 7 million expected to be enrolled by March 31, 2014.\n\nObamacare\u2019s website problems are technical, and can be solved by technically competent staff. It will be fixed, sooner or later.\n\nBut fixing Obamacare\u2019s website problems will not bring back the cancelled insurance policies of millions of Americans, soften the rate shock of those enrolling in the exchanges, or reverse the perverse economic incentives hardwired into the body of the law.\n\nAdministrative improvements, better software, or more competent staff will not roll back the law\u2019s health care cost increases, or reduce taxpayers\u2019 burdens, or restore long-established but broken relationships between doctors and patients.\n\nAlready disturbing patterns are starting to emerge.\n\nAs noted, preliminary HHS numbers show that only 106,185 persons have enrolled in \u201cprivate\u201d health insurance in the exchanges, but we do not know the composition of this population. They could be predominantly younger and healthier, or they could be older and sicker, desperate for coverage or subsidies.\n\nIf it turns out to be an older and sicker group of enrollees, then the health care costs and premium increases in the exchanges are going to be even higher than the rate shockers already published. A twenty-six-year-old California female, for example, might be faced with a $170 monthly premium for a \u201cbronze\u201d plan, plus a fat $4,500 deductible.\n\nIf younger and healthier men and women in California and elsewhere find that hard to stomach, they\u2019ll just go bare and pay the paltry penalty (maybe). After all, they can rely upon the hospital emergency room for nonurgent care or sign up for coverage when they get sick. This invites an unstable health-insurance market, higher rates of uninsurance, and even more wasteful cost shifting.\n\nTeam Obama is all about central planning on the grand scale. They can only hope that their carefully calibrated combination of \u201ccarrots\u201d (insurance subsidies) and \u201csticks\u201d (mandate tax penalties) can lure enough younger and healthy enrollees into their exchanges to cross-subsidize older and sicker persons.\n\nThey really need a robust pool of younger and healthier applicants. If not, the administration could preside over insurance-market mayhem. Ugly stuff.\n\nPreliminary HHS numbers also show that while little more than one hundred thousand persons have signed up for private coverage in the exchange, almost four hundred thousand are eligible for welfare\u2014mostly in the form of Medicaid, a poorly performing government program.\n\nLast May, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that thirteen million more Americans would be added to the Medicaid rolls over the next ten years, at an additional cost to the taxpayers of $709 billion. (CBO, it should be noted, has a long history of underestimating the true cost of government health programs.)\n\nAn imbalance between paying and non-paying enrollees through the Obamacare exchanges is not a good thing. It\u2019s the sort of imbalance that could explode CBO cost projections, deepen middle-class anger and incite a taxpayers\u2019 revolt.\n\nWhile Obamacare\u2019s insurance rules have already resulted in more than 5 million Americans having their individual insurance policies cancelled, a potentially much larger disruption looms over the horizon: the mass disruption of employer-based group insurance.\n\nWith the onset of Obamacare, businesses and even public institutions are responding by cutting employees hours and relying more on part-time employment. Much depends on how firms will respond to the employer mandate and its delay, as well as the complex set of incentives created by generous exchange premium subsidies for low-income workers and new mandates and taxes on group insurance.\n\nPages", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "What happens when \"30 to 50 percent of all employers\" drop health coverage?", "dcterms.title": "The Real Cost of Obamacare", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"url": "http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-real-cost-obamacare-9444", "type": "article", "site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "What happens when \"30 to 50 percent of all employers\" drop health coverage?", "title": "The Real Cost of Obamacare"}, "dcterms.subject": "Economics, Political Economy, United States,", "abstract": "What happens when \"30 to 50 percent of all employers\" drop health coverage?", "description": "What happens when \"30 to 50 percent of all employers\" drop health coverage?", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "Robert E.
