Hurt of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nSo if the real Overstock.com is where you want to shop, understand this: \u201cIf the name is longer, or uses any additional words, or letters, if it has any words other than \u2018overstock\u2019 before the dot-com, it\u2019s not our website,\u201d says company official Jonathan Johnson.\n\n\n\nHowever, understand that other legitimate websites may have \u201coverstock\u201d somewhere in a web address \u2013 usually at the very end (after the .com) to indicate a specific page where overstocked items are being sold. Expect something like this: www.samplecompany.com/overstocks.\n\nOverstock name games aside, here are your safest bets for any online shopping:\n\nType the site\u2019s address yourself, rather than clicking on links found through keyword searches. Be especially wary of links offered by strangers in emails or on social media sites.\n\nPay with a credit card, which offers you more protections than a debit card.\n\nNever provide your credit card or other sensitive information on any page whose address doesn\u2019t begin with \u201chttps://\u201d rather than \u201chttp://\u201d. But even with an \u201chttps://\u201d, avoid using public Wi-Fi hotspots for online shopping or other financial transactions.\n\nFor a quick (but not foolproof) legitimacy check, visit the website\u2019s \u201cContact Us\u201d page to see if there\u2019s a phone number and a physical address. (Avoid any site that is missing both; be wary if it\u2019s missing either).
