Drev made the podium for the first time in her career.\n\nFederica Brignone of Italy finished third, 0.99 seconds off the pace.\n\nOverall World Cup leader Lara Gut of Switzerland finished a distant 19th after a mistake on the second run, while her closest rival, Lindsey Vonn, crashed out in the second run.\n\nEva-Maria Brem of Austria finished fourth to dislodge Gut from the top of the giant slalom standings. Brem now has 392 points and is 30 points clear of Gut. Gut increased her overall lead over Vonn, however, and is now 50 points clear at 750.\n\nRebensburg won the giant slalom gold medal at the 2010 Olympics and took the bronze four years later. She also won the silver at last year\u2019s world championships.\n\nBut she had to wait three years for her 11th World Cup win, after a Super-G triumph in January 2012 in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy.\n\n\u201cYou have to believe in yourself and let your skis run,\u201d Rebensburg said.\n\nShe was the first to start the first run as falling snow and poor visibility slowed later starters. Drev was ninth out of the gate and clipped the German by 0.04 seconds.\n\nThe second run began in sunshine, but the snow returned by the time the top runners started in reverse order and all leaders had to deal with poor visibility.\n\nVonn, winner of one giant slalom race this season, appeared to catch a rut with her right ski and crashed out close to the finish line.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn crashes out in second run of giant slalom", "title": "Lindsey Vonn crashes out in second run of giant slalom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/lindsey-vonn-crashes-out-in-second-run-of-giant-slalom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__BN20160118_BB2_BNSP18SKIWCWOMENp2.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__BN20160118_BB2_BNSP18SKIWCWOMENp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T22:24:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T01:23:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Overall World Cup leader Lara Gut of Switzerland finished a distant 19th after a mistake on the second run, while her closest rival, Lindsey Vonn, crashed out in the second run.\nVonn, winner of one giant slalom race this season, appeared to catch a rut with her right ski and crashed out close to the finish line.\nRebensburg won the giant slalom gold medal at the 2010 Olympics and took the bronze four years later.\nEva-Maria Brem of Austria finished fourth to dislodge Gut from the top of the giant slalom standings.\nFLACHAU, Austria \u2014 Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany mastered tough conditions to come from behind and win her first World Cup giant slalom race in more than three years Sunday."}
