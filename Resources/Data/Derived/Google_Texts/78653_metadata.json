Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and the temporary restraining order.\n\nUndercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress have raised allegations that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates are selling aborted fetal body parts to researchers for profit. Spokespersons for the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider have denied participation in illegal transactions and have claimed that they are only reimbursed for the cost of a donation.\n\nSome of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 undercover footage was recorded at the annual meeting of the National Abortion Federation.\n\nThe National Abortion Federation was granted a temporary restraining order barring David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, and the Center for Medical Progress from releasing the footage of its meeting.\n\n\u201cThe National Abortion Federation has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep David Daleiden\u2019s footage of its annual meetings out of the hands of law enforcement and the Congress,\u201d Peter Breen, Thomas More Society special counsel, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the District Court has today decided to allow Congress to seek the unedited footage of the wrongdoing uncovered by David\u2019s investigation. We will continue to urge the District Court to allow David to release more undercover videos featuring the footage from these annual meetings to the public, so that the American people can make their own assessment of the practices of Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Federation.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Vicki Saporta, the president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, denied that her organization had tried to prevent the Center for Medical Progress \u201cfrom providing compelled responses to lawful subpoenas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that all of the footage CMP stole from our meetings is responsive to this subpoena, and we urge the Committee to require Daleiden to also turn over all documents and emails relevant to the conspiracy and fraud he committed against NAF and our members,\u201d Saporta said.\n\nElizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said, \u201cIn yet another delaying tactic, the National Abortion Federation asked Judge Orrick to interfere with the House\u2019s subpoena of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 videos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judge is right to allow David Daleiden to comply with this subpoena, which is fully within the House Oversight Committee\u2019s investigative authority. The National Abortion Federation is clearly worried about what other horrendous details may come out in these unreleased videos.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Center for Medical Progress may comply with a congressional subpoena to provide lawmakers with its unedited footage.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Center for Medical Progress may comply with a congressional subpoena to provide lawmakers with its unedited footage.", "title": "Judge Allows Center for Medical Progress to Comply With Congressional Subpoena", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151007_CMPRuling_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-08T00:00:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1jdqP1O"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Center for Medical Progress may comply with a congressional subpoena to provide lawmakers with its unedited footage.", "title": "Judge Allows Center for Medical Progress to Comply With Congressional Subpoena", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151007_CMPRuling_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-10-07T13:33:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-08T00:00:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood videos, Center for Medical Progress, National Abortion Federation, prolife, pro-life, Planned Parenthood hearing"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ce8\"", "article_summary": "Some of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 undercover footage was recorded at the annual meeting of the National Abortion Federation.\nThe National Abortion Federation was granted a temporary restraining order barring David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, and the Center for Medical Progress from releasing the footage of its meeting.\nThe National Abortion Federation is clearly worried about what other horrendous details may come out in these unreleased videos.\u201d\nUndercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress have raised allegations that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates are selling aborted fetal body parts to researchers for profit.\nA federal judge has ruled that the Center for Medical Progress may comply with a congressional subpoena to provide lawmakers with its unedited footage despite a temporary restraining order granted to the National Abortion Federation barring the group from releasing the footage."}
