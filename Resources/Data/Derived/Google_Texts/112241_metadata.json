I particularly liked the end:\n\nKristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent \u201cprogressive\u201d radicalism unthinkable now?\n\nBecause it\u2019s just obvious that San Francisco progressives are the political heirs of fascism, right?\n\nYou do wonder why the WSJ published this screed. Do billionaires have the right to get their views aired, regardless? Did the Journal think that it was doing a public service by letting the rest of us see the loose screws in this guy\u2019s head? Or \u2014 what I suspect, to be frank \u2014 did the relevant editors actually think he was making a useful point?\n\nAnyway, thinking about this sort of thing makes me realize that there\u2019s a danger, especially for progressives, of confusing the proposition that Obama\u2019s billionaire haters are stark raving mad \u2014 which is true \u2014 with the proposition that Obama has done nothing that hurts the plutocrats\u2019 interests, which is false. Actually, Obama has been tougher on the one percent than most progressives give him credit for.\n\nStart with taxes. The Bush tax cuts haven\u2019t gone completely away, but at the very high end they have been pretty much reversed; plus there are additional high-end taxes associated with Obamacare. The result is that taxes on wealthy Americans have basically been rolled back to pre-Reagan levels:\n\nPhoto\n\nMeanwhile, financial reform looks as if it will have significantly more teeth than expected.\n\nSo the one percent does have reason to be upset. No, Obama isn\u2019t Hitler; but he is turning out to be a little bit of FDR, after all.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140126113813, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 26, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Obama and the One Percent ( 20140126 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Not Hitler, but a touch of FDR.", "title": "Obama and the One Percent", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/obama-and-the-one-percent/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Not Hitler, but a touch of FDR.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 26, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1390754293, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-01-26T16:38:13-05:00"}, "utime": 20140126163813, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140126, "pdate": 20140126, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Not Hitler, but a touch of FDR.", "title": "Obama and the One Percent", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/obama-and-the-one-percent/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/obama-and-the-one-percent/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Obama and the One Percent", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c47\"", "article_summary": "Actually, Obama has been tougher on the one percent than most progressives give him credit for.\nNo, Obama isn\u2019t Hitler; but he is turning out to be a little bit of FDR, after all.\nOr \u2014 what I suspect, to be frank \u2014 did the relevant editors actually think he was making a useful point?\nI particularly liked the end:Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent \u201cprogressive\u201d radicalism unthinkable now?\nAnyway, thinking about this sort of thing makes me realize that there\u2019s a danger, especially for progressives, of confusing the proposition that Obama\u2019s billionaire haters are stark raving mad \u2014 which is true \u2014 with the proposition that Obama has done nothing that hurts the plutocrats\u2019 interests, which is false."}
