Gary Peters (D-MI)\n\nAccording to an anti-choice group in Michigan, one of the state\u2019s lawmakers has staked out his position on reproductive rights purely because he wants to make sure that abortion remains \u201caccessible and cheap for his daughters.\u201d\n\nThe statement comes in response to a controversial new abortion restriction in Michigan that took effect earlier this month. Women who buy health insurance in Obamacare\u2019s private market are now barred from purchasing a plan that includes abortion coverage, even if they want to end a pregnancy that resulted from rape or incest. They\u2019ll be required to purchase a separate rider if they want an abortion procedure to be covered, which has led reproductive rights supporters to decry the measure as a \u201crape insurance\u201d law.\n\nU.S. Rep. Gary Peters (D), who is currently running for a Senate seat, is one of the lawmakers who has repeatedly spoken out against the measure. \u201cAs the father of two daughters, I struggle with how to tell them that the state we love and where our family has been for generations is now unfairly discriminating against them and makes health care less affordable,\u201d Peters said in a statement last week.\n\nRight to Life of Michigan \u2014 the right-wing group that was instrumental in getting the new law approved last winter \u2014 has seized on that sentiment. In a new website highlighting Peters\u2019 abortion policy positions, the group cites Peters\u2019 recent comments to assert that the pro-choice lawmaker \u201cwants to make sure abortion is accessible and cheap for his daughters.\u201d\n\nThanks to the persistent stigma that remains attached to abortion care, the comments appear to imply something negative about the women who may need access to abortion, and attempt to link Peters with that implication.\n\nThe congressman has condemned the comments as \u201cinflammatory partisan politics,\u201d saying that using his daughters to make a point is a step too far. Peters is calling on his Republican opponent, Terri Lynn Land, to distance herself from Right to Life of Michigan. Land has been endorsed by the anti-choice group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be the dad of two amazing teenage daughters, and I\u2019m also proud of my record fighting to protect critical access to women\u2019s health care,\u201d Peters said in a statement provided to ThinkProgress. \u201cWomen\u2019s health care is a serious and significant point of contrast in the U.S. Senate race, and it is outrageous that Land\u2019s allies would cheapen this debate and distort my support for women\u2019s health care\u2026 To include my teenage daughters in their attack crosses the line.\u201d\n\nA Right to Life spokesperson told Michigan Live that Peters has brought up his daughters on several occasions while discussing reproductive rights, which makes the point relevant to the current race.\n\nMichigan\u2019s new insurance restriction has captured a lot of media attention, but it\u2019s hardly the only state with this type of policy on the books. Cutting off access to insurance coverage for abortion is an very popular method of restricting reproductive rights, and Obamacare\u2019s state-level exchanges have introduced a new avenue for abortion opponents to accomplish this goal. Just as Peters points out, this policy is about making abortion care too expensive for many women to afford.\n\nSince abortion is simply part of women\u2019s reproductive health care, complicated laws that segregate it from the rest of the services covered by insurance are often too difficult to implement in practice. For instance, even though Michigan\u2019s new law operates under the assumption that women can buy separate insurance riders for abortion, it\u2019s not clear that these types of riders are even being offered on the individual market.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
