Give me a break,\u201d Mr. Trumpsaid at the State Fairgrounds in Oklahoma City, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cYou know Russia wants to get ISIS right,\u201d Mr. Trump said, using the acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. \u201cWe want to get ISIS. Russia\u2019s in Syria. Maybe we should let them do it? Let them do it. What the hell are we, crazy?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks come as Russia is increasing its military forces in Syria, a move which has alarmed U.S. military and administration officials.\n\nThe U.S. is concerned that Russia will lend its own troops to help embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad take on the Islamic State terrorist group. While the U.S. is also leading a coalition force against the terror group, it also opposes Mr. Assad\u2019s regime and has urged him to step down from office.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments on foreign policy have been heavily scrutinized and may be a stumbling block on his road to the White House.\n\nHe was widely criticized for a radio interview with Hugh Hewiit earlier this month, in which he appeared to confuse the names of top terrorist leaders and mixed up the Kurds with the Iranian Quds force \u2014 an elite military unit under the command of the Ayatollah and linked to terrorist activities in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Trump, an opponent of the nuclear deal with Iran, also said Friday that the U.S. had only empowered Iran by invading Iraq.\n\n\u201cI said don\u2019t go into Iraq. I\u2019m the most militant person here, the most militaristic person you\u2019ll ever meet. I believe in the military strongly but I didn\u2019t want to see us invade Iraq,\u201d he said, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cWe spend $2 trillion, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place that I love by the way\u2026 we got nothing. We can\u2019t even go over there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/09/trump_accuses_rivals_of_wanting_to_start_world_war_ii_over_syria.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Trump accuses rivals of wanting 'to start World War III' over Syria"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know Russia wants to get ISIS right,\u201d Mr. Trump said, using the acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.\nMr. Trump, an opponent of the nuclear deal with Iran, also said Friday that the U.S. had only empowered Iran by invading Iraq.\nThe U.S. is concerned that Russia will lend its own troops to help embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad take on the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\u201cThey want to start World War III over Syria.\nWashington Times:GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump shared more of his views on foreign policy Friday, telling an audience in Oklahoma his 2016 rivals want to \u201cstart World War III over Syria\u201d and suggesting the U.S. let Russia take up the fight against the Islamic State in the region."}
