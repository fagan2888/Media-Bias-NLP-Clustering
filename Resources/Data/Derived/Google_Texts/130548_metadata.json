America is losing; our politicians are stupid; if elected, I\u2019ll kick ass.\n\nNow, some are calling on Trump to be more \u201cspecific.\u201d What are his multi-point plans for dealing with the issues, they want to know.\n\nThe call for \u201cspecifics\u201d plays into Trump\u2019s hands because its a \u201cchallenge\u201d he can easily meet. You don\u2019t even have to be a billionaire to hire people to write a 4-point plan for taking on ISIS or a 6-point plan for replacing Obamacare; nor do you even have to be ahead in the polls to receive help for free.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that Trump plans to unveil a series of position papers in early September. The Washington Post reports that the immigration paper was crafted with the help of Sen. Jeff Sessions.\n\nSome who are favorably disposed to Trump\u2019s candidacy seem to understand that casting Trump\u2019s problem as a lack of specifics sets the bar low and thus helps his candidacy. Sean Hannity asked Trump for specifics during a recent interview. He didn\u2019t get many, but Trump\u2019s statement that he favors medical savings accounts impressed Hannity. Medical savings accounts \u2014 why didn\u2019t anyone else think of that.\n\nThe problem with Trump\u2019s candidacy from a conservative standpoint is not a lack of specifics; it\u2019s a lack of sincerity. To put it more precisely, the problem is a lack of any reason to believe that Trump\u2019s conservative positions (with or without specifics) are sincerely held.\n\nIn the not-so-distant past, Trump has supported abortion, various forms of gun control, universal healthcare, and a huge tax increase on the wealthy. Until 2009, he was a registered Democrat.\n\nTrump\u2019s answer to criticism over his consistently liberal record is to point out that Ronald Reagan originally was a New Deal-style liberal. Reagan was indeed a liberal in the 1930s and early to mid-40s. But he didn\u2019t run for office until 1966 and didn\u2019t seek the presidency until 1976.\n\nIn the interim, Reagan spent two decades traveling the country and appearing on the radio to make the philosophical case for conservatism. Let Trump make that case \u2014 for conservatism, not for himself \u2014 for a decade and then govern a state conservatively, as Reagan did for two terms. At that point, we\u2019ll know he\u2019s a real conservative, not one who mouths conservative talking points (with or without specifics) because, given Hillary Clinton\u2019s presumed standing among Democrats, he has concluded that doing so represents his only path to a presidential nomination.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump\u2019s \u201cspecifics\u201d won\u2019t be worth the paper they are printed on.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Donald Trump has moved to the top of the GOP presidential field by painting in broad strokes.
