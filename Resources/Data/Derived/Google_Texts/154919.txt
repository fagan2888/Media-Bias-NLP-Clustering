Illinois deserves major props for becoming the first state to ban microbeads, the tiny plastic exfoliants found in face washes, and even toothpaste, that are causing serious pollution problems. The legislation has all the makings of a great environmental battle, pitting the big soap industry against the well-being of the Great Lakes.

Except that’s not quite what happened. In what the Associated Press is calling an “odd twist,” it seems the industry went quietly. Instead of complaining that the switch will be time-consuming and expensive, as they have in the past, representatives conceded to the deal early on. And companies like Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate, Unilever and L’Oreal are all planning to reformulate their products with more environmentally friendly exfoliants.

Mark Biel, of the Chemical Industry Council of Illinois, which represents the manufacturers, swears the collaboration was a one-time thing. “I just concluded that maybe this was one of those issues where it would be smart to try to work something out,” he said. It’s unclear whether other states’ attempts at passing bans will go as smoothly: Some are pushing for a quicker phase-out, and manufacturers say in those cases it may be impossible to reformulate their products in time.
