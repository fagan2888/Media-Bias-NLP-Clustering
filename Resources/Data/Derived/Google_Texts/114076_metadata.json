That meant few spins and more amplitude, thrilling the packed crowd at the bottom of the pipe.\n\n\u201cI realized throughout the contest that they were rewarding big for amplitude and I was like, \u2018All right, I got to step up my game a little bit,\u2019 \u201d said 20-year-old Alex Ferreira, an Aspen native who claimed his second consecutive X Games bronze.\n\nCanadian Simon d\u2019Artois increased his amplitude as he moved down the pipe on his final run, reaching 21 feet, 6 inches on his final hit \u2014 a double-corked 1080 \u2014 to steal the lead from Ferreira with 93 points.\n\nFrenchman Kevin Rolland, competing in his eighth X Games, went next, boosting a 23-foot air on one of three double-corked hits to score 92.33 points and silver.\n\nFerreira held his skis for seconds as he spun a pair of lofty, dynamic double corks, including a spectacular alley-oop double flat spin 900 to score 91.66 points for bronze.\n\nThe medalists all agreed the contest was the best ever for X, powered by technical trickery, height and style. Many of the competitors threw first-ever tricks in the pipe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what put me above these guys,\u201d d\u2019Artois said. \u201cBoth of them had runs that were beyond anything I\u2019d ever seen. I\u2019m just thankful that mine was able to come out on top.\u201d\n\nSochi Olympic gold medalist David Wise slipped to fourth place in the final round, missing his shot at a golden four-peat in the X Games pipe. Skating hard into his first hit and spinning the contest\u2019s only double-cork 1440 and backing up with two more of the double-flip tricks, Wise fought hard for the win.\n\n\u201cObviously I could have gone for an easier run, but I\u2019m out here to push the limits and do something new,\u201d Wise said. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the game. I feed off that progression and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOf the 10 Olympic contests staged at the X Games \u2014 men\u2019s and women\u2019s ski and snowboard halfpipe and slopestyle and men\u2019s and women\u2019s boardercross \u2014 only freeskier Maddie Bowman was able to repeat her golden performance from Sochi with X Games gold in the halfpipe.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Simon d\u2019Artois unseats David Wise to win X Games ski halfpipe gold", "title": "Simon d\u2019Artois unseats David Wise to win X Games ski halfpipe gold", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/25/simon-dartois-unseats-david-wise-to-win-x-games-ski-halfpipe-gold/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__simonp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__simonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T16:32:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:46:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18fb\"", "article_summary": "ASPEN \u2014 The skiers flipped and spun in every direction on a warm Sunday afternoon, soaring more than 20 feet above the halfpipe in one of the most exciting Winter X Games contests in years.\nFrenchman Kevin Rolland, competing in his eighth X Games, went next, boosting a 23-foot air on one of three double-corked hits to score 92.33 points and silver.\nLeapfrogging leaders lasted mere minutes in golden position as skier after skier stepped up their game in the best-of-three contest.\nI\u2019m just thankful that mine was able to come out on top.\u201dSochi Olympic gold medalist David Wise slipped to fourth place in the final round, missing his shot at a golden four-peat in the X Games pipe.\nI feed off that progression and enjoy it.\u201dOf the 10 Olympic contests staged at the X Games \u2014 men\u2019s and women\u2019s ski and snowboard halfpipe and slopestyle and men\u2019s and women\u2019s boardercross \u2014 only freeskier Maddie Bowman was able to repeat her golden performance from Sochi with X Games gold in the halfpipe."}
