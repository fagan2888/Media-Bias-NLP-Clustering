The new clinic, with its central location in Milford, will be able to help Delawareans in lower Kent County more readily receive primary and pediatric medical care, CEO Brian Olson said.\n\nThe new clinic also will work to integrate mental health care into the patient's overall care, to diagnose faster and more efficiently. Olson estimates more than 1,440 people may benefit from the services.\n\nIt's expected to be open in 120 days.\n\n\"So we have a lot to accomplish in a short period of time,\" Olson said.\n\nLa Red will care for people with private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Obamacare plans and no insurance.\n\nThe new clinic's grant funding was provided through the Affordable Care Act. Nationally, approximately $101 million was awarded to 164 new health center sites in 33 states to potentially increase access to health care services for nearly 650,000 patients.\n\n\"Health centers are keystones of the communities they serve in Delaware,\" HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. \"Today's awards will enable more individuals and families in Delaware to have access to the affordable, quality health care that health centers provide. That includes the preventive and primary care services that will keep them healthy.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1ACv3Sv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Sussex County-based La Red Health Center was awarded a $483,333 grant by the feds to fund a new clinic in Milford.", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "The Sussex County-based La Red Health Center was awarded a $483,333 grant by the feds to fund a new clinic in Milford.", "title": "La Red Health Center to open Milford health clinic", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/05/05/la-red-open-milford-health-clinic/26930747/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Sussex County-based La Red Health Center was awarded a $483,333 grant by the feds to fund a new clinic in Milford.", "title": "La Red Health Center to open Milford health clinic", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a147e13c4ef89460a68acf34b36cfdc9638c772e/c=314-0-1686-1372&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/05/Wilmington/B9317235179Z.1_20150505192845_000_GNTAMUK15.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd46\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: CHUCK SNYDER/SPECIAL TO THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy PhotoBolstered by a newly awarded federal grant, La Red Health Center will be opening an additional medical clinic in Milford.\n\"Today's awards will enable more individuals and families in Delaware to have access to the affordable, quality health care that health centers provide.\nThe Sussex County-based health center was awarded a $483,333 grant Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nBuy Photo La Red Health Center\u2019s Seaford medical clinic is shown.\nNationally, approximately $101 million was awarded to 164 new health center sites in 33 states to potentially increase access to health care services for nearly 650,000 patients."}
