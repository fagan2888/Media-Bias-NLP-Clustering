Can\u2019t blame him.\n\nThe thought of clinching the NFC North at Lambeau Field certainly is an enticing one. McCarthy\u2019s Packers can do so with a victory over the Lions, whose recent history in Green Bay is, well, dismal.\n\nDetroit has not won there since 1991. And the Pack is 7-0 at Lambeau this season.\n\nBoth teams are 11-4 and the winner still could get home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs if Seattle falls to St. Louis. The focus is not on anywhere but the Green Bay tundra for McCarthy and his players.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that Detroit and our records are the same and we\u2019re playing for the title,\u201d the Packers coach says. \u201cYeah, I think this is exactly how you\u2019d want it. I know it\u2019s how I\u2019d prefer it.\u201d\n\nEspecially at home, where the Packers (No. 3, AP Pro32) are 7 1-2 point favorites over the Lions (No. 6, AP Pro32).\n\nSpread should be higher.\n\nPACKERS, 31-20\n\nNo. 23 Cleveland (plus 9) at No. 12 (tie) Baltimore\n\nRavens put themselves in desperate spot with recent losses.\n\nBEST BET: RAVENS, 26-10\n\nNo. 18 (tie) Carolina (plus 3 1-2) at No. 20 Atlanta\n\nPanthers sneak off with second straight division crown \u2014 at 7-8-1.\n\nUPSET SPECIAL: PANTHERS, 20-19\n\nNo. 9 Cincinnati (plus 3) at No. 7 Pittsburgh\n\nBoth are headed to playoffs. Steelers get AFC North title.\n\nSTEELERS, 27-23\n\nNo. 11 San Diego (plus 2 1-2) at No. 14 Kansas City\n\nChargers can claim final AFC wild-card slot, just as they did in 2013.\n\nCHARGERS, 21-20\n\nNo. 22 St. Louis (plus 13) at No. 1 Seattle\n\nHome-field advantage to the Seahawks. NFC Beware!\n\nSEAHAWKS, 23-13\n\nNo. 8 Arizona (plus 5 1-2) at No. 18 (tie) San Francisco", "article_metadata": {"description": "Packers, Steelers, Panthers choices to win their divisions", "title": "Packers, Steelers, Panthers choices to win their divisions", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Packers, Steelers, Panthers choices to win their divisions", "title": "Packers, Steelers, Panthers choices to win their divisions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/24/packers_steelers_panthers_choices_to_win_their_divisions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/packers-buccaneers-football.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Packers, Steelers, Panthers choices to win their divisions", "title": "Packers, Steelers, Panthers choices to win their divisions", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/packers-buccaneers-football.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Barry Wilner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc19\"", "article_summary": "18 (tie) San Francisco\nMcCarthy\u2019s Packers can do so with a victory over the Lions, whose recent history in Green Bay is, well, dismal.\n12 (tie) BaltimoreRavens put themselves in desperate spot with recent losses.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that Detroit and our records are the same and we\u2019re playing for the title,\u201d the Packers coach says.\nBoth teams are 11-4 and the winner still could get home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs if Seattle falls to St. Louis."}
