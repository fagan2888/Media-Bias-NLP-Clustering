Foley Skilled Nursing Facility with a directive: Negotiate a contract with Suffolk County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll notify them later this week or early next week,\u201d confirmed Richard T. Margulis, chief executive officer and president of BMHMC. \u201cOur expectation in negotiating a contract is that it contains the major pieces for us, that the county and town resolve their differences for the county to deliver the building zoned and the impact fees paid for the uses we\u2019ve stated publicly. My board has authorized me to negotiate a contract. That\u2019s the latest news from the board.\u201d\n\nBMHMC, who offered $15 million for the Yaphank property last September, currently has a letter of intent with the county. The county agreed to a due diligence period with the hospital, which has taken place since October.\n\n\u201cThe time period that has elapsed was to allow us to do a thorough due diligence,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cWe had to look at the building from physical plant aspects, its architecture, engineering and potential tenants. And there needed to be an economic financial plan. Also, we had to consider the expansion of some hospital services that could go into it, like our hemodialysis services.\u201d\n\nThe $15 million purchase price remained. \u201cWe haven\u2019t altered it,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the dominos in the hoped-for sale was the move of the hemodialysis and transitional care unit on West Main Street in Patchogue to the Foley building. Margulis had commented in the past it would include back office functions and possible cardiac care rehab, including Medicaid assisted living or a nursing home, picking up the spirit of its former use.\n\nWhen asked if FEDCAP, which acquired Easter Seals New York last May, was in the running regarding partner services in providing adult day care services for Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia patients, as well as medical rehabilitation, Margulis said he couldn\u2019t be specific.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get into tenants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have firm leases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vision is for us to have space to expand outpatient services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel that in order to better serve our community, whether through a new healthcare regime or the Affordable Care Act, we need access to assisted living or residential beds.\u201d Margulis said the hospital also saw an opportunity to provide in-patient services for substance abuse in helping to address the county\u2019s major drug problems.\n\n\u201cFirst services we would offer, we would look to finalize our relationship with the two service lines and would look to expedite hemodialysis, potential assisted living and substance abuse to get it online as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nMargulis was asked about offering veterans services. Last fall, BMHMC announced the hospital\u2019s registration with the Veterans CHOICE program, allowing for local veterans to receive care. At that press conference, Margulis announced intentions to designate space within the new Knapp Cardiac Care Center for creative therapy and community outreach programs geared to veterans and their families.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with a group to offer a veterans group at the hospital, that\u2019s separate from Foley,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we won\u2019t have it there, but right now we\u2019re looking at starting it this year for needy people to have services in their community.\u201d\n\nMargulis said he couldn\u2019t affix a number to renovation costs. \u201cFrom what I understand, the building has minor roof issues and there were some mechanical issues with the heating and ventilation system, but it seems to be in pretty good shape,\u201d said Legis. Rob Calarco (D-Patchogue).\n\nLegis. Kate Browning (WF-Shirley) commented in an earlier interview that infrastructure grants could help with renovation modifications.\n\nIt costs the county $700,000 a year in maintenance costs, said an official.\n\nThe John J. Foley Skilled Nursing Facility at 14 Glover Drive in Yaphank is 181,749 square feet with five floors. It was closed on June 30, 2013.\n\nBrowning said she had received calls from former employees hoping for jobs there.\n\n\u201cIf they waive the impact fee, everyone benefits and Brookhaven Hospital can take it over,\u201d she said of the $580,000 figure. \u201cI\u2019ve had some people call, former employees, asking when it will open.\u201d\n\nReaction to the proposed contract negotiations was positive.\n\n\u201cIf it happens, it provides us with the opportunity to move forward with one of our goals, a hotel, but also additional retail space if the hotel doesn\u2019t make it, and it moves an active Main Street further west,\u201d said Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri. \u201cAlso there are 170 additional parking spaces behind Brookhaven Hospital\u2019s dialysis building on Lake Street.\u201d\n\nPontieri said he had a handful of inquiries for a hotel in the village \u201cand that spot has been the primary one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to hear that the hospital is going forward with the process of getting the contract together and I understand they would want the county to deliver the building with the zoning in place,\u201d Calarco said. \u201cWe can figure it out.\u201d\n\nBrowning, who fought against Foley\u2019s closing, said she would push for the contracts.\n\n\u201cSomeone needs to get moving and make this a reality, because I can\u2019t think of a better organization taking it over,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community hospital and they know what the residents need.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy the hospital is going forward,\u201d said Brookhaven Town Attorney Annette Eaderesto. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent news. The supervisor has been a big proponent of taking over the building.\u201d\n\nEaderesto said efforts had been made to facilitate the hospital\u2019s move. \u201cWe met with the two attorneys for the hospital a couple of weeks ago that included [County Attorney] Dennis Brown, [Deputy County Executive] Jon Schneider, [Deputy Chief of Staff] Lisa Keys, myself and [Planning Commissioner] Tullio Bertoli. It was a very friendly meeting and we provided the county with all the issues of what it would take to occupy the building. We would do a stipulation of settlement on the existing use of the building, we would do a change of use without a hearing, and we\u2019d rezone the property on the town board\u2019s own motion.\u201d\n\nSchneider said in an email, \u201cWe are eager to move this process forward in order to improve healthcare options for Brookhaven residents and provide relief to Suffolk County taxpayers. We look forward to working out a fair contract.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center\u2019s board of directors wants to negotiate a contract for the purchase of the former John J.
