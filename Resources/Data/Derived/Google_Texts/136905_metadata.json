It's evident that even the president believes there are problem with the employer mandate,\" she said, citing multiple delays in the policy.\n\n\n\nDonnelly said he supported ObamaCare but added, \u201cthat doesn't mean that the law can't be strengthened.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"A full-time work week is 40 hours,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe bill is one of several measures \u2014 including legislation on the Keystone XL pipeline \u2014 that Republican leaders hope to pass in the early weeks of the new Congress.\n\n\n\nThe workweek measure has also been at the center of a heavy lobbying campaign from business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the National Restaurant Association.\n\nSeveral representatives from industry groups were on hand for Wednesday's press conference, which featured testimony from a restaurant industry leader and a community college official.\n\n\u2014 Elise Viebeck contributed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
