The Supreme Court said liability is triggered by the fiduciary's ongoing role monitoring the plan's performance, so the six-year clock routinely resets.\n\nIn 2010, a federal judge in California said the claims against Edison were barred. The 9th Circuit agreed in a 2013 decision that the high court last year overturned.\n\nThe case is Tibble v. Edison International, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-56406.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Will Dunham)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/13/Edison-International-wins-dismissal-US-lawsuit-over-401k-plan", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - A U.S.", "title": "Edison International wins dismissal of U.S. lawsuit over 401(k) plan"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/13/Edison-International-wins-dismissal-US-lawsuit-over-401k-plan", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - A U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The case concerned exactly when the role of a retirement plan administrator in monitoring a plan's performance can trigger liability under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA.\nCircuit Court of Appeals, No.\n(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by Edison International employees in California who accused the utility of favoring higher-cost mutual funds over lower-cost ones in its retirement plan, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling backing the workers.\nThe Supreme Court said liability is triggered by the fiduciary's ongoing role monitoring the plan's performance, so the six-year clock routinely resets.\nThe 9th Circuit agreed in a 2013 decision that the high court last year overturned."}
