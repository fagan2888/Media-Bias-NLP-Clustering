SAN FRANCISCO — Tyler Chatwood was activated for his season debut Sunday, just in time for the Rockies to shift their concern to pitcher Brett Anderson.

Chatwood faces the Giants, his left hamstring deemed ready after a successful rehab start. Charlie Culberson was optioned to Triple-A to create room. There could be another roster move in the next few days based on Anderson’s bruised left finger. It was worse Sunday than expected, swelling significantly over night. He will undergo an X-Ray and possibly an MRI. He injured the finger on a groundball out in Saturday’s game, exiting in the top of the fourth inning.

“It felt like a firecracker went off in my batting glove,” said Anderson, wondering aloud about his injury curse the past few seasons. The video included here of Anderson is from Saturday. The finger has not improved.

If Anderson goes on the disabled list — a distinct possibility — Franklin Morales is the logical replacement in the rotation. He was moved to the bullpen to keep Jordan Lyles start, but Morales has not pitched in relief yet.
