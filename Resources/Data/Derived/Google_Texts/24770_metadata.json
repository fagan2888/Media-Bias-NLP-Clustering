Benson, a Catholic priest, was a popular writer in his time, and his dark vision of a world destroyed by secular humanism still resonates with a small but loyal following. In a 2013 homily, Pope Francis spoke of Lord of the World \u201calmost as though it were a prophecy.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Benson prophesy? A catalogue of early 20th century right-wing fears. In Lord of the World, religion has been subsumed to a kind of hyper-rational communism, the professions have been nationalized, and euthanasia and suicide are legal. Worst of all, Esperanto is the official language of Britain.\n\nJulian Felsenburgh, a man of great charisma and linguistic ability, then rises from U.S. senator (from Vermont, no less) to President of the World. He encourages pogroms against Catholics and destroys Rome, which everybody goes along with, even though the guy might as well have a giant blinking Anti-Christ on his forehead.\n\nThe President of the World tracks down the last Pope and his retinue, who have taken refuge in Nazareth, and bombs them too. And that\u2019s the end of everything. \u201cThen this world passed, and the glory of it,\u201d writes Benson.\n\nWith his flying boats and underground cities, Benson does create a fun kind of steampunk future, avant le lettre. But the novel\u2019s infelicities are numerous. Benson is overfond of turgid passages wherein some character sits around thinking and praying, or praying and thinking, or merely thinking. Not to mention his fatuous conflation of Marxism, Freemasonry and Judaism. (Felsenburgh? Really?)\n\nBenson was part of the great tradition of intellectual Britons who converted to Catholicism\u2014the tradition that gave us John Henry Newman, Gerard Manley Hopkins, G.K. Chesterton, Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene. If only the quality of Benson\u2019s writing were in the same vein. After reading this book it\u2019s difficult to understand why he was famous in his day.\n\nThat is, until one considers the extraordinary success of the Left Behind series. You may recall that these novels (and videos and YA series and films) are a dramatization of the evangelical version of the apocalypse\u2014that is, the Rapture, when all the true believers are snatched up to heaven and the rest of us are left here to battle it out. Left Behind is smug, violent, sexist, racist and anti-Semitic. Reading it, one sometimes imagines a drooling white supremacist scribbling in crayon. Nevertheless this triumphalist version of the End Times has great appeal for millions of Americans, perhaps because it panders to their own prejudices, egos and sense of rightness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pontiff is the first non-European to lead the church in 1,200 years.
