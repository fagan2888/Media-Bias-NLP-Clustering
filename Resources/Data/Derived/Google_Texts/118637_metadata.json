The cost is half for each child who was not covered.\n\n\n\nAside from health insurance, there are other potential pitfalls: virtual money, like Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\"It would be much more like a house than wages,\" said Fierro.\n\n\n\nSo if you received it in 2014--you'll likely be hit with a tax.\n\n\n\nAnd something to beware of throughout 2015: withdrawing from your IRA isn't as simple as it once was .\n\n\n\nYou used to be able to withdraw money for 60 days without penalty.\n\n\n\nBut in 2015 you can only do that once a year before being penalized and hit with a 10 percent early withdrawal tax.\n\nNeed my help?
