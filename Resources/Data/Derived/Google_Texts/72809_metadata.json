Although his insistence on being an Independent induced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats\u2014and few thought he would last long without bowing to one political party\u2014Mr. Sanders has defied naysayers with a career spanning nearly three decades.\n\nDubbed the \u2018amendment king,\u2019 Mr. Sanders passed more amendments than any other member of Congress during his 16 years in the House of Representatives\u2014despite Republicans holding a majority between 1994 and 2006. He kicked off his political career with an amendment to start a National Program of Cancer registries, which is now maintained by all 50 states. In 2001, he successfully passed an amendment to the general appropriations bill which banned the importation of goods made with child labor, and passed an amendment to increase funding by $100 million for community health centers.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, Sanders took on powerful adversaries, including Lockheed Martin, Westinghouse, the Export-Import Bank, and the Bush Administration,\u201d wrote Matt Taibbi in a 2005 Rolling Stone article. \u201cAnd by using the basic tools of democracy-floor votes on clearly posed questions, with the aid of painstakingly built coalitions of allies from both sides of the aisle-he, a lone Independent, beat them all.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Sanders was elected to the Senate in 2006, he continued pushing amendments through legislation, including securing $10 million in additional funds for the Army National Guard, providing financial assistance for childcare to people in the armed forces, exposing corruption in the military industrial complex, support in treating autism in the military\u2019s healthcare system and ensuring bailout funds weren\u2019t used to displace American workers.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Sanders stood in opposition to many egregious legislative blunders now retrospectively viewed as mistakes. He voted against the disastrous trade deal, NAFTA, in 1993 and was one of the earliest voices of opposition against the TPP\u2014which doubles down on many of NAFTA\u2019s fallacies. Mr. Sanders was one of 67 legislators who voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 and against the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d military policy in 1993. He also voted against the Iraq War and the Patriot Act, and helped secure billions in funding under the Affordable Care Act for community health services.\n\nDespite Mr. Sanders\u2019 self-avowed Democratic Socialism\u2014putting him on the far left of most in the Democratic Party\u2014he has earned the respect of his colleagues in Congress. Amid years of partisan politics where each party has obstructed the other from passing meaningful legislation, Mr. Sanders worked across the aisle with his conservative counterparts\u2014with Ron Paul to audit the Federal Reserve for the first time in 2010 and with John McCain in 2014 to co-write the bill to reform the Veterans Affairs Administration. When his colleagues voted in line with the rest of their party, Mr. Bernie Sanders wasn\u2019t afraid to stray from the pack for his principles. He has earned a reputation for honesty and integrity unmatched in comparison to his opponent in the Democratic primaries. Hillary Clinton, well-known for flip flopping for political expediency, courts corporations and wealthy donors.\n\nDespite Mr. Sanders\u2019 impeccable record in Congress, The New York Times recently ran an article initially praising his ability to work with both parties to get amendments added to legislation and passed\u2014but later edited it without any footnotes or addendums explaining why the changes were made. The Times has been infamously harsh on Mr. Sanders in favor of Ms. Clinton, possibly because the top shareholder of the company, billionaire Carlos Slim, is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. Despite the controversy, The New York Times has continued running overtly pro-Clinton articles. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders carries on, drawing record crowds in campaign rallies as his message grows through grassroots organization\u2014much like his progressive reforms have sprouted into large pieces of legislation.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Michael Sainato", "sailthru.author": "Michael Sainato", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-516874068.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-516874068.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 elections, Affordable Care Act, Bernie Sanders, Carlos Slim, Clinton Foundation, Congress, Defense of Marriage Act, democrats, Hillary Clinton, Iraq War, NAFTA, patriot act, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "2016 elections, affordable care act, bernie sanders, carlos slim, clinton foundation, congress, defense of marriage act, democrats, hillary clinton, iraq war, nafta, patriot act", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "http://i0.wp.com/nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-516874068.jpg?crop=578px%2C0px%2C2195px%2C1646px&resize=300%2C225&quality=80&strip&ssl=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "How Bernie Gets Things Done in Congress Without Being Bought Off", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "michael-sainato", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-516874068.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Unlike Clinton, who courts corporations, Sanders isn't afraid to stray from the pack for his principles.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_1537.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-03-24T15:00:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-24T15:00:19+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/michael-sainato"}, "sailthru.description": "Unlike Clinton, who courts corporations, Sanders isn't afraid to stray from the pack for his principles.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Unlike Clinton, who courts corporations, Sanders isn\u2019t afraid to stray from the pack for his principles.", "title": "How Bernie Gets Things Done in Congress Without Being Bought Off", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/03/how-bernie-gets-things-done-in-congress-without-being-bought-off/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-516874068.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 688}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Michael Sainato's writing has appeared in the Guardian, Miami Herald, Baltimore Sun, Huffington Post, LiveScience, Buffalo News, the Plain Dealer, the Hill, Gainesville Sun, Tallahassee Democrat, Knoxville News Sentinel, and the Troy Record.
