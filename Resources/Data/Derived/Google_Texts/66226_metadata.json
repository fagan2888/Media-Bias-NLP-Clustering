Wellmont pointed to reimbursement cuts associated with the Affordable Care Act, \u201cextremely\u201d low community use, and a lack of consistent physician coverage, as the primary reasons for its closure one year ago.\n\nLast week, News Channel 11\u2019s Kylie McGivern brought us inside the public hearing, nearly 500 people strong, in support of reopening Lee County\u2019s only hospital. Tonight, she reports why the hospital authority feels this time will be different.\n\nTom Clarke, President and CEO of Kissito Healthcare in Roanoke and Councilman of the Lee County Hospital Authority (created 6 months ago), says on top of the Lee County community voicing emotional testimony for a hospital, the numbers speak to a need that exists.\n\n\u201cThis is a community of 25,000 people. And if you look at communities around Tennessee and around Virginia, it\u2019s sort of unheard of not to have a hospital in that size,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nThe absence of Lee County\u2019s only hospital, many say, has left a gaping hole in the region\u2019s healthcare.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the closure of hospitals, they\u2019re usually very long processes, there\u2019s public awareness, maybe an urgent care center in its place. There\u2019s usually a combination for primary care, and that type of thing. Unfortunately, this was very sudden,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nNews of the closure last year sent shock waves throughout the sprawling community.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew, is when they released it to the public,\u201d Lee County Administrator Dane Poe said. \u201cWe knew there was gonna be some changes at the hospital. What they had identified to us as early as July was, the original plan was to shut down portions of the hospital, but not the entire facility. And they had pretty much indicated that they were NOT planning to shut the entire thing down,\u201d Poe said.\n\nWellmont told News Channel 11, \u201cThere were conversations with community leaders about our ability to maintain sufficient physician coverage and sustain hospital operations. It was uncertain at that time whether we were able to keep the hospital open.\u201d\n\nAfter the October 1, 2013 closure, Wellmont says it continued to operate primary, and some specialty practices, and expanded resources around 20 miles away at Lonesome Pine Hospital.\n\nNews Channel 11 asked Clarke in he and the Hospital Authority\u2019s research, if he felt there was any alternative that would have prevented closing Lee Regional Medical Center.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s always difficult to reopen something once its been closed. And I\u2019ve often thought, if only we could have all sat down at the table earlier. I think there were options. And the biggest option is, something that the federal governments actually created for these situations \u2013 the Critical Access Hospital (CAH).\u201d\n\nCAHs are largely rural, community hospitals that receive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare.\n\nAccording to the Lee County Hospital Authority, based on numbers from US Census 2013 estimates, in Tennessee,\n\n11 of the state\u2019s 15 CAHs serve populations smaller than Lee County. In Virginia, 6 out of the 7 CAHs serve populations smaller that Lee County.\n\nWellmont told News Channel 11:\n\n\u201cWe gave serious consideration to multiple options and explored several new models of care delivery, including the critical access hospital option, and closed as the absolute last resort. Because of the very complex issues the hospital faced, including physician coverage and financial issues resulting from low inpatient census, relatively low medicare and commercial use, and a high percentage of uninsured, we could not envision long-term sustainability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe population of a county is just one factor that contributes to sustainability. Other factors such as physician coverage, payor mix and community use must also be considered. It is accurate inpatient use of the hospital declined significantly over the last several years of the hospital\u2019s operation. Community use of the hospital will be essential to future success, and in large part, the community has to determine what services it will support to ensure the viability of those services. By looking at a full spectrum of care delivery and service options, the hospital authority will have a better chance at achieving a sustainable model for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident that we will be profitable out of the box, maybe the first year as we ramp up there will be small losses, but our forecast is for a profitable operation second year and beyond,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nClarke told News Channel 11 he and other members of the Hospital Authority sat down with Wellmont Wednesday, in a meeting he walked away feeling positive about. News Channel 11 was told there will be an announcement within the next couple months regarding the Authority\u2019s ability to purchase the hospital from Wellmont. Keep in mind, the Authority should also have word from the state on whether its Certificate of Need has been approved, by the end of the year. The Certificate of Need is for the opening of a 25-bed CAH.\n\nWith Wellmont poised to make a decision on whether or not to merge and with what health system by the end of the year, Clarke said after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the Hospital Authority is no longer concerned about how a potential merger could impact the sale of Lee Regional Medical Center. Clarke said, and Wellmont confirmed, that whatever agreement they come to will have to be accepted by any potential future merging health system.\n\nCopyright 2014 WJHL.
