I think outpatient facilities are going to grow the market, and also facilities are looking for more strategic plans as far as how to consolidate service lines\u2014amongst other things\u2014to make themselves more operationally efficient.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to outpatient facilities and ambulatory care, according to Lane, there are requests for planning efforts within health systems relative to addressing the outpatient model.\n\n\u201cThe questions become what do you do with your existing in-patient campuses, how do you make them the right size, and is there a need to repurpose them? Or, how do you consolidate service lines between campuses if you\u2019re a part of a larger system, so you do not have as many adjunct services?\u201d\n\nChanges in the way people seek medical care\u2014they want more outpatient surgeries and less in-patient care, and they want smaller locations that are closer to them.\n\nLane noted that consumers\u2014because of the way insurance is going with high-deductible insurance plans\u2014are starting to get more and more cost conscience.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see other business institutions enter the healthcare marketplace at different price points, like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, and Target,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s that entry-level price point for basic services, and then there are more robust services which stay within the larger health hospital systems\u2014your ambulatory surgery centers, diagnostic centers and general practitioners go in that category.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to start seeing more and more of ambiguity amongst different players in the marketplace. Clearly, there is a need to enter the healthcare market at different price points depending on the type of continuity healthcare providers are trying to address.\u201d\n\nAs for the mergers and acquisitions that have\u2014and are\u2014taking place in the healthcare market, Lane noted that are a few reasons as to why that is occurring.\n\n\u201cAs healthcare systems become larger, they are able to negotiate better rates for their insurance providers,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, demand for population health is on the rise\u2014which is when you try to take care of people when they are well opposed to when they are sick over a certain geographic area.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal is to reach those patients in a continuum of care, versus just once when they come to the hospital and are sick,\u201d Lane added.\n\nLane noted that the larger systems have more resources to do that and can absorb some of the overhead as a result.\n\n\u201cThey also have a better geographical footprint to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Chicago for instance, there used to be four or five hospitals, maybe within five miles of each other, all competing for the same patient population.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver time, those hospitals started to specialize on certain services because they all couldn\u2019t do everything, and they needed to be able to take care of more people, more efficiently.\u201d\n\nLane said he believes that there are some probable strategic reasons as to why some health systems are merging or allowing themselves to be acquired by the larger health systems.\n\n\u201cThere are still some arguments in outlying areas where you might want to stay independent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in some of the more rural communities, sometimes they find it difficult to find someone to come in and make them a part of their system because they do not have the volume, so they have to stay independent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet certainly a healthy, independent hospital that is getting a lot of attention from a larger system may do so because they want to keep increasing their reach,\u201d Lane said.\n\nLane\u2019s expectations for the market in 2015 is that activity will be slightly up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a dramatic surge in volume, but I will say that I\u2019ve been having conversations with industry figures around the city, and they all seem to have a lot of deals they are trying to put together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s reinforcing the point that most of the activity is going to be in the outpatient market,\u201d he said. \u201cHealthcare systems themselves, while they are doing things, seem to be more in the planning side of things now and smaller projects. So the big replacement hospitals with bed tower expansions\u2014while they may be happening, they seem to be more repurposing projects.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s healthcare market has certainly evolved from what it once was, say thirty years ago. So for those who are wondering where the market is going from here, Lane said he thinks there will be a greater focus on health and wellness and providing the right care that is convenient and accessible.\n\n\u201cThere will be more consolidation of systems, and I think those systems are going to be a little more streamlined as a result of what services are offered and where,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be a little more strategic about what services they put on what street corner so to speak.\u201d\n\nLane also noted that the market will start to see the continuation of getting the right types of facilities, with the right type of providers, at the right locations for the right demographics.\n\n\u201cWhat those will be remains to be unknown, \u201che said. \u201cBut getting the right facility at the right price point for the patient is going to be critical because they are going to have options now that more people are becoming insured due to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have choices now as to where they can go to receive care,\u201d Lane continued. \u201cAlso, if they are in high-deductible insurance plans, they are going to be very cognizant of what\u2019s the most affordable option to receive care. You\u2019re going to start seeing a bit more transparency in pricing.\u201d\n\nAs for the Affordable Care Act, and its effect on the market, some people are happy and there are some who aren\u2019t. Lane said he believes it\u2019s in a \u201cwait and see\u201d period.\n\n\u201cI know that depending on the institution that you are in, some institutions who have more of a challenge with their demographics are certainly thinking that it\u2019s going to help their business model. Those institutions that had a pretty good pair mixed to begin with aren\u2019t that excited about it, which is understandable as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how it all shakes out at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s always good for people to have options to get healthcare.\u201d\n\nTags | Affordable Care Act, Andy Lane, Commercial Real Estate, heathcare, RTKL\n\n\u00a9 2016 Real Estate Communications Group.
