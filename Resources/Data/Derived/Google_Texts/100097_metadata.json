The overflowing plot is located in Box Elder and is tended to by inmates from the Pennington County Jail.\n\nThe garden was such a success last year that plans were made to triple its size this season. More than 3,300 pounds of produce was harvested last year and donated to area charities like the Cornerstone Mission and Working Against Violence Inc.\n\nEarly season plants like snap peas have already been picked and replanted, and Correctional Officer/Garden supervisor Bill Atyeo estimates that over 1,800 pounds of produce has already been harvested, including a whopping 700 pounds this week alone. With bigger items like pumpkins, squash and corn still in the fields, he hopes to top 10,000 pounds before the growing season comes to an end.\n\nThe garden will be open to the public on Tuesday, Aug. 19.
