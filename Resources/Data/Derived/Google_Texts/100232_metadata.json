I realize now that I waded into this subject too hastily, as the issues at stake need to be teased out more carefully.\n\nPosner\u2019s argument, essentially, is that the executive branch has broad prosecutorial discretion to enforce, or to not enforce, federal laws as it sees fit. Since the federal government has long had a semi-official policy of allowing unauthorized immigrants to remain in the United States if they do not commit serious crimes, Posner maintains that President Obama\u2019s proposal would do little more than officially recognize this current practice. This strikes me as incorrect. Yet it is incorrect in a more interesting manner than I had originally suggested.\n\nTo make his case, Posner compares the president\u2019s decision to not enforce immigration laws for a given class of people to the fact that the IRS doesn\u2019t audit poor people, and that the DEA goes after criminal syndicates but not ordinary drug users. Federal agencies face resource constraints that make setting priorities when it comes to law enforcement a necessity. This setting of priorities falls under the rubric of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nBut the executive action that is being contemplated by the Obama administration is not primarily about husbanding enforcement resources to achieve the broader goal of enforcing existing U.S. immigration laws. There are two separate components to it. The first is deferred action, which is within the prosecutorial discretion of immigration officers. On this front, Posner has a case, albeit a weaker one than he seems to think. The second component involved granting a broad class of unauthorized immigrants work authorization. This second step is in many respects more significant than the first, and the question of whether or not to grant work authorization to those who have settled in the country unlawfully is, I would argue, at the heart of the immigration reform debate. This power to grant work authorization does not derive from an inherent authority of the executive branch. Rather, the power to grant work authorization was granted to the executive branch under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. It seems very unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president the authority to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants the right to full participation in the U.S. labor market, and some lawmakers have tried to address this question, but the statute says what the statute says. So while there is much to say about Posner\u2019s idiosyncratic reading of American constitutional history, his analysis sheds little light on the most pressing policy questions raised by the president\u2019s (reported) new proposal.\n\nProsecutorial discretion applies to many different decisions made by those charged with immigration enforcement, as a recent CRS report helpfully explains: which immigration violations to investigate most vigorously; deciding whether or not to question or detain a particular individual; agreeing to let an unauthorized immigrant to leave the country voluntarily; granting a deferred action; and actually deporting an immigrant. Deferred action has generally been granted on an individualized, case-by-case basis, yet the immigration authorities have granted blanket relief from deportation to all immigrants from, say, a particular country that has experienced some humanitarian disaster.\n\nThe deferred action the Obama administration announced in its June 15, 2012 DHS memorandum is quite different from those that came before it. DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) applies to over one million people, as a class, not in response to natural disaster or civil strife or some temporary disruption. Rather, it represents, in the words of Zachary Price, \u201ca categorical, prospective suspension of both the statutes requiring removal of unlawful immigrants and the statutory penalties for employers who hire immigrants without proper work authorization.\u201d (Like the executive action that is currently being contemplated by the White House, DACA had both a prosecutorial discretion component and a work authorization component.) And as Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law observes in a forthcoming article, DACA achieved the statutory objectives of the DREAM Act despite the fact that Congress expressly declined to enact it. This is why a number of critics insist that the president has stretched the limits of prosecutorial discretion. CRS strongly suggests that the courts are unlikely to rein in the executive branch:\n\nBy refusing to fully enforce certain aspects of a statutory provision, such an action may exceed the permissible scope of prosecutorial discretion and violate the President\u2019s duty that the \u201claws be faithfully executed.\u201d However, CRS was unable to find a single case in which a court invalidated a policy of non-enforcement founded upon prosecutorial discretion on the grounds that the policy violated the Take Care clause. Moreover, it is unclear whether the June 15 memorandum would constitute an absolute non-enforcement policy so as to amount to an \u201cabdication\u201d of a statutory obligation, as discussed previously. Though establishing a department-wide policy regarding a group of individuals who meet certain criteria, the directive suggests that the listed criteria should be \u201cconsidered\u201d in each individual case. Thus, the directive could be interpreted as setting forth criteria for consideration in each individual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, rather than implementing a ban on deportation actions for qualified individuals.\n\nIf President Obama can stretch prosecutorial discretion to this extent, why has he taken so long to extend the logic of DACA to encompass a broader constituency of unauthorized immigrants, including millions of others who are the relatives of U.S. citizens or who have lived in the United States for five years or more? It seems that the president had in the past been limited by a sense of political prudence. When Congress has debated immigration legislation in the past, there has been a sense that the executive branch shouldn\u2019t preempt these debates or effectively overrule them by creating facts on the ground by, say, granting work authorization to contested categories of immigrants.\n\nNow, however, the president seems to have decided that congressional intransigence gives him the political license to act unilaterally. Blackman elaborates on this theme:\n\nAs a justification for DACA, the President stressed that \u201cIn the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system . . . we\u2019re improving\u201d the immigration policy on our own. This policy does not fit neatly into the \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait\u201d rubric, as Congress considered it, and defeated it. Congress failing to vote on a law is a decision on policy in and of itself. Yet, the President cited this impatience, and frustration with the legislative process as the basis for an expansion of his inherent prosecutorial discretion to not enforce the laws against an entire class of people.\n\nThe trouble is that under our system of government, prosecutorial discretion is meant to be a tool to allow the executive branch to achieve statutory objectives, not as a tool for changing policy:\n\nIn the case of the recess appointments to the NLRB, DACA, and the myriad revisions of the Affordable Care Act, Congress has opposed each of the actions taken. The President has not argued that any of these limitations imposed by Congress were unconstitutional, or violated the separation of powers. Rather, inherent authority has been relied upon to justify policies where there is a disagreement or impasse with Congress. The Office of Legal Counsel has taken the position that while it may be valid for the President to decline to enforce the laws due to his view that they are \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d it would not be permissible to do so because he \u201copposes [them] for policy reasons.\u201d Apropos, John Yoo charged the President with \u201cthe unprecedented stretching of the Constitution and the rule of law.\u201d For, President Obama \u201cis laying claim to presidential power that goes even beyond that claimed by the Bush administration, in which I served. There is a world of difference in refusing to enforce laws that violate the Constitution (Bush) and refusing to enforce laws because of disagreements over policy (Obama).\u201d Further, without the benefit of a raging war, bolstered by the Commander in Chief Clause, the President\u2019s inherent authority over domestic matters becomes quite weak.\n\nThe American constitutional order doesn\u2019t rest solely on statutes, or on judicial efforts to restrain the executive branch. It also rests on norms. And the president\u2019s apparent willingness to violate these norms is setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nUpdate: Eric Posner has replied to this post. Posner makes a number of claims about my post that are inaccurate. For example, he writes that \u201cSalam argues that the president can\u2019t do what Congress didn\u2019t intend.\u201d In fact, I argue almost exactly the opposite. I explicitly note that the executive branch has broad authority to grant work authorizations under federal law, and that whether or not Congress intended to grant the president such sweeping powers, \u201cthe statute says what the statute says.\u201d\n\nJosh Blackman has done an able job of addressing Posner\u2019s arguments, and so I don\u2019t see a need to respond to Posner in detail. As I thought was fairly clear from my post, but evidently not clear enough for Posner, my objection to the new deferred action initiatives is that they represent a violation of important norms about which decisions belong in the legislative realm and which belong to the executive branch.\n\nI will, however, address one of Posner\u2019s claims:\n\nThe Chicago police do not announce in advance that it will suspend the law requiring people to obtain a license to shoot off fireworks. That the police are issuing \u201cfireworks permits\u201d hither and yon, akin to Obama\u2019s work permits. But everyone knows that this is the policy. No one has explained why announcement of prospective action\u2013which serves important rule-of-law values by informing the public of policy\u2013is a defect rather than an improvement over the Bush era, where virtually no employer was ever punished for employing illegal immigrants but a policy of non-enforcement was never announced. Question: How many employers were punished by the Bush administration in 2006 for employing illegal immigrants? Answer: zero. It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t announce a policy of granting work permits to illegal aliens. But that was his policy. Why didn\u2019t Salam argue then that Bush was violating the Constitution?\n\nNote that I don\u2019t argue that Obama is violating the Constitution, so that\u2019s one rather straightforward reason. As for why a prospective action might be a defect rather than an improvement over the Bush era, I can think of at least one obvious reason: a prospective action of this kind informs the expectations of unauthorized immigrants, and the expectations of those who enter into economic and other social arrangements with them. Though such an announcement does not technically \u201clegalize\u201d unauthorized immigrants, it encourages them to deepen their ties to the United States. This in turn makes the future revocation of their contingent protected status far more difficult. Prospective action can thus be understood as \u201centrenching.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Tue, 2014-08-05 17:50", "sailthru.author": "Reihan Salam", "description": "Yesterday, I wrote a post on Eric Posner\u2019s reply\u00a0to Ross Douthat\u00a0on President Obama\u2019s refusal to enforce immigration laws against large numbers of unauthorized immigrants.

I realize now that I waded into this subject too hastily, as the issues at stake need to be teased out more carefully.\n\nPosner\u2019s argument, essentially, is that the executive branch has broad prosecutorial discretion to enforce, or to not enforce, federal laws as it sees fit. Since the federal government has long had a semi-official policy of allowing unauthorized immigrants to remain in the United States if they do not commit serious crimes, Posner maintains that President Obama\u2019s proposal would do little more than officially recognize this current practice. This strikes me as incorrect. Yet it is incorrect in a more interesting manner than I had originally suggested.\n\nTo make his case, Posner compares the president\u2019s decision to not enforce immigration laws for a given class of people to the fact that the IRS doesn\u2019t audit poor people, and that the DEA goes after criminal syndicates but not ordinary drug users. Federal agencies face resource constraints that make setting priorities when it comes to law enforcement a necessity. This setting of priorities falls under the rubric of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nBut the executive action that is being contemplated by the Obama administration is not primarily\u00a0about husbanding enforcement resources to achieve the broader goal of enforcing existing U.S. immigration laws.\u00a0There are two separate components to it. The first is deferred action, which is within the prosecutorial discretion of immigration officers. On this front, Posner has a case, albeit a weaker one than he seems to think. The second component involved granting a broad class of unauthorized immigrants work authorization. This second step is in many respects more significant than the first, and the question of whether or not to grant work authorization to those who have settled in the country unlawfully is, I would argue, at the heart of the immigration reform debate. This power to grant work authorization does not derive from an inherent authority of the executive branch. Rather, the power to grant work authorization was granted to the executive branch under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. It seems very unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president the authority to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants the right to full participation in the U.S. labor market, and some lawmakers have tried to address this question, but the statute says what the statute says. So while there is much to say about Posner\u2019s idiosyncratic reading of American constitutional history, his analysis sheds little light on the most pressing policy questions raised by the president\u2019s (reported) new proposal.\n\nProsecutorial discretion applies to many different decisions made by those charged with immigration enforcement, as a recent CRS report helpfully explains: which immigration violations to investigate most vigorously; deciding whether or not to question or detain a particular individual; agreeing to let an unauthorized immigrant to leave the country voluntarily; granting a deferred action; and actually deporting an immigrant. Deferred action has generally been granted on an individualized, case-by-case basis, yet the immigration authorities have granted blanket relief from deportation to all immigrants from, say, a particular country that has experienced some humanitarian disaster.\n\nThe deferred action the Obama administration announced in its June 15, 2012 DHS memorandum is quite different\u00a0from those that came before it. DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) applies to over one million people, as a class, not in response to natural disaster or civil strife or some temporary disruption. Rather, it represents, in the words of Zachary Price, \u201ca categorical, prospective suspension of both the statutes requiring removal of unlawful immigrants and the statutory penalties for employers who hire immigrants without proper work authorization.\u201d (Like the executive action that is currently being contemplated by the White House, DACA had both a prosecutorial discretion component and a work authorization component.) And as Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law observes in a forthcoming article, DACA achieved the statutory objectives of the DREAM Act despite the fact that Congress expressly declined to enact it. This is why a number of critics insist that the president has stretched the limits of prosecutorial discretion. CRS strongly suggests that the courts are unlikely to rein in the executive branch:\n\n\nBy refusing to fully enforce certain aspects of a statutory provision, such an action may exceed the permissible scope of prosecutorial discretion and violate the President\u2019s duty that the \u201claws be faithfully executed.\u201d However, CRS was unable to find a single case in which a court invalidated a policy of non-enforcement founded upon prosecutorial discretion on the grounds that the policy violated the Take Care clause. Moreover, it is unclear whether the June 15 memorandum would constitute an absolute non-enforcement policy so as to amount to an \u201cabdication\u201d of a statutory obligation, as discussed previously. Though establishing a department-wide policy regarding a group of individuals who meet certain criteria, the directive suggests that the listed criteria should be \u201cconsidered\u201d in each individual case. Thus, the directive could be interpreted as setting forth criteria for consideration in each individual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, rather than implementing a ban on deportation actions for qualified individuals.\n\n\nIf President Obama can stretch prosecutorial discretion to this extent, why has he taken so long to extend the logic of DACA to encompass a broader constituency of unauthorized immigrants, including millions of others who are the relatives of U.S. citizens or who have lived in the United States for five years or more? It seems that the president had in the past been limited by a sense of political prudence. When Congress has debated immigration legislation in the past, there has been a sense that the executive branch shouldn\u2019t preempt these debates or effectively overrule them by creating facts on the ground by, say, granting work authorization to contested categories of immigrants.\n\nNow, however, the president seems to have decided that congressional intransigence gives him the political license to act unilaterally. Blackman elaborates on this theme:\n\n\nAs a justification for DACA, the President stressed that \u201cIn the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system . . . we\u2019re improving\u201d the immigration policy on our own. This policy does not fit neatly into the \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait\u201d rubric, as Congress considered it, and defeated it. Congress failing to vote on a law is a decision on policy in and of itself. Yet, the President cited this impatience, and frustration with the legislative process as the basis for an expansion of his inherent prosecutorial discretion to not enforce the laws against an entire class of people.\n\n\nThe trouble is that under our system of government, prosecutorial discretion is meant to be a tool to allow the executive branch to achieve statutory objectives, not as a tool for changing policy:\n\n\nIn the case of the recess appointments to the NLRB, DACA, and the myriad revisions of the Affordable Care Act, Congress has opposed each of the actions taken. The President has not argued that any of these limitations imposed by Congress were unconstitutional, or violated the separation of powers. Rather, inherent authority has been relied upon to justify policies where there is a disagreement or impasse with Congress.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel has taken the position that while it may be valid for the President to decline to enforce the laws due to his view that they are \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d it would not be permissible to do so because he \u201copposes [them] for policy reasons.\u201d Apropos, John Yoo charged the President with \u201cthe unprecedented stretching of the Constitution and the rule of law.\u201d For, President Obama \u201cis laying claim to presidential power that goes even beyond that claimed by the Bush administration, in which I served. There is a world of difference in refusing to enforce laws that violate the Constitution (Bush) and refusing to enforce laws because of disagreements over policy (Obama).\u201d Further, without the benefit of a raging war, bolstered by the Commander in Chief Clause, the President\u2019s inherent authority over domestic matters becomes quite weak.\n\n\nThe American constitutional order doesn\u2019t rest solely on statutes, or on judicial efforts to restrain the executive branch. It also rests on norms. And the president\u2019s apparent willingness to violate these norms is setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nUpdate: Eric Posner has replied to this post. Posner makes a number of claims about my post that are inaccurate. For example, he writes that \u201cSalam argues that the president can\u2019t do what Congress didn\u2019t intend.\u201d In fact, I argue almost exactly the opposite. I explicitly note that the executive branch has broad authority to grant work authorizations under federal law, and that whether or not Congress intended to grant the president such sweeping powers, \u201cthe statute says what the statute says.\u201d\u00a0\n\nJosh Blackman has done an able job of addressing Posner\u2019s arguments, and so I don\u2019t see a need to respond to Posner in detail. As I thought was fairly clear from my post, but evidently not clear enough for Posner, my objection to the new deferred action initiatives is that they\u00a0represent a\u00a0violation of important norms about which decisions belong in the legislative realm and which belong to the executive branch.\n\nI will, however, address one of Posner\u2019s\u00a0claims:\n\n\nThe Chicago police do not announce in advance that it will suspend the law requiring people to obtain a license to shoot off fireworks. That the police are issuing \u201cfireworks permits\u201d hither and yon, akin to Obama\u2019s work permits. But everyone knows that this is the policy. No one has explained why announcement of prospective action\u2013which serves important rule-of-law values by informing the public of policy\u2013is a defect rather than an improvement over the Bush era, where virtually no employer was ever punished for employing illegal immigrants but a policy of non-enforcement was never announced.\n\nQuestion: How many employers were punished by the Bush administration in 2006 for employing illegal immigrants? Answer: zero. It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t announce a policy of granting work permits to illegal aliens. But that was his policy. Why didn\u2019t Salam argue then that Bush was violating the Constitution?\n\n\nNote that I don\u2019t argue that Obama is violating the Constitution, so that\u2019s one rather straightforward reason.\u00a0As for why a\u00a0prospective action might be a defect rather than an improvement over the Bush era, I can think of at least one obvious reason: a prospective action of this kind\u00a0informs the\u00a0expectations of unauthorized immigrants, and the expectations of those who enter into economic and other social arrangements with them. Though such an announcement does not technically \u201clegalize\u201d unauthorized immigrants, it encourages them to deepen\u00a0their ties to the United States. This in turn makes the future revocation of their contingent protected status far more difficult.
