Cape Coral police are searching for two suspects who beat up their victim during a strong-arm robbery Saturday evening.

Police said the victim, a teenager, reported two men wearing hoodies beat him up and stole his phone and backpack.

It happened just after 6 p.m. near the Publix at 2420 Santa Barbara Blvd.

Officers are looking for the suspects who possibly got into a red sedan. One suspect is described as Hispanic and wearing a black sweater and red bandana. The other suspect is described as white with red hair and freckles.

People living in Cape Coral who heard about the crime said this isn't the norm.

"I've got two little ones, and I brought them here specifically in the Cape...I brought my wife here because the crime is so low," said Peter Albert.

His wife, Heather, said she was heartbroken to hear about the incident. "I mean, there aren't words for that. There aren't words for that. You can only do so much and control so much with your children. Or try to."

Although unusual for them, they said moments like these are the nature of a growing city.
