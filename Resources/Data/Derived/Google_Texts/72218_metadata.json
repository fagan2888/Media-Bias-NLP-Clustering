We tend to underestimate the possible health benefits that can be achieved by finding a quiet location, getting into a comfortable posture, and focusing our attention and attitude toward something positive. For example, many health care professionals recommend meditation as a treatment option for chronic pain, stress, anxiety, insomnia, depression, as well as symptoms of major chronic illness like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Here are 23 mediation quotes that promote mind-body wellness.\n\n1. \u201cIf a person\u2019s basic state of mind is serene and calm, then it is possible for this inner peace to overwhelm a painful physical experience.\u201d \u2014 The Dalai Lama\n\n2. \u201cMeditation is the dissolution of thoughts in eternal awareness or pure consciousness without objectification, knowing without thinking, merging finitude in infinity.\u201d \u2014 Voltaire\n\n3. \"In meditation, I can let go of everything.

I\u2019ve been using it for almost 40 years now \u2014 and I think it\u2019s a great tool for anyone to have, to be able to utilize as a tool for stress. Stress, of course, comes with almost every business. I think there are enough studies out there that show that TM is something that could benefit anybody. It\u2019s a great system to use. Otherwise, why would I\u2019ve been doing it for all these years, for almost half of my life?\u201d \u2014 Clint Eastwood\n\n7. \u201cMeditation brings wisdom; lack of meditation leaves ignorance. Know well what leads you forward and what holds you back, and choose the path that leads to wisdom.\u201d \u2014 Buddha\n\n8. \u201cHappiness, whether consisting in pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often found with those who are highly cultivated in their minds and in their character, and have only a moderate share of external goods, than among those who possess external goods to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities.\u201d \u2014 Aristotle\n\n9. \u201cEmpty your mind, be formless, shapeless \u2014 like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\u201d \u2014 Bruce Lee\n\n10. \u201cIn proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty, poverty, nor weakness, weakness.\u201d \u2014 Henry David Thoreau\n\n11. \u201cThe important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein\n\n12. \u201cIn dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart.

In action, be aware of the time and the season.\u201d \u2014 Lao Tzu\n\n13. \u201cSleep is the best meditation.\u201d \u2014 Dalai Lama\n\n14. \u201cDo not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.\u201d \u2014 Plato\n\n15. \u201cMeditation is such a more substantial reality than what we normally take to be reality.\u201d \u2014 Richard Gere\n\n16. \u201cThe more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large.\u201d \u2014 Confucius\n\n17. \u201cThe truth is incontrovertible.
