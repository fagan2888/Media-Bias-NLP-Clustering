(Kevin Johnson -- Santa Cruz Sentinel)\n\nThe PR playbok In \u201cDeadly Spin: An insurance company insider speaks out on how corporate PR is killing health care and deceiving Americans,\u201d Wendell Potter, who spent 25 years in public relations, describes the PR playbook fundamentals used to fend off reforms by executives in the tobacco, oil, soda, big banks, and health insurance industries. Step one is to hire a well connected PR firm to: \u2022 Set up and operate a coalition or front group with words like \u201cAmerican\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cchoice\u201d in the name. \u2022 Recruit third parties to list as members of the front group. \u2022 Write letters to the editor and opinion pieces that will be signed by the third parties. This PR firm likely will have people on staff who have worked at news outlets and who can influence the tone and content of what reporters write. Other strategies include: \u2022 Conducting a survey or finding statistics that support the client industry. \u2022 Feeding talking points to columnists or TV hosts to discredit your opponents. \u2022 Carrying out a communications campaign to position the company or industry as part of the solution. Source: \u201cDeadly Spin\u201d\n\nSANTA CRUZ >> Wendell Potter, a journalist who spent 15 years in public relations at health insurance giant CIGNA, saw firsthand how corporate spin worked to raise the stock price and executive compensation. Since he quit in 2008, he\u2019s been trying to atone for what he did.\n\nPotter wrote \u201cDeadly Spin,\u201d a book revealing manipulative tactics used by the health insurance industry to guard profits, joined the Center for Public Integrity as an analyst, and Thursday night spoke to more than 100 physicians gathered at Chaminade for an event presented by the Santa Cruz County Medical Society.\n\nPotter\u2019s column last month pointed out United Health Group, the largest health insurer, reported $10.3 billion in profits in 2014, up 7 percent from 2013. United Health\u2019s stock climbed to a record $113.85, up from $30.40 on March 23, 2010, when the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\nAsked about the dispute between insurer Blue Shield and Sutter Health, a fast-growing regional provider, and its affiliated Palo Alto Medical Foundation that left 284,000 Californians, many in Santa Cruz County, in the lurch for 30 days, Potter said, \u201cIt revolves around money.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said Sutter wanted a rate increase, which was unacceptable to Blue Shield, but when a two-year agreement was announced Jan. 30, neither side explained how the dispute was resolved.\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d asked Dr. Brian Brunelli, a neurologist with Palo Alto Medical Foundation who is president of the Santa Cruz County Medical Society, noting the economics were not shared with doctors.\n\n\u201cBoth sides are loath to provide the public with any details,\u201d Potter said. \u201cThey all insist it\u2019s proprietary information. The big losers are the patients. You never know what rates were finally agreed to. It\u2019s impossible to know the true cost of health care.\u201d\n\nThis secrecy contributes to escalation in health care costs, he said.\n\n\u201cLawmakers need to take a very close look at this,\u201d Potter added. \u201cThere\u2019s no incentive for change to happen within the industry.\u201d\n\nOpponents spent $57 million to defeat Prop. 45 to give the state insurance commissioner authority to regulate rates. On the other side, proponents spent $7 million.\n\n\u201cA lot of campaign money is spent by special interests, insurance as well as healthcare providers to influence public policy,\u201d Potter said. \u201cMost of us are completely unaware of how much is being spent. A big portion of what we pay in premiums is used for PR campaigns.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPotter identified a 1996 change in the insurance industry affecting health care. A trade group of Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers amended its bylaws to allow members to become public-stock companies.\n\nSince then, executives at for-profit insurers have pursued strategies such as higher premiums and more customer cost-sharing to boost their price of their stock and their stock options.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly it\u2019s greed,\u201d Potter said.\n\nIs it possible to reform the current system?\n\nHe contends the U.S. is \u201cfar away\u201d from a time when a doctor\u2019s office would have a price list \u201cthat would be of significant meaning to a patient.\u201d\n\nInsurers are developing \u201cclinical pathways,\u201d which are proprietary.\n\n\u201cDoes that make any sense?\u201d Potter asked. \u201cI assure you Wall Street is really calling the shots. They have to demonstrate every three months to their shareholders they are meeting profit expectations.\u201d\n\nA glimmer of hope comes from Dr. Leana Wen, inspired by her mother\u2019s care, who developed the Total Transparency Manifesto, a TEDMED talk, prompting thousands of doctors to sign her pledge to be accountable to patients.\n\nDr. John Christensen cited the case of a publicly traded staffing company that fired a doctor, overwhelmed by very sick patients in the emergency room, who asked for help.\n\nEd Gomez, a marketing rep at Norcal Mutual, which provides liability coverage to physicians, said, \u201cMaybe we have to do is blow it up and start over.\u201d\n\nOne frustrated physician wondered where to go for ideas on what to do.\n\nPotter suggested a group run by former Medicare chief Don Berwick and the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nHe advised local doctors work together to make a difference.\n\nPotter said he fell in love with idea of being a journalist, worked as a reporter in Memphis and then in Washington covering Congress and the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said he was lured to public relations by money and recruited to work for Humana, where he thrived, and then to CIGNA, where he became the chief spokesman.\n\nHe helped defeat the Clinton health reform initiative and a patient bill of rights before health care reform took shape under Obama.\n\nOn a visit home to Tennessee, he made a trip to Wise County, Virginia, where health care was being offered free for the weekend at a fairgrounds, where lines of people waited to be seen in animal stalls. \u201c\n\n\u201cIt hit me like a ton of bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cI began to see I was part of the problem.\u201d\n\nHe said he thought he could make changes from the inside, but realized that was not possible and gave his notice.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t set out to be a whistleblower,\u201d he said, but seeing someone on television give the kind of talking points he used to write led him to volunteer for reform and in 2009 testify before Congress.\n\nHe explained common industry practices that contributed to the rising number of uninsured Americans, such as cancelling policies of women after they got breast cancer, which then led to his book.\n\nOne statistic from the book: A Kaiser Family Foundation report found insurers raised premiums in employer-sponsored health plans 97 percent from 2000 to 2008 when overall inflation was 21 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SANTA CRUZ >> Wendell Potter, a journalist who spent 15 years in public relations at health insurance giant CIGNA, saw firsthand how corporate spin worked to raise the stock price and executive compensation.
