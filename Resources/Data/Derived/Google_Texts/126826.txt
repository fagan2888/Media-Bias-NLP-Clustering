When the Affordable Care Act rolls out on Oct. 1, more residents will be able to get coverage when the state insurance marketplace opens.

They should jump at the opportunity, said Luis Veloz, a 19-year-old student at Mountain View College. But not everyone will be covered, including Veloz and his parents.

He made that point at a community meeting Tuesday at St. Luke Community United Methodist Church in East Dallas. The meeting was sponsored by the Texas Organizing Project, an advocacy group.

That’s why Veloz wants Gov. Rick Perry to expand Medicaid and accept federal money, he said. Texas Democrats in Congress want the Republican governor to expand Medicaid, too.

But Perry punctuated his resistance with this statement in March to the Texas Democrats: “Medicaid is driving our nation over a fiscal cliff and consuming a ballooning portion of state budgets — already a quarter of our budget in Texas.”
