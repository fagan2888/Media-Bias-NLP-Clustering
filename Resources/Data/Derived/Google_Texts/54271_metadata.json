Now it has grown into an agency serving the health needs of those living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n\nBack in the 1980s, when so many people were dying from the virus, who would have thought that one day, a clinic inside GSP would offer health exams and more?\n\n\n\nOpened last year, the clinic has been open only on Fridays, with medical care provided by Truman Medical. But beginning in mid-February, officials say, it will be open five days a week at Good Samaritan Project, 3030 Walnut, KCMO. (816) 561-8784, GSP.\n\n\n\nTruman has hired a nurse practitioner for the clinic, said David Schlomer, who is the CEO of GSP.\n\n\n\n\u0093She is going through the orientation process at Truman right now,\u0094 he said. \u0093The exciting thing is that it gives us an incentive to be innovative. For example, one of the programs we\u0092re working on is one day a month, we\u0092d have a young adult clinic, and that day would be devoted to teenagers and young adults. And we may have some days that are focused on women. We\u0092ll just have to see what the need is.\u0094\n\n\n\nGSP is one of Kansas City\u0092s four primary AIDS Service Providers (ASPs) that benefit from the money raised by the AIDS Service Foundation through AIDS Walk and their fundraising events. GSP\u0092s clients are all living with HIV/AIDS. The other beneficiaries are SAVE Inc., Hope Care Center, and KC Care Clinic.\n\n\n\nSchlomer said GSP gets roughly $60,000 to $70,000 a year from that fundraising. He said about two-thirds of the agency\u0092s funding comes from the federal government (mostly from the Ryan White Care Act), other grants, and fundraising events like the annual Dining Out for Life. This year, that event will be May 7, with about 30 restaurants participating and giving a share of their proceeds.\n\n\n\nBriana L. McClernon, director of case management at GSP, described the role of her staff: \u0093The case manager\u0092s role is basically to help clients engage in medical care and stay in medical care. That\u0092s our goal. We have eight case managers; seven are medical case managers.\u0094 They carry a caseload of 66 to 73 right now, instead of the 50 to 70 that they usually have.\n\n\n\nIn addition, GSP has a transitional case manager who goes into the prisons and meets with clients about six months before their release and then six months to a year after their release, McClernon said.\n\n\n\nAccording to GSP\u0092s eligibility guidelines, she said, a person\u0092s income must be under the national poverty level for a single person, to qualify for services.\n\n\n\n\u0093We help them with accessing medication, and insurance has been really a big part of our jobs now, especially with the Affordable Care Act,\u0094 she said.\n\n\n\nSchlomer said they hired someone for a temporary position a few months ago through the end of February to assist clients in getting insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\u0093During the last open enrollment period, we enrolled about 140 people,\u0094 McClernon said. \u0093We have less and less clients now who are totally uninsured.\u0094\n\n\n\nThe case management client list changes slightly on a monthly basis. Here are GSP\u0092s reported statistics by race and gender as of December 2014. Case Management\n\nProgram Statistics by\n\nRace and Gender Current Month % Current Case Load: 500\n\nCaucasian 245 49%\n\nAfrican American 184 37%\n\nHispanic 30 6%\n\nNative American 4 1%\n\nAfrican 29 6%\n\nPacific Islander/Asian 8 1% Male 399 80%\n\nFemale 93 19%\n\nTransgender 8 2%\n\n\n\nThe members of the African population in the statistics above are refugees in many ways, Schlomer said. \u0093There is a fair number in Kansas City.\u0094\n\n\n\nMcClernon said that \u0093We do have one case manager where that is her heart, she really wants to work with this population of clients.\u0094\n\n\n\nIf there is a language barrier in working with clients, Schlomer said, GSP can provide interpretive services when necessary. One bilingual staff member, Lorena Holguin, works with the Hispanic female population, he said. GSP also works with Mario Canedo on the annual Latino Gay Pride festival held in September for outreach to the Hispanic community.\n\n\n\nGSP serves 11 counties in the Kansas City metro area, on both sides of the state line. Its clients have primarily used the medical facilities of Truman, KC Care Clinic, Southwest Boulevard Family Health Clinic, and KU Medical Center. The case managers work out of satellite offices. Two are at Southwest Boulevard Family Health Clinic; one is at the Johnson County Health Department, and one is at the Research Medical campus.\n\n\n\nClients get help with emergency assistance and sometimes transportation through GSP. They can use a computer in the building to look for a job or housing resources, McClernon said. She said GSP works closely with SAVE Inc. and ReStart on referring clients for assistance and housing.\n\n\n\n\u0093One great thing about our agency is that it\u0092s just quiet. It\u0092s away from the bustle of things and people can come and kind of take a break and look at the things they need to,\u0094 said McClernon.\n\n\n\n\u0093We also provide mental health counseling services through the Ryan White Care Act,\u0094 said Schlomer. \u0093It\u0092s a program that is coordinated by a mental health provider, not an employee, a contractor that we have -- maybe a dozen providers in the network. That way, the client can choose who they\u0092d like to see, assuming they are eligible. But we pay for the sessions and we have providers all over town.\u0094\n\n\n\nMcClernon said that GSP cannot provide vision coverage under the Ryan White Care Act, but they can provide dental care through approved contractors.\n\n\n\nTravis Barnhart, GSP\u0092s manager of prevention services, has implemented walk-in testing days, Schlomer said.\n\n\n\nFree testing is held from 3 to 7:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\n\n\nThey test for HIV, STI, gonorrhea and chlamydia. In addition to doing the standard urine testing, they do more.\n\n\n\nPharyngeal testing of the throat and rectal screenings have been effective, said Mark Halastik, GSP\u0092s director of development and communications.\n\n\n\n\u0093They have actually found results by going through the extra step,\u0094 said Schlomer. The HIV testing uses the rapid screening finger prick, with results in about 20 minutes.\n\n\n\nBarnhart does outreach in the community at LGBT events and health fairs. He also brings in a busload of youth four mornings a month for presentations on STI and HIV prevention; each group has 20-42 youth.\n\n\n\nIn the last 10 years, Schlomer said, \u0093I think we\u0092ve seen a big switch in the demographics. I think we are seeing more women and more diverse populations.\u0094 He also said that treatments have changed dramatically.\n\n\n\n\u0093Everyone is trying to get toward a single-tablet regimen,\u0094 said McClernon.\n\n\n\n\u0093One of our biggest goals this year is to re-build our client services program. That would include emergency assistance, coordination, transportation services,\u0094 said Schlomer.\n\n\n\n\u0093We have those services now but they\u0092re just add-ons to management. It\u0092d be great to have a separate department that could manage that and make it better,\u0094 said McClernon.\n\n\n\n\u0093Our role as case managers has changed a lot,\u0094 she said. \u0093We still have a focus on their HIV care and educating them on medication and side effects and everything, but with the Affordable Care Act, we have become very insurance-focused. Those of us who didn\u0092t have insurance backgrounds have had to become experts at health insurance, so that\u0092s a big change.\u0094\n\n\n\n\u0093I think it\u0092s changed the way all of us do our work. Not just GSP, but the whole AIDS service community,\u0094 said Schlomer.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2e2\"", "article_summary": "The other beneficiaries are SAVE Inc., Hope Care Center, and KC Care Clinic.\nBriana L.
