DENVER -- A Denver family is turning to friends and strangers for help after a thief is accused of breaking into their home and stealing thousands of dollars worth of Christmas presents and electronics.

The burglary, which was reported to police Friday evening, happened at a home in East Denver. The thief is accused of stealing at least one television set, several wrapped gifts, and several family documents.

"It just really makes you feel uneasy and unsafe in your own home where you should feel the safest," said Cynthia Wake, the victim of the burglary.

Ms. Wake posted pictures of the incident to her Facebook page which lead friends to create a "Go Fund Me" donation site to help replace the gifts.

The thief was also able to steal some gifts that the family was collecting for a neighborhood toy drive.

Thanks to the online donation page, over $2,000 has already been raised.
