And a reminder for everyone watching I worked for President Clinton made charitable contributions in the past of the Clinton foundation. Welcome back thanks church is it time to declare war on license. Look we are definitely. In conflict with the crisis and I think we need a new update. Military authorization the AUN math which was passed after the attack on nine elevenths. Should be brought up to my not declare war. Well declare war is a very legal term as you know so well. I think what we want to do is make sure we have every tool at our disposal two number one. Destroy their would be Kalla fate in Syria and Iraq in Iraq number two do everything we can't dismantle this very effective. Virtual jihadist network that they are using on the Internet and number three do whatever is necessary to protect it is concerned about in the declaration were. Well I think that the legal experts say that if week it. There are a lot who say that we already have the authority we need to go after I say this or any international terrorist network including al-Qaeda and anybody else. In the AU a math I think it is important though for the congress to vote on behalf of the American people. And to make sure that we are updating it to take into account the new authorities said to have risk people you've also been reluctant to say we're fighting radical Islam I wonder why not who isn't a mistake not to save playing. That the violence is being pushed by radical elements nothing. Well let's a different thing radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist. Ambitions. I'm fine with that I say it all the time and I go after Islamic a list that come with radical Islam well the problem is that. That sounds like we are declaring war against a religion and that to me is number one wrong even though the qualifier radical is there now because look that. You know enough about religion you've studied it and there are radicals people who believe all kinds of things in every religion in the world. I don't want to do that because number one. It doesn't do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people number two. It helps to create this clash of civilizations. That is actually a recruiting tool. For crisis and other radical jihadist who use this as a way of saying we are in a war against the west. You must join us if you're a Muslim you must join us know. If you're a law abiding peace loving Muslim you need to be with us against those who are distorting. Islam can you say today that we're winning the fight against thanks this. Agitated day that we have. A new set of threats you know if if you go back and look where we were with al-Qaeda in 9/11. There's no doubt bin Laden and his lieutenants were planning to carry out additional attacks if they possibly could. And they did in places like Madrid in London at Sutter. So we have dealt with that threat it doesn't go away we haven't eliminated but we've dealt with it now we have to turn our attention to. The very sophisticated. Op propagation. This new threat from ice is we're not winning. That bad yet well we're not winning but it's too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do and I've outlined very clearly Sophia well after we have to fight them in the air we have to fight them on the ground and we have to fight them. On the Internet and we have to do everything we can with our friends and partners around the world to protect our viewer in the Oval Office and I would you be announcing new strategy. Well I think what that's what we'll hear from the president and intensification. Of the existing strategy and I think they're some additional steps we have to take. If you look at the story about this woman and may be the man too who got radicalized self radicalized. We're gonna need help from FaceBook and from YouTube and from Twitter they cannot per met. The recruitment and the actual direction of attacks or the celebration of violence. By this sophisticated Internet user. They're gonna have to help us take down these. Announcements and these appeals are about Italy as they get up how about apple no more encryption. This is something I've said for a long time George. I have to believe that the best minds in the private sector and the public sector could come to gather. To help us deal with this evolving threat. And you know I know what the argument is from our friends. In the industry. I hate respect that nobody wants to be feeling like their privacy is invaded but I also know what you are given as. On the other side from law enforcement and security professionals. So please let's get together and try to figure out the best way forward some of your potential rivals and Republican sides agreed to do more overseas as well. Ted Cruz says with the carpet bond prices. Well that's an easy thing to say you know he's never had any responsibility for trying to figure out to you know who the bad guys aren't who innocent civilians are. Clearly we have to have a much more robust. Air campaign against. Ice is targets against that. Oil infrastructure against their leadership I think you'll hear that from the president and part of what I have been arguing for for quite some time now. Is that we've got to do a better job of getting back the Sunnis on the ground along with the Kurds. Who can be that fighters who will actually take back territory. With air cover and with targeted attacks on. Ice is infrastructure we still are gonna have to have people fighting now I do not believe though should be American combat troop house Ali not is that an absolute it. Where I sit right now I think it would make things worse not better I do believe we have to up our special ops numbers the fifty that have been authorized need to get there. And then we need to take stock of what else we need. I think the more than 3000 Americans that we have on the ground in Iraq who are advising assisting. And enabling the Iraqi military have to be given the flexibility and support they need. And I believe strongly we should perhaps ask some of our current and retired military officers who dealt with the Sunni sheiks in Anbar and elsewhere. To once again reconstitute. The fighting force that they put into the fight against al-Qaeda in Iraq. And that was one of my biggest complaints about now lucky because what he did was to basically not only. Destroyed the the military because of the sectarianism but also. He went after ago Sunni leaders in Anbar. And we know from reporting that some of them are support of a crisis some of the former bath military officers under Saddam Hussein. As you know years of Republican rivals of Oscars as you for focusing on gun control after the San Bernardino attacks mark rubio. Points at that France has some of the strictest gun control in the world that didn't stop the terrorist attacks. California has some of the strictest gun control laws here it didn't stop those attacks either so what law would have stopped this. Well first of all the what happened a San Bernardino was a terrorist act nobody is arguing that the militant the law enforcement FBI have come to that conclusion. And let's not forget though a week before we had an American. Assault on Planned Parenthood and some weeks before that we had an assault at a community college so. I don't see these two as an anyway contradictory we have to up our game against terrorists abroad and at home. And we have to take account of the fact that our gun laws and the easy access to those guns. By people who shouldn't get them mentally ill people fugitives felons. And the congress continuing to refuse to prohibit people on the no fly list from getting guns which include a lot of it on domestic and international terrorists. These are two parts of the same approach that I'm taking to make us safe and yes. The NRA's position always is you know if you can't stop everything why try to stop anything that's not the way law works we we have laws that are gonna govern. Our speed limits on. Rhodes knowing some people are gonna violated or people are gonna drive drunk but we still have laws we need. To have comprehensive background checks we need to close a gun show loophole. Close the online group will go after what's called the Charles some loophole. An end the liability for. Gun sellers. This no fly list that critics that vote say that you know you look back at this lets its indiscriminate. And they go back ten years and say 2000 people on the watch list actually did buy guns government isn't on any of them committing a crime with a gun. Well again that that's like proving the negative. We have a list if you are on that list and you believe you should not be on that list we have a process to actually raise your objections about being on that list. You get on the list because there is some credible evidence you belong on the list now obviously I'm missing some time some just makes of course that's why there's a process for people to be able to raise. Their concerns about being on the list. And then to have a process that could even lead to a legal action to remove yourself from the list. But I for one analog act at the shuttle from New York I'm a lot happier having a list that keep people off planes that. There's any question about their intent or their potential behavior so I'm not I can't take anybody seriously who's gonna begin to chip away at the no fly when. Style chomping yesterday Jerry Falwell junior say the answers for more good people have guns. Mr. Falwell urged his students at Liberty University to actually arm themselves get concealed carry permits your response. Well he also went off and don't forget he said this George he said that way we can take up the Muslims he said that okay. This is the kind of deplorable. Not only hateful. Response to a legitimate security issue. But it is giving aid and comfort to I sis and other radical jihadist. With respect to the gun issue. It's legal to buy guns in America if you are eligible to buy a gun you can go buy a gun and hundreds of thousand people apparently are in the aftermath of what happened in San Bernardino. I just want people to understand some. Threats we now face whether it's. The guy in Charleston who should never have been given a gun but the universal background check was not fast enough didn't find the fact he was prohibited went into the church and killed nine innocent people. We should be able to approach both of these with some sense of you know unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting a hold of guns have to take a quick break stand by. I think you're looking at the next Republican nominee. And here's what I promise you should I win this nomination. I will take it to Hillary Clinton and I won't work. Jeb Bush yeah. Hillary Clinton Era right now and is he's hoping he's gonna tell applied in just little bit helping taking on in the general election if you get the nomination. We didn't some of the issues that may come up in in in the general election when things you're seeing. Republicans really taking aim at is your spending investment programs right on the show right here propose about a trillion dollars over ten years over ten years and spending proposals include that lot of questions on whether you can actually paid for by focusing tax increases. Only in the top 3% and here's the Washington Post editorial they say there's simply no way that the federal government can meet its current fiscal commandments. Plus the increased demands of an aging population and provide the new forms of middle class relief and business tax relief from the screen promises. What's happening only the top 3% of earners in response. Well I just respectfully disagree and that's why I've laid out very specific plans about the kind of investments that I think middle class families particularly need that. We have to have to you know grow our economy and I've been very specific about how I will pay for each of those and that is part of the in underlying principle of my presenting also said but I think it is a little bit and music that's separate Republican National Committee. Would go after me since all of their candidates than their party philosophy is. Massive spending cuts and massive tax decreases for those at the very top with no thought to how to pay for it. Or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national debt you know. I do come from the Clinton school of economics and win my has been ended we had a balanced budget and a surplus. Then present Obama inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I don't think he gets the credit he deserters for digging us out so were standing and now we've got to start moving into the future again it is gonna take good. Fiscal responsibility. That's what I'm promising but I'm also promising that the wealthy are gonna start paying more of their fair share and help to fund some of the investments that girls. Good morning no tax increases at all anyone earning under 250000 dollars is that a rock solid read my lips promise. Well it certainly is my goal and I've laid it out in this campaign and it's something the President Obama promised it's something my has been certainly tried to achieve. Because I want. Americans to know that I get it. That a lot of the losses that they experience because of the Great Recession are still really pull on them down. You know thirteen trillion dollars in family wealth was destroyed by the Great Recession people lost their homes their 401 k.s an irate they're college funds. So we've got to rebuild the middle class if we expect to have broad based prosperity that doesn't come. It's and the global what if he can't get the revenue and other ways what the spending comes in more than is we then raise taxes and George. I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna continue to stick with what I'm gonna do a hundred billion dollars a year in these new investments all paid for. I think is a responsible approach to getting our economy creating good jobs again you know I have an infrastructure plan that's on top of what the congress just passed. So I'm gonna gut go out there and I'm gonna defend what I'm doing and I'm also really gonna defend the middle class. Because a lot of these proposals would have a very bad effect either it would raise taxes on the middle class. Or it would undermine the kind of growth and structure that we need for the middle class to take off again. The challenge you could face this campaign majority of Americans question your honesty some GOP rivals. And family members of the band guys he victims are saying you lied to them in that hearing they point to. Emails and you sent to the night of the attack one to your daughter. Chelsea Clinton saying. Is fanatical my glasses back here at the united us. We are silent with. Two of our officers were killed and make doesn't buy an al-Qaeda lay group. Another one to the Egyptian prime minister we know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with a film it was a planned attack. Not a protest for the family members as you know see you told them was by filmmaker you go after the film maker here's what they said. She yeah I she absolutely do lied to her daughter. Was able to be told differently that it was not the video it was something else now her daughter could be told why can't I. Neither she was lying and prime minister where she was lying to me into the American public. Did you tell Elizabeth the film what's your response no you know I look I I understand. Continuing grief at the loss that. Parents experienced. With the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify as you know for. Eleven hours. And I answered all of these questions now I can't. I I can't help that the people think their house to be something else they're I said very clearly. There had been a terrorist group album that had taken responsibility. On FaceBook. Between the time that. High you know when I talked to my daughter that was the latest information we were giving it credibility. And then we learn the next day it wasn't true in fact they retracted it. This was a fast moving series of events in the fog of war and I think most Americans all the more generally do you do you think there's something you can do to get a majority of Americans to believe you're trustworthy well it obviously don't like hearing that George but I think people who have worked with me people who. Voted for me twice in New York people who I've had a very long relationship with -- working on their behalf are gonna know. What I do and when I say I will do what I will move everything I can to get it done and I believe the American people are looking for somebody who is a fighter who will stand up there. Just as I did tell you what I will do tell you I'll do everything to make it happen. And I think my values have been consistent over the years and the results that I've gotten are ones that I'm gonna take to the American public. Immigration a be a big issue in this campaign in the past you said that undocumented immigrants and not be covered by health care proposals hasn't changed we had in 2007. When illegal immigrants be covered under your plan. Illegal immigrants would not be covered. No they would not be covered I will continue to have a safety net which I think is. And the best traditions of our country and also. It for public health reasons absolutely necessary but. We did not cover them in 9394. And my plan does not cover them now. Now you see that undocumented immigrants should be able to buy into the exchange's so why the shift. Well because number one V kinda plan that was passed in the Affordable Care Act. It gives you a market based bay of getting into the insurance market so. If you can afford to buy a policy. You can. You don't get however any of the subsidies that American citizens might O'Malley says they showed why not well I disagree with him I think part of comprehensive immigration reform should be looking at all of these issues but as things stand right now. Under the Affordable Care Act if you have the money. And you are on documented you can buy into it. But without the subsidies that's why it's important we continue to support community health centers we continue to support our hospitals because those are often the places. That undocumented people on 4 PM what a reason for not going further. Because I don't think legally used canned I mean that is not something that we can legally support that was very clear about that Donald Trump. Plus a few days has opened up at. Lashing getting girls aren't enough that he's lower opening up a new line of attack on you here I was here a new wanna. She'll do a couple of minutes and Iowa meaning a short period of time. And that she doesn't get us here for 56 days. She goes home she goes to sleep I'm telling she. She doesn't have the strength. She doesn't have this stamina. Oh goodness gracious. If you don't agree well who could agree with anything he says that is you know it subject to 12 of suspect checking. Look if he gets that nomination I will be more than happy to campaign against him it's only wanna running against. I really think about it that way I don't have any influence over who they nominate over there and in fact. He's not the only one saying things that are deeply distressing. A lot of the others are kind of trump to you know I'll whatever trump says Mabel who won't go quite as far but we'll get as close as we can. So of the Republicans. The in their presidential. And nominating process have a lot to answer please explain why he's doing so well. I don't know because he's he's a reality TV star. I mean tens of millions of people have watched him for more than a decade on TV and he's parred the celebrity culture and he will. Say whatever he wants to say and if he's held account that it's not true he just brushes it off he goes on and I think that you know there's a certain attractiveness. Two people. They here's a guy who says exactly what he believes untrue is it may be inflammatory as it certainly and it's finally you see you getting better learning from your critics me tell you things to your friends won't. Salute you learn from critics in this campaign. I've said for a long time George that I try I tried to take criticism seriously but not personally. And by that I mean look if somebody says hey. You know you didn't do he or she didn't do a good job answering this or. You know I don't think that that. You know adds up whenever they might say I will take that seriously but I really try not to take it personally and I think that's a big distinction that you have to begin to draw when your in the public arena. You know one of my favorite Americans Eleanor Roosevelt said for any woman in the public arena you have to grow skin as thick as the rhinoceros and you know I try to put lotion on it. There are a lot of thick step over the years thanks for joining us thanks George.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Video: Hillary Clinton on 2016 Presidential Race", "description": "The Democratic candidate for president is interviewed on \"This Week.\"", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "The Democratic candidate for president is interviewed on \"This Week.\"", "title": "Video: Hillary Clinton on 2016 Presidential Race", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-race-35606476", "image": {"identifier": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/ThisWeek/151206_tw_clinton_1003_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "video": {"width": 470, "secure_url": "https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/AkamaiPremierPlayer.swf?settings_url=https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/amp.premier.flashonly.xml?sec=1&params=%7B%22playerId%22%3A%22facebookHTTPS%22%7D&data_feed_url=http://abcnews.go.com/video/itemfeed?id=35606476&auto_play=true&ad_control_enabled=false", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "identifier": "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/AkamaiPremierPlayer.swf?settings_url=http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/amp.premier.flashonly.xml?sec=1&params=%7B%22playerId%22%3A%22facebookHTTP%22%7D&data_feed_url=http://abcnews.go.com/video/itemfeed?id=35606476&auto_play=true&ad_control_enabled=false", "height": 265}, "type": "video"}, "twitter": {"player": {"identifier": "https://abcnews.go.com/video/twittercard?id=35606476", "stream": {"identifier": "http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/98330877-5095-4ac9-9a8c-7cdcd3944274/15a750c8-e7be-4371-b5c3-dd911c0d8bb0/thisweek-35606476/content.once", "content_type": "video/mp4"}}, "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/ThisWeek/151206_tw_clinton_1003_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/video,35606476", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/video,35606476"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638}}, "card": "player", "site": "@ABC"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/video,35606476", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/video,35606476", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "video": {"duration": 1245}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "This Week, George Stephanopoulos, Hillary Clinton, San Bernardino, California, Shooting, 2016, Terrorism, political news, political analysis, political interviews, george stephanopoulos, this week"}, "article_summary": "I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna continue to stick with what I'm gonna do a hundred billion dollars a year in these new investments all paid for.\nSo I'm gonna gut go out there and I'm gonna defend what I'm doing and I'm also really gonna defend the middle class.\nTranscript for Hillary Clinton on 2016 Presidential RaceSecretary Hillary Clinton back on this week for the first time this presidential campaign.\nWe're gonna need help from FaceBook and from YouTube and from Twitter they cannot per met.\nVoted for me twice in New York people who I've had a very long relationship with -- working on their behalf are gonna know."}
