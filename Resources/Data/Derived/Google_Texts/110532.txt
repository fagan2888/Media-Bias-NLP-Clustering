One person suspected of shooting at a motorist from a passing car is in police custody after leading officers on chase around the southern stretch of the Beltway and Interstate 295 on Friday afternoon.

U.S. Park Police officials said during the chase that the person tossed a gun, which has been recovered, from a gold Lexus as the vehicle crossed the Woodrow Wilson Bridge from Prince George’s County into Virginia.

The chase began around 2 p.m. when a motorist informed a U.S. Park Police officer that someone had shot at his car. A bullet hole was discovered in the front fender of the driver’s red sedan.

As the motorist was talking to the officer, the gold Lexus passed by on the Suitland Parkway and the motorist told the officer that was the car from which someone had opened fire.

The U.S. Park Police officer pursued the vehicle, which traveled from the parkway onto the Beltway into Virginia and eventually back into Maryland. Officers stopped the vehicle on I-295 just north of the exit for the Beltway around 2:45 p.m. Friday.

A park police spokesman said no serious injuries were reported as part of the shooting or chase.

Officers are still investigating the incident and have not released the name of the person taken into custody.
