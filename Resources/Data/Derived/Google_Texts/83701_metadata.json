Oh yeah, you could feel the explosion. We looked straight up and we saw things flying in the air.\"\n\nIt was like a scene out of a movie, captured with cell phone pictures and video throughout the area Saturday.\n\nInvestigators say 55-year-old Jeffrey and Sarah Witter of Iowa, had just finished refueling their 40-foot powerboat.\n\nAfter starting one of the boat's internal engines, they tried to start the other and it caused the engine to explode.\n\nGary Wandrey was helping the Witters refuel and was just yards away from the blast.\n\n\"All the shrapnel went up, rather than flying out to the sides, or we would've had a lot more injuries.\"\n\nBystanders were able to push the boat away from the dock where it took firefighters more than a half hour to put out the flames.\n\nBoth Jeffrey and Sarah Witter were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Four others on board including their two-year-old granddaughter escaped injury.\n\nWe contacted the family and they wanted us to pass along their gratitude for the response:\n\n\n\n\"Please do pass along our appreciation to all of the individuals that helped us get to safety, the first responders, police officers, EMT's, doctors and nurses. Everyone was so wonderful and we can't express enough how appreciative we are. Thank you, Hannah Kustes\"\n\nOnce the fire was out, the boat was towed to shallow water. Sea Tow and the Coast Guard will remove the boat and take it to a secure location.\n\n\n\nCape Coral Police, Cape Coral Fire Department, Sanibel Fire Department, Iona McGregor Fire Department, Lee County EMS, Lee County Sheriff's Office and FWC all responded to the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n?\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The state fire marshal is investigating an explosion on a boat at a fuel dock at Tarpon Point Marina in Cape Coral on Saturday.
