Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on Sunday that his party\u2019s upcoming presidential debates are based on merit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPriebus argued that the most successful GOP White House hopefuls will get the most debate spotlight.\n\n\u201cThe reality is \u2014 and it might be a little harsh \u2014 you can\u2019t necessarily treat someone that\u2019s polling at 18 or 20 percent the same as someone polling at a half a percent or 1 percent,\u201d Priebus told host Jonathan Karl on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the point is there is a meritocracy involved,\u201d he added of the GOP\u2019s crowded field containing 17 presidential contenders.\n\nPriebus cited the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominating process as proof the RNC is not setting a new precedent with its debates this year.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got amnesia,\u201d he told Karl.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, do you remember that Jon Huntsman and Gary Johnston didn\u2019t make the cut of some debates?\u201d Priebus asked.\n\nFox News is hosting the GOP\u2019s first presidential debates on Thursday evening.\n\nIt is partitioning the party\u2019s large 2016 field based on an average of national polling numbers concluding Tuesday night.\n\nPriebus charged on Sunday that none of the GOP\u2019s Oval Office seekers are getting lost in the shuffle.\n\n\u201cI actually think they\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d he said of Fox News and CNN, another upcoming debate host.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually very grateful to Fox News and CNN for the fact that they\u2019re letting every single person, all 17, participate in debate night,\u201d Priebus said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is going to have an opportunity,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nFox News is spotlighting the top 10 GOP presidential candidates based on national polling averages during its main stage debate next week.\n\nThe remaining contenders will meet in an earlier, runoff debate conducted on the same evening.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cEveryone is going to have an opportunity,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d", "description": "\u201cEveryone is
