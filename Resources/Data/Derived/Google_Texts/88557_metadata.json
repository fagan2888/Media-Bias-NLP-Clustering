Loudermilk (a freshman who ran to the right of another hero of the mad fringe, Bob Barr, in his original primary) is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and an outspoken \"constitutional conservative.\" Collins, who's notable for being both an ordained Baptist minister and a lawyer, is probably best known for defending military chaplains (he's one himself in the Reserves) who get a little carried away with proselytizing.\n\nBut while both congressmen are facing multiple opponents all shrieking at them for their alleged betrayal of True Conservatism, Collins has drawn the marquee challenger: his former House colleague Paul Broun, a favorite of extremism aficionados everywhere.\n\nUntil he left the House for a failed Senate bid in 2014, Broun was one of those pols who said incredible things with every other breath. Perhaps his most famous moment was when this member of the House Science Committee delivered a speech in his district referring to evolution and various other scientific teachings that conflict with his conservative Evangelical views as \"lies from the pit of hell.\" So notorious was Broun as a proud know-nothing that a significant number of write-in votes in his district were cast for Charles Darwin.\n\nNow Broun is aiming his peculiar brand of thunder and lightning at Collins, and he has the advantage of having represented about half the current ninth district before the last rounds of redistricting. But Broun is being dogged by ethics charges dating from his congressional service that recently led to a criminal indictment of his former top chief of staff.\n\nBoth Loudermilk and Collins are expected to come out on top in tonight's returns. But the catch is that Georgia requires majorities for nominations, and being knocked into a crazy-low-turnout runoff would be perilous for either incumbent. A wild card is that North Georgia right-wing activists have already been stirred up by the treachery of another of their own: Governor (and former ninth-district congressman) Nathan Deal, who recently vetoed a \"religious liberty\" bill aimed at making anti-LGBT discrimination easier. (On the principle of in-for-a-penny, in-for-a-pound, Deal, who is safely in his second and final term, subsequently infuriated the gun lobby by vetoing a \"campus carry\" bill getting rid of restrictions on shooting irons at colleges and universities. Where will the betrayals end?)\n\nThe one thing we know for sure is that there's no degree of extremism in the GOP that will give Democrats a chance at either House seat. These are two of the most profoundly Republican districts east of Utah. And, so far as we know, Charles Darwin's not even in the race.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "One \u2014 Paul Broun \u2014 called evolution \"lies from the pit of hell.\"", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "One \u2014 Paul Broun \u2014 called evolution \"lies from the pit of hell.\"", "title": "In Georgia, Two Republicans Face Primary Challenges for Not Being Extremist Enough", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/georgia-downballot-primary-preview.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/24/20-paul-broun.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One \u2014 Paul Broun \u2014 called evolution \"lies from the pit of hell.\"", "creator": "@ed_kilgore", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/24/20-paul-broun.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Georgia Down-ballot Primary Preview", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "politics, georgia, republicans, paul broun, early and often", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "politics,georgia,republicans,paul broun,early and often", "published_time": "2016-05-24T23:09:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, politics, georgia, republicans, paul broun, early and often", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "But the catch is that Georgia requires majorities for nominations, and being knocked into a crazy-low-turnout runoff would be perilous for either incumbent.\nA wild card is that North Georgia right-wing activists have already been stirred up by the treachery of another of their own: Governor (and former ninth-district congressman) Nathan Deal, who recently vetoed a \"religious liberty\" bill aimed at making anti-LGBT discrimination easier.\nBoth Loudermilk and Collins are expected to come out on top in tonight's returns.\nSo notorious was Broun as a proud know-nothing that a significant number of write-in votes in his district were cast for Charles Darwin.\nUntil he left the House for a failed Senate bid in 2014, Broun was one of those pols who said incredible things with every other breath."}
