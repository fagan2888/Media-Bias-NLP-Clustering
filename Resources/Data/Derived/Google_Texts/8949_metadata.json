This is important work, and we\u2019re honored to have a colleague with the experience, integrity and smarts that Kim brings to this challenge.\u201d\n\nFox currently serves as president of the Tennessee Hospital Association\u2019s Tennessee Society for Healthcare Marketing & Public Relations and is a member of the Society for Healthcare Strategy & Market Development.
