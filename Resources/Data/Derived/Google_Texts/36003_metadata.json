Researchers instead are harnessing the bacteria. It\u2019s most commonly being used to treat a clostridium difficile, or C. Diff, infection that won\u2019t respond to antibiotics, with very promising early results.\n\n\u201cIf the concept of using microbes to treat disease actually works, there\u2019s a whole new field of medicine this could generate,\u201d said Lee Jones, founder and CEO of Rebiotix, a company looking to commercialize the fecal microbiome. \u201cIt allows the antibiotics we\u2019ve developed today to treat other diseases to be saved to treat those diseases and not be overused.\u201d\n\nHit the audio player above to listen to an interview with Lee Jones of Rebiotix.\n\nI looked through the FDA\u2019s clinical trial site, and it\u2019s not just C. Diff infections being studied. There are 97 open studies where fecal microbiota are being studied as a treatment. In some ways, research is like journalism: You don\u2019t know if you don\u2019t ask.\n\nHere are three conditions where fecal transplants are being studied as a possible treatment :\n\nMRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a lot like C. Diff. It\u2019s a natural bacteria, but if it becomes resistant to antibiotics, it can get bad. Researchers are looking to use the healthy bacteria in feces to treat MRSA.\n\nObesity: One study looks to transplant bacteria from a healthy, lean donor to an obese patient. It\u2019s an interesting research point. There have been some people who don\u2019t respond to diet and exercise, and much of the previous research has looked for genetics. Maybe there\u2019s a microbiome cause?Anyway, this study isn\u2019t recruiting yet.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy: This one intrigued me because it\u2019s technically a brain dysfunction. This is the confusion and altered mental status that happens when your liver doesn\u2019t filter out toxins right. What role the microbiome could play in this is beyond my comprehension. Check here for that study.\n\n-- Reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
