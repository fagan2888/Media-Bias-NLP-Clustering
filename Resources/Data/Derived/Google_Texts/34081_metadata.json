An updated report, due May 29, is now expected to show that the economy actually shrank over the first three months of the year. J.P.

As the Macroeconomic Advisers report explains, \u201cA sharp decline in net exports more than accounted for the decline in monthly GDP, as resolution to the West Coast port dispute led to a surge in imports to well above the recent trend. As a result, they write, they believe the one-month plunge \u201coverstates the underlying weakness in the economy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the economy is particularly strong, either.
