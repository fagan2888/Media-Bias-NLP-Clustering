Representing California\u2019s 12th Congressional District \u2013 arguably, the safest Democratic seat in the country \u2013 Pelosi virtually inherited her seat in Congress when her outgoing predecessor, Sala Burton, named her as a successor and instantly conveyed upon her the support of some powerful political connections. This happened in 1987 and Pelosi has run virtually unopposed ever since.\n\nPelosi, originally from Maryland, is mostly known for being the only woman to serve as Speaker of the House, for resisting calls to bring impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush and for being accused of insider trading. She is also known, however, for a number of outrageous statements, hilarious flubs, an obvious disdain for the Constitution and more than a few shameless lies. Among the unforgettable words of wisdom from Nancy Pelosi, a few that shine the brightest are now recounted:\n\nSince numerous videos recently emerged of MIT economist Jonathon Gruber telling various audiences that Obamacare \u2013 the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA), which he helped to craft and was instrumental in promoting \u2013 was really a massive redistributed tax and became law thanks to \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter,\u201d Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have been trying to pretend that they have never heard of Gruber and that he did not work on ACA. Pelosi, who personally cited Gruber\u2019s contribution in a 2009 interview, denied any knowledge of the man, during a recent press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t help write our bill.\u201d\n\nFor context, Pelosi \u2013 back in the 2009 interview \u2013 pointed out Gruber\u2019s own conclusions about healthcare rates under the proposed Democratic healthcare legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT\u2019s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange.\u201d she said at the time. Pelosi\u2019s office has offered the explanation that politicians often cite the work of various experts and that the California Democrat meant that she didn\u2019t know him personally. This seems to be quite a stretch, however, considering that Pelosi herself was very much involved with efforts to get Obamacare passed and Gruber was a frequent visitor to the White House at that time and is on video speaking, in some detail, about how the legislation would be presented to the American people.\n\nThis is not the first time Pelosi is on record, denying something that she is on record as having done or said. Appearing on Meet the Press in July, 2012, she touted the benefits of Obamacare, saying \u201cEverybody will have lower rates, better quality of care, and better access.\u201d At a press conference in 2013, when queried about the comments, she replied \u201cI don\u2019t remember saying that everybody in the country will have a lower premium.\u201d\n\nClearly, Nancy Pelosi has a serious memory problem.\n\nAnother immortal Pelosi quote was delivered in 2010, during a speech before the Legislative Conference for the National Association of Counties. Once again, expounding on the, apparently, urgent need for healthcare reform, Pelosi spoke about the proposed legislation at some length, adding the comment \u201cBut we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.\u201d Whilst her many supporters in the mainstream media have, since, attempted to brush this off by saying that it was, somehow, taken out of context, it completely goes against the spirit of all that Obama promised, when campaigning for the presidency. He often bragged that his administration would be the most transparent ever and that major legislation would be posted online first, so that Americans could consider the relative merits. None of these lofty ideals applied to Obamacare, as it turned out.\n\nIn January of 2009, when the Obama administration was trying to push through a $787 million \u2018economic stimulus\u2019 package, the situation appeared desperate; so much so that Pelosi foresaw catastrophic consequences if the bill was not passed. \u201cEvery month that we do not have an economic recovery package 500 million Americans lose their jobs,\u201d she warned. A slip of the tongue, surely; but no, as she quoted the exact same figure during an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News, that same month.\n\nNeither is Pelosi above making up fictional Bible passages. In a 2008 Earth Day news release, she decided to minister; \u201cThe Bible tells us,\u201d she explained, \u201cin the Old Testament, \u2018To minister to the needs of God\u2019s creation is an act of worship. To ignore those needs is to dishonor the God who made us.\u2019\u201d These words do not appear anywhere in the Old Testament.\n\nAppearing on Meet the Press in 2008, Pelosi decided to expound upon her vast knowledge of the energy industry and promote the use of natural gas. \u201cI believe in natural gas as a clean, cheap alternative to fossil fuels.\u201d she said, and later also pointed out that natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, \u201cis cheap, abundant and clean compared to fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nThis list of Pelosisms \u2013 memorable words of wisdom, indeed \u2013 is, by no means, complete, and Americans can look forward, no doubt, to many more. None of these quotes are new \u2013 other than her denial of Gruber \u2013 but they do bear a re-run; if only to remind the Democratic Party that their leader in the House of Representatives is either stunningly stupid, or she \u2013 like Jonathon Gruber \u2013 believes that everyone else is.\n\nOpinion by Graham J Noble\n\nSources:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nCatholic News Agency\n\nNew York Post\n\nPolitiFact\n\nThe Weekly Standard\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Incredibly, Democrats in the United States House of Representatives have chosen to re-elect Nancy Pelosi as their leader and, in order to divine how and why this could happen, it would seem fitting\u2026", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Memorable Words of Wisdom", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2014/11/nancy-pelosi-memorable-words-of-wisdom/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nancy-Pelosi-Memorable-Words-of-Wisdom-e1416357434143.jpg", "height": 330}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-19T00:38:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T00:38:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dimarkco.chandler"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nancy-Pelosi-Memorable-Words-of-Wisdom-e1416357434143.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NRSTGeeks"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde953\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe didn\u2019t help write our bill.\u201dFor context, Pelosi \u2013 back in the 2009 interview \u2013 pointed out Gruber\u2019s own conclusions about healthcare rates under the proposed Democratic healthcare legislation.\nIncredibly, Democrats in the United States House of Representatives have chosen to re-elect Nancy Pelosi as their leader and, in order to divine how and why this could happen, it would seem fitting to look back at some of Pelosi\u2019s memorable words of wisdom.\nPelosi, who personally cited Gruber\u2019s contribution in a 2009 interview, denied any knowledge of the man, during a recent press conference.\nAnother immortal Pelosi quote was delivered in 2010, during a speech before the Legislative Conference for the National Association of Counties.\nThis is not the first time Pelosi is on record, denying something that she is on record as having done or said."}
