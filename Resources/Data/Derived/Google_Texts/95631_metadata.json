ClaudiasCause/Twitter\n\nA brave 8-year-old girl shows you can never be too young to leave a mark on history. The terminal brain cancer survivor, Claudia Burkill, from the United Kingdom, has been in and out of hospitals for exactly three years. But over the weekend, her parents, Andrea and David, were told their daughter had made a miraculous recovery from metastatic pineoblastoma. Claudia is now cancer-free and no longer classed as terminally ill, becoming the first in the world to beat brain cancer.\n\nAs of 07/06/14 Claudia is no longer classed as terminal. 695 days before (13/07/12), came the terminal prognosis. pic.twitter.com/dWqZiaCZsU \u2014 Claudia's Cause (@ClaudiasCause) June 8, 2014\n\nOver the years, the Burkills were told on several occasions Claudia only had a few weeks to live and that they should start planning her funeral. However, over the weekend, an MRI scan showed Claudia is now in the clear, although she has suffered some brain damage from the treatment. \u201cA miracle has happened, it really has. I just can't stop shaking,\" said Andrea on her daughter\u2019s Facebook page \u201cClaudia\u2019s Cause.\u201d\n\nThe 8-year-old first got sick in 2011 when she began vomiting after the Burkills returned home from a holiday vacation. Initially, doctors suspected Claudia had a virus, but several tests, a lumbar puncture, and MRI later, she was diagnosed with a squint at Lincoln County Hospital, the Mirror reported. It was not until Andrea transferred her daughter to Queens Medical Centre Notthingham that doctors found the deadly metastatic pineoblastoma tumor in the center of her brain.\n\nUsually, hydrocephalus \u2014 the buildup of flood pressure within the brain \u2014 is present in patients with pineal tumors. This commonly causes headaches and nausea/vomiting, says UCLA Neurosurgery, while some patients experience difficulty looking up. Doctors only see about three to four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year, which is inoperable and has no known cure.\n\nClaudia's leg gaiters! Our latest efforts to help her stand again.

These sessions included some of the highest doses of chemotherapy ever administered to a child. This is thought to be the reason why doctors have reversed Claudia\u2019s prognosis.\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult brain tumor to treat so I am delighted that three years later Claudia has beaten the odds,\u201d said Dr. Sophie Wilne, consultant paediatric oncologist, Nottingham Post reported. Wilne confirmed the MRI scan showed no traces of the tumor. The Nottingham Children\u2019s hospital is \"really pleased and wish her and her family the best for the future.\u201d\n\nAndrea quickly took to social media to share the good news. \u201cWe had lived with a terminal diagnosis with death believed to be imminent for a crazy 694 days,\u201d Andrea wrote on the Facebook page. \u201cToday is the very first day in a very long time that I can look into the eyes of our four stunning children and \u201cknow\u201d that I don\u2019t have to plan the funeral of one of them in the very near future.\u201d She continued to say, \u201cThere are no signs of any tumor, any leptomeningeal spread or any recurrent disease, anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe Burkills are overcome with joy and hope they can spend more time with their daughter. Claudia will now be seen with a brand new blonde hairstyle, which according to Andrea, makes her look just like she did before cancer. Claudia now can join her siblings Abigail, Esme, and Zachery, and her parents, as they know they can now get through anything.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brain cancer, terminal illness, first in the world, little girl, claudia burkill", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Eight-year-old Claudia Burkill is the first in the world to survive a terminally ill brain cancer diagnosis, after doctors told parents to plan her funeral on several occasions.", "title": "Little Girl Becomes First In The World To Beat Brain Cancer [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/claudia-burkill-beats-brain-cancer-8-year-old-becomes-1st-world-survive-terminally-ill-brain-cancer", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/little-girl-first-world-beat-brain-cancer.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eight-year-old Claudia Burkill is the first in the world to survive a terminally ill brain cancer diagnosis, after doctors told parents to plan her funeral on several occasions.", "title": "Little Girl Becomes First In The World To Beat Brain Cancer [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/claudia-burkill-beats-brain-cancer-8-year-old-becomes-1st-world-survive-terminally-ill-brain-cancer", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/little-girl-first-world-beat-brain-cancer.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/12/little-girl-first-world-beat-brain-cancer.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-12T12:20:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T12:47:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Eight-year-old Claudia Burkill is the first in the world to survive a terminally ill brain cancer diagnosis, after doctors told parents to plan her funeral on several occasions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa1f\"", "article_summary": "An 8-year-old is the first in the world to survive a terminally ill brain cancer diagnosis, after doctors told parents to plan her funeral on several occasions.\nThe terminal brain cancer survivor, Claudia Burkill, from the United Kingdom, has been in and out of hospitals for exactly three years.\nClaudia is now cancer-free and no longer classed as terminally ill, becoming the first in the world to beat brain cancer.\nBut over the weekend, her parents, Andrea and David, were told their daughter had made a miraculous recovery from metastatic pineoblastoma.\nClaudia will now be seen with a brand new blonde hairstyle, which according to Andrea, makes her look just like she did before cancer."}
