A former Hall County Jail inmate allegedly punched while handcuffed by a former jailer settled for $50,000, according to his attorney.

Kendrick Goss, 35, filed a complaint in U.S District Court alleging he was punched in the stomach by Sgt. Kenny Lane on June 14, 2014.

Lane was fired by the Hall County Sheriff’s Office June 17, 2014, following the accusations and an investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

“(Goss) was not resisting any jailer, he did not present a threat to any person, and he was fully compliant with all commands when defendant Lane punched (Goss) in his body,” according to Goss’ lawsuit.

An attempt to reach Lane’s attorney, Harvey Gray, for comment was unsuccessful.

“The sheriff has not had a chance to consult with the county attorney yet regarding this settlement so we will need to confer with him before making any statements,” Hall County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Deputy Nicole Bailes wrote in an email.

The lawsuit names multiple jailers, and Goss’ attorney Mark Begnaud said the $50,000 settlement comes as a global agreement among the parties to resolve the litigation.

The jailers named in the lawsuit were Seth Tyner, Ryan Sauter, Alvin Fann, Derek Brown and Derek Arnold.

An attempt to reach those jailers’ attorney, Sun Choy, was unsuccessful.

Begnaud said his client is pleased to have resolved the litigation. Goss was moved Sept. 15 to a Department of Corrections facility for a conviction out of Franklin County for possession with the intent to distribute cocaine.

Lane served with the Sheriff’s Office for 25 years. According to the Sheriff’s Office at the time of the incident, the shift lieutenant intervened after seeing Goss punched in the abdomen.

The jail sergeant was placed on administrative leave with pay before his termination.
