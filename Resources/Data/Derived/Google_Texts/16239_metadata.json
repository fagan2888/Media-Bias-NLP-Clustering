The Graco- and Century-branded models have folding hinges that \"can pinch a child\u2019s finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard,\" reports the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, which also warns those watching children to show \"extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller.\" A free repair kit with hinge covers will be offered for affected models, which were sold through Target, Toys R Us, Walmart, Amazon, and other retail and online sites, according to Graco.\n\nRecalled models include Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling, and TravelMate model strollers and travel systems, with a manufacture date of Aug. 1, 2000, to Sept. 25, 2014. Even such a big recall might not take babies out of harm's way, though. An investigation set to air on ABC's 20/20 tonight shows that most recalled products are never brought in or fixed\u2014at best, the number hovers around 20%, at worst 5%, ABC News reports. Instead, the products stay in use or\u2014worse\u2014are listed for resale, which is illegal, according to the CPSC. ABC News found plenty of such resale items available and points out that manufacturers don't have federal minimums to meet in terms of either effort or money when it comes to recalls.
