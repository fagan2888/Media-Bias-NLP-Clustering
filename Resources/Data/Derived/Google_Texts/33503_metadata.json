Chris Christie, and Marco Rubio is backed by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. But Ted Cruz\u2019s only gubernatorial endorsement is a former mentor who\u2019s still making a name outside Texas.\n\nThe stakes for Cruz to dominate his home state on Super Tuesday are high. Texas is the crown jewel of 11 states holding primaries Tuesday, and following third-place finishes in Nevada and South Carolina, Cruz can\u2019t afford to share the state\u2019s 155 delegates as Rubio muscles toward becoming perhaps Trump\u2019s only obstacle to the nomination.\n\nSome polling suggests that Cruz\u2019s own turf may not be safe from Trump, who chose Fort Worth to announce that Christie was joining his side. But Cruz is banking on his former boss, Gov. Greg Abbott, being the bigger draw in Texas. Abbott has tried making waves in his first 15 months but denies being another Texas governor with White House ambitions.\n\nAbbott, the state\u2019s former attorney general, hired Cruz as Texas\u2019 solicitor general in 2003. He lacks the national celebrity of Christie or Haley, whose backing of Rubio before her state\u2019s primary last week was seen as helping push the Florida senator to second place.\n\nBut anything short of first in Texas would likely doom Cruz, who on Monday will campaign across the state with Abbott and bet on the governor\u2019s reputation for winning over both restless conservative activists and party standard-bearers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s exceptionally popular. Governor Abbott and Ted Cruz are the two most popular Republicans in the state,\u201d said Steve Munisteri, the former longtime chairman of the Texas Republican Party and a former adviser to Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cGovernor Abbott\u2019s been on the scene a very long time and has built a very loyal base.\u201d\n\nPolitical longevity \u2014 Abbott has climbed the ranks of elected office for 20 years \u2014 has been toxic to Republican voters in an election year fueled by anti-incumbent resentment. But Abbott\u2019s relentless suing of the Obama administration has preserved credibility among the tea party, while his even temper and experience has long won admirers with the elite GOP donor class, including some who heavily backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz\u2019s big endorsement? A Texas governor still making a name", "title": "Cruz\u2019s big endorsement?
