They offer many of the services hospitals do and allow single practitioners to share space. This is part of a larger trend in the industry, experts say.\n\n\u201cIn our analysis, the development of medical office space is changing much in the way office space has changed,\u201d said developer William Macklowe.\n\n\u201cIn the office market, people have moved to open plan seating, which allows them to use space more effectively. We are seeing a similar dynamic in medical office space. Waiting rooms are getting smaller, larger practice groups are emerging and trying to consolidate.\u201d\n\nMacklowe recently bought the 250,000 s/f office building 156 William Street and plans to turn it into a mall-type medical building, housing various medical services and practitioners.\n\nSimone Healthcare Development has a similar strategy and is currently converting a 360,000 s/f former bakery in the Bronx into medical offices, with attached retail space and a hotel. The company is also building a 93,000 s/f outpatient facility in Riverdale and is looking to convert a Long Island office building into medical space.\n\nLast week, Cure Urgent Care announced it will open its first urgent care center in New York City, with plans to open five more over the next year and a half.\n\n\u201cUrgent care will be more in demand, medical offices and sub-specialty buildings will become more prevalent,\u201d said Guy Leibler, president of Simone Healthcare Development. \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping people out of the hospital.\u201d\n\nIndicative of this trend, NYU recently proposed turning the struggling Long Island College Hospital into a medical center with several freestanding facilities.\n\nPerhaps the most-cited explanation for this shift from hospitals towards medical office buildings is technology. \u201cChanges in technology have allowed so much more healthcare to be done on an outpatient basis,\u201d said Todd Jensen, CIO of American Realty Capital\u2019s two healthcare REITs. \u201cIf you had a knee replacement 25 years ago, you had to spend a week in the hospital. Now this can be done in an outpatient facility \u2014 a far less expensive environment to treat people.\u201d\n\nARC Healthcare Trust, launched in 2011, has invested $2 billion across the U.S. Last fall, ARC launched Healthcare Trust II, which has raised $180 million so far and plans to raise another $1.75 billion by the end of the year, according to Jensen. He added that the REIT has signed a letter of intent to buy a $150 portfolio of medical buildings in upstate New York, Arizona and Indiana. Both REITs are public, non-traded and primarily target medical office buildings.\n\nApart from technological change, the boom in medical offices is also driven by the Affordable Care Act, experts say.\n\nThe law seeks to reduce healthcare costs, for example by limiting hospital visits and sourcing services out. This creates an incentive for new, more cost-effective medical office buildings. The Affordable Care Act will also give more people access to healthcare, driving up demand for medical facilities.\n\nAn aging population and the concurrent growth in certain diseases are a third factor driving the medical-office boom.\n\nTodd Jensen said that his REIT is currently investing in mezzanine debt for a Manhattan Alzheimer facility \u2014 one of the types of treatment centers that should see growing demand.\n\nNew York-based real estate fund management company Iridium Capital recently bought a renal care facility and dialysis center in Georgia.\n\nIridium\u2019s president Marilyn Kane said the time is right to invest in medical buildings. \u201cThe population is increasingly diabetic. This is a problem that wasn\u2019t as pressing in past decades,\u201d she said.\n\nKane said her investment in the facility has been highly profitable, and the triple-net nature of the lease has kept her free of certain tax and insurance responsibilities.\n\nFor investors, medical buildings can offer precious stability. \u201cIt\u2019s a needs-driven property type. Whether the economy is expanding or in recession, people continue to consume healthcare,\u201d said ARC\u2019s Todd Jensen.\n\n\u201cHealthcare tenants tend not to move very much, physicians often stay in same office for 30 years. Combined with all the demographic changes, this makes medical buildings very good investments,\u201d he added.\n\nBut there is also a downside. \u201cTo do this type of development, it does dictate the need for additional expertise,\u201d said Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics. For example, floors need to be able to withstand a certain weight, and the power supply needs to be adjusted to medical needs. William Macklowe said he is converting 156 William Street with the help of Array Architects, who specialize in medical facilities.\n\nDespite these challenges, a growing number of investors see medical offices as a good pick. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smart money that\u2019s building medical office platforms,\u201d said Dan Fasulo. \u201cThe demographics say they\u2019re going to win.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb975\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn our analysis, the development of medical office space is changing much in the way office space has changed,\u201d said developer William Macklowe.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smart money that\u2019s building medical office platforms,\u201d said Dan Fasulo.\nAcross Greater New York, new types of medical office space are springing up.\nWe are seeing a similar dynamic in medical office space.\nPerhaps the most-cited explanation for this shift from hospitals towards medical office buildings is technology."}
