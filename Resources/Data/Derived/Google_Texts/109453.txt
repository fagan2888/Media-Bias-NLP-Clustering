Music, art, literature and fashion came together on Thursday night when the Indo-American Arts Council held its 15 year anniversary gala dinner. Salman Rushdie, filmmaker Mira Nair, “Homeland” actress Sarita Choudhury, celebrity chef Madhur Jaffrey and many other celebrities were in attendance.

“It’s about sharing a high-quality of craft and story-telling,” Nair (director of such films as “The Namesake” and “Monsoon Wedding”) said of her involvement in IAAC.

IAAC, a non-profit founded with just a few members 15 years ago in New York, seeks to support all forms of Indian art, including dance, music, film, theater and fashion. The organization puts on annual film festivals and has an annual traveling contemporary Indian art exhibit.

Aroon Shivdasani, executive director and founding member of the Indo-American Arts Council, credits the group’s efforts with moving many Indian artists into the mainstream. “And now they are everywhere,” she said.

Rushdie, Nair and Dr. Manjula Bansal, Attending Pathologist at The Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, were honored for their outstanding contributions to Indian culture in North America and Dehli-based Indian designer Manish Arora showcased his fashion during the star-studded evening at the Angel Orensanz Foundation for Performing Arts in Manhattan.

“It’s been an uphill struggle, not because we don’t have wonderful artists, not because of volunteers, it’s because money is difficult to come by to support the arts,” said Shivdasani. “People don’t realize you breathe art, it’s all around you.”
