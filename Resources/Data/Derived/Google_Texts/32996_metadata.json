Offer Benefits, not Features\n\nThis is the most important thing to keep in mind when writing up the sales points of your business or products. People get sold on how a product or business can solve their problems. They don\u2019t get sold on your self-centric product features.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, though, promoting the benefits is harder than promoting the features of your product. Selling benefits means you have to identify the problems of your target audience. Then, you have to come up with how your product or service solves those problems. You have to leave the safety of jargon and technical details and venture into the real world \u2013 if you want to get the profits.\n\nTo help you understand the difference between features and benefits, here are a few examples:\n\nSelling Features:\n\nThe AcmeTikon12 has 300 gigabytes of space! Our AcmePad2000 has a 1.7GHz processor! Our AcmeWebTool\u2019s templates have over 5000 color options!\n\nSelling Benefits:\n\nThe AcmeTikon12 has enough space for 75,000 songs! Our AcmePad2000 is our fastest than ever, making browsing a cinch! We guarantee our AcmeWebTool\u2019s templates will have your business\u2019 brand colors.\n\nFeatures still have their place on your product landing pages. To cover all your bases, use your product or service\u2019s features to support the benefits to your target audience. Or translate the sexy-sounding (if somewhat obscure) feature into a concrete benefit for the consumer, like Wishpond has done below:\n\n2. Use Customer Testimonials and Reviews\n\nFace it, to most visitors to your landing page you\u2019re not exactly a trustworthy source. They recognize you\u2019re the slightest bit biased when it comes to this particular subject (your own product).\n\nSo don\u2019t sell your own product, have someone else do it for you. Since Amazon took over online selling about 20 years ago, internet users are increasingly trusting the word of their peers over any other sources.\n\nBy the way, did you know Amazon accounts for more online sales than the next 12 competitors combined? I didn\u2019t.\n\nNeedless to say, reviews have never been more important, nor have customer testimonials. Yes, visitors to your landing pages know that these testimonials come through your business, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Not only do customer testimonials function to make your audience trust your business, it gives them the assurance that someone has engaged with you before \u2013 so they\u2019re safe to do so.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from Wishpond\u2019s Facebook Sweepstakes App landing page \u2013 from our friend Josh Beaty:\n\nFor ecommerce businesses, test offering product reviews like Amazon does. A/B test stars or a 5-point system, or whatever creative method of reviewing you can think of. Be aware, though, that the review process also opens up the chance of negative feedback.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t fake reviews. If your products aren\u2019t awesome enough to earn more positive reviews than negative, pull the review tool until you\u2019ve stepped it up.\n\n3. Make it Beautiful\n\nThis should be an obvious one, but I can\u2019t tell you how many times I see an appealing product portrayed in an ugly way. Put time and effort into framing your product in the best possible light. A/B test a model with your product. A/B test the gender of your model. A/B test the colors behind your model. A/B test no model but a beautiful abstract collage that resembles a Kandinsky piece. I don\u2019t care \u2013 just make it pretty.\n\nRecommended for You Webcast: The 5 Experiments You Need to Find Product-Market Fit\n\nTo illustrate my point on the most basic level, which one of these do you think will sell better? Same sunglasses, one with a white background, one with a Johnny Depp background:\n\nBut making it beautiful isn\u2019t just about your picture.\n\nWords can also be beautiful, and the words we use can make our products just as appealing as a great picture. A quick look at the Lexus homepage and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. Head to their \u2018Automobiles\u2019 tab (notice that Lexus makes \u2018automobiles\u2019, not \u2018cars\u2019). Each class of automobiles has its own slogan, from the IS\u2019s \u2018Driving in Every Sense\u2019 to the GX\u2019s \u2018Expand your Possibilities\u2019.\n\nDo these slogans have any real relevance to the car they represent? No. But do these words create a certain desirable feeling in their reader? Absolutely.\n\nLexus also makes it a point to frame their products in terms of an ideal customer \u2013 a customer their customers want to be. For instance, their LX (SUV) \u2018enables you to venture where few others can while surrounded in unsurpassed interior comfort and refinement\u2019, which sounds like something I might want to do.\n\nWords have a huge impact on us. Of course putting your product in the best possible visual light is vital to making a sale, but don\u2019t neglect the importance of the words you use.\n\n5 Phrases that Make your Product Sound Desirable:\n\nSleek and sophisticated Pinnacle of artistry Premium technology and unparalleled innovation Reinvention of [relevant field-focused term] Faster, newer, affordable, exclusive\n\n4. Make your Landing Page Chill\n\nI was trying to think of a better word than \u2018chill\u2019 but I think it\u2019s actually the most accurate. Don\u2019t be needy. Don\u2019t be pushy. Let your product or service speak for itself through clear benefits, awesome images and appealing text. Sit back a bit.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever feeling like \u2018ol Gil in the header image up there, remember to chill \u2013 your customers will thank you.\n\nKeep a personal touch in all the written parts of your landing page. Test out framing your product or service in terms of \u2018you\u2019, or the idealized customer I referred to above.\n\nConverting should be your visitor\u2019s idea, not yours. They should be sold by the value they\u2019re receiving. When creating your optimized landing page, keep in mind the ratio of risk over reward. Is what you\u2019re offering worth what you\u2019re asking from your customer?\n\nCTAs:\n\nRemember to keep your CTAs appealing, rather than demanding. Use \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018my\u2019, \u2018free\u2019 and \u2018get\u2019. Tell people what they stand to gain, not what to do.\n\nHere are 5 appealing CTA formulas:\n\nStart your/my free [trial period] Get your/my free [focus of landing page] Increase your/my [beneficial result of your service/tool] today! Learn more today Try [service/tool] for free\n\n5. Sell the Deal, not the Product\n\nAre you one of those people who finds themselves buying things they don\u2019t need just because it\u2019s a great deal? I most definitely am (darn you IKEA). Offers and contests are my favorite strategy for lead generation and to encourage a sale (genuinely, not just because I work for a company that builds online promotional tools for small business).\n\nThe right offer is sellable simply as an offer \u2013 the product itself is actually secondary to the deal.\n\nThe best strategy for using offers is to target well with a Facebook Ad. This way, the traffic you\u2019re generating to your landing page is already half-nurtured, whether because of their interests, job title, relationship status, etc. A half-nurtured lead will be better informed of how good a deal they\u2019re getting, making conversion more likely.\n\nRemember however, deals work best as value propositions. You need to back up your offer with some substance.\n\nDon\u2019t necessarily prioritize the offer over visuals, benefits, and an awesome overall product. An offer won\u2019t always work entirely on its own. (At least, unless your deal is just insane. I mean, who hasn\u2019t brought home bean-bag chairs to their already fully-furnished tiny apartment? They were buy one get two free!)\n\nThe best strategy is to use great images, sell someone on the product, every benefit, every facet of the thing, and then wow them with the fact that this amazing, state-of-the-art, life-changing product is only $29.99 for this month only.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo that\u2019s how you sell a product without selling a product. Focus on letting it speak for itself through beautiful images, a great offer, clear and simple benefits, customer testimonials and language that appeals.Have you tried implementing any of these strategies?
