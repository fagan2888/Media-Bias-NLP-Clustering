Not because we\u2019d written anything negative about Frank previously or because we knew him to harbor ill will toward Salon. Rather, our disquiet was a byproduct of Frank\u2019s well-earned reputation for being a man who does not suffer fools gladly, even (or especially) when said fools work for the press. And reading \u201cFrank: A Life in Politics From the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage,\u201d his new memoir and the impetus for our conversation, did little to disabuse us of that notion.\n\nMaybe we caught him on an especially good day, or maybe he\u2019s found life outside the House of Representatives to agree with him; but for whatever reason, we found Frank to be different than what we\u2019d come to expect. He still flashed his talent for dry humor and his razor-sharp wit, of course. But Frank was also introspective and reflective while remaining staunchly unsentimental. Our discussion, which touches on the new book as well as Frank\u2019s thoughts about Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Ben Carson and the problem with movies like \u201cSelma,\u201d has been lightly edited for length and clarity and can be found below.\n\nAs you were writing your memoir, what audience did you have in mind? Was it for the contemporary reader or more for posterity?\n\nOh, the contemporary reader. I had two goals. My biggest single goal was to have a continuation of my public policy drive; the thing I was most trying to accomplish was to help turn around this anti-government attitude and to explain to people why we should be more supportive of government and, in particular, to explain how I think we can accomplish that, politically. I think it also has some use for LGBT people, although by now I think the notion that you can prosper in the face of prejudice is fairly widespread.\n\nTo be honest, I started out wanting to write a very political-message-type book but the people at the publisher\u2019s persuaded me that people would also like to read about my life. One of the messages I try to get across is to my allies on the left, that we would be better off if they were more disciplined. I wish Occupy acted more like the Tea Party \u2014 politically, not substantively, obviously\u2014 and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time arguing with friends on the left that these expressive demonstrations are only rarely the best way to go and that in any case, you need to get involved politically.\n\nIt\u2019s been my frustration that some of the groups I disagree with like the National Rifle Association and the Tea Party do a much better job of mobilizing and influencing the political process than the people I agree with. That was a significant part of what I was trying to get across in the book.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in these debates with your friends, are there any stances on issues that you think have changed over time among the left?\n\nYeah, the civil rights movement. At the March on Washington in 1993, Lea DeLaria said, to great applause and hilarity, isn\u2019t it wonderful that there\u2019s now a First Lady I\u2019d like to fuck? If Red Foxx had said that at the March on Washington about Jackie Kennedy 30 years earlier, he would have been physically kicked out of there.\n\nIf there\u2019s one book I wish I could get people to read, it\u2019s Taylor Branch\u2019s book about Martin Luther King. It\u2019s a great example of what a strategist he was. Today there\u2019s a movement towards an overall civil rights bill but the blacks never had that. The \u201964 civil rights bill was very important, but then came the \u201965 Voting Rights Act and then the \u201968 housing bill. Properly understood, the civil rights model is a very good one to follow, but people have this sort of romanticized, simplified version. It\u2019s the need to strategize, if you really want to change reality.\n\nWhy do you think that simplified version of history is so appealing to so many?\n\nFirst of all, you are by definition talking about issues that people feel very deeply about. These are morally compelling issues, I agree; that\u2019s why I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to deal with them! When you\u2019re motivated by some deep moral passion, you want to express that passion, and you\u2019re also dealing with conditions you believe are causing great harm to people\u2014 which is, again, accurate\u2014 and you\u2019re in a hurry to fix them. You don\u2019t want to help people slowly when they\u2019re greatly in need!\n\nThe reality can be very frustrating, too. I would say this: One of the things that\u2019s been exacerbated by the divide in our media is that people on the left do not understand the strength of the opposition we face. That is, they\u2019re inclined to think, well, this is just politicians standing in the way of overwhelming public opinion\u2014 I wish! They are frustrated when we tell them, look, we don\u2019t have the votes to do this right away and they\u2019re inclined to think we\u2019re not fully committed.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s something much more fun\u2014 in the profound sense\u2014 about this. Joining with people you agree with in this passionate demonstration of your feeling, that\u2019s much more enjoyable than trying to get votes. There\u2019s an emotionally expressive content to that. Our dirty little secret is that most political work is boring. It\u2019s bit by bit, piece by piece. Getting out there and demanding or getting yourself arrested or blocking something, that\u2019s a powerful act, but it\u2019s unfortunately much less effective.\n\nWhat do you mean by \u201cpolitical work\u201d?\n\nBy nature, the kind of political work I\u2019m talking about involved trying to move people who are not fully committed to you. You don\u2019t work on registering the voters who are already deeply motivated; they\u2019ve already registered and they\u2019re ready to vote. If you\u2019re trying to lobby legislators, you don\u2019t only lobby the legislators that are in 100 percent agreement with you. The kind of work I\u2019m talking about brings you into contact with people who are anywhere from only mildly committed to openly skeptical of you, but it\u2019s much more enriching to be with people who agree with you 100 percent and are going to tell you how wonderful you are.\n\nAre there any figures from your career that come to mind when you think of people who were able to strike the balance you\u2019re talking about?\n\nAllard Lowenstein was both a very articulate political strategist and a guy who was very forceful; Martin Luther King was an inspirational moral leader but he was also a very thoughtful strategist. Those are two examples.\n\nYou say you didn\u2019t begrudge Clinton for recognizing during his presidency that the country was still in a conservative mood. But you also say that you were unhappy with what you perceived as a lack of willingness on his part to put a plan into motion to eventually change that reality. Do you buy the narrative that\u2019s popular on the left that sees Obama as more like Reagan, more concerned with changing the trajectory?\n\nTwo things: First of all, what Reagan was preaching to people was, here\u2019s the deal: I can cut your taxes and you won\u2019t feel any losses. I can give you more and more and you\u2019ll have to do less and less. Reagan never asked people do to anything that wasn\u2019t wildly popular.\n\nAs far as Obama is concerned, I think his problem is that he\u2019s well-intentioned but he underestimated how vehemently right-wing the Republicans have become. He\u2019s finally overcome that, which you can see in his recent budget; he\u2019s doing the right thing, but it took him longer than it should\u2019ve. In fairness to him, we\u2019ve never in American history had a party so in control of such an ideologically extreme faction.\n\nHow might his presidency have looked if he had realized that sooner?", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the biggest political personalities of our time tells Salon about his new memoir and his theory of change", "title": "\u201cRepublicans are getting worse\u201d: Barney Frank unloads on GOP bigotry \u2014 and Obama\u2019s mistakes", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "One of the biggest political personalities of our time tells Salon about his new memoir and his theory of change", "title": "\u201cRepublicans are getting worse\u201d: Barney Frank unloads on GOP bigotry \u2014 and Obama\u2019s mistakes", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/17/republicans_are_getting_worse_barney_frank_unloads_on_gop_bigotry_and_obamas_mistakes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/barney_frank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the biggest political personalities of our time tells Salon about his new memoir and his theory of change", "title": "\u201cRepublicans are getting worse\u201d: Barney Frank unloads on GOP bigotry \u2014 and Obama\u2019s mistakes", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/barney_frank.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barney Frank, Ben Carson, Dodd-Frank, Elizabeth Warren, Financial Reform, Healthcare Reform, Hillary Rodham Clinton, LGBT", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0795\"", "article_summary": "If you\u2019re trying to lobby legislators, you don\u2019t only lobby the legislators that are in 100 percent agreement with you.\nThese are morally compelling issues, I agree; that\u2019s why I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to deal with them!\nOur dirty little secret is that most political work is boring.\nBy nature, the kind of political work I\u2019m talking about involved trying to move people who are not fully committed to you.\nWhat do you mean by \u201cpolitical work\u201d?"}
