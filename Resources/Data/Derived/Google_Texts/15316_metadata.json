Tammy Baldwin Tammy BaldwinSenate panel passes 4.5B defense bill Dem introduces bill to block new government hacking powers The Trail 2016: The campaign that never sleeps MORE (D-Wis.) and Jeff Merkley Jeff MerkleyHonor Frank Lautenberg by protecting our kids Dems discuss dropping Wasserman Schultz Sanders pans chemical safety reform deal MORE (D-Ore.) unveiled the bill Thursday, which they say will make it harder for activist hedge funds to take over a business, make deep cuts to its operations to reap a short-term profit and then unload it for failure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bill marks the latest attempt to crack down on Wall Street by Democratic lawmakers, and is also backed by Sens.(I-Vt.) and(D-Mass.), two of that sector\u2019s biggest critics.\n\nThe measure primarily boosts disclosure requirements for hedge funds investing in other companies, making it more difficult for a group of funds to team up to buy out a company and take it over without anyone noticing.\n\nThe legislation is dubbed the \u201cBrokaw Act,\u201d after a town in Wisconsin that saw its paper mill go out of business after hedge funds stepped in as investors. Hundreds of people lost their jobs, and critics charge investors demanded short-term gains like stock buybacks ahead of long-term company growth.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow our economy to be hijacked by a small group of investors who seek only to enrich themselves at the expense of workers, taxpayers and communities,\u201d said Baldwin.\n\nOne of the main thrusts of the bill is to make it more difficult for investment firms to form loose allies, or \u201cwolf packs,\u201d to swoop in and effectively take over a company by buying up that company\u2019s shares.\n\nUnder the bill, companies that make significant investments in other companies would have to more quickly disclose those investments \u2014 the lawmakers argue that quicker disclosure would prevent investors from \u201ctipping\u201d each other to the opportunity and building up an alliance.\n\nAnother change under the bill is aimed at rooting out these packs. Under current law, a person or group only has to disclose an investment in a company if it exceeds 5 percent of total shares. But the senators charge that informal investor groups can invest significantly more in a company as a group, but with individual investments that fall below the disclosure requirement. Their bill would treat that group\u2019s investment as a single investment, requiring public disclosure.\n\nAnd the bill would also boost disclosure requirements around derivatives, in an effort to prevent investors from buying into a company and making secret side investments that that company\u2019s value would fall, allowing them to turn a profit by worsening the company they invested in.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A pair of Senate Democrats have set their sights on hedge fund \u201cwolf packs\u201d they say take over businesses to kill them and reap a profit.", "description": "A pair of Senate Democrats have set their sights on hedge fund \u201cwolf packs\u201d they say take over businesses to kill them and reap a profit.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A pair of Senate Democrats have set their sights on hedge fund \u201cwolf packs\u201d they say take over businesses to kill them and reap a profit.", "title": "Dem senators take aim at hedge fund 'wolf packs'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/273383-dem-senators-take-aim-at-hedge-fund-wolf-packs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-17T11:42:34-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-17T11:42-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/273383-dem-senators-take-aim-at-hedge-fund-wolf-packs", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-17T10:48-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-17T10:48:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17T11:42:34-04:00"}, "keywords": "Hedge fund,Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Tammy Baldwin, Jeff Merkley,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/273383-dem-senators-take-aim-at-hedge-fund-wolf-packs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A pair of Senate Democrats have set their sights on hedge fund \u201cwolf packs\u201d they say take over businesses to kill them and reap a profit.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dem senators take aim at hedge fund 'wolf packs'"}, "dcterms.title": "Dem senators take aim at hedge fund 'wolf packs'"}, "article_summary": "A pair of Senate Democrats have set their sights on hedge fund \u201cwolf packs\u201d they say take over businesses to kill them and reap a profit.\nThe legislation is dubbed the \u201cBrokaw Act,\u201d after a town in Wisconsin that saw its paper mill go out of business after hedge funds stepped in as investors.\nTheir bill would treat that group\u2019s investment as a single investment, requiring public disclosure.\nADVERTISEMENTThe bill marks the latest attempt to crack down on Wall Street by Democratic lawmakers, and is also backed by Sens.(I-Vt.)\nHundreds of people lost their jobs, and critics charge investors demanded short-term gains like stock buybacks ahead of long-term company growth."}
