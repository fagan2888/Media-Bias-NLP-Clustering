But maybe he should have.\n\nThis month marks Dodd-Frank\u2019s fourth anniversary. And as with many anniversaries, it sparks the question: What has changed? The answer is plenty, and not for the better. The president continues to sing Dodd-Frank\u2019s praises. He recently called it \u201can unfinished piece of business\u201d that nevertheless has achieved some \u201cimportant stabilization functions.\u201d But that\u2019s just putting a brave face on it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse Republicans delivered their own birthday present last Monday in the form of a new report that outlines the law\u2019s failure to achieve one of its main stated goals\u2014to end bailouts for large, \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial firms.\n\nNow even lawmakers from Obama\u2019s own party see this \u201cfinancial reform\u201d legislation is more like a destabilizing force\u2014much like the Obamacare health insurance \u201creform.\u201d This is fitting, considering the two laws\u2019 many unfortunate similarities.\n\nBoth Obamacare and Dodd-Frank clocked in at about 2,500 pages and were rammed through a Democrat-controlled House and Senate at breakneck speed.\n\nAlso as with Obamacare, Dodd-Frank\u2019s unintended consequences began to surface almost immediately. First, there was a sharp reduction in free checking due to price controls on debit card transactions. Then community banks and credit unions \u2013 including some with close to zero foreclosures \u2013 found the laws\u2019 \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rules so costly and complex that they slowed or altogether stopped issuing new mortgages. And a provision with no plausible connection to sound banking and finance forced domestic manufacturers to scour their supply chains for \u201cconflict minerals\u201d from the Congo.\n\nBut the latest unintended consequence may bear the most striking similarity to Obamacare. Turns out that if you like your life, home, and auto insurance, you probably can\u2019t keep them after all. Here\u2019s why.\n\nDodd-Frank regulates many insurance companies as if they were banks. Under the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of an amendment sponsored by Republican Sen. Susan Collins Susan CollinsGOP lawmaker: 'Republicans were wrong\u2019 to block Garland Senate passes broad spending bill with .1B in Zika funds Senators unveil bill to overhaul apprenticeship programs MORE (R-Maine), insurance companies with a small thrift\u2014or even without any banking component but deemed \u201csystemically important\u201d by Dodd-Frank\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2014will face the same capital standards as banks.\n\nBoth banks and insurers face risks, but they operate under very different business models. Typically, banks make short-term payouts on deposits for millions of customers. Insurers, by contrast, pay claims for just a fraction of policyholders, or in the case of life insurance, pay out after years or decades.\n\nConsequently, insurance firms, with the oversight of state regulators, have designed portfolios that contain high-quality corporate bonds and some blue-chip stocks to build up reserves in the event of a catastrophic loss. Yet banks, with primary assets of loans, are limited to a small number of corporate bonds and virtually no stocks to meet their capital requirements.\n\nImposing bank capital standards on insurers would raise costs for life insurance consumers by $5 billion to $8 billion, according to the economic consulting firm Oliver Wyman. These costs could hit policy holders both through higher premiums and reduced benefits. And some policies simply could become unavailable as insurers \u201cexit certain product lines,\u201d the Oliver Wyman study found.\n\nWorse, such bank-like standards would likely heighten risks instead of making insurers safer, according to risk management professionals. A letter to Congress from the American Academy of Actuaries warns that forcing insurers to follow bank capital rules \u201cassigns risks to insurers that are not necessarily significant to them\u201d and \u201cunderstates risks that may be more significant to insurers than to entities such as banks.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that the Democrat-controlled Senate, perhaps chastened by the experience of Obamacare, recently passed, by a unanimous vote, a bill to provide relief from these Dodd-Frank provisions. The Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270), which the Senate passed on June 3, would revise Dodd-Frank by clarifying that the Collins Amendment does not apply bank capital rules to insurance firms. Sen. Collins was one of the cosponsors.\n\n\n\nFor this anniversary of Dodd-Frank, the House should consider passing the Senate bill exactly as written. For once, they would do well to take the advice of Sen.
