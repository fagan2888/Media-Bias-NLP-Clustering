A newcomer to a suddenly potent lineup. A stingy pitching staff. The Washington Nationals are finding it\u2019s not so easy playing at Citi Field anymore.\n\nThey could find themselves out of sole possession of first place, too, if they don\u2019t figure out a way to break though against these new-look New York Mets.\n\nWashington wasted an early two-run lead Saturday night, losing, 3-2, to New York behind Lucas Duda\u2019s two home runs and a tie-breaking double.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve come to play the Mets and they\u2019ve had a packed stadium. It\u2019s good for baseball. It makes it fun,\u201d Jayson Werth said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it adds any pressure or anything like that. It just makes it for an exciting night of baseball and a good atmosphere. We welcome the challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals ran off 12 consecutive wins at Citi Field, a streak that ended last September. The Mets have won the first two games in this series to secure a home series win against Washington for the first time since April 21, 2013.\n\nWith their second consecutive late win, the Mets moved one game behind Washington in the National League East with one game remaining in the series.\n\nPlaying for the first time since being acquired from Detroit on Friday at the non-waiver trade deadline, Yoenis Cespedes was walked by left-handed reliever Matt Thornton (1-1) to face Duda, a lefty, even though Duda had already hit two home runs off Joe Ross and has been on a recent tear.\n\n\u201cWe have confidence in [Thornton] every time he faces a lefty,\u201d Nationals manager Matt Williams said. \u201cYou get an opportunity to get him back in there tomorrow, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWith 42,996 fans on their feet and cheering, Duda drove a 1-2 pitch the opposite way to left field that short-hopped the wall. Curtis Granderson, who doubled leading off the inning, scored to put New York ahead.\n\nNew York fell behind in the first on Ian Desmond\u2019s two-run single off Jacob deGrom, tiring the Mets all-star with long at-bats in a 31-pitch inning. But deGrom held the Nationals through six innings, even without his best fastball.\n\nHansel Robles (3-2) struck out Bryce Harper and Werth in the eighth for the win.\n\nJeurys Familia was perfect in the ninth for his 28th save, striking out Michael Taylor with the elated crowd stand and chanting \u201cLet\u2019s go Mets!\u201d for the final out.\n\nRoss held New York without a hit until Duda sent a shot to center field with two outs in the fourth. Duda then hot a home run to left field leading off the seventh for his eighth longball in seven days.\n\n\u201cBoth home runs, they were OK pitches, I wouldn\u2019t say down the middle by any means.\u201d Ross said. \u201cI guess I kind of learned my lesson, be a little bit more careful next time. He had a helluva game.\u201d\n\nFour days earlier, Duda hit one of his three home runs in the game against the Padres off Ross\u2019 brother, Tyson Ross.\n\nJoe Ross allowed only two other hits in 6 1/3 innings.\n\n\u201cThose guys are filthy \u2014 two pretty exceptional pitchers,\u201d Duda said.\n\nCespedes batted third and received a polite standing ovation when he came to the plate in the first. He grounded out in his first two at-bats, but he got a rise out of the crowd in the sixth when he hit a long flyball to left that went foul. He struck out and finished 0-for-3 with the walk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Duda hit a home run in the fourth inning and another in the seventh as the Mets climbed to within one game of the Nationals in the National League East with a 3-2 victory at Citi Field.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Duda hit a home run in the fourth inning and another in the seventh as the Mets climbed to within one game of the Nationals in the National League East with a 3-2 victory at Citi Field.", "title": "Lucas Duda hits two home runs as Mets defeat Nationals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/2/lucas-duda-hits-two-home-runs-mets-beat-nationals/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/6d2bbf8d70eae9227d0f6a706700066f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/6d2bbf8d70eae9227d0f6a706700066f.jpg", "description": "Duda hit a home run in the fourth inning and another in the seventh as the Mets climbed to within one game of the Nationals in the National League East with a 3-2 victory at Citi Field.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Lucas Duda hits two home runs as Mets defeat Nationals"}, "Author": "Howie Rumberg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Lucas Duda, New York, New York Mets, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09f1\"", "article_summary": "They could find themselves out of sole possession of first place, too, if they don\u2019t figure out a way to break though against these new-look New York Mets.\nThe Washington Nationals are finding it\u2019s not so easy playing at Citi Field anymore.\nHe had a helluva game.\u201dFour days earlier, Duda hit one of his three home runs in the game against the Padres off Ross\u2019 brother, Tyson Ross.\nWashington wasted an early two-run lead Saturday night, losing, 3-2, to New York behind Lucas Duda\u2019s two home runs and a tie-breaking double.\nRoss held New York without a hit until Duda sent a shot to center field with two outs in the fourth."}
