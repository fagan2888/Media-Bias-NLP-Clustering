The fashion school she is enrolled in is almost two hours from her parents\u2019 house in Orange County, and she still doesn\u2019t have a valid driver\u2019s license.\"\n\nTrue, she doesn't have a valid driver's license, but isn't she going to be escorted to and from her classes?\n\nSo\u2026if she has escorts, they'll be able to drive her? But we will admit, two hours is a long drive for school!\n\nThe source also acknowledged that Mandy is still seeing her doctors for therapy, saying:\n\n\u201cYes, she is still seeing her doctors on an outpatient basis, but this is all happening way too fast and too soon. Amanda should be eased back into her life in a controlled manner, because she is dealing with a very serious health diagnosis. Why does she need to enroll now in school? It would be ideal if she waited six months to a year.\u201d\n\nOkay, to be honest, we were a little shocked when we saw that she was enrolled and ready to go at FIDM.\n\nMaybe Mandy just thinks she's up for the challenge and is ready to dive back into society!\n\nAnd the drama continues\u2026\n\n[Image via WENN.]\n\nTags: amanda bynes, challenge, doctors, drama, education, fashion, fidm, go back, mental health, pressure, rehab, sad, school", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amanda Bynes' doctors think she should head back to rehab??", "title": "Amanda Bynes Told To Put Down The Backpack & Head Back Into Rehab By Her Doctors?!", "og": {"url": "http://perezhilton.com/2013-12-07-amanda-bynes-rehab-fashion-school-go-back-ill-advised", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wenn5364228(1)__oPt.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 675}, "type": "article", "description": "Amanda Bynes' doctors think she should head back to rehab??", "title": "Amanda Bynes Told To Put Down The Backpack & Head Back Into Rehab By Her Doctors?!"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PerezHilton", "description": "Amanda Bynes' doctors think she should head back to rehab??", "card": "summary", "title": "Amanda Bynes Told To Put Down The Backpack & Head Back Into Rehab By Her Doctors?!"}, "botify-site-verification": "f4noNRNmylRngbEW7tfdgZWcCimPVmeG", "p": {"domain_verify": "1236f683124f133aa3dbeb8727141b29"}, "fb": {"app_id": 519028218124180}, "keywords": "celebrity gossip, Hollywood gossip, juicy celebrity rumors, Perez Hilton, Mario Lavandeira, celebrity blog", "msvalidate.01": "7194517B76439A893EB37CE8733FCBAE", "google-site-verification": "qglU8HAcnf57Vs2kL70RP4fzNl6V7Wwhk-5Imy9jeOU", "news_keywords": "amanda bynes, rehab, mental health, sad, drama, challenge, school, fidm, fashion, education, go back, doctors, pressure,", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 7 Dec 2013 13:33:28 EST"}, "article_summary": "Tags: amanda bynes, challenge, doctors, drama, education, fashion, fidm, go back, mental health, pressure, rehab, sad, school\nAmanda Bynes just got out of rehab, is back spending time with her loving family and friends and now her doctors are saying she should go back?\nA source is claiming that Amanda's doctors are saying her return to school is a little too soon for the actress.\n\u201cThere will be pressure on Amanda as far as school work, deadlines, and it\u2019s unlikely she will be able to succeed.\nThe fashion school she is enrolled in is almost two hours from her parents\u2019 house in Orange County, and she still doesn\u2019t have a valid driver\u2019s license.\""}
