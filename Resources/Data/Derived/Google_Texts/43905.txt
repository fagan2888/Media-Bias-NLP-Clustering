The once teen heartthrob has a knack for storytelling that makes this a page turner. A few tidbits:

Jewel refused him an on-screen kiss during an episode of "The Lyon's Den." The chaste kiss ended with her wiping a hand across her mouth in disgust.

At 18, he was invited to the Playboy Mansion. It was not a chaste experience.

He hid behind a newspaper as he cried on the plane taking his oldest son to college.

Warren Beatty clued him into his then girlfriend's activities in an ultra-cool way.

He got ousted as a youth coach, mostly for having the audacity to keep score during games.

Les Moonves of CBS talked him out of a role on ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" in favor of the doomed "Dr. Vegas"

He could have hooked up with Madonna but blew it when he refused to dance first. He described her as having "flawless skin and eyes that imparted secrets."

Most of "Love Life" is dedicated to lessons learned from his two sons and wife. Those recollections shuck off the celebrity skin and embrace the every person's experience.

Lowe relishes his role of dad — coaching basketball, chaperoning field trips and pulling pranks during camping trips. He never speaks about the hardships of celebrity parenting, recognizing all parenting is tough work.

This is where he connects with readers. His self-effacing humor keeps the pace brisk.

When explaining the parent drama during his youth coaching days, he said, "I haven't felt such tension and disapproval since I sang with Snow White at the Oscars."

When it comes to his wife of more than 20 years, women will swoon. In the sweetest of words, he writes love letters disguised as chapters.

Sobriety remains a priority in life, noting his sons have always known him this way.

Compared to his first book, this offering gives more about the current state of the entertainment business and his approach to acting.

Lowe encourages taking chances and doing the unexpected, like his role as Dr. Jack Startz in HBO's "Behind the Candelabra."

Writing biographical books is also a challenging stretch for an artist and one Lowe does well.
