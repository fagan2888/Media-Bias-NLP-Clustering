Jim Webb, who is waging a long-shot bid for president, acknowledged Sunday that he is out of step with his own Democratic Party but vowed that he will connect with working-class Americans.\n\n\u201cThe party has moved way far to the left. And that\u2019s not my Democratic Party,\u201d Mr. Webb said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe need to bring working people back into the formula.\u201d\n\nHe said that he would be a voice for poor and working-class Americans who had been forgotten by the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nHe invited Fox News to cover a medial clinic for people without medial insurance next weekend at a fairgrounds in remote southwest Virginia.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to take care of about 6,000, at least, if historical records hold, people with no medical care,\u201d said Mr. Webb. \u201cThey\u2019ll pull 3,000 teeth. And these are people forgotten by both parties. And I think they need a voice.\n\nMr. Webb, a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War, novelist and former secretary of the Navy, was a Republican but switched parties over his opposition to the Iraq war to win an upset victory in the 2006 U.S. Senate race in Virginia.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Webb demonstrated his independent streak by breaking with President Obama over the administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran, its strategy to combat the terrorist army known as Islamic State and its policy for not arming Ukraine to fight Russian-backed separatists.\n\nOn Iran, Mr. Webb said he agrees with the stance of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.\n\nEarlier on the show, Mr. McConnell blasted the Iran negotiations that are nearing completion in Vienna.\n\n\u201cWe already know that it\u2019s going to leave Iran as a threshold nuclear state. We know that,\u201d said Mr. McConnell. \u201cIt appears as if the administration\u2019s approach to this was to reach whatever agreement the Iranians are willing to enter into.\u201d\n\nThe Senate leader said that it would be a \u201chard sell\u201d to get the deal approved by his chamber.\n\nMr. Webb said he, too, would be hesitant to back the deal that\u2019s coming together in Vienna.\n\n\u201cI agree a lot with what Senator McConnell just said, that what we do not want to do at this point is to send a signal to the region that we are accepting the notion that eventually Iran would be acquiring nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are other ways that we can improve relations with Iran, confidence building gestures as we did with the Soviet Union over many years. Just that you don\u2019t have to have this deal in order to move forward with them. But, you know, they seem pretty optimistic this morning from Europe. So, we\u2019ll see what they bring to the table,\u201d said Mr. Webb.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Webb, who is waging a long-shot bid for president, acknowledged Sunday that he is out of step with his own Democratic Party but vowed that he will connect with working-class Americans.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jim Webb, who is waging a long-shot bid for president, acknowledged Sunday that he is out of step with his own Democratic Party but vowed that he will connect with working-class Americans.", "title": "Jim Webb confronts leftists: \u2018Not my Democratic Party\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/12/jim-webb-confronts-leftists-not-my-democratic-part/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/03/6c79157a774c121d7b0f6a706700dc8d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/03/6c79157a774c121d7b0f6a706700dc8d.jpg", "description": "Jim Webb, who is waging a long-shot bid for president, acknowledged Sunday that he is out of step with his own Democratic Party but vowed that he will connect with working-class Americans.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Jim Webb confronts leftists: \u2018Not my Democratic Party\u2019"}, "Author": "S.A.
