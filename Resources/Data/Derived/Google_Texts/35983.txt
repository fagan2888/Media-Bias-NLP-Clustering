The sign at the entrance of the Wichita Union Rescue Mission says 'Wise men came to a shelter 2000 years ago.' Those wise men brought gifts to the Christ child. With that in mind on this Christmas Eve local Muslims brought gifts as a peace gesture to the Christian ministry.

Mahmood Karim, who helped organize the collection, explained the peace gesture saying, "We just want to make Wichita feel comfortable that we are the citizens of Wichita, in particular, and of the United States, in general."

Karim says Muslims have suffered a negative backlash after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino with some saying, "Muslims are bad. They profile them as being terrorists. That's totally wrong."

He says it is time Muslims break their silence and speak up about the stereotyping. "We're all brothers. We're all creations of same God. And we are here to help them celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ."

So several members of the Wichita Muslim community including students from WSU and Wichita schools brought clothes, toys and food to the Union Rescue.

Syeda Nabeela is a WSU junior who helped with the gift collections saying, "This is a time for everyone to just come together.. eat and just live.. just enjoy life. It's not about Christianity. It's not about Buddism. It's not about Islam. We are all taught peace."

Union Rescue Mission's Executive Director Denny Bender says he welcomes the gifts saying they will help the homeless in Wichita.
