It\u2019s clobbering workers and roiling union negotiations across the country.\n\nThe growing uproar over this tax may even present an opportunity for Republicans in Congress to woo enough Democratic votes to pass changes to ObamaCare and overcome President Obama\u2019s likely veto.\n\nAs far back as 2009, the president said he wanted to penalize \u201cfancy plans that end up driving up costs.\u201d The Affordable Care Act slapped a 40 percent tax on these plans, starting in 2018.\n\nYet it\u2019s not just fancy people who have these plans. Over the years, countless blue-collar and union workers have opted for these generous benefits instead of wage hikes.

Chris Christie reminded constituents that it was Obama \u2014 \u201cnot the Republican governor of New Jersey\u201d \u2014 who labeled the state\u2019s health benefits as \u201ca Cadillac plan.\u201d\n\nHere in New York, Mayor de Blasio is evading the issue as he negotiates contracts with the major municipal unions.
