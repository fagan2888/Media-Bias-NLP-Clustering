As WKSU\u2019s M.L. Schultze reports, that\u2019s not just because those candidates have been spending all their time in New Hampshire.\n\nPolitical thoughts from the B&K\n\nEditor's note: We\u2019ll be checking back with the B& K regularly though the 2016 election. And though this presidential field may seem more crowded than in years\u2019 past, you can check at the bottom of this story to find some surprising parallels with the election of 1996.\n\nIt's the economy and healthcare -- again\n\nThe B&K restaurant is unusually quiet the morning after the Superbowl, though the first set of regulars are in their booths at 6:30, and most of the rest stroll in during the next hour or so. The waitress pours from a bottomless pot of coffee \u2013 that and a full breakfast can still come in at about 5 bucks or so.\n\nThat\u2019s not a whole lot more than when I reported from here back in the 90s. We picked the B&K back then to talk about issues during presidential election years because the family-owned restaurant was in the middle of the swing township \u2013 Perry -- in the swing county \u2013 Stark \u2013 in the swing state \u2013 Ohio.\n\nOver and over back then, people cited two issues key to their lives: The economy and healthcare.\n\nAnd neither of those concerns has gone away.\n\nWendy Smith steps out from the kitchen to fill a tall mug with coffee and stops to chat with a customer at the counter. She hasn\u2019t had much sleep lately.\n\n\u201cShe tried to stand yesterday. She thought she could stand. She fell. She\u2019s strong willed.\u201d\n\nThat's because her sister had a stroke two weeks ago -- and has no health insurance.\n\n\u201cI was more worried about her than thinking health insurance. But now that we\u2019re together mentally, you\u2019re like \u2018OK, how are we going to deal with this?\u2019 That\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d\n\nStill, she told sister not to worry about it: \u201c\u2019Don\u2019t worry about nothing, just get better, that\u2019s what you have to do.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was supposed to have resolved this.\n\nA powerless or too powerful government?\n\nBut to Bill Daar, the solutions promised by politicians are too often part of accelerating problems that government can\u2019t or won\u2019t do anything about.\n\nHe retired from the Timken Company after 30 years, in the days before outside shareholders forced the steel and bearing icon to split into two. He sees himself as one of the lucky ones.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta work under 30 hours. So people gotta hold two jobs. That means the school children especially, they don\u2019t have two parents at home or anybody to help them; usually it\u2019s a single-family home and education suffers...\u201d\n\n\u200bDefensive disinterest\n\nDaar is not exactly one of this year\u2019s much-talked-about angry voters.\n\nFor him, it\u2019s more of a defensive disinterest. Politics and government and the people who populate them are a collective \u201cthey\u201d and he\u2019s tuning it all out \u2013 at least until it gets closer to the primary.\n\n\u201cI got so sick of being lied to I quit listening to TV.\u201d\n\nJeff Greenfelder says he, too, is waiting awhile before he tunes in.\n\n\u201cThey have a tendency to talk around issues and not really tell you what they truly believe in. They want to try to tell you what you want to hear rather than what specifically they are going to do.\u201d\n\nNational issues, perhaps local solutions\n\nGreenfelder is a retired anatomy and physiology teacher \u2013 and his students included Brad and Karen Miller \u2013 who bought the restaurant from the original B and K more than 10 years ago\n\nIn rapid succession, Greenfelder gives a history of Stark County\u2019s economy:\n\n\u201cThis county for so many years relied upon steel and associated industries. People like the Hoover Co., which is basically not making any sweepers in this country any more....\u201d\n\nAn international comparison of healthcare:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Norway, which is a socialistic country. They do very well. They pay for all their medication, all their education, everything. But they only have 5 million people in the country. And they have North Coast oil. ...\u201d\n\nAnd an examination of Middle East policies:\n\n\u201cWe have spent huge amounts of money and we\u2019re losing lives and we have gained nothing by it. The reason we have problems with ISIS, the Taliban etc. is we\u2019re interfering their countries and they don\u2019t like that. ...\u201d\n\nBut he says many problems \u2013 from drug addition to education to family support -- are closer to home \u2013 and so are the solutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made such a big deal out of it. The press has made such a big deal out of it that we throw up our hands and say, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u2019 But there is and it has to start at the grass roots level.\u201d\n\nStill, Greenfelder and some of the others promise they\u2019ll tune in more to the presidential candidates after voters in New Hampshire and some of the states have done some winnowing for them. Then they stop and add that they hope one candidate is not winnowed out before Ohio gets its say ... Gov. John Kasich.\n\nThink back to the election of 1996...\n\nOhio voters back in 1996 had lots of choices to make in the March primary. And some may seem familiar in name or at least in biography.\n\nThere was a Clinton, a very wealthy businessman, and a socially conservative African American. Here\u2019s the rundown and their vote totals:\n\nDemocratic\n\nClinton, Bill D 713,153 91.84\n\nLaRouche, Lyndon H., Jr. D 63,377 8.16\n\nTotal Party Votes: 776,530\n\nRepublican\n\nDole, Bob R 640,954 66.53\n\nBuchanan, Patrick J.
