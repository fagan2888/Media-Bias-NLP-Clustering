Governor Pat McCrory attended an anniversary celebration for a Kinston dishwasher plant today.

Electrolux held a special celebration to commemorate the 25th anniversary of its plant in Kinston.

Over 30 employees who have worked at the plant since it opened in 1989 were recognized for their contributions.

McCrory was joined by Jack Truong, president and CEO of Electrolux Major Appliances North America.

More than 600 full time and contract employees work at the 463,000-square-foot plant, which is known for introducing the industry-leading Frigidaire Gallery Orbit Clean Dishwasher in 2012.

The Charlotte-based Electrolux currently employs nearly 1,500 people across the state.

â€œThe Kinston dishwasher plant has made a tremendous impact not only on the city of Kinston but the entire state of North Carolina," said Governor Pat McCrory. "I am very appreciative of the hard work and dedication of the Kinston plant employees who have made this venture such a success. I am honored to be part of their 25th Anniversary celebration."
