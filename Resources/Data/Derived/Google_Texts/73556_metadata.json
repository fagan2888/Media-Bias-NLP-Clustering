A policewoman was also killed.\n\nIsabelle Soller, 52, carried a sign that said \u201cJe suis Charlie, I am Jewish.\u201d\n\nSoller said she grew up in the neighborhood where the kosher market is located. The assault on the market was an obvious attack on Jews, Soller said.\n\n\u201cI grew up with Charlie Hebdo,\u201d she said of the magazine, which was known for satire that mocked all forms of authority. \u201cI always thought that it was very offensive. But whether I approve or not, I like the fact that they were without mercy for everyone.\u201d\n\nAl-Qaeda\u2019s branch in Yemen said it directed Wednesday\u2019s attack against the publication Charlie Hebdo to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly\u2019s satire, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t kill in the name of religion,\u201d said Bernadette Barbier Toulouse, 55.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee\n\nSolidarity rally.
