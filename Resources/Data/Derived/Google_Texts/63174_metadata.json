The debate about curbing tax increases to create a possible \u2018healthcare district\u2019 is heated \u2013 but all the local hospitals have been quietly paying millions each year since 2013 to help the county leverage matching federal funding for uncompensated care.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been a tremendously beneficial program for not just Hidalgo County but the entire border region,\u201d Carlos Zaffirini Jr. president of Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, an Austin-based consulting company for the healthcare industry, told commissioners during the meeting.\n\nThe program is called the Local Provider Participation Fund and it was created in 2013, when legislation carried by State Sen. Juan \u201cChuy\u201d Hinojosa was signed by the governor.\n\nHidalgo County collects $20,000 each year of the payments for administrative fees, as permitted by law.\n\nFor example, Doctors Hospital at Renaissance is set to pay $419 million in 2016 \u2013 or 6 percent of its net patient revenue that was calculated in 2010. Likewise, Edinburg Regional Medical Center is set to pay $361 million; Mission Regional Medical Center, $115 million; and Rio Grande Regional $181 million. Knapp Medical Center is mandated to pay $128 million.\n\nIts CEO, Bill Adams \u2013 who announced his resignation lasr week \u2013 was the treasurer of a political action committee dedicated to the passage of the hospital district.\n\nWhen contacted directly, local hospitals deferred comments to Zaffrini.\n\n\u201cAs Hidalgo County\u00b9s safety-net hospitals, our mission is to improve access, affordability, delivery and funding for quality healthcare services,\u201d according to a statement.\n\nAbout five years ago, Hidalgo County was eligible for about $820 million worth of what is called 1115 Medicaid waiver funding, but the program requires a local match and the county didn\u2019t have enough in its tax base to cover it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, because of our county\u00b9s lack of financial resources, our safety-net could access only approximately 13 percent of the funds made available,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nInstead, the new law allowed some leverage from hospitals through this fund. The Medicaid waiver currently supports $602 million worth of healthcare access between 78 different programs including local clinics like the Hope Clinic.\n\nBut healthcare programs are not the equivalent of health insurance, and while hospitals may write off millions each year in charity care, patients are still expected to pay the bill for medical care whether they are underinsured or lack any coverage.\n\nINDIGENT CARE\n\nSeparately, Hidalgo County is required to set aside up to 8 percent of its general fund to help pay its indigent care program. For the FY 2016 budget, commissioners are considering to set aside about $5.5 million for the 1115 waiver program. After it\u2019s multiplied by federal funds, the program has about $12.8 million to operate.\n\nThere are about 10,000 applicants each year for the indigent care program that covers about $30,000 worth of medical services for eligible individuals, but only about 5,000 are enrolled.\n\n\u201cTheoretically those other 5,000 that did not qualify show up at the hospital and say, \u2018I don\u2019t have insurance,\u201d and those people become part of the \u2018uncompensated care\u2019 costs,\u201d said Eddie Olivarez, chief administrative officer for the Hidalgo County health department.\n\nThe county\u2019s share has shifted over the years, from its peak of $9 million in 2014 to only $6 million in 2015. In 2014, that $9 million contribution, including matching dollars, meant the county had $21 million to spend on local healthcare programs, but it only spent $10 million.\n\nWhen the \u2018healthcare district\u2019 was presented on the November 2014 ballot, most residents reacted to concerns about the potential for a significant tax increase \u2013 voted it down \u2013 and many continue to battle against the idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that poor people are going to get helped at all, but I do think that the hospitals are going to get helped a lot.\u201d said Virginia Townsend, president of the Objective Watchers of the Legal System, a local watchdog group. \u201cI don\u2019t want it coming out of our pockets. I really think we\u2019re taxed enough.\u201d\n\nCritics of the healthcare district have been calling for the county to lower its tax rate this year after collecting more property taxes due to higher valuations. Commissioners approved a 59 cent tax rate for $100 valuation for the upcoming year.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any bridges that we collect revenue from. We don\u2019t get any sales taxes as a county, and there is a tremendous amount of growth and, with that, comes need,\u201d said Hidalgo County Judge Ramon Garcia.\n\nSHIFTING PLANS\n\nLast August, some local cities and Hidalgo County pledged $47.5 million to the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley Medical School over the next ten years, provided that a county healthcare district isn\u2019t established first.\n\nMcAllen is set to pay $2 million each year. Hidalgo County promised $1 million along with Edinburg; Pharr will chip in $500,000; and Mission $250,000. Mission Mayor Beto Salinas staunchly opposed the \u2018healthcare district\u2019 and offered more funding for the medical school\u2019s residency program if the district wasn\u2019t pushed.\n\nAny newly formed district would pay for the cities\u2019 share if created.\n\nBut the whole equation keeps shifting, especially since the 1115 Medicaid waiver is slated to expire in 2016 statewide.\n\nThe waiver was approved in 2011, while states were supposed to gear up for the Affordable Care Act and expand its Medicaid program with the help of federal funds, but Texas decided against expansion.\n\nInstead, the 1115 Medicaid waiver has been used to largely fund community health programs and an uncompensated care pool makes payments to hospitals across the state to help cover uninsured patients that accrue large medical bills they can\u2019t pay.\n\nIn the meantime, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services applied for an extension from the federal government. The last day for public comment on the waiver is Sept. 30 and there\u2019s an online survey as part of the federal requirements for the renewal. Some advocates argued that Texas should coordinate with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand Medicaid instead of paying for billions of dollars worth of unpaid medical bills so patients can use insurance instead.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the same waiver that would be leveraged for more federal funding if voters approve a new healthcare district \u2013 something that may be on the ballot in November 2016 \u2013 the same day as the presidential election.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Brownsville Herald", "description": "EDINBURG \u2013 Hidalgo County commissioners held a public hearing this past week to review and approve the annual local hospital payments that total $1.2 billion to help pay for local healthcare programs.
