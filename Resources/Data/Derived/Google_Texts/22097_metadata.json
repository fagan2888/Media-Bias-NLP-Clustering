The games get tougher from here.\"\n\nBrumbies winger Henry Speight threatened to end the Vikings' golden run, scoring with his first touch in the first half and carrying Super Rugby teammate Christian Lealiifano over the line.\n\nLealiifano was a surprise inclusion for the Vikings after being released from Wallabies camp to get some extra game time before the Super Rugby resumes next weekend.\n\nGungahlin hard man Rutikha Ilolhia left the field in the first half after copping a stray boot stud in his eye, but returned to almost lift the Eagles to victory when he crossed late to level the score.\n\nBut Vikings fullback Brendan Taueki wrestled back momentum, scoring in the corner to ensure the Vikings' unbeaten run continued.\n\nSpeight was supposed to play 40 minutes to blow out the cobwebs, but wanted to stay on the field in the hope of helping the Eagles win.\n\n\"I think Christian was being generous to me, a bit too kind to let me go over for my first try for the Eagles,\" Speight grinned.\n\n\"You don't get many chances to play for your club, this was my first time to play for the Eagles in three years. I hope the Brumbies didn't mind me going the full 80, it was just what I need to get a full blow out.\"\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nTUGGERANONG VIKINGS 22 (S Naeata, E Suavai, B Taueki tries; C Lealiiano, I Thompson conversion; I Thompson penalty) bt GUNGAHLIN EAGLES 12 (R Ilolhia, H Speight tries; A Dawes conversion), UNI-NORTHS OWLS 33 bt WESTS 29, QUEANBEYAN WHITES 85 bt EASTS 17.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ACT Sport, Brumbies, Union News", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The Tuggeranong Vikings have staked their claim for a fourth consecutive John I Dent Cup premiership.", "title": "Henry Speight scores but can't lift Gungahlin Eagles to victory over Tuggeranong Vikings", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/henry-speight-scores-but-cant-lift-gungahlin-eagles-to-victory-over-tuggeranong-vikings-20140621-zshkn.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/a/l/f/d/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zshkn.png/1403348812777.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/a/l/f/d/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zshkn.png/1403348812777.jpg"}, "title": "Henry Speight scores but can't lift Gungahlin Eagles to victory over Tuggeranong Vikings", "description": "The Tuggeranong Vikings have staked their claim for a fourth consecutive John I Dent Cup premiership.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Tuggeranong Vikings have staked their claim for a fourth consecutive John I Dent Cup premiership."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9503\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementThe Vikings beat the Gungahlin Eagles 22-12 at Gungahlin Enclosed, scoring a late try and penalty to hold on for victory.\n\"I think Christian was being generous to me, a bit too kind to let me go over for my first try for the Eagles,\" Speight grinned.\nBut Vikings fullback Brendan Taueki wrestled back momentum, scoring in the corner to ensure the Vikings' unbeaten run continued.\nBrumbies winger Henry Speight threatened to end the Vikings' golden run, scoring with his first touch in the first half and carrying Super Rugby teammate Christian Lealiifano over the line.\n\"It was physical and we probably lost our way in the second half, but the Eagles were very, very good,\" Harris said."}
