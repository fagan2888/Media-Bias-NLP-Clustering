Until your plan is mandated out of existence, which is exactly what happened to Pattie Curran, a North Carolina mother of three. Pattie says that she has witnessed her family\u2019s health insurance coverage slip away with the implementation of the mandates of the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act.\n\nTwo of Pattie\u2019s sons were born with a rare bone marrow dysfunction syndrome combined with a secondary mitochondrial disease, which require continuous specialists visits, treatments, and pricey medications. Pattie\u2019s family has been covered by a private health insurance plan provided by her husband\u2019s employer of 9 years, a plan which Pattie says her family considered to be affordable prior to Obamacare and under which they were never denied coverage of a single medical claim.\n\nPattie recently sat down with me for an on-camera interview in which she describes the first indication of major changes to her family\u2019s healthcare costs. One medication, required to protect her son\u2019s kidneys from damage, suddenly more than doubled in price from a $131.75 co-pay for a 3-month supply, a price Pattie says remained the same from 2005-2010, to $281.47 in 2011.\n\nPattie further relates feeling \u201cshocked and horrified\u201d as her family continued to see increases in the price of the prescription, reaching its present day out-of-pocket cost of $708.00 for a 3-month supply. She asks, reasonably, \u201cHow is that affordable when, before Obamacare, no paperwork, $131.00 for a 3-month supply and now it\u2019s $708.00?\u201d\n\nWatch the full video here:\n\nAfter 2011, the Currans experienced further increases in their premiums, deductibles, and medication co-pays. The situation has created a heavy financial burden for their family, forcing them to open several lines of credit in order to obtain their medications. Despite paying cash for their out-of-pocket expenses whenever possible, Pattie says that her family went from having zero credit card debt to over $60,000.00 in just a few years, all of it medically related.\n\nPattie indicates that her husband\u2019s employer has been forced to seek further cuts to the company\u2019s health care package in order to offset the expenses of the Obamacare mandates. Prior to their 2014 open enrollment Pattie received a notice stating that, due to the additional mandates going into effect for 2014, the company\u2019s healthcare costs were expected to increase by $7.4 million above the $64 million paid by the company in 2013. She has now learned that her children\u2019s life-saving compounded medications will be dropped from coverage altogether this month.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nicole Revels", "description": "This month, Pattie Curran will have to pay retail price for her sons' medication.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
