Bob sadly passed away from a neurological injury a few months ago.\n\nLocals who attended the funeral at A Pet\u2019s Memory Funeral Home and Crematory in Gulfport reminisced over memories of feeding the marsupial bananas or petting him during their visits to the rescue center. Well-wishers could also leave their thoughts of the late rodent on the funeral home\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cFor the most part our aftercare program services that we provide are for dogs, kitties, some birds, rabbits. I have to say Bob the opossum is our first experience performing aftercare cremation on a opossum. Bob is very well loved throughout the coast,\u201d Linda Sumrall, the owner of A Pet\u2019s Memory, told the station.\n\nBob spent the last two years of his life at the rescue center after being found with a spinal injury in nearby Ocean Springs. Because of the injury, he couldn\u2019t be released back into the wild.\n\nWatch WLOX-TV\u2018s news coverage of Bob\u2019s funeral below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Bob the possum must have been very beloved creature in the town of Gulfport, Ms. - so much so that the town threw him a proper funeral over the weekend to celebrate his life.", "title": "Mississippi town throws funeral for pet possum - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 535, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/01/Bob-the-possums-funeral-535x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/20/mississippi-town-throws-funeral-for-pet-possum/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "wlox-tv-bob-possum", "published_time": "2014-01-20T15:57:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T18:33:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Locals who attended the funeral at A Pet\u2019s Memory Funeral Home and Crematory in Gulfport reminisced over memories of feeding the marsupial bananas or petting him during their visits to the rescue center.\nBob the possum must have been very beloved creature in the town of Gulfport, Ms. \u2013 so much so that the town threw him a proper funeral over the weekend to celebrate his life.\nBob is very well loved throughout the coast,\u201d Linda Sumrall, the owner of A Pet\u2019s Memory, told the station.\nBob spent the last two years of his life at the rescue center after being found with a spinal injury in nearby Ocean Springs.\nWell-wishers could also leave their thoughts of the late rodent on the funeral home\u2019s Facebook page."}
