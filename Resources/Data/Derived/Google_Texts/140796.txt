“Hang on to your hats, guys,” Jeanine Pirro said in her opening statement Saturday on Fox News. “There’s another big lie by those purveyors of fantasy in the Obama administration about to be exposed.” And that “big lie” is that everyone will be covered for pre-existing conditions.

To make her case on “Justice With Judge Jeanine,” she told the story of stage IV cancer patient Maria Silva, who lost her coverage because of Obamacare just prior to her next scheduled round of chemotherapy treatment and now is unable to find anything in the exchange.

“Mr. President, with all due respect — that pre-existing condition thing?” Pirro said. “She’s got it!” And now she’s got nothing. “Are you proud of yourself?” she asked Obama.

“How many veterans, how many retired individuals, how many in the middle class are facing the loss of medical care or the loss of everything they’ve ever worked for” because the president had “a harebrained scheme?” she asked.

“Mr. President, the clock is ticking,” she closed.
