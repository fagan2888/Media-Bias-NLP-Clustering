He then would walk out or be carried out, Patterson said, depending on his condition.\n\nOn Saturday, after he fell, the man \u201cfound himself in a spot where he could not move up or down,\u201d Patterson\n\nsaid.\n\nTo find him, the rangers used the beacon and GPS during a call the man made to 911 with his cellphone.\n\nOfficials said the man was about 500 feet below Thatchtop Mountain and 1,500 feet above Sky Pond.\n\nA search-and-rescue team set out on foot early Sunday morning from the Glacier Gorge Trailhead.\n\nA team member was also dropped at the top of Thatchtop Mountain, which has a peak elevation of 12,668 feet.\n\nRocky Mountain Rescue and Larimer County Search and Rescue assisted.\n\nThe rescue is the second since May inside Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nIn late May, Samuel Frappier, 19, of Quebec, got stuck on a high, dangerous rock ledge on Longs Peak after getting separated from a friend while hiking and climbing. He was stranded for more than a day, at 13,000 feet, before rescuers reached him. He called for help on a cellphone.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rescuers reach climber who tumbled at Rocky Mountain National Park", "title": "Rescuers reach climber who tumbled at Rocky Mountain National Park", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/29/rescuers-reach-climber-who-tumbled-at-rocky-mountain-national-park/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-29T13:12:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-29T13:12:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac10\"", "article_summary": "Rescuers reached a 21-year-old climber who was stuck overnight on a mountainside in Rocky Mountain National Park, a park spokeswoman said.\n\u201cOur rescuers reached him around 12:15 p.m.,\u201d Kyle Patterson, a RMNP spokeswoman, told The Denver Post.\nRocky Mountain Rescue and Larimer County Search and Rescue assisted.\nOfficials said the man was about 500 feet below Thatchtop Mountain and 1,500 feet above Sky Pond.\nHe was stranded for more than a day, at 13,000 feet, before rescuers reached him."}
