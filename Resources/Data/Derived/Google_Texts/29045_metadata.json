Ask yourself, when you need a doctor, do you want a range of options or are you all right with staying in a network? Do you spend months away from Rochester? How many prescriptions do you take?\n\nThat analysis will determine whether original Medicare or Medicare Advantage is best for you.\n\nBrandwein, Monroe County coordinator of the Health Insurance Information Counseling and Assistance Program run at Lifespan, said you can't look only at the monthly cost of a plan. \"Just by the premium, you can make a bad decision. You have to look at other aspects.\"\n\nMedicare is for people 65 and older and individuals with disabilities regardless of age.\n\nOriginal or straight Medicare is administered through the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It includes hospitalization (Part A) and medical coverage (Part B). There is a premium for Part B and copayments when you get care. A drug plan (Part D) and Medigap to supplement Parts A and B, are extra.\n\nMedicare Advantage are plans sold by private insurers, which receive payment from CMS. They cover Parts A and B, and also Part D. Plans also may include other benefits.\n\nDrastic increases in the price for some local Medicare Advantage plans could send seniors back to the drawing board for open enrollment, which runs Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. Even with doing their homework, they're making an educated guess about their needs.\n\n\"Since no one has a crystal ball,\" Brandwein said, \"you have to make assumptions based on history, which may or may not repeat, and you have to live with those decisions for a year.\"\n\nMedicare can be confusing for first-timers not used to the system and for oldtimers who find their plan is gone or costs a lot more.\n\n\"Seniors do not like change,\" said the 66-year-old Brandwein, who has been running Medicare seminars for more than eight years. \"It very much goes against their grain. If they can get through it once, they want to get through and not deal with it again. Unfortunately, it's not something you can do with this.\"\n\nMore than more than 60 percent of Monroe County residents eligible for Medicare have an advantage plan.\n\nBy law, details of Medicare Advantage plans can't be revealed before Oct. 1. Local seniors got a hint when MVP Health Care announced a few weeks ago that it was dropping the two most expensive plans for the insurer to operate in that lineup. Premium increases in the remaining plans will range from $29 to $64.50 a month, an average of 44.8 percent. Co-pays are expected to range from $20 to $50.\n\nExcellus BlueCross BlueShield has yet to announce its Medicare Advantage plans, but several sources have said its zero-premium plan will now have a monthly cost. Other plans may be keeping their zero-premium plans, but those are likely to have higher out-of-pocket costs and smaller networks.\n\nThat wouldn't be a surprise. According to an analysis by HealthPocket.com, there will be 19 percent fewer zero-premium plans in 2015 than in 2014. HealthPocket used data from government, nonprofit and private sources, according to a news release.\n\nIn general, local costs seem on a different trajectory than national figures. CMS issued a news release that Medicare Advantage that premiums remain affordable for the 30 percent of beneficiaries \u2014 an all-time high \u2014 who choose the option. It said 61 percent of enrollees would not see a premium increase, and the average increase would be $2.94, to a premium cost of $33.90 per month.\n\nAverages take into account wide variations and some parts of the country may see greater increases than others.\n\nPatrick Glavey, executive vice president for government programs for MVP, said the aggregated figures don't apply to upstate New York. He said the area's health care industry has slowed the rate of growth. \"The reality is, we still have a small medical trend where costs are going up, just because of new things that are introduced.\"\n\nHe said chronic illness and an aging population also are factors in rising medical costs. According to census data, there was a 12 percent increase in the 65-to-74 age group and a 28 percent increase in 85-and-old group from 2000 to 2010. The fastest growing group was 50-to-64 years old, which increased 33 percent.\n\nAge and illness aside, some see the Affordable Care Act as the villain.\n\n\"The reality is that CMS has to position this in such a way as to not view the ACA as hurting seniors,\" Glavey said.\n\nMuch has been made of cuts to Medicare Advantage programs, but Brandwein said reductions have been in administrative expenses. Plans are supposed to use at least 85 percent of what they get from the government to pay for member benefits.\n\nThe ACA requires preventive care at no cost to the patient and has addressed the doughnut hole for prescription drug coverage. In 2015, someone with Part D will be responsible for 45 percent of prescription drug costs as opposed to the 100 percent they would have been responsible for prior to the ACA.\n\n\"Seniors should not really feel that the ACA has caused them financial problems,\" Brandwein said. \"It's all been, in my opinion, fairly beneficial.\"\n\nPSINGER@DemocratandChronicle.com\n\nTwitter.com/PattiSingerRoc\n\nMedicare 101\n\nLifespan, which provides nonmedical services for seniors and their caregivers, is seminars to explain the basics of Medicare.\n\n\u2022 10 a.m. to noon, Oct. 24, Lifespan, 1900.
