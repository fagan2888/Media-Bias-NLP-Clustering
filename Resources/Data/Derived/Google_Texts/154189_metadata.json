Health officials told about two dozen parents that only they can be caregivers for their children who are medical-marijuana patients.\n\nFurther, health officials said it was against the law for one caregiver to delegate authority \u2014 such as growing marijuana \u2014 to another caregiver.\n\nThe department, though, doesn\u2019t have the authority to do anything about this apparent breach of the law.\n\nWe are sympathetic to parents seeking help for their sick children. However, the structure is set up in a way that could subject them to exploitation by someone with purely financial motives.\n\nThe laws should be rewritten to allow caregivers, especially parents of minor children, to delegate their authority.\n\nForcing parents to grow their own marijuana to create the special oil for their sick children is not in the best interest of anyone.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Missing the mark on marijuana caregiver rules", "title": "Missing the mark on marijuana caregiver rules", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/19/missing-the-mark-on-marijuana-caregiver-rules/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__marijuana2p1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__marijuana2p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-19T18:04:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:23:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Further, health officials said it was against the law for one caregiver to delegate authority \u2014 such as growing marijuana \u2014 to another caregiver.\nThe Colorado Board of Health\u2019s recent action on its medical-marijuana caregiver rules was confusing and regrettable, creating more questions than solutions.\nHealth officials told about two dozen parents that only they can be caregivers for their children who are medical-marijuana patients.\nA more troubling revelation from last week\u2019s health board meeting was that many parents are apparently breaking the law by using a Boulder-based caregiver to obtain special marijuana oil for their children.\nForcing parents to grow their own marijuana to create the special oil for their sick children is not in the best interest of anyone."}
