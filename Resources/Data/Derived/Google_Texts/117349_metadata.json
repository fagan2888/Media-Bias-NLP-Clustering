He was named offensive MVP.\n\nPhiladelphia wide receiver DeSean Jackson and Carolina quarterback Cam Newton also had touchdowns for Team Sanders. New Orleans tight end Jimmy Graham and Cleveland wide receiver Josh Gordon caught touchdowns for Team Rice.\n\nThe Pro Bowlers were split up by the NFL greats in a new draft format meant to improve the game. The picks made earlier in the week created matchups that pitted usual teammates against each other and challenged Rice and Sanders to compare the all-stars against one another.\n\nThe result was a game that appeared more competitive than in years past, with some big hits and fewer shenanigans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson caught the game's first touchdown pass from Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck. Luck threw the ball 36 yards into double coverage in the end zone on a flea flicker, where Jackson wrestled it away from Titans cornerback Alterraun Verner.\n\nGraham caught an 8-yard fade in the second quarter from teammate Drew Brees, turning around Brees' slow start. Graham dunked the ball over the crossbar in celebration, but San Diego safety Eric Weddle jokingly defended the attempt.\n\nNewton scored on 1-yard run up the middle for a touchdown, making up for an earlier interception on a ball Cleveland cornerback Joe Haden wrestled away from Jackson.\n\nKansas City's Derrick Johnson -- who had a big hit in the first half on Chiefs teammate Jamaal Charles -- was selected as the game's defensive MVP for Team Rice.\n\nTeam Rice 0 14 0 8--22\n\nTeam Sanders 7 7 0 7--21\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nSAN--Jackson 36 pass from Luck (Tucker kick), 10:10.\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nRIC--Graham 8 pass from Brees (Gostkowski kick), 9:05.\n\nSAN--Newton 1 run (Tucker kick), 5:42.\n\nRIC--Gordon 10 pass from Rivers (Gostkowski kick), :36.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nSAN--Cameron 12 pass from Foles (Tucker kick), 4:41.\n\nRIC--Murray 20 pass from A.Smith (Tolbert run), :41.\n\nA--47,270.\n\nRIC SAN\n\nFirst downs 24 14\n\nTotal Net Yards 384 285\n\nRushes-yards 20-114 17-62\n\nPassing 270 223\n\nPunt Returns 5-56 3-8\n\nKickoff Returns 0-0 0-0\n\nInterceptions Ret. 2-0 4-101\n\nComp-Att-Int 26-54-4 20-34-2\n\nSacked-Yards Lost 4-21 5-41\n\nPunts 4-49.0 5-49.2\n\nFumbles-Lost 2-1 3-1\n\nPenalties-Yards 4-20 2-10\n\nTime of Possession 32:47 27:13\n\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\n\nRUSHING--Team Rice, Forte 6-31, Murray 4-25, L.McCoy 3-14, Tolbert 3-14, Gordon 1-13, A.Smith 1-13, Brees 2-4.
