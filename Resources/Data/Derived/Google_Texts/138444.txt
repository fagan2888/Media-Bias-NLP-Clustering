Golden police found a dead woman when they responded to a report that an RTD light rail train hit a pedestrian early Sunday.

The accident happened at about 1:30 a.m. on a stretch of track that is fenced in, so “from either side of the tracks, you can’t get on them,” without getting over the fence, said Capt. Daryl Hollingsworth.

An east bound light rail train hit the woman on track that runs on the north side of U.S. 6 and Ulysses St.

Police aren’t identifying the victim pending positive identification by the coroner and notification of relatives.

Golden Police continue the investigation and anyone with information about this accident can call 303-384-8045 and speak to accident investigators.
