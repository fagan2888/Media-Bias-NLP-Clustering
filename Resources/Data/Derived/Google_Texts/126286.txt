WASHINGTON — President Obama wants YOU to help get more people signed up for Obamacare.

Beginning the third year of open enrollment on the public health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, the White House is rolling out a new strategy to boost participation above the elusive 10 million mark.

Called the "Healthy Communities Challenge," the campaign will target 20 cities with the most uninsured people eligible for marketplace coverage but who haven't signed up. Nationwide, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates there are 10.5 million such people.

Obama said Saturday that the city with the most sign-ups will get bragging rights — and a presidential visit.

"If you live in one of the 20 cities participating in our Healthy Communities Challenge, I want to see how many of your neighbors you can get signed up," Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio address. "I’ll come visit the city that enrolls the highest percentage of folks who aren’t covered right now. That’s a promise."

Open enrollment for the exchanges began last week. Consumers must sign up by Dec. 15 in order to be beginning Jan. 1, but the White House will consider new sign-ups through the end of open enrollment in January, said White House spokeswoman Katie Hill.

The White House was scheduled to release details on the "Healthy Communities Challenge" on Friday, but delayed the rollout after Obama announced that his administration had denied a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.

Participating cities are Atlanta, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Nashville, Chicago, New Orleans, Dallas, Oakland, Calif., Denver, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, Great Falls, Mont., Richmond, Va., Kansas City, Mo., Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Seattle, Long Beach, Calif., and Tampa, Fla.
