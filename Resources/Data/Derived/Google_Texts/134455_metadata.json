It officially became the law of the land a few days later through a fast-tracked, parliamentary maneuver called reconciliation. Under Article 1, Section 7, of the U.S. Constitution, all bills for raising government revenue are supposed to originate in the House rather than the Senate, however. No Republican in Congress voted for Obamacare. Thirty of the 60 Senate Democrats who voted for Obamacare are no longer in office as the new Congressional term began last month with both chambers under GOP control.\n\nIn revisiting his support for Obamacare, Maher noted while the healthcare law has been a significant upgrade for those consumers with preexisting conditions, other issues have emerged, whether intended or unintended.\n\n\u201cBut the New York Times\u2026 did an article that basically said, you know, when Obama said if you like your plan nothing will change \u2014 well, everything has changed. 46 percent of people are having trouble paying health care costs now, up 10 percent from a year ago because the deductibles went the up, the co-pays went up. They can\u2019t see the doctor they used to see because he\u2019s in a different network. They go to get questions answered and they\u2019re talking to somebody reading a script in the Philippines. It\u2019s like your prostate cancer is being handled by Comcast now.\u201d\n\nContinued Maher about the shortcomings of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe most frightening thing in this article is when somebody said \u2018it\u2019s so confusing, I\u2019ve just stopped seeing a doctor,\u2019 and that\u2019s going on a lot, apparently. People are not going [to the doctor] because it\u2019s more expensive, too confusing, and I think this was intentional. I think the insurance companies wanted this to happen because that\u2019s how they make money.\u201d\n\nWhile leveling criticism at Obamacare, Bill Maher reaffirmed his support for a single-payer healthcare system, which is a completely government-run program, such as currently in effect in countries like the U.K. and Canada, to take the profit motive out of sickness and death as he deemed it.\n\nAll the political parties in Britain acknowledge that major problems exist in the U.K. National Health Service, however, drawbacks which are regularly covered in the British press. Parenthetically, the Academy Award-winning comedy drama The Barbarian Invasions (Best Foreign Language film 2004) provides a glimpse of what the Canadian system is like.\n\nApart from his apparent about-face on Obamacare, while Bill Maher has made a nice living in part from portraying Republicans and conservatives as anti-science hillbillies, he has a history of vaccine skepticism, although he now denies that he was ever an anti-vaxxer.\n\n[Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images Entertainment]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher may be having second thoughts about his vocal support for Obamacare, President Obama's signature legislative accomplishment, officially known as the", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Bill Maher may be having second thoughts about his vocal support for Obamacare, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment, officially known as the", "title": "Bill Maher: Obamacare Is More Expensive And Too Confusing [Video]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1845006/bill-maher-obamacare-is-more-expensive-and-too-confusing-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bill-Maher-Obamacare-Getty-Images-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-15T21:36:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T22:41:21+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bill-Maher-Obamacare-Getty-Images-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-02-15T21:36:37+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,bill maher,bill maher obamacare,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bill-Maher-Obamacare-Getty-Images-670x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bill Maher may be having second thoughts about his vocal support for Obamacare, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment, officially known as the"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Bill Maher may be having second thoughts about his vocal support for Obamacare, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment, officially known as the Affordable Care Act.\nPeople are not going [to the doctor] because it\u2019s more expensive, too confusing, and I think this was intentional.\nIn revisiting his support for Obamacare, Maher noted while the healthcare law has been a significant upgrade for those consumers with preexisting conditions, other issues have emerged, whether intended or unintended.\nIt\u2019s like your prostate cancer is being handled by Comcast now.\u201dContinued Maher about the shortcomings of Obamacare.\nIn revealing his disillusionment with the law\u2019s implementation as it applies to the average person, however, Maher pointed the finger at \u201cshark-like\u201d insurance companies \u2014 rather than complicated, one-size-fits-all government regulations \u2014 for making medical treatment under Obamacare more expensive and too confusing."}
