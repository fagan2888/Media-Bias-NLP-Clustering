A new multimillion-dollar forensic science laboratory is set to open Monday on the Washburn University campus in Topeka.

The four-story building, which had a $55 million budget, will be used by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. It replaces an old lab in the basement of a renovated junior high school.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the public will be able to tour the building later this week.

KBI Director Kirk Thompson says the new building was designed to meet current and future needs of the KBI. The current lab processes about 10,000 pieces of evidence each year for law enforcement agencies across the state.

Washburn University's forensic science classes will also be located in the building.
