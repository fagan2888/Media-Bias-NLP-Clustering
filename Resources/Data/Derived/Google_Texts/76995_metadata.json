The tax is certainly harmful. Whether it deserves the highest priority in repealing Obamacare, we\u2019ll leave to discuss another day.\n\nAlthough, repealing the medical device excise tax does nothing to repeal Obamacare. It just gives us a deficit-financed Obamacare. This is the second time the Republican-majority Congress has voted to increase deficit spending on health care this year, without winning any meaningful reform to any program.\n\nWith 46 Democrats joining the Republican majority, the votes in favor added up to 280, just 8 short of the number needed to override the promised presidential veto. We\u2019ll see how it does in the Senate.\n\nThe bill was scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which determined that it would increase the deficit by over $24 billion in the next 10 years. We seldom see explicit budget scores of individual Obamacare taxes. This score overlaps the original 2010 CBO score for four years, 2016 through 2019. Comparing the two scores (see Table 1) shows how much the tax\u2019s estimated revenues have shrunk \u2013 36 percent, from $12.7 billion to $8.1 billion over the period.\n\nI\u2019ve previously noted how Obamacare\u2019s spending estimates have also dropped. We need a new, comprehensive CBO score of all Obamacare provisions, so we know what we\u2019ll be tackling when it comes time to repeal and replace it.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the pivotal alternative to Obamacare, please see the Independent Institute\u2019s new book, A Better Choice: Healthcare Solutions for America, by John C.
