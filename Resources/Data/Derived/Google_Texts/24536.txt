Patrick Roy is tweaking his lines for The Big Game Saturday night against Winnipeg. On Friday, after an optional practice, he disclosed he was going to reunite Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginila as linemates, with John Mitchell centering them.

After the morning skate, the Avalanche coach disclosed that another of the changes was due to injury.

Veteran winger Jack Skille, who has been skating on the fourth line with Mitchell and Cody McLeod, suffered a concussion against Dallas Thursday night. “He had an elbow to the head by one of their players,” Roy said.

How long will Skille be out?

“I have no idea,” Roy said. “You know how it is (with) the protocol sometimes. Hopefully, it won’t be that long.”

With Skille out and Mitchell stepping between Iginla and Tanguay, the other lines shaked out this way: Gabe Landeskog-Carl Soderberg-Blake Comeau, Mikhail Grigorenko-Nathan MacKinnon-Matt Duchene and Cody McLeod-Chris Wagner-Andreas Martinsen. Colorado has been carrying only one extra forward, so with Skille out, it’s likely one will be recalled from San Antonio in the next few days.

On defense, Andrew Bodnarchuk will be back in the lineup against the Jets after eight healthy scratches in the last 10 games, and Zach Redmond is slated to join Nate Guenin as the healthy scratches.

The Jets arrived in Denver in the early morning hours Saturday after losing 5-3 to Carolina and finishing a six-game homestand with a 1-5 record. The slump/collapse has dropped the Jets to nine points out of a playoff spot.
