The Treasury Department said the nation had hit its .294 trillion debt limit \u2013 a milestone that has little practical impact beyond injecting a note of urgency into the debate over taxes and spending that has dominated Washington this year.\n\nWhile many Americans were out buying Christmas presents on \"Black Friday,\" the U.S. national debt surpassed $18 trillion.\n\nAccording to the official numbers released by the U.S. Treasury Department, at the end of the workday on Friday, the total national debt was $18,005,549,328,561.45\n\nAccording to usdebtclock.org, which maintains a rolling estimate of the national debt based upon the official numbers released by the U.S. Treasury Department, the current debt amounts to $56,369 for each U.S. citizen, or $153,729 for each U.S. taxpayer. Current federal tax revenue is about $3.1 trillion.\n\nFree Sign Up Newsletter!\n\nThe national debt is now higher than the nation's gross domestic product, or the values of all goods and services produced, which is almost $17.2 trillion.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama first took office, the national debt was $10.6 trillion. With debt accumulation currently averaging about $1.3 trillion, the debt could double during Obama's term.\n\nThe national debt does not take into account state and local government debt, or personal debt. It also does not take into account unfunded liabilities, or payments that have been promised for Social Security and Medicare without the revenue to pay for them under current policy.\n\nCurrent national unfunded liabilities are over $115.7 trillion.\n\nTo get a better idea of how the current debt would compare to household debt, you can chop off the last eight digits. For a family making $30,000 per year, comparable debt would be $180,000 and $1,157,000 in unfunded liabilities.\n\nCongress is currently working on a government spending bill in its \"lame duck\" session. A bill must be passed and signed by Obama by Dec. 12 to avoid a government shutdown.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "While many Americans were out buying Christmas presents on \"Black Friday,\" the U.S. national debt surpassed $18 trillion.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "National Debt Surpassed $18,000,000,000,000 on Black Friday", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "While many Americans were out buying Christmas presents on \"Black Friday,\" the U.S. national debt surpassed $18 trillion.", "author": "Napp Nazworth", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/national-debt-surpassed-18000000000000-on-black-friday-130556/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/49998/national-debt.jpg", "title": "National Debt Surpassed $18,000,000,000,000 on Black Friday", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/49998/national-debt.jpg", "title": "National Debt Surpassed $18,000,000,000,000 on Black Friday", "description": "While many Americans were out buying Christmas presents on \"Black Friday,\" the U.S. national debt surpassed $18 trillion.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/national-debt-surpassed-18000000000000-on-black-friday-130556/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "National&20Debt,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2014-12-02T14:59:16-05:00", "modDate": "2014-12-02T14:59:16-05:00"}, "Keywords": "National Debt,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfecd\"", "article_summary": "The national debt does not take into account state and local government debt, or personal debt.\nWhile many Americans were out buying Christmas presents on \"Black Friday,\" the U.S. national debt surpassed $18 trillion.\nTo get a better idea of how the current debt would compare to household debt, you can chop off the last eight digits.\nWhen President Barack Obama first took office, the national debt was $10.6 trillion.\nThe national debt is now higher than the nation's gross domestic product, or the values of all goods and services produced, which is almost $17.2 trillion."}
