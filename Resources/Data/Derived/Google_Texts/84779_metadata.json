This election is the first since the law was fully implemented.\n\nNow, Republicans are seeking a new winning formula, with the midterm election less than three months away. Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has advised U.S. Senate candidates including Marco Rubio of Florida, said the party is pausing to reframe the ads by tying the health law to the economy and jobs, the top concerns for most Americans.\n\nAttack Testing\n\n\u201cObamacare will not be the most important issue,\u201d and Republicans will have to \u201ctarget people very directly\u201d with their messages, said Ayres, who co-wrote a memo this month for outside spending groups such as Crossroads GPS and the American Action Network. The memo came after Ayres tested 57 possible avenues of attack.\n\nAyres said another round of health-care ads may drop next month when premium increases take effect after state regulators finish negotiating with insurers on 2015 rates, he said.\n\n\u201cObamacare remains of serious concern,\u201d his memo said, \u201cgarnering significant opposition among Republicans and widespread criticism among independents, who are suspicious of the law\u2019s Washington-driven approach.\u201d\n\nStill, the party\u2019s experience across the country shows that Republicans can\u2019t count on the issue to motivate independent voters they need to oust Democrats in Arkansas, Louisiana and Alaska. And in North Carolina, the ads being run against Senator Kay Hagan also underline the limits of the health-care law as a political topic.\n\nNegative Ads\n\nRepublicans have accused Hagan of casting the deciding vote on the law, when it passed in 2010 and became President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest legislative initiative. Yet even with more than $4 million in negative ads aimed at the law this year, Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger, Thom Tillis, in recent polls.\n\nIn April, anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina. It accounted for 3,061, or 54 percent, of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina, according to Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. By July, the numbers had reversed, with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971, or 27 percent, of the top issue ads, and the budget, government spending, jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608, or 72 percent, of such ads, CMAG data show.\n\nEconomy Focus\n\n\u201cIt is a recognition that there\u2019s more going on in this state and also nationally than just frustration over Obamacare,\u201d said Jordan Shaw, Tillis\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cWe have never had an approach to make this campaign all about the Affordable Care Act. You can\u2019t have a conversation about Obamacare without talking about its impact on the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Republican approach, long defined by a \u201crepeal and replace\u201d mantra, is also challenged by a policy void, said Jennifer Duffy, a Senate analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cYou can\u2019t really repeal it without creating a mess,\u201d she said, \u201cand the problem is they\u2019re not entirely sure what to replace it with.\u201d\n\nIn another reflection of the party\u2019s efforts to put its campaign against the health law in a broader context, the House voted last month to sue Obama over its implementation. House Republicans said the president exceeded his constitutional powers in delaying one of the measure\u2019s central requirements on his own, without a vote of Congress.\n\nPryor\u2019s Contest\n\nThe situation is much the same in Arkansas, where Mark Pryor is trying to keep his Senate seat, and Louisiana, where Mary Landrieu is in a tight race for a fourth term. The health law was just about the only issue on the air in Louisiana in April, according to CMAG. By July, it had dropped to 41 percent of the top five issue ads, and in Arkansas just 23 percent.\n\nThe ads have diminished as insurance coverage has expanded in North Carolina. About 581,000 people in the state had signed up for private plans under the law by April, 54 percent of the potential market, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group.\n\nNationwide, Obamacare has exceeded enrollment projections since March as its troubled website has been fixed. Premiums in the insurance marketplaces are expected to increase only modestly in most states, and the percentage of uninsured Americans has dropped significantly, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cWhen they righted the ship, it no longer was as effective a weapon to use to hit Democrats over the head with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Caught Up\u2019\n\nRose Duke, a 44-year-old from Raleigh who cast her ballot for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, is one of the law\u2019s new beneficiaries. Duke, who lost her flooring business after her husband died last year, says she now has a favorable view of the measure and is angry at her state\u2019s Republican governor, Pat McCrory, for refusing to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDuke has a diabetic daughter who was initially denied health-insurance coverage because of the state\u2019s swollen Medicaid rolls.\n\n\u201cMy child got caught up in the political B.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to walk in there and beg them for help,\u201d said Duke, who eventually got coverage from Medicaid, the federal-state program for lower-income Americans.\n\nThe dialing down of the Obamacare offensive coincides with the public\u2019s relative lack of attention to the issue.\n\nJust 5 percent of Americans identified health care as the most important problem facing the U.S., after the economy and jobs at 22 percent and immigration at 13 percent, in a July 29-Aug. 4 CBS News poll. In November 2010 -- at the last midterm election -- a CBS survey ranked health care as the second-most important issue, at 17 percent, after unemployment and jobs.\n\n\u2018Getting Less\u2019\n\nThe ad that has run the most in North Carolina, sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, an outside spending group founded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, proclaims that millions of Americans have lost insurance, can\u2019t see their own doctors and are \u201cpaying more and getting less.\u201d\n\nAnother features a self-employed Chapel Hill woman named Sheila Salter who says her policy was canceled and that she\u2019ll be paying $4,500 a year more for insurance.\n\nThe challenge for Republicans is there may not be enough people losing coverage who can relate to the broadcast messages, to move the public-opinion needle.\n\nAccording to a Gallup survey this month, the rate of uninsured people has dropped in all except five states. Two critical states, Arkansas and Kentucky, had the biggest declines. In Arkansas, the rate of people without health insurance fell from 22.5 percent in 2013 to 12.4 percent in mid-2014.\n\nEconomic Concern\n\nFurther, recent survey data show the number of people affected by canceled health-care policies was about 1.9 million nationally, less than the 4.8 million often cited in the run-up to the health program\u2019s launch last year, according to the journal Health Affairs.\n\nAccording to the memo by Ayres, the Republican pollster, arguments against Obamacare that resonate most with independent voters are economic. These include the law\u2019s cost to taxpayers; concern that it discourages some employers from hiring full-time workers, and that it will lead to higher premiums and co-payments for some in the private insurance market.\n\nThe Republican messages on Obamacare and other issues have \u201cbecome more diluted\u201d now that it is the law of the land, said Elizabeth Wilner, CMAG\u2019s vice president. \u201cThere is more material to use for messaging but they\u2019re not sure which one works best.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heidi Przybyla", "twitter": {"description": "Republicans seeking to unseat the U.S. Senate incumbent in North Carolina have cut in half the portion of their top issue ads citing Obamacare, a sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch.", "title": "Obamacare Losing Power as Campaign Weapon in Ad Battles", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-19/obamacare-losing-punch-as-campaign-weapon-in-ad-battles", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia1gpEe_aia4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Heidi Przybyla", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Kay Ruthven Hagan,Louisiana,Arkansas,Democrats,Health,U.S. Senate,North Carolina,Law,Republicans", "news_keywords": "Kay Ruthven Hagan,Louisiana,Arkansas,Democrats,Health,U.S. Senate,North Carolina,Law,Republicans", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-19/obamacare-losing-punch-as-campaign-weapon-in-ad-battles", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Losing Power as Campaign Weapon in Ad Battles", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-19T14:51:04.419Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Republicans seeking to unseat the U.S. Senate incumbent in North Carolina have cut in half the portion of their top issue ads citing Obamacare, a sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch.", "parsely-tags": "Kay Ruthven Hagan,Louisiana,Arkansas,Democrats,Health,U.S. Senate,North Carolina,Law,Republicans,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-08-19T14:51:04.419Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Republicans seeking to unseat the U.S. Senate incumbent in North Carolina have cut in half the portion of their top issue ads citing Obamacare, a sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch.", "title": "Obamacare Losing Power as Campaign Weapon in Ad Battles", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-19/obamacare-losing-punch-as-campaign-weapon-in-ad-battles", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia1gpEe_aia4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Republicans seeking to unseat the U.S. Senate incumbent in North Carolina have cut in half the portion of their top issue ads citing Obamacare, a sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch."}, "parsely-post-id": "NA971O6KLVRZ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia1gpEe_aia4/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01d6\"", "article_summary": "By July, it had dropped to 41 percent of the top five issue ads, and in Arkansas just 23 percent.\nIt accounted for 3,061, or 54 percent, of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina, according to Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.\nThe health law was just about the only issue on the air in Louisiana in April, according to CMAG.\nIn April, anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina.\n\u201cThe Republican Party is realizing you can\u2019t really hang your hat on it,\u201d said Andrew Taylor, a political science professor at North Carolina State University."}
