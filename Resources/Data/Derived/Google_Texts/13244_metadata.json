With this mind-set, a lot is possible. I am a fighter. Many think it\u2019s just drama, but that\u2019s nonsense. I have pain, but I can fight. I always give everything.\u201d\n\nVonn crashed in Saturday\u2019s super-G race after catching a spot of soft snow. She was brought down the hill on a rescue sled and underwent tests in a hospital.\n\nInitially, she said she had suffered a \u201chairline fracture,\u201d but after an additional test Sunday evening, Vonn wrote on Facebook that \u201cthe MRI shows a pretty substantial fracture in my tibia plateau. MCL looks decent as well as the rest of my knee. Now I will talk to my trainers and make a plan.\u201d\n\nHours before Sunday\u2019s race, Vonn posted a short video, showing how she had excess fluid removed from her knee.\n\n\u201cDrained my knee a few times and it\u2019s feeling a little better. Going to go up on the hill and see how it feels,\u201d she wrote.\n\nVonn inspected the course for the first leg and made one run on the warm-up course before deciding to actually start. She trailed the leader at the time, American teammate Laurenne Ross, by 0.36 seconds halfway down the course but won by more than a half-second on Ross with a strong finish.\n\nVonn screamed for joy after finishing, holding both arms and ski poles up in the air while waving to the spectators.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn returns to action with fractured knee, extends World Cup lead", "title": "Lindsey Vonn returns to action with fractured knee, extends World Cup lead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/28/lindsey-vonn-returns-to-action-with-fractured-knee-extends-world-cup-lead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228__lindsey-vonnp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228__lindsey-vonnp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T22:20:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:33:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I always give everything.\u201dVonn crashed in Saturday\u2019s super-G race after catching a spot of soft snow.\nSOLDEU-EL TARTER, Andorra \u2014 Hampered by a fractured left knee, Lindsey Vonn managed to extend her overall World Cup lead by placing 13th in an alpine combined event Sunday, while Marie-Michele Gagnon of Canada took the win.\nNow I will talk to my trainers and make a plan.\u201dHours before Sunday\u2019s race, Vonn posted a short video, showing how she had excess fluid removed from her knee.\nVonn inspected the course for the first leg and made one run on the warm-up course before deciding to actually start.\nVonn screamed for joy after finishing, holding both arms and ski poles up in the air while waving to the spectators."}
