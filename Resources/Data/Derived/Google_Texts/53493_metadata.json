Some of the rocks were even dug from the prehistoric floor of the site and thrown over the embankment.\n\nIn an effort to identify the individuals involved, the Forest Service has released an image of three people of interest.\n\n\u201cDamaging the resource of any kind is illegal and, depending on the extent of the crime, something could be punishable up to $20,000, possible jail time and restitution,\u201d Brienne Magee, public information office with the Coconino National Forest, told AZCentral.\n\n\u201cEven just moving rocks around on the surface within the site, even if they don\u2019t leave the site, still destroys that information,\u201d Travis Bone, archaeologist with the U.S. Forest Service at the Red Rock Ranger District, told AZCentral.\n\nHe also said the cave had been an archaeological site for about one year and that more information needed to be collected and studied.\n\n\u201cThese prehistoric sites are rare treasures on our public lands and the Forest Service takes every effort to preserve and protect those resources,\u201d said Patrol Captain Jon Nelson in a news release from the Forest Service. \u201cOnce these sites are damaged, it removes a piece of the puzzle of how past communities lived and existed over time that cannot be replaced. It not only destroys scientific evidence, it denies the public from seeing these areas as they were left by the Pueblo people who lived here centuries ago.\u201d\n\nThe about 800-year-old cave was once a dwelling for the Pueblo, who consider it a sacred place. The area is not open to the public.\n\nAnyone with information regarding this vandalism should contact Officer Mike O\u2019Neil at 928-203-7512.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Forest Service is looking for information and individuals connected to vandalism to a sacred site known as Jordan Cave in Arizona.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/22/arizona-sacred-site-vandalized-forest-service-investigating-158805", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/jordan-cave-vandalism-forest-service.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Arizona Sacred Site Vandalized, Forest Service Investigating"}, "abstract": "The U.S. Forest Service is looking for information and individuals connected to vandalism to a sacred site known as Jordan Cave in Arizona.", "keywords": "U.S. Forest Service, Native American Sacred Sites, Arizona, Archaeological Site", "dc": {"title": "Arizona Sacred Site Vandalized, Forest Service Investigating"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/22/arizona-sacred-site-vandalized-forest-service-investigating-158805", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.date": "2015-01-22T14:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Arizona Sacred Site Vandalized, Forest Service Investigating"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdaa8\"", "article_summary": "In an effort to identify the individuals involved, the Forest Service has released an image of three people of interest.\nAccording to the Forest Service, several people were seen removing and throwing rocks from the walls of the site over a steep embankment.\n\u201cThese prehistoric sites are rare treasures on our public lands and the Forest Service takes every effort to preserve and protect those resources,\u201d said Patrol Captain Jon Nelson in a news release from the Forest Service.\nThe U.S. Forest Service is looking for information and individuals connected to vandalism to an archaeological site known as Jordan Cave near the Jordan Trailhead parking lot in Sedona, Arizona.\nSome of the rocks were even dug from the prehistoric floor of the site and thrown over the embankment."}
