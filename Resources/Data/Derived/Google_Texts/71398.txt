Paris, France

Paris' most iconic boulevard was the scene for a spectacular exhibition on Sunday when a series of cars that captured the public imagination through their appearances in James Bond drove past stunned bystanders.

Visitors came out in their droves to catch a glimpse of decades of motoring history as Bond's cars drove up to the Arc de Triomphe, including the latest vehicle to be associated with the fictional British spy, the Aston Martin DB10.

For some it brought back watching James Bond films during their childhood, while for other devotees, the car show projected a quintessentially British style of culture.

The car parade comes ahead of the release of the twenty-fourth James Bond film, Spectre, which is scheduled to hit the cinemas in the UK on 26 October and the rest of the world from 6 November.

Spectre will see British actor Daniel Craig return for his fourth performance as Bond.
