Access Health CT officials say plans were in the works to provide such options, since the federal healthcare law mandated it.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act actually stipulates that the exchanges must offer these types of plans so it\u2019s actually codified in the law,\" said Jason Madrak, Access Health's Chief Marketing Officer. \"The ACA also says that states have until 2017 to go ahead and make these kinds of plans available.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Affordable Care Act actually prohibits federally subsidized plans from covering elective abortion procedures.\n\nMadrak said policymakers always had it in mind for people who opposed abortion to have choices in their healthcare coverage.\n\n\u201cIf you do have an objection to elective abortive services, these plans do offer you some alternative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Access Health CT, the state's healthcare marketplace offers four plans that don't include coverage for elective abortion procedures.", "title": "Conn.
