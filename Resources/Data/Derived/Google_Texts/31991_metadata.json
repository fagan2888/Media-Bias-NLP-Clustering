YouTube/ Munchies\n\nPizza \u2014 it\u2019s a guilty pleasure for most. And regardless if you\u2019re a Chicago deep dish aficionado or if you favor the thin New York slice, there\u2019s a pizza lover in almost all of us. One man loves pizza so much that he eats it every single day. He doesn\u2019t eat it for every meal, but at least once a day, he\u2019s been eating it for the last 25 years.\n\nAccording to a Vice documentary, Dan Janssen has received a lot of criticism for the diet. \u201cYou\u2019re horribly unhealthy and you\u2019re gonna die,\u201d he says people have told him. And Janssen responds, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re all gonna die. But I\u2019m gonna die with pizza in my stomach.\u201d\n\nHe claims that despite his diabetes, most of this doctors (besides his endocrinologist) say that he\u2019s perfectly fine. \u201cYour cholesterol is fine. You seem healthy. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d is what he claims that his doctors have said.\n\nAnd besides the endocrinologist being unhappy, his fianc\u00e9e Madeline is not happy about his eating habits. Janssen is a vegetarian but doesn\u2019t like vegetables. Madeline attempts to get him to put vegetables on his pizza anyway, even though he makes a face when he has to eat them.\n\nThe pizza lover says he \u201crecognizes that he has a very strong food aversion\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t \u201ceat things normal people eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have to have locally grown food from around the corner and all that bull****,\" he said. \"I like processed food. I like preservatives and pizza. My dad's the same way, too. He had triple bypass surgery and then a week later went out and had a huge steak dinner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pizza", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "He doesn't eat it for every meal, but Dan Janssen has to eat pizza at least once a day.", "title": "25 Years Of Eating Pizza Daily Rewards Man With Diabetes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pizza-breakfast-lunch-or-dinner-one-man-has-been-surviving-it-past-25-years-294298", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/22/man-who-eats-pizza-25-years.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He doesn't eat it for every meal, but Dan Janssen has to eat pizza at least once a day.", "title": "25 Years Of Eating Pizza Daily Rewards Man With Diabetes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pizza-breakfast-lunch-or-dinner-one-man-has-been-surviving-it-past-25-years-294298", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/22/man-who-eats-pizza-25-years.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/22/man-who-eats-pizza-25-years.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-22T12:12:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-22T13:54:30-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "He doesn't eat it for every meal, but Dan Janssen has to eat pizza at least once a day."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbad3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou\u2019re horribly unhealthy and you\u2019re gonna die,\u201d he says people have told him.\nHe doesn\u2019t eat it for every meal, but at least once a day, he\u2019s been eating it for the last 25 years.\nHe doesn't eat it for every meal, but Dan Janssen has to eat pizza at least once a day.\nBut I\u2019m gonna die with pizza in my stomach.\u201dHe claims that despite his diabetes, most of this doctors (besides his endocrinologist) say that he\u2019s perfectly fine.\nAnd Janssen responds, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re all gonna die."}
