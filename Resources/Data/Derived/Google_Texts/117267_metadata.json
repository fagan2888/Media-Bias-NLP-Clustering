Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a final rule this week focused on improving Medicare compliance, reporting, and self-identified overpayments to ultimately combat Medicare fraud.\n\nUnder CMS-6037-F, Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B healthcare providers must report and return overpayments according to a variety of guidelines.\n\nCMS established a specific timeline within the 132 page rule as \u201cthe later of the date that is 60 days after the date an overpayment was identified, or the date due of any [applicable] corresponding cost report.\u201d\n\nOverpayments must be reported and returned if identified within a 6 year window from when they were received.\n\nCMS explained this limitation means both providers and suppliers will not experience as much unreasonable cost burden.\n\nThese mandates were created to ensure applicable statute compliance, advance the delivery of high quality care, and help defend the Medicare Trust Funds from fraud, CMS stated.\n\n\u201cThis rule provides needed clarity and consistency in the reporting and returning of self-identified overpayments,\u201d the rule explained.\n\nBut even without this rule, providers are not immune to potential False Claims Act liability or Civil Monetary Penalties Law liability, CMS said.\n\nNor are they excluded from federal healthcare programs for not reporting and returning overpayments.\n\n\u201c[Providers] continue to be required to comply with our current procedures when we, or our contractors, determine an overpayment and issue a demand letter,\u201d the rule clarified.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act connection\n\nCMS explained the proposed rule is tied to several new sections of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2013 1128J9(d)(1-3).\n\nCMS\u2019s proposed rule implements provisions from this segment of the ACA for Medicare Part A and B providers and suppliers.\n\nSegments 1128J9(1-3) require someone who has received an overpayment to report and return it and to also explain reason for overpayment, CMS said.\n\nAdditionally, the ACA requires overpayment be reported and returned on a given date.\n\nAnd, the regulation specifies any overpayment retained after the deadline for reporting and returning an overpayment \u201cis an obligation,\u201d CMS clarified.\n\nCommenters express support, suggest changes\n\nThe 132 page proposed rule contained a great deal of summarized conversation between commenters and CMS.\n\nCMS stated that in summation, commenters \u201cgenerally agreed that providers and suppliers should promptly refund overpayments and maintain efforts to prevent and detect improper payments.\u201d\n\nSupportive commenters said the rule will hopefully reduce improper payments and ensure the Medicare Trust Funds\u2019 overall sustainability, CMS added.\n\n\u201cSome commenters stated they were pleased that CMS issued the proposed rule and believed it would motivate providers and suppliers to educate billing staff and practitioners on Medicare billing rules.\u201d\n\nHowever, commenters also had a number of concerns and suggestions, which CMS responded to.\n\nHere are two highlights from the extensive dialogue that are particularly worthy of note.\n\nFirst, some commenters expressed unease regarding the proposed rule\u2019s limitations to Medicare Parts A and B.\n\nSome commenters felt \u201cCMS did not articulate any statutory authority or rationale for creating this distinction and narrowing the scope of the proposed rule to Medicare Part A and Part B providers and suppliers,\" said CMS.\n\nCommenters also asserted CMS\u2019s proposed rule demands more cohesion, especially since many healthcare providers submit claims to many different places \u2013 i.e. Medicaid, Medicare Part A, Part B, Part C managed care plans, and Part D plan sponsors.\n\nCommenters urged \u201cCMS include all of Medicare and Medicaid in the final rule or quickly issue other proposed rules so all providers and suppliers have guidance on their obligations and are treated equally.\u201d\n\nSecondly, some commenters requested for the exclusion of overpayments not caused by a provider or supply when an error occurred that was simply beyond their control.\n\nCommenters said certain erroneous situations arise that are not necessarily of their doing \u2013 such as a CMS system error where a Medicare beneficiary is incorrectly classified as fee-for-service \u2013 that result in inaccurate payments.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the commenters that certain types of payments, including those made as a result of an error by any particular party, should be excluded from the definition of an overpayment,\u201d CMS responded.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe it is necessary for providers or suppliers to make determinations regarding whether they were the cause of an overpayment in lieu of reporting and returning any identified overpayments as required by this rule.\u201d\n\nCMS describes how to report and return overpayments\n\n\u201cThis final rule provides that providers and suppliers must use an applicable claims adjustment, credit balance, self\u2011reported refund, or another appropriate process to satisfy the obligation to report and return overpayments,\u201d CMS explained.\n\n\u201cThis approach for returning overpayments provides an array of familiar options from which providers and suppliers can select.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis rule also provides that if a health care provider or supplier has reported a self-identified overpayment[,] \u2026 the provider or supplier is considered to be in compliance with the provisions of this rule as long as they are actively engaged in the respective protocol.\u201d",
