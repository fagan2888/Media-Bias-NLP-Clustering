The 47-year-old executive joined Blackstone in 2008, one year after the private equity firm went public. He would replace Andrew Swain, who left Airbnb last September.\n\nBlackstone declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Airbnb did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nreached out to him for the position of CFO in 2011, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. Before joining Blackstone, Tosi was Chief Operating Officer of global markets and investment banking at Merrill Lynch & Co. From 2004 through 2007, Tosi was Merrill's principal accounting officer for global finance. A graduate of Georgetown University, he was also global head of corporate development at Merrill from 1999 to 2007, where he managed many of the firm's strategic acquisitions and investments. Before joining Merrill Lynch in 1999, he was director of business development for General Electric Co's NBC division.
