ST. LOUIS (KPLR) - The Affordable Care Act has allowed millions of people to get health insurance, but there are some who complain insurance-based primary care is too complex, inefficient, and restrictive, driving frustrated physicians and patients to seek alternatives.

One rapidly-growing alternative is known as ‘direct primary care,’ which promises to not only alleviate some frustration in getting care, but also offer increased access and improved care at a more affordable cost.

Dr. Sonny Saggar visits KPLR 11 for today’s Doctor Is In segment to discuss this particular solution, and why an upcoming change in state law will make it even more attractive.
