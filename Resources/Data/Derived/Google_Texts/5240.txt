With ski season on the horizon, the U.S. Forest Service on Thursday approved expansion plans for Eldora Mountain Resort — but for now, only within its existing boundaries.

The decision was seen as a shift toward meeting the concerns of expansion critics, after a draft ruling this year did not advocate the resort staying within its current boundaries.

“This decision will allow the ski area to move forward with proposed improvements inside its existing special use permit boundary — such as replacing lifts, adding gladed terrain and new runs, improving snowmaking, and building and renovating restaurant facilities,” a news release from the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests stated.

The decision defers all expansion outside the existing ski area special-use boundaries, providing an opportunity for Eldora to work with interested parties on the more “controversial elements of the project,” according to the release.
