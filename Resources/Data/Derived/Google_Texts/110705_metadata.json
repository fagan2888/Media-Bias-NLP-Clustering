If you work for one of the major cable news networks or the nation\u2019s largest newspapers you probably don\u2019t. I base this anecdotally on the fact that I was struggling this morning to recall the last time I saw an interview with him or coverage of a campaign event he held. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019d already folded up his tent and gone home. That\u2019s particularly strange in light of the fact that nationally he\u2019s still tied with Huckabee for 5th, he\u2019s a solid 4th in Iowa and 5th in New Hampshire.\n\nBut Carson is still out there on the trail, so it seems fitting to check in on him. The candidate did a Facebook \u201cask me anything\u201d style exchange to reach out to younger, social media using voters, and he hit a variety of topics. He went after Planned Parenthood pretty hard, saying he was \u201csickened\u201d by the actions of the organization, and called for an end to all government funding to them. Sticking with a health care theme, he also addressed Obamacare, which he still wants to cancel almost entirely\u2026 but not quite. (From Inquisitr)\n\nCarson also recently attacked Obamacare saying the whole thing should be changed with the exception of one clause. And that is the one that prevents insurance companies from barring people with pre-existing conditions from joining health care programs. The following was Ben Carson\u2019s statement, according to IJ Review. \u201cProviding coverage to people who are sick is extremely important. When I work with Congress to repeal the law, I think we should keep this protection for the sick.\u201d\n\nThese are the kinds of policy statements which give the health insurance industry nightmares and should set the teeth of customers on edge as well. The problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t the individual items\u2026 it\u2019s the entire package, and Carson should know that. We can divide the big ticket elements of the Affordable Care Act into two buckets to make things easy; the goodies and the baddies.\n\nOn the goodies side we find all sorts of great sounding stuff which people like. There\u2019s the idea of people with preexisting conditions getting coverage which Carson clearly likes. Heck\u2026 I like it too! It sounds just great. There\u2019s also keeping kids on your policy for longer, wellness initiatives and all manner of other things which carry great populist appeal. Then there\u2019s the baddies. The mandates \u2013 both individual and employer \u2013 and the spectacularly unsuccessful attempts to \u201cinfluence\u201d prices downward, the anaconda style entanglement with Medicaid and all the rest.\n\nThe problem is, you don\u2019t get one without the other. If Carson is willing to keep only the government mandate that people with preexisting conditions must be covered without penalty, the underlying system of insurance policies collapses. Why would anyone \u2013 particularly the young and relatively healthy \u2013 waste their money paying for insurance until they actually become seriously ill? Then, when you get the terrible diagnosis, you just pick up the phone and start your policy. Insurance companies would either go out of business overnight or jack up everyone\u2019s rates astronomically to cover their losses. It\u2019s pretty much the opposite of a win-win.\n\nI\u2019m glad to see Carson still out there mixing it up, but I think he needs to continue getting some tutoring on policy and stay awake in debate prep school. He\u2019s a smart guy with a lot of good ideas, a solidly conservative stance on most of the subjects of interest to the Right and he has a winning personality on the stump. In short, he has most of the baseline boxes checked off for what you want in a potentially successful candidate. But he\u2019s going to have to get all of his policy details down pat before he takes on the rest of the leaders in the current field. This exchange with his supporters was not encouraging.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Yeah, but that\u2019s a pretty big piece", "title": "Carson would dump all of Obamacare but one piece", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/27/carson-would-dump-all-of-obamacare-but-one-piece/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-27T12:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T11:46:43+00:00"}, "keywords": "Ben Carson, health insurance, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b1e\"", "article_summary": "The problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t the individual items\u2026 it\u2019s the entire package, and Carson should know that.\nCarson would dump all of Obamacare but one pieceposted at 8:01 am on July 27, 2015 by Jazz ShawRemember that neurosurgeon guy who said he wanted to run for President?\nSticking with a health care theme, he also addressed Obamacare, which he still wants to cancel almost entirely\u2026 but not quite.\nBut Carson is still out there on the trail, so it seems fitting to check in on him.\nThere\u2019s the idea of people with preexisting conditions getting coverage which Carson clearly likes."}
