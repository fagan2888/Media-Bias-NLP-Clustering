Burwell case, which risks depriving 8 million people of health insurance and death-spiraling the individual insurance markets in 37 states. I received an email from a reader chastising me for defending Obamacare. Wasn\u2019t I aware, the reader inveighed, that the Affordable Care Act is unaffordable? Did I not know that the law has robbed millions of their health care and even more of their jobs?\n\nOn one level the note was nonsensical, a propaganda scrum focused on Obamacare, which will achieve its fifth anniversary this month. But especially in the context of both King v. Burwell and 2016, it highlights a trap for the GOP.\n\nStart with the facts. Just last week the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law will cost 29 percent \u2013 that\u2019s more than $200 billion \u2013 less than originally forecast when it was enacted five years ago. And as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff and Ezra Klein report, the government is on track to spend $600 billion less on health care in this decade than was first projected in 2010, pre-Obamacare. Put another way, the government is spending less now even with the new outlays in the law than it anticipated spending before. This should not be hugely surprising given that the CBO originally scored the law as a deficit-reducer, but along with the dropping price tag it\u2019s a striking reminder.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nOn the topic of whether the law has cost people their health insurance, the talking point is also at variance with the facts. Last year, for example, the Washington Post\u2019s fact checker awarded House Speaker John Boehner \u201cFour Pinocchios\u201d for asserting that Obamacare had caused a net loss of insurance. Weeks later FactCheck.org wrote that the claim that \u201cmillions\u201d of people have lost insurance because of Obamacare is \u201cmisleading. Those individual market plans were discontinued, but policyholders weren\u2019t denied coverage.\u201d Most lost old policies but got new ones.\n\nAnd more to the point, the overall uninsured figure has dropped sharply. A January Gallup survey found that the uninsured rate dropped to 12.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from 17.1 percent a year earlier. These results were in keeping with other independent findings on this topic. Around the same time, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed that the number of uninsured Americans fell by 6.8 million in the first half of the year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Just this week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that 16.4 million people have gained insurance under Obamacare in the five years since it was enacted; that's a 35 percent decline in the uninsured rate.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Republican Party]\n\nWhat about the jobs? \u201cIt\u2019s going to destroy our economy,\u201d then-Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican of Georgia, said in October, 2013. That\u2019s pretty tough stuff. And it\u2019s wrong. When President Barack Obama signed Obamacare into law, the unemployment rate stood at 9.7 percent. It\u2019s now 5.5 percent. As ThinkProgress has noted, February\u2019s addition of 295,000 jobs marked the 12th straight month with more than 200,000 added \u2013 the longest streak of that kind since 1977. And PwC\u2019s 2015 survey of CEOs found that for the first time in five years, \u201cmore business leaders rate the U.S. as their most important market for overseas growth ahead of all others, including China\u2019s.\u201d I\u2019ll sign up for that level of destruction any day.\n\nBut as is so often the case in politics, inconvenient data does little to change rhetoric. Last year\u2019s gloomdoggling predictions aren\u2019t slain by facts, they merely morph into well-worn right-wing urban legend. So as recently as last week, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch could blandly assert to The New York Times that \u201cObamacare is going to bankrupt the country.\u201d (\u201cOnce people get hooked on it, the only answer is to move this country to socialism,\u201d he added.) Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush last week declared Obamacare to be a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that was \u201cthe greatest job suppressor in the so-called recovery.\u201d And so on.\n\nGiven the GOP\u2019s unbending attitude toward the law, it seems safe to say that 2016 GOPers will fall over themselves to match Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s insistence that \u201cevery last word of Obamacare must be repealed.\u201d Like 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee will probably invoke the idea of day one executive orders to pave the way. That in and of itself could prove problematic if Democrats can ever figure out how to marshal the facts enough to even up Obamacare\u2019s upside-down poll numbers.\n\n\n\n[READ: View You Can Use: Four Little Words]\n\nBut King v. Burwell could pose an especially pointed problem. Recall the 8 million people who stand to lose their insurance if the high court declares that the IRS\u2019s allowing subsidies for federally-run exchanges violates the law. Chief Justice John Roberts was uncharacteristically quiet during the King arguments. The one question he did ask was whether a future administration\u2019s IRS could reverse the current view of the law. Noting that Roberts is a longtime advocate of an expansive executive and so might be loath to restrict it in this case (by overruling the IRS), The New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin wrote, \u201cThe question suggests a route out of the case for Roberts\u2014and the potential for a victory for the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nIf Roberts couples another Obamacare victory with a reminder that a GOP president holds the power to reinterpret the law, he would also be setting a trap for Republicans who vow to use any means available to eradicate the act. Even if Republicans don\u2019t say it explicitly, any Democratic ad-maker worth their salt will note that this would start with reinterpreting the subsidies issue \u2013 so costing 8 million Americans their health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Op-Ed [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Trapped By Their Obamacare Errors", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Republicans get the Affordable Care Act wrong on unemployment, cost and the uninsured rate.", "title": "Trapped By Reality", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2015/03/18/republicans-trapped-by-their-obamacare-errors", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/36/f51e1fdbb8dc5c1b9956d9ee3c0b93/media:0923664593c5441e8132a852404fecbfCongressHomelandAnalysis.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Republicans get the Affordable Care Act wrong on unemployment, cost and the uninsured rate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans Trapped By Their Obamacare Errors"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert Schlesinger,Affordable Care Act,Republican Party,Congress,Obama, Barack,economy,picks,Op-Ed [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republicans get the Affordable Care Act wrong on unemployment, cost and the uninsured rate."}, "article_summary": "Weeks later FactCheck.org wrote that the claim that \u201cmillions\u201d of people have lost insurance because of Obamacare is \u201cmisleading.\nOn one level the note was nonsensical, a propaganda scrum focused on Obamacare, which will achieve its fifth anniversary this month.\nJeb Bush last week declared Obamacare to be a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that was \u201cthe greatest job suppressor in the so-called recovery.\u201d And so on.\nWhen President Barack Obama signed Obamacare into law, the unemployment rate stood at 9.7 percent.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]On the topic of whether the law has cost people their health insurance, the talking point is also at variance with the facts."}
