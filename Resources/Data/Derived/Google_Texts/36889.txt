The Rockies on Saturday gave away 15,000 Troy Tulowitzki jerseys to fans at Coors Field before their game against the Pirates.

Just one issue: The jerseys spelled Tulo’s name wrong.

The second T was missing — and ‘Tulowizki’ it was instead.

Some fans proclaimed the jersey an instant collector’s item, something like Billy Ripken’s notorious baseball card from 1989 or something like the left-handed hitting Hank Aaron card from 1957.

Other wiseacres on Twitter suggested the jersey manufacturer should have left out the W (because the Rockies have fewer wins this season than losses, if that’s not clear).

The Rockies released a statement about the shirt misspelling:

The Colorado Rockies offer our sincere apologies to the fans for the misspelling of the Troy Tulowitzki King Soopers jersey that was distributed tonight. The Rockies would also like to apologize to longtime corporate partner King Soopers, who was not involved in the production of the jerseys. Acknowledging that many fans came to the game for the jersey, rather than disappoint them, we decided to go ahead and hand them out. We have made plans to reproduce the jersey and fans wishing to exchange will be able to do so at a future date (TBD) in September at Coors Field or the Rockies Dugout Stores. In addition, fans exchanging the jersey will receive a complimentary ticket to a future game in 2014 or 2015.
