Why? I\u2019ve listened intently. I\u2019ve heard four arguments asserted, none of which makes any sense. So, let\u2019s review the concept.\n\n\u2022 First, some assert that it will help attract business to Maine.\n\nabout the author Andy Wright of Cumberland Foreside, a retired executive who has owned two small companies, has a bachelor of science degree in economics and a master of business administration from the University of Chicago. Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nMany times in my career, I helped investigate the relocation of companies and/or manufacturing facilities to other states. We evaluated skilled labor availability, real estate costs, labor rates, economic development grants, offers of tax increment financing and other relevant criteria, but never the state income tax rate. It wasn\u2019t relevant to our decision. So by what economic theory will eliminating the state income tax help bring jobs to Maine?\n\nSome will point to states such as South Dakota, Louisiana, Nevada, Texas, Florida and Alaska that have no income tax and enjoy a higher economic growth rate than Maine does.\n\nBut a closer look fails to prove any cause-and-effect relationship. These states are growing for other, non-tax reasons, such as population migration, oil discoveries, aggressive economic grants and incentives, acceptance of Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid and other serendipitous economic variables.\n\nNo study has ever demonstrated that a correlation exists between lowering income tax rates and subsequent economic growth.\n\nMost income tax reductions go to the wealthy, who have an extremely low propensity to spend since their consumption needs have already been met. Nor do they tend to invest this newfound money locally. So the income tax cut results in no discernible increase in economic activity.\n\n\u2022 Second, I\u2019ve heard that eliminating the income tax will help attract and maintain wealthy retirees. Hmm, don\u2019t we want them here so we can collect their taxes?\n\nTheir consumption days are typically over, so the consumption-based tax system won\u2019t help us.\n\nAnd I have to believe that it\u2019s a small minority of retirees who base their retirement decision on tax policy. For every tax-motivated retiree that we attract, we\u2019d sacrifice 100 percent of the income taxes from all the others who stay here regardless of our tax policy because Maine\u2019s a great place to live \u2013 an ill-conceived trade-off!\n\nAnd even if you wanted to give tax incentives to retirees, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to just leave the state income tax alone and offer various tax credits to people over 65?\n\n\u2022 Third, it has been asserted that it will increase taxes on tourists \u2013 an excellent concept that I fully support. But the most efficient way to do this is to increase lodging, rental car and restaurant taxes.\n\nOr place a special state assessment at the York tollbooth, Portland International Jetport and Portland Pier.\n\nOr increase sales and gas taxes in the summer months, but lower them the rest of the year so that, over the course of the year, tourists pay more, but Mainers do not.\n\nOr give full-year residents a large \u201chomestead exemption\u201d on property taxes that out-of-staters don\u2019t get. But most of these ideas haven\u2019t even been proposed.\n\nIn reality, the elimination of the income tax does absolutely nothing to transfer more of our tax burden to tourists. It\u2019s the myriad of other taxes that replace the income tax that accomplishes it by sheer coincidence and without conviction.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, proponents say that replacing income taxes with a broader consumption tax \u201csmooths\u201d tax collections and helps us avoid the boom-and-bust tax inflows when the economy cycles.\n\nBut the best way to accomplish this is with a partial replacement of the income tax with other, broader consumption taxes \u2013 not by eliminating the income tax.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the correct way to avoid boom-and-bust revenue inflows was passed in 2009, and Republicans rallied to kill it in 2010 via a people\u2019s veto.\n\nHelp me out, governor. The income tax is the most fair and efficient tax system. Give me a reason to support eliminating it, because it looks to me like another Republican Party method to further enrich the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\n\nIt appears to be part of the conservatives\u2019 \u201cstarve the beast\u201d strategy: Dramatically slash tax revenues to justify draconian cuts to state spending, thus disproportionately harming the poor, the disadvantaged and the middle class.\n\nIf not, then please explain to me why eliminating the state income tax is in the best interest of the average Mainer.
