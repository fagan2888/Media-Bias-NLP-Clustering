Campaigning in Milwaukee Thursday, Chelsea Clinton said her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be the better choice for Democratic voters in the April 5 Wisconsin presidential primary.

The younger Clinton told news reporters that her mom has a lot of experience with some key issues.

"Whether around college affordability, or health care reform or criminal justice or someone else asked me about early childhood education, I think my mom has a stronger record of not only fighting for those issues, but delivering those issues and stronger plans for what she would do as president," Clinton said.

Chelsea Clinton took questions from a few of the 100 or so people who came to hear her talk at a Clinton campaign office in a predominantly African-American Milwaukee neighborhood. One woman raised concerns about police efforts in Milwaukee's black neighborhoods in the name of the war on drugs. Clinton said her mother would try to change some laws.

"My mom has said we need to, at the federal level, decriminalize the possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use and apply that retroactively, (and) do the same with reforming or getting rid of three strike laws or minimum sentencing laws," said Clinton, adding that hopefully, state and local governments would follow suit.

She also spoke of improving education and mental health care for African-Americans.

Clinton made stops Tuesday to meet with supporters in Waukesha and Madison as well.

Earlier this week, Jane Sanders, wife of Hillary Clinton's Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, told Wisconsin Public Radio that her husband's positions on issues like raising the minimum wage would be a better fit for Wisconsin.

Chelsea Clinton said she "would think" that her mother will visit Wisconsin before April 5. Bernie Sanders will speak in Madison on Saturday.
