While chlorpyrifos can no longer legally be used around the house or in the garden, it is still legal to use on the farm. But researchers are finding that children aren\u2019t safe when the insecticide is applied to nearby fields.\n\nThe entrance to Dow\u2019s fields near Waimea in Kaua\u2019i. While chlorpyrifos can no longer legally be used around the house or in the garden, it is still legal to use on the farm.\n\nLike a ghost drifting through a child\u2019s bedroom window, the airborne insecticide can settle on children\u2019s skin, clothes, toys, rugs, and furnishings.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s likely that the only people who needn\u2019t worry about exposure to chlorpyrifos are adults living far from the fields in which it is sprayed. That includes civil servants who work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which regulates the stuff, and executives with Dow Chemical, the company that manufactures it.\n\nIn a regulatory process known as re-registration, the EPA will decide in 2015 whether it still agrees that chlorpyrifos is safe for farming, or whether it will order a complete ban, as Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Pesticide Action Network have demanded in lawsuits filed in 2007 and in 2014.\n\nDow has long insisted that its chlorpyrifos products are safe, despite tens of thousands of reports of acute poisoning and multiple studies linking low-level exposures to children with lower IQ. The company also has a long history \u2014 going back decades \u2014 of concealing from the public the many health problems it knew were linked to chlorpyrifos.\n\nIn 1995, the EPA found that Dow had violated federal law by covering up its knowledge of these health problems for years. In 2004, then-New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer found that Dow had been lying about the known dangers of the pesticide in its advertising for nearly as long. Together, the EPA and the State of New York have levied fines against the company approaching $3 million.\n\nOn Kaua\u2018i, subsidiaries of four transnational chemical companies\u2014Dow Chemical, DuPont, Syngenta, and BASF\u2014spray chlorpyrifos and several other potent pesticides to protect their experimental genetically engineered crops (GMOs) against a wide variety of bugs and weeds. Because of the heavy pesticide use, Kaua\u2018i\u2019s GMO testing fields are among the most toxic chemical environments in all of American agriculture. The island, with its precious ecosystems and diverse wildlife, seems particularly ill-suited to be a laboratory for such experiments.\n\nIn two incidents in 2006 and 2008, all students at the Waimea Middle School on Kaua\u2018i were evacuated and about 60 were hospitalized with flu-like symptoms like dizziness, headaches, and nausea. Many people in town blamed the outbreak on chlorpyrifos dust and vapors that they believed had drifted from the nearby GMO test fields. The corporations denied that any illnesses were caused by their products and officials only tested for a few of the possible chemicals that could have contaminated the school and children.\n\nThe companies conduct their experiments on Kaua\u2018i because it has a 12-month growing season, and they can get in three or four crops each year. As Steve Savage, a former research manager for DuPont, has stated that they protect their GMO crops with chemicals to protect their large investments.\n\n\u201cThe pesticides used on the seed farms are mostly just there to protect these very valuable seeds from pest damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is more challenging because there is no winter to set-back the populations of things like insects. Some of the tropical weeds are also very challenging to control.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that chlorpyrifos is efficient at killing insects. But the question before the EPA re-registration process is, \u201cWhat is it doing to children?\u201d\n\nThe EPA\u2019s Tepid Investigation of Dow\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency never determined how many lives were ruined or\n\nlost as a result of harm caused by chlorpyrifos or Dow\u2019s cover-up.\n\nThe last time chlorpyrifos went through the re-registration process was in 2000. (The EPA is required to do that every 15 years.) At the time, Dow was fighting off several lawsuits from families with children poisoned by the chemical. It also faced an almost certain regulatory crackdown by the EPA. A large number of children and adults were being poisoned by more than 800 different chlorpyrifos-containing products that were commonly used around the house, including Dursban, Raid, Black Flag Liquid Roach and Ant Killer and Hartz Mountain Flea and Tick Collar. Chlorpyrifos applied by pest control operators also often led to serious health effects.\n\nUnder the terms of an agreement between Dow and the EPA, chlorpyrifos products for indoor use were taken off store shelves at the end of 2001 and were banned in schools, parks, and at day care centers. They continued to be used on the farm under the trade name Lorsban.\n\nDow Chemical started selling chlorpyrifos in 1965. In 1972, when the EPA banned DDT and other bug-killers, chlorpyrifos was there to take their place. There was a time when chlorpyrifos was invited into most homes in America on a daily basis. Approximately 21 to 24 million pounds were used annually in the US, of which about 11 million pounds were applied in the home, where the chemical\u2019s main job was to kill termites.\n\nBecause of its extensive use in the home before the ban in 2000, the vast majority of the US population was exposed to chlorpyrifos or its environmental breakdown product, trichloropyridinol (TCP). A 1999 Minnesota Children\u2019s Exposure Study found that 92 percent of the 89 children evaluated had measurable amounts of TCP in their urine. A 1999 study of 416 children in North and South Carolina found TCP in the urine of all the children evaluated.\n\nChlorpyrifos belongs to a class of pesticides known as organophosphates, which are designed to interfere with the way insect brains operate. They can also interfere with human brains. Some people are more sensitive to chlorpyrifos based on their genes, according to the EPA.\n\nA 2000 EPA review of \u201cincidents\u201d caused by chlorpyrifos notes: \u201cChildren under six were three times more likely to be hospitalized, five times more likely to be admitted for critical care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and three times more likely to have experienced a life-threatening outcome or death when exposed to an organophosphate than when exposed to non-organophosphate pesticides.\u201d\n\nBy 1984, the number of chlorpyrifos poisonings in the home had begun to rise, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers.\n\nThe Poison Control Centers found that the annual number of reported chlorpyrifos poisoning cases before 2000 was close to 7,000. Many of these exposures involved small children who never developed symptoms, but several hundred cases per year were serious enough to require special medical attention. At least three children died. For example, in 1996, among the victims who received medical follow-up care, 567 experienced moderate, major, or life-threatening effects.\n\n\u201cThese data do suggest that inhalation or dermal exposure can lead to life-threatening effects,\u201d the EPA said in 2000.\n\nThe EPA accused Dow of concealing what it knew about the negative health effects of chlorpyrifos from 1984 to 1994 when CBS News investigated an incident in which the parents of a disabled child obtained a judgment against Dow for injuries that a court found were caused by a prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos.\n\nUnder the Federal Insecticide, Rodenticide, and Fungicide Act (FIFRA), the nation\u2019s main law regulating pesticide use, pesticide manufacturers like Dow are required to report to the EPA any complaints they receive about pesticide poisonings within 30 days. The law is designed to warn the EPA of all known health dangers associated with a product so it can prevent further poisonings and save lives. The EPA fined Dow $876,000 for 327 violations of FIFRA, but it failed to investigate any deeper.\n\nThe EPA never determined how many lives were ruined or lost as a result of harm caused by chlorpyrifos or Dow\u2019s cover-up. Nor did the EPA ever open a criminal investigation to find out who at the company knew about the health problems or why they didn\u2019t report them to the EPA. The EPA never determined whether responsibility for the cover-up extended all the way to the top of the corporate ladder or was limited to lower-level employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data show insecticides can cause significant harm to children.
