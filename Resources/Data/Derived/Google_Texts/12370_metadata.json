While the intent of insuring the masses is admirable, it is the middle-class who are being asked to pay for it and at higher prices. Add this to increased costs of utilities, groceries and other life necessities, and the situation is unsustainable for Alaskans. It\u2019s likely to push more people to government assistance, and the middle class toward delayed health care. If a patient has to pay high premiums and a high deductible, that\u2019s enough incentive to put off medical care.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in the King v. Burwell case upheld Obama Care subsidies this week. The federal subsidies are secured for eligible Americans in all states.\n\nIf Obamacare had been what it was promised to be and do, by now it\u2019s opposition would have had to change its tune or simply not comment. But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan says \u201cObamacare has failed to deliver on its promises. ... Premiums for Alaskans are skyrocketing. ... Thousands (of Americans, including Alaskans) have lost their plans and lost their doctors. ... when the so-called \u2019Cadillac Tax\u2019 kicks in, thousands of Alaskan workers will be paying even more in taxes\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s increased premium prices of their own, plus increased taxes to pay for government employees increases. Some governments have insurance plans that the federal government deems of Cadillac quality.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski points out that \u201conly 11 percent of Americans see (Obamacare) as succeeding.\u201d (Eight-nine percent of Americans cannot be wrong.) \u201cIn Alaska we continue to see the promise of affordable care move further and further away as our costs skyrocket,\u201d she adds.\n\nCongressman Don Young sums up the delegation\u2019s intent: \u201cI will continue to work with my colleagues to repeal this law and replace it with patient-centered reforms that allow for freedom and flexibility\u201d instead of overregulation.\n\nObamacare overregulation and costs are hurting Alaskans. In health care, the idea isn\u2019t to hurt, but to heal.\n\nNo wonder the act got it wrong in name and effect as well.\n\n-The Ketchikan Daily News (A.K.)", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "opinion", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourconroenews.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is a misnomer.", "title": "Affordable Care Act: a misnomer", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/opinion/affordable-care-act-a-misnomer/article_ed29dc42-be8a-5ea8-b159-765630f80034.html", "image": "undefined", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is a misnomer."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s likely to push more people to government assistance, and the middle class toward delayed health care.\nThe Affordable Care Act is a misnomer.\nIn health care, the idea isn\u2019t to hurt, but to heal.\n\u201cIn Alaska we continue to see the promise of affordable care move further and further away as our costs skyrocket,\u201d she adds.\nAdd this to increased costs of utilities, groceries and other life necessities, and the situation is unsustainable for Alaskans."}
