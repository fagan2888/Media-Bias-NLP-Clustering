The Republican race is taking shape! The latest poll conducted by Connecticut\u2019s Quinnipiac University says so.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nThere\u2019s former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson . There\u2019s also Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee . (I use their titles to help you keep them straight. As the race gets even more crowded , you will thank me for this.)\n\nIn the poll, each man clocks in at a mere 10 percent.\n\nNot excited? Look deeper, people. When the Quinnipiac pollsters ask which Republican would run best against Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2014 all of a sudden Rand Paul and Rubio leap to the head of the pack.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. When you look at the runners up \u2014 the candidate voters would most likely choose as a backup \u2014 Texas Senator Ted Cruz joins the popular kids.\n\nFor now, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former business executive Carly Fiorina, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal score pretty dismally. Businessman Donald Trump actually comes in first \u2014 among voters who say there is \u201cno way\u201d they would vote for him.\n\nAnd, hey, it could be worse. No one even asked about former New York Governor George Pataki, who is actually an announced candidate.\n\nSo many numbers to digest. If they\u2019re lucky, ten of these candidates get to crowd onto a debate stage late this summer \u2014 a year in advance of the nominating convention \u2014 to elbow one another aside.\n\nBut here\u2019s why it\u2019s all so ridiculous.\n\nWe don\u2019t have national primaries. Each of these candidates will have to slug it out state by state to even make it to their nominating convention. In the case of the crowded GOP field, they will have to slug it out state by state to even make it onto a debate stage.\n\nThis is why we have the spectacle of Fiorina popping up outside Clinton events to denounce a woman she is not even running against yet. Jesse James robbed banks because that\u2019s where the money was; Fiorina stalks Hillary Clinton because that\u2019s where the cameras are.\n\nSo it\u2019s OK to read the polls. I do. But there is this caution. Ignore the horse race for now. Except to the degree it dictates chances for survival, it is ridiculous. People with deep pockets read those polls to make sure they are making a wise investment. And people who send cameras to cover press conferences do too. All of this dictates outcome. The rest of us can take a deep breath.\n\nThere is plenty of time to decide whether the polls \u2014 or the debates alone \u2014 will tell the story. Until then, read them \u2014 there will be many \u2014 but keep a grain of salt handy at all times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican race is taking shape!
