So far, you head-in-the-sand Democrats are crying about Trumpâ€™s qualifications to be the next president.

OK, let me remind you of a person that has been president for almost the last eight years. Qualifications: Chicago community leader, one year in the Senate. Most of the time posturing to run for president.

Now, there might be someone to shake up the political establishment, like lifetime politicians, who are so entrenched with their own well-being, they cannot see the forest for the trees.

Gladly, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd (the authors of the mortgage crises, via the Community Reinvestment Act) are gone, and soon, thankfully, Harry Reid. Now, if only Nancy Pelosi will exit, our country will be very grateful, and Congress will get issues resolved.

Obamacare is imploding, strong foreign policy is a joke. Our military is the weakest it has ever been. The economy also is struggling. So, do we want an Obama clone as in Hillary Clinton? I think not.
