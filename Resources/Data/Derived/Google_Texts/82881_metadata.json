Project coordinators said Jessica was working on a paper about dragonflies when she was snatched from the park, one year ago, while walking to her nearby Witt Elementary School.\n\n\u201cJessica\u2019s laughter will be here echoing forever,\u201d her grandmother Christine Ridgeway said during a 30-minute ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony follows guilty pleas on Tuesday by Austin Sigg, 18, who confessed to kidnapping, abusing, killing and dismembering Jessica and also attacking a jogger. Sigg is to be sentenced in November, and prosecutors say they\u2019ll seek consecutive terms so that he is never released from prison.\n\nBeneath a sign at the west entrance of the 3.2-acre park, friends set out cherished items: a softball inscribed by \u201cRayshell\u201d (\u201cI remember playing catch with you\u201d), a marble, a painted rock, a quarter, a doll, a yellow Frisbee. Gold leaves fell from trees decorated with purple ribbons.\n\nDogs barked behind fences as people \u2014 police estimated the crowd at 600 \u2014 walked and rode in golf carts toward the park.\n\nFamily members sat on a stage by a photo portrait and collage showing a smiling girl in glasses, goggles, sombrero, blowing a bubble.\n\n\u201cWhat Jessica leaves as a legacy is much bigger than a park,\u201d Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk said. \u201cShe reminded us how precious life is and how fleeting it can be.\u201d\n\nPolice officers who worked on the case \u2014 75 agencies assisted \u2014 \u201care profoundly touched by it and feel as if Jessica was our own daughter,\u201d Birk said.\n\nWestminster Mayor Nancy McNally reminded family members: \u201cThis community stands behind you.\u201d\n\nJessica\u2019s grandmother, Christine, looked out at Jessica\u2019s classmates standing solemnly before the stage and told them: \u201cGo play. Jessica would not want you standing here mourning her.\u201d\n\nBut they stayed.\n\nThe family released 10 purple balloons to honor Jessica\u2019s 10 years of life.\n\nAnd then, scores of children did play \u2014 twirling, twisting and testing their climbing skills on the playground apparatus.\n\nThe classmates supplied park designers with the jokes. Examples:\n\n\u2022 Knock knock. Who\u2019s there? Abner. Abner who? Abner-noon, pard-ner.\n\n\u2022 Knock knock. Who\u2019s there? Alex. Alex who? Alex the questions around here.\n\n\u2022 Knock knock. Who\u2019s there? A little old lady. A little old lady who? I didn\u2019t know you could yodel.\n\nReading these words as she stood on the green cement forced retired fifth-grade teacher Janelle Bratten, 62, to turn in circles like a child. She loves Jessica\u2019s park, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is who she is.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, twitter.com/finleybruce or bfinley@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Westminster park, dedicated to slain Jessica Ridgeway, opens", "title": "Westminster park, dedicated to slain Jessica Ridgeway, opens", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/05/westminster-park-dedicated-to-slain-jessica-ridgeway-opens/", "image": {"width": 385, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131005__20131006_B2_cd06jessicap2.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131005__20131006_B2_cd06jessicap2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-05T13:48:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:02:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde932\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 Knock knock.\nExamples:\u2022 Knock knock.\n\u201cWhat Jessica leaves as a legacy is much bigger than a park,\u201d Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk said.\nWESTMINSTER \u2014Knock-knock jokes of the sort that slain 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway loved, etched into cement, adorn the park that was dedicated Saturday morning in her memory.\nShe loves Jessica\u2019s park, she said."}
