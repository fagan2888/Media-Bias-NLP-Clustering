So for now, all those affected are being told to wait.\n\nAndrew Slavitt, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the government needs time to sort out the mistakes.\n\n\"So we're notifying people,\" Slavitt told reporters Friday. \"We've already begun notifying people today. They'll get a corrected form beginning the first week of March.\"\n\nThe administration has also announced a special enrollment period from March 15 to April 30 for people who did not realize they'd have to pay a penalty for not having health care coverage.\n\nAbout 6.5 million people are receiving tax credits to help pay for their insurance through the federal marketplace. Officials don't yet know what caused the problem for the 800,000, but options range from human error to a software glitch.\n\nWith filing season underway, it's causing complications. The world's largest tax services provider, H&R Block, warned in a statement Friday that those who already filed \"could face an additional repayment obligation.\" Others could see their tax returns delayed.\n\nFriday's snafu is a blemish on the federal enrollment season, which officials said saw 11.4 million people sign up or renew Obamacare plans. It's reminiscent of last year's debacle when the federal website crashed multiple times at launch.\n\nRepublicans are pouncing.\n\nIn a letter sent late Friday to the Department of Health and Human Services, Rep. Pete Roskam, R-Illinois, demanded answers, writing \"This error has created additional uncertainty in a tax season already filled with unprecedented challenges and complexity for taxpayers.\"\n\nIt's also amplifying calls from Republicans to repeal the law.\n\nThe White House is playing down the glitch, saying this is just a very small fraction of people affected and they should still have plenty of time to file by the April 15 deadline with the right information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "World&#039;s largest tax services provider warns some taxpayers &quot;could face an additional repayment obligation&quot;", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-complications-tax-returns/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/21/8ea3cf4c-a3e1-4ef3-b41d-0a235b850d91/thumbnail/1200x630/4d43c0c2b6a1b59c2f7c623980a13ded/obamacare-2015-01-24t192537z.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "World's largest tax services provider warns some taxpayers \"could face an additional repayment obligation\"", "title": "Obamacare snafu causing complications with tax returns"}, "twitter": {"description": "World's largest tax services provider warns some taxpayers \"could face an additional repayment obligation\"", "title": "Obamacare snafu causing complications with tax returns", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-complications-tax-returns/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-complications-tax-returns/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-complications-tax-returns/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbsthismorning", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/02/21/8ea3cf4c-a3e1-4ef3-b41d-0a235b850d91/thumbnail/1200x630/4d43c0c2b6a1b59c2f7c623980a13ded/obamacare-2015-01-24t192537z.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-complications-tax-returns/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-complications-tax-returns/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSThisMorning"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd891f\"", "article_summary": "The world's largest tax services provider, H&R Block, warned in a statement Friday that those who already filed \"could face an additional repayment obligation.\"\nWith filing season underway, it's causing complications.\nFriday's snafu is a blemish on the federal enrollment season, which officials said saw 11.4 million people sign up or renew Obamacare plans.\nAbout 6.5 million people are receiving tax credits to help pay for their insurance through the federal marketplace.\nOfficials are trying to fix a problem that could be a headache for hundreds of thousands of taxpayers enrolled in Obamacare."}
