But the crop extracts a staggering price from the land, consuming more water than all the showering, dish-washing and other indoor household water use of California\u2019s 39 million people.\n\nAs California enters its fourth year of drought and imposes the first mandatory statewide water cutbacks on cities and towns, the $6.5 billion almond crop is helping drive a sharp debate about water use, agricultural interests and how both affect the state\u2019s giant economy.\n\nAlmonds have claimed the spotlight as \u201cthe poster child of all things bad in water,\u201d almond grower Bob Weimer said.\n\nPeople around the world are eating over 1,000 percent more California almonds than they did just a decade ago, and last year almonds became the top export crop in the nation\u2019s top agriculture state. China\u2019s booming middle class is driving much of the demand.\n\nThat strong Asia market is producing up to 30 percent returns for investors, prompting agri-businesses to expand almond planting in the state by two-thirds in the past decade. The crop has come to be dominated by global corporations and investment funds.\n\nRows of almond trees now cover nearly 1 million acres in California, many of them on previously virgin hillsides or in pastures or desert with little rain or local water. Since each tiny nut requires a gallon of water, almonds are consuming 1.07 trillion gallons annually in the state, one-fifth more than California families use indoors.\n\nSo when Gov. Jerry Brown ordered cities and towns this month to cut their water consumption by 25 percent but exempted farms, almonds got toasted in the public heat that followed.\n\n\u201cDrought villains?\u201d the Los Angeles Times asked this month. A Sacramento TV station referred to \u201calmond-shaming.\u201d National Public Radio called almond farms \u201ca rogue\u2019s gallery\u201d of water users.\n\nNow almond farmers and investors are on the defensive.\n\n\u201cThe tomato growers use a lot more water than we do. You should go after those guys,\u201d said Ryon Paton, a global real-estate developer and principal of Trinitas Partners.\n\nPaton\u2019s online literature tells investors to think of his newly planted almond orchards in Stanislaus County as \u201cthe classic Silicon Valley startup, except we have nothing to do with technology.\u201d\n\nHe regularly has to deny rumors \u2014 including from fellow almond farmers \u2014 that celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Condoleezza Rice are among the investors drawn to his almond fund.\n\nCalifornia growers provide 80 percent of the global supply of almonds. In China, where the number of middle-class households has doubled since 2006, consumers see almonds as a healthy snack and regard American food in general as less contaminated than products from elsewhere.\n\nCalifornia almonds are a popular bagged treat in China\u2019s convenience stores and supermarkets and a must-have item in holiday gift baskets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almonds get roasted in debate over California water use", "title": "Almonds get roasted in debate over California water use", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Almonds get roasted in debate over California water use", "title": "Almonds get roasted in debate over California water use", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/almonds_get_roasted_in_debate_over_california_water_use/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/california-drought-almonds.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Almonds get roasted in debate over California water use", "title": "Almonds get roasted in debate over California water use", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/california-drought-almonds.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ellen Knickmeyer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c7a\"", "article_summary": "California almonds are a popular bagged treat in China\u2019s convenience stores and supermarkets and a must-have item in holiday gift baskets.\nAlmonds have claimed the spotlight as \u201cthe poster child of all things bad in water,\u201d almond grower Bob Weimer said.\nSince each tiny nut requires a gallon of water, almonds are consuming 1.07 trillion gallons annually in the state, one-fifth more than California families use indoors.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 California almonds are becoming one of the world\u2019s favorite snacks and creating a multibillion-dollar bonanza for agricultural investors.\nPeople around the world are eating over 1,000 percent more California almonds than they did just a decade ago, and last year almonds became the top export crop in the nation\u2019s top agriculture state."}
