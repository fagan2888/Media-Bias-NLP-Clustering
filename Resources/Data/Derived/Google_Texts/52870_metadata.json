The technique would diagnose a patient within the hour.\n\nIn the study, researchers reviewed 1,320 patients who had been in the emergency room for suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI), another term for a heart attack. The technique, which involves a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T 1-hour algorithm, was applied to blood samples from the patients. The researchers discovered that 786 (or 60 percent) of patients didn\u2019t have a heart attack, 16 percent did, and 24 percent didn\u2019t have fully conclusive results and needed to be checked further.\n\n\u201cIntroducing the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T 1-hour algorithm into clinical practice would represent a profound change, and it is therefore important to determine if it works in a large patient group,\u201d said Dr. Tobias Reichlin of the Division of Cardiology at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland, and an author of the study, in a press release.\n\nTypically, doctors diagnose heart attacks after the fact through an EKG (electrocardiogram), which records the heart\u2019s electrical activity. An EKG can show heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as the precursors to a heart attack or a current heart attacks. Blood tests can also detect changes of protein levels in the blood after a heart attack, and a coronary angiography is a type of X-ray test that allows doctors to see the inside of coronary arteries.\n\nBut these techniques often take hours to complete. According to a previous study on the new technique, published in 2012, heart attack patients make up about 10 percent of all emergency department consultations, and often delays in diagnosing disease \u201cholds back prompt use of evidence-based therapies.\u201d\n\nThe new technique, however, would eliminate much of this delay if incorporated into hospitals, the authors argue.\n\n\u201cThis rapid strategy incorporating high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T baseline values and absolute changes after the first hour substantially accelerates the management of patients with suspected acute MI by allowing safe rule-out as well as accurate rule-in of acute MI in three out of four patients,\u201d the authors of the new study wrote.\n\nIn other words, finding ways to quickly diagnose heart attacks could be hugely helpful in the clinical setting, giving doctors the time to start early treatment and also manage any cardiovascular events.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "heart attack, myocardial infarction, heart attack diagnosis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers have used an algorithm to discern whether a patient has had a heart attack much more quickly than before.", "title": "Diagnosing Heart Attacks Faster Than Ever Before", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/heart-attack-patients-may-become-diagnosed-within-hour-improves-chances-recovery-329092", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/13/hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers have used an algorithm to discern whether a patient has had a heart attack much more quickly than before.", "title": "Diagnosing Heart Attacks Faster Than Ever Before", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/heart-attack-patients-may-become-diagnosed-within-hour-improves-chances-recovery-329092", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/13/hospital.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/13/hospital.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-13T17:40:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T18:34:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers have used an algorithm to discern whether a patient has had a heart attack much more quickly than before."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9c5\"", "article_summary": "An EKG can show heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as the precursors to a heart attack or a current heart attacks.\nHospitals would be able to diagnose heart attack patients more quickly with a new technique, which would also allow them to treat patients more efficiently.\nTypically, doctors diagnose heart attacks after the fact through an EKG (electrocardiogram), which records the heart\u2019s electrical activity.\nIn the study, researchers reviewed 1,320 patients who had been in the emergency room for suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI), another term for a heart attack.\nIn other words, finding ways to quickly diagnose heart attacks could be hugely helpful in the clinical setting, giving doctors the time to start early treatment and also manage any cardiovascular events."}
