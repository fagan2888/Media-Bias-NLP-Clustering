It said that after entering the country as a tourist he committed an anti-state crime with \u201cthe tacit connivance of the U.S. government and under its manipulation.\u201d\n\nNo details of what kind of charges or punishment Warmbier faces were immediately released.\n\nAccording to Warmbier\u2019s statement Monday, he wanted the banner with a political slogan on it as a trophy for the church member, who was the mother of a friend.\n\nIn previous cases, people who have been detained in North Korea and given a public confession often recant those admissions after their release.\n\nHe was arrested while visiting the country with Young Pioneer Tours, an agency specializing in travel to the North, which is strongly discouraged by the U.S. State Department. He had been staying at the Yanggakdo International Hotel, which is located on an island in a river that runs through Pyongyang.\n\nIt is common for sections of tourist hotels to be reserved for North Korean staff and off-limits to foreigners.\n\nWarmbier is a native of Ohio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, while campaigning in New Hampshire as a Republican presidential candidate, called the arrest \u201cinexcusable.\u201d Kasich has urged President Barack Obama to \u201cmake every effort to secure Mr. Warmbier\u2019s immediate release and keep (his) family constantly apprised.\u201d\n\nKasich said North Korea should either provide evidence of the alleged anti-state activities or release Warmbier.\n\nIn his comments, Warmbier said he was offered a used car worth $10,000 by a member of the church. He said the church member told him the slogan would be hung on its wall as a trophy. He also said he was told that if he was detained and not returned, $200,000 would be paid to his mother in a way of charitable donations.\n\nCalls to the Friendship United Methodist Church went unanswered Monday.\n\nWarmbier named that as the church his acquaintance belonged to and there is church of that name in his hometown, Wyoming, Ohio.\n\nHe said he was also encouraged in his act by the \u201cZ Society\u201d at the University of Virginia, which he said he was trying to join. The magazine of the university\u2019s alumni association describes the Z Society as a \u201csemi-secret ring society\u201d that was founded in 1892 and conducts philanthropy, puts on honorary dinners and grants academic awards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Korea puts tearful detained American before cameras", "title": "North Korea puts tearful detained American before cameras", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "North Korea puts tearful detained American before cameras", "title": "North Korea puts tearful detained American before cameras", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/29/north_korea_puts_tearful_detained_american_before_cameras/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/north-korea-detained-american.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Korea puts tearful detained American before cameras", "title": "North Korea puts tearful detained American before cameras", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/north-korea-detained-american.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Talmadge and Jon Chol Jin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In previous cases, people who have been detained in North Korea and given a public confession often recant those admissions after their release.\nNorth Korea announced in late January it had arrested Otto Warmbier, a 21-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate student.\nHe said he was also encouraged in his act by the \u201cZ Society\u201d at the University of Virginia, which he said he was trying to join.\nThe magazine of the university\u2019s alumni association describes the Z Society as a \u201csemi-secret ring society\u201d that was founded in 1892 and conducts philanthropy, puts on honorary dinners and grants academic awards.\nHe said the church member told him the slogan would be hung on its wall as a trophy."}
