ObamaCare subjects employers to a 40 percent tax if premiums for health care exceed prescribed limits starting in 2018. The article said ATI has one of these \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans.\n\nWhen national health care was approved, I knew we were going to pay. I did not vote for President Obama because I read his books, which all but state he is a socialist. To paraphrase former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, \u201cSocialism is great until you run out of other people's money.\u201d I guess it's time to pay the piper.\n\nThe ATI employees who voted for Obama are getting what they sought. Maybe if they had researched the people running for president, they wouldn't be in this situation. The USW pushed for Obama. Maybe the members need to quit letting the union lead them around by the nose and think for themselves.\n\nIf the USW wants more of the same, vote Democrat again.\n\nHillary Clinton pushed hard for government health care when her husband was president, but it was defeated. Obama just carried the torch.\n\nI am a retired ATI employee and was a member of the United Plant Guard Workers of America union. I negotiated contracts at Vandergrift and Bagdad for over 20 years. This will not be easy.\n\nRon Waner\n\nParks", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Letter to the Editor", "description": "I wonder if all of ATI's United Steelworkers members are aware of the so-called ''Cadillac tax'' that is playing a key role in the lockout. ...", "pubdate": "2015-08-25 21:00:04", "author": "Letter to the Editor", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "I wonder if all of ATI's United Steelworkers members are aware of the so-called ''Cadillac tax'' that is playing a key role in the lockout. ...", "title": "ObamaCare and the ATI lockout", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-26 11:47:02.795", "url": "http://triblive.com/opinion/letters/8948975-74/ati-obama-care", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "I wonder if all of ATI's United Steelworkers members are aware of the so-called ''Cadillac tax'' that is playing a key role in the lockout. ...", "title": "ObamaCare and the ATI lockout", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "creator": "@triblive", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-25 21:00:04", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/opinion/letters/8948975-74/ati-obama-care", "sailthru.title": "ObamaCare and the ATI lockout", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, Opinion, Letters (Regional)", "headline": "ObamaCare and the ATI lockout", "keywords": "ati, obama, care, health, lockout", "article": {"category": "Opinion", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2015-08-25 21:00:04", "subcategory": "Letters", "mainsection": "Opinion", "section": "Opinion", "publishedtoweb": "2015-08-25 21:00:04", "modified_time": "2015-08-26 11:47:02.795", "tag": "ati, obama, care, health, lockout", "subsection": "Letters", "title": "ObamaCare and the ATI lockout", "author": "Letter to the Editor"}, "docauthor": "Letter to the Editor", "sailthru.description": "I wonder if all of ATI's United Steelworkers members are aware of the so-called ''Cadillac tax'' that is playing a key role in the lockout. ..."}, "article_summary": "I recently read an article stating that a provision of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is one of the main reasons for the lockout.\nObamaCare subjects employers to a 40 percent tax if premiums for health care exceed prescribed limits starting in 2018.\nObamaCare & the ATI lockoutEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nI did not vote for President Obama because I read his books, which all but state he is a socialist.\nWhen national health care was approved, I knew we were going to pay."}
