The Fighting Irish had won five of their past six meetings against DU. And they were well on their way to another, leading 5-1 after Matt Kavanagh\u2019s goal with three seconds left in the first quarter.\n\nAnd Notre Dame led 10-7 going to the fourth. But DU faceoff specialist Trevor Baptiste muscled the Pioneers back into possession (he won 16-of-23) and Miller (four goals, one assist) and Connor Cannizaro (four goals) took over down the stretch in DU\u2019s 4-0 run.\n\n\u201cNo panic,\u201d Cannizzaro said. \u201cWe just knew we had to chip away at it.\u201d\n\nDU defenseman Christian Burgdorf shut down Kavanagh (team-high four goals) on a key late possession. And Miller\u2019s winner \u2014 he slipped a rushing defender with an inside roll, then buried a goal from 10 yards out \u2014 was the Pioneers\u2019 first lead since they were up 1-0.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get them all back at once. There are no field goals or touchdowns in lacrosse,\u201d Tierney said.\n\nDU hits the road for three games in a week \u2014 against Ohio State, Lehigh and Penn State \u2014 before starting its Big East schedule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous task to ask guys to go 14 or 15 weeks undefeated,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cBut we\u2019re 2-1 against top-five teams in the country. If you\u2019d told me that a month ago, I\u2019d have taken it.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 4 Denver lacrosse rallies to win OT thriller over No. 3 Notre Dame", "title": "No. 4 Denver lacrosse rallies to win OT thriller over No. 3 Notre Dame", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/07/no-4-denver-lacrosse-rallies-to-win-ot-thriller-over-no-3-notre-dame/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150307__du-lacrossep1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150307__du-lacrossep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-07T17:50:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T15:39:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9a9\"", "article_summary": "3 Notre Dame 11-10 in a sunny thriller Saturday afternoon in front of 2,728 paying fans.\nPHOTOS: University of Denver beat Notre Dame 11-10 in LacrosseNo.\nAlready battle-tested just at the quarter point of the season, DU stayed calm as Notre Dame (3-1) pulled away.\nAnd Notre Dame led 10-7 going to the fourth.\n4-ranked Denver rallied from a game-long deficit, scoring the final four goals \u2014 including Zach Miller\u2019s spin-move winner in overtime \u2014 as the Pioneers took down No."}
