A new survey shows 69 percent of Americans listed “big government” as the biggest threat the future of the United States.

According to a Gallup poll released Tuesday, 88 percent of Republicans listed the issue followed by 67 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats.

The number is slightly lower than the 2013 results, the last time the question was posed, which stood at 72 percent, but the polling company said the numbers were significantly lower before 1990.

“The large increase in the percentage naming big government as the biggest threat in 2013 may have resulted from the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and Edward Snowden’s revelations about government monitoring of communications.” the poll said in its findings.

Concerns over big business have gone down in recent years, with 41 percent of Democrats, 25 percent of independents and 7 percent listing it as their main concern about the country’s future.

The results are not surprising as a survey conducted in September found 79 percent of Americans believe Congress is out of touch with their constituents and 52 percent believe they are corrupt.

The poll was conducted from Dec. 2-6 using a random sampling of 824 phone interviews of adults across the country and leaves a margin of error of ±4 percentage points.
