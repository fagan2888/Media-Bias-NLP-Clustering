That\u2019s the only conclusion we can draw from an epidemic of self-pitying American billionaires decrying their persecution by \u201cdespots,\u201d and the \u201cKristallnacht\u201d of rising concern about income inequality, over just the last few months.\n\nCharles Koch is the latest to fall victim to what funnier folks than me have labeled the WATB syndrome, with a whiny op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cCollectivists\u201d in government, Koch writes \u2013 \u201cthose who stand for government control of the means of production and how people live their lives,\u201d i.e. Democrats \u2014 \u201cstrive to discredit and intimidate opponents.\u201d It gets worse: \u201cThey engage in character assassination. (I should know, as the almost daily target of their attacks.)\u201d\n\nI\u2019m worried about Charles Koch. For one thing, with all his billions, he couldn\u2019t find a better ghost writer? His silly op-ed, with its alarmist Marxist clich\u00e9s and fusty Schopenhauer references, would have been dismissed as an April Fool\u2019s joke if published just one day sooner. It came the same day as the Supreme Court\u2019s McCutcheon decision, which only increased its ridiculousness.\n\nBut Koch\u2019s self-pity and persecution complex is downright unhealthy. He clearly suffers from the same malady as Tom Perkins, who delusionally compared rising political concern about income inequality to \u201cKristallnacht\u201d for the rich. Newspaper-destroying real estate mogul Sam Zell, who cosigned Perkins, is also a victim, complaining the super-rich \u201care getting pummeled because it\u2019s politically convenient to do so,\u201d when in fact \u201cthe 1 percent work harder.\u201d\n\nSelf-pity sufferer Ken Langone of Home Depot even warned Pope Francis that Catholic billionaires might stop contributing to the church because of the pope saying the \u201cexclusionary\u201d culture of the rich made some of them \u201cincapable of feeling compassion for the poor.\u201d Langone had earlier joined self-pitying mogul Leon Cooperman to admonish President Obama for \u201cnew lows in polarizing rhetoric\u2026aimed at successful people in the business sector.\u201d\n\nMaybe we need a public health campaign to warn billionaires about the dangers of self-pity: stress, anxiety, depression, isolation and illness. The authors of \u201c47 Steps to Stress Management\u201d say that \u201cthe effect of self-pity on the body is similar to chronic anxiety.\u201d A widely quoted 2003 study of self-pity in the Journal of Personality found:\n\n\u2026Strong associations of self-pity with neuroticism, particularly with the depression facet. With respect to control beliefs, individuals high in self-pity showed generalized externality beliefs, seeing themselves as controlled by both chance and powerful others\u2026Furthermore, individuals high in self-pity reported emotional loneliness and ambivalent-worrisome attachments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An epidemic of self-pity among the wealthy raises questions about the mental health of the top of the top 1 percent", "author": "Joan Walsh", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An epidemic of self-pity among the wealthy raises questions about the mental health of the top of the top 1 percent", "title": "Billionaires\u2019 crybaby club: Someone get these whiners a bottle!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/03/billionaires_crybaby_club_someone_get_these_whiners_a_bottle/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/tom_perkins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An epidemic of self-pity among the wealthy raises questions about the mental health of the top of the top 1 percent", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/tom_perkins.jpg", "title": "Billionaires\u2019 crybaby club: Someone get these whiners a bottle!", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Billionaires\u2019 crybaby club: Someone get these whiners a bottle!", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Billionaire self-pity, Billionaires, Charles Koch, David Koch, Editor's Picks, Koch Brothers, one percent, plutocrats, President Obama, Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5f6a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Billionaire self-pity, Billionaires, Charles Koch, David Koch, Editor's Picks, Koch Brothers, one percent, plutocrats, President Obama, Wall Street Journal, News, Politics NewsDoes being super-wealthy make you extra susceptible to self-pity today?\nCharles Koch is the latest to fall victim to what funnier folks than me have labeled the WATB syndrome, with a whiny op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.\nThat\u2019s the only conclusion we can draw from an epidemic of self-pitying American billionaires decrying their persecution by \u201cdespots,\u201d and the \u201cKristallnacht\u201d of rising concern about income inequality, over just the last few months.\n\u201cCollectivists\u201d in government, Koch writes \u2013 \u201cthose who stand for government control of the means of production and how people live their lives,\u201d i.e.\nHe clearly suffers from the same malady as Tom Perkins, who delusionally compared rising political concern about income inequality to \u201cKristallnacht\u201d for the rich."}
