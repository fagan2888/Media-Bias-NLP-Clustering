Most recently, just 12 percent of House Republicans voted for a bill to raise the debt ceiling, whose scheduled vote resulted in at least one Tea Party group calling for Speaker John Boehner\u2019s removal.\n\nGOP members of Congress aren\u2019t the only Republicans disappointed with the party\u2019s policies. In January, even before the debt ceiling vote, just 28% of Republicans and Republican leaners said the GOP was doing a good or excellent job in standing up for its traditional positions of smaller government, tax-cutting and conservative social values, while seven-in-ten (70%) rated their party\u2019s job as \u201conly fair\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nThe percentage of Republicans and leaners who rate the party\u2019s performance positively has fallen 12 points since the GOP took control of the House in November 2010, according to a Pew Research survey last month. Over the past decade, the only time Republicans have been more negative about their party was in April 2009 \u2014 in the wake of Barack Obama\u2019s election victory \u2014 when 21% rated the job it was doing as excellent or good. Democrats, on the other hand, have become more likely to say their party is standing up for its traditional positions. Roughly half of Democrats and those who lean Democratic (49%) rated their party as doing an excellent or good job on things such as protecting minorities\u2019 interests, representing working people and helping the poor and needy. This is up 11 points from August 2011, but about the same as November 2010.\n\nA caveat is in order when looking at Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 evaluations of their party\u2019s performance on the \u201ctraditional job\u201d measure. The old maxim \u201cnothing succeeds like success\u201d applies here: Partisans tend to be happier with their parties when they\u2019re winning. In five of six surveys since Obama took office in 2009, more Democrats than Republicans have given their party positive ratings for standing up for traditional positions. During the Bush administration, Republicans were often happier than Democrats with their party\u2019s performance.\n\nStill, Republicans were not particularly positive about their party\u2019s support for traditional positions after its sweeping triumph in the 2010 elections, when the GOP won back the House. In the days following that election, more Democrats (48%) than Republicans (40%) expressed satisfaction with how well their party was standing up for its traditional positions. Since then, Republicans\u2019 views of the party\u2019s performance have only become more negative.\n\nOur January survey also included the parties\u2019 ratings of the ideologies of the two parties. Overall, these views have changed little in recent years: 55% said the Republican Party was either very conservative (23%) or conservative (32%) while 51% viewed the Democratic Party as very liberal (27%) or liberal (24%).\n\nAs in the past, Democrats and Republicans have somewhat similar views of the Republican Party\u2019s ideology: 64% of Democrats and 51% of Republicans say the GOP is either very conservative or conservative. But Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to view the Democratic Party as very liberal or liberal (75% vs. 36%).\n\nTea Party Republicans don\u2019t see the GOP as especially conservative, and that is likely a factor in the low ratings they give the Republican Party for standing up for traditional positions.\n\nJust 44% of Republicans and Republican leaners who agree with the Tea Party say the GOP is very conservative or conservative; that compares with 55% of non-Tea Party Republicans. Only about a quarter of Tea Party Republicans give the party positive ratings for advocating traditional positions compared with 31% of non-Tea Party Republicans.\n\nTopics: Congress, Political Attitudes and Values, Political Party Affiliation", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only 28% of Republicans believe their party does a good job standing up for its positions of smaller government, tax-cutting and conservative social values.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/24/just-28-of-republicans-believe-gop-advocates-its-principles-well/", "site_name": "Pew Research Center", "type": "article", "description": "Only 28% of Republicans believe their party does a good job standing up for its positions of smaller government, tax-cutting and conservative social values.", "title": "Just 28% of Republicans believe GOP advocates its principles well"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/24/just-28-of-republicans-believe-gop-advocates-its-principles-well/", "site": "@pewresearch", "description": "Only 28% of Republicans believe their party does a good job standing up for its positions of smaller government, tax-cutting and conservative social values.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Just 28% of Republicans believe GOP advocates its principles well"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"U.S. Politics\"}", "theme-color": "#231f20", "projects": "U.S. Politics", "date": 20140224, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2014-02-24T13:15:52+00:00"}, "topics": "Political Party Affiliation", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca514\"", "article_summary": "Only about a quarter of Tea Party Republicans give the party positive ratings for advocating traditional positions compared with 31% of non-Tea Party Republicans.\nJust 44% of Republicans and Republican leaners who agree with the Tea Party say the GOP is very conservative or conservative; that compares with 55% of non-Tea Party Republicans.\nA caveat is in order when looking at Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 evaluations of their party\u2019s performance on the \u201ctraditional job\u201d measure.\nStill, Republicans were not particularly positive about their party\u2019s support for traditional positions after its sweeping triumph in the 2010 elections, when the GOP won back the House.\nDemocrats, on the other hand, have become more likely to say their party is standing up for its traditional positions."}
