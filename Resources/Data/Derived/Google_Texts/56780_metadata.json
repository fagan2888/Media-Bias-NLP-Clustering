Allegations of extensive wait times for lifesaving care, deaths while waiting, and horrific mismanagement have triggered outrage.\n\nUnfortunately, the VA abuses are just the tip of a much larger, more menacing iceberg. The iceberg is covert health care rationing, and it\u2019s inherent in single-payer systems like the VA.\n\nThe obvious question to ask about the VA scandal is: Why? Why would a VA hospital administrator direct doctors not to perform colonoscopies until patients had three positive tests for bloody stools? Or why were VA employees ordered to \u201ccook the books\u201d and hide long wait times that veterans faced when seeking care from heart, cancer, or other specialists? Why did some VA administrators go so far as to create a secret waiting list to hide year-plus wait times?\n\nThere\u2019s only one plausible answer to these questions: rationing. The VA is but a smaller version of the sort of government-run, single-payer health care with which the political left is so enamored.\n\nWhen individuals receive care through the VA, it becomes the only payer and hence, the only decision-maker. The VA decides who gets care, when, and how much. Moreover, as the single payer, the VA bears the risk of loss: If tax dollars aren\u2019t enough to pay for the care demanded, there\u2019s only one result \u2014 rationing of care.\n\nRationing care can take many forms. It can be overt, like the Canadian or British health care systems, which have unambiguous, publicly-announced waiting times and coverage denials for certain procedures. Or rationing can be more subtle, with little or no public participation. This latter, covert form of rationing is what the VA has adopted.\n\nCovert rationing appears to be the only form of rationing that\u2019s politically palatable to Congress. Another example is the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), the so-called \u201cdeath panel\u201d created by Obamacare. Congress charged IPAB with cutting Medicare spending below certain levels, without reducing Medicare benefits or increasing beneficiary cost-sharing.\n\nThe only way to achieve IPAB\u2019s lofty goal, as Congress surely understood, is to reduce payments to hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers. As providers make less money per patient, there will be fewer providers willing to accept Medicare beneficiaries, and waiting times will inevitably rise. Increasing waiting times, as VA executives well know, is a subtle but effective form of rationing.\n\nMany on the political left argue that since tax dollars for health care are limited, rationing is inevitable, so we shouldn\u2019t worry too much about what form it takes. If everyone has access to health care, the argument goes, it doesn\u2019t really matter that some are getting less overall care. Don\u2019t fall for this straw man.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that health care demand always outstrips supply, this concession doesn\u2019t imply that government-run, single-payer health care is inevitable, or a good thing; quite the contrary. The abuses experienced in the VA system are endemic to all single-payer systems.\n\nWhen government has a monopoly on the provision of health care, patients lose. They lose because they cannot escape. They have no viable alternative choice.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Elizabeth Price Foley", "description": "Whenever there's a single payer, someone has to make decisions about cost.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Whistleblowers within the Veterans' Administration health system are coming forward with tales of brutal disregard for the health and life of those who served our country.
