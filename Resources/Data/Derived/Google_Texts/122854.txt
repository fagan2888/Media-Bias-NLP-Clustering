Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played the second of back-to-back nights at the Hope Estate, a vinyard, in Hunter Valley, Australia on Sunday. And for the second straight night, he celebrated wine with an opener of "Spill The Wine," the 1970 song recorded by Eric Burdon and War.

As usual, Bruce mixed the set list up greatly when he plays back-to-back, playing 19 songs that were not played on NIght 1 on Saturday He played 46 different songs in the two nights.

There were four tour premieres in the 28-song, three-hour-and-eight minute performance: "Spill the Wine," "Brilliant Disguise," "4th of July Asbury Park (Sandy)" and "I Wish I Were Blind" (played solo acoustic in the encores).

"Bruce was very loose and in a playful mood tonight," my friend Mitch, formerly of Manalapan, texted me. "The opening song 'Spill the Wine' was very well received. The highlight for me was 'Human Touch.' "

Here's the opener of "Spill the Wine":

The encore began with "4th of July Asbury Park (Sandy)" dedicated to Danny Federici. Bruce said this was "Danny's signature song" according to Mitch. Nice to see "I Wish I Were Blind" also played, that's one of my favorite songs from the early 1990s.

Here's "4th of July Asbury Park (Sandy) from the show. It's always nice to hear this:

Bruce has now played 118 different songs in just 14 shows so far this tour.
