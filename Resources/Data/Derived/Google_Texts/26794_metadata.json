In recent years ALEC, whose members include Republican politicians as well as businesses, has been behind \u201cmodel legislation\u201d to limit renewable energy in states. The group has also condemned the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposed Clean Power Plan, and fought against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe continually assess our engagements with policy and advocacy organizations, and based on our most recent assessment, we have determined that we can effectively pursue policy matters of current interest to BP without renewing our membership in ALEC,\u201d a BP spokesman told ThinkProgress.\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the move, saying it had asked BP to leave ALEC last fall.\n\n\u201cBP was right to leave ALEC, an important decision consistent with the company\u2019s public acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change,\u201d said Peter Frumhoff, UCS\u2019s director of science and policy. \u201cWe are gratified that they have listened and that a growing number of people and groups are calling on fossil fuel companies to end their support for ALEC.\u201d\n\nUCS said Shell should also leave ALEC. Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips have both already cut ties with the group. In a proxy statement for Occidental\u2019s annual stockholders meeting before the decision, Needcor Foundation wrote, \u201cWe believe this partnership [with ALEC] may bring significant reputational and business risk to the company.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unknown whether BP broke with ALEC specifically over the group\u2019s views on climate change. However, it has become increasingly unpopular for companies to associate with climate deniers. After pressure from environmental activists, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Yelp left ALEC last year, citing differences on climate change policy.\n\nGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt told Diane Rehm his company\u2019s decision to fund ALEC was a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone understands climate change is occurring and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd so we should not be aligned with such people \u2014 they\u2019re just, they\u2019re just literally lying.\u201d\n\nAt the time, ALEC said Google\u2019s decision was the result of \u201cpublic pressure from left-leaning individuals and organizations who intentionally confuse free market policy perspectives for climate change denial.\u201d\n\nBP\u2019s annual strategic report notes that \u201cBP believes that climate change is an important long-term issue that justifies global action.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, dozens of companies, including household names such as Coca-Cola, Kraft, Walmart, Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, and MillerCoors, cut ties with ALEC in the wake of the group\u2019s support for voter ID and \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d gun laws.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "BP didn't say why it chose to leave ALEC, but environmentalists and climate change activists are applauding the move.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "BP didn't say why it chose to leave ALEC, but environmentalists and climate change activists are applauding the move.", "title": "Oil And Gas Giant BP Cuts Ties With Conservative Group ALEC", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/03/24/3638181/bp-leaves-alec/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP8725582289.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BP didn't say why it chose to leave ALEC, but environmentalists and climate change activists are applauding the move.", "creator": "@samanthadpage", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP8725582289-320x213.jpg", "title": "Oil And Gas Giant BP Cuts Ties With Conservative Group ALEC", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP8725582289.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP8725582289.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-24T13:08:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampagewriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb314\"", "article_summary": "Climate Oil And Gas Giant BP Cuts Ties With Conservative Group ALEC CREDIT: AP Photo/Matt Dunham BP has left conservative group ALEC.\nAfter pressure from environmental activists, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Yelp left ALEC last year, citing differences on climate change policy.\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the move, saying it had asked BP to leave ALEC last fall.\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) lost another high-profile member Monday, when oil and gas mega-company BP announced it would no longer be part of the largely Koch-funded, conservative organization.\n\u201cBP was right to leave ALEC, an important decision consistent with the company\u2019s public acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change,\u201d said Peter Frumhoff, UCS\u2019s director of science and policy."}
