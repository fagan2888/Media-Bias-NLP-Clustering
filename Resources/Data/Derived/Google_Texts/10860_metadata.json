But its critics charge that the nonprofit institution has become devoted exclusively to pushing a progressive, even radical, agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is all about HUD bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., working to take away local control on zoning so they can determine who lives where,\u201d tea party activist Mike Puyana says of a \u201csmart growth\u201d plan backed by the foundation.\n\nWith almost $1 billion in assets, the foundation bills itself as Rhode Island\u2019s largest grant-maker, awarding more than $30 million a year, according to annual reports. Tax records show that the foundation concentrated its most recent donations on left-of-center organizations, with a particular emphasis on environmental causes.\n\nThese organizations include Earthjustice, EcoRI News, the Climate Action Network, the Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island, and Grow Smart Rhode Island. Each has received tens of thousands in donations from the Rhode Island Foundation, according to the most recent tax forms.\n\nOther left-leaning recipients of the foundation\u2019s largess include Planned Parenthood branches in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; Direct Action for Rights and Equality, an anti-capitalist \u201csocial justice\u201d group; the Economic Progress Institute, a Rhode Island-based progressive research group; and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, which seeks new gun controls.\n\nRhode Islanders who express concern over the Rhode Island Foundation\u2019s penchant for funding liberal causes have been particularly critical of the nonprofit\u2019s support for environmental groups standing behind a project called RhodeMap Rhode Island.\n\nThey say RhodeMap Rhode Island opened the door for centralized planners in Washington, D.C., to gain control over housing and development at the local level.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development established funding for RhodeMap RI, as it is known, through a Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant in 2011 offered as part of the Federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities. This partnership includes HUD, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Rhode Island Division of Planning is responsible for administering RhodeMap RI.\n\nA Brookings Institution scholar involved in making that road map a reality held a top HUD post during the Clinton administration and later advised the Obama administration.\n\nBut what is RhodeMap RI, exactly?\n\nOfficials in the state\u2019s Division of Planning describe RhodeMap RI as a statewide strategy to bolster the economy and meet \u201ccurrent and future housing needs\u201d while planning for \u201cfuture growth through the development of integrated plans and guidance consistent with existing strategies for transportation, land use and environmental protection.\u201d\n\nCode for Big Government?\n\nThat\u2019s one definition.\n\nGrow Smart, which received $112,000 from the Rhode Island Foundation in 2013, identifies itself as a \u201cproud member\u201d of a consortium of public and private entities that back RhodeMap RI. A nonprofit, Grow Smart describes itself as devoted to \u201csustainable and equitable economic growth.\u201d\n\nThough Grow Smart has vigorously defended the RhodeMap RI program, its own definition of the effort is somewhat nebulous. The program is described on the Grow Smart website, in part, as \u201ca unified economic development strategy for the state that integrates business growth with land use and transportation choices.\u201d\n\nBut the group\u2019s definition of smart growth, which is at the core of the RhodeMap program, is a bit more exacting: Smart growth simultaneously combines \u201ceconomic development and jobs, strong neighborhoods and healthy communities\u201d as part of an overarching strategy.\n\nThat sounds benign enough. But Mark Zaccaria, former chairman of the state Republican Committee, says he is concerned about the \u201cfine print\u201d folded inside the HUD grants and the ramifications for self-government and local autonomy.\n\nUnder state law, Rhode Island\u2013the nation\u2019s smallest state geographically but No. 43 by population\u2013has a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d that must be updated every five years. RhodeMap RI builds on the criteria set by the state plan, Zaccaria says.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that RhodeMap Rhode Island is being done in strict accordance with HUD\u2019s sustainable development agenda,\u201d says Zaccaria, now active with the Property Rights Alliance of Rhode Island. He adds:\n\nThe ultimate goal is to have something like 75 percent of our land mass go back to wilderness and to pack the population into certain areas with restrictions on the kind of housing that is permitted. There\u2019s also a certain emphasis on public transportation, which means personal, individual transportation means like automobiles are now considered a bad thing, and you\u2019re going to see taxes and regulations on automobiles.\n\nSeven Targets for Taxpayer Dollars\n\nIn Zaccaria\u2019s opinion, the Rhode Island Foundation is \u201cpopulated with liberals\u201d who are keen on pushing what they call smart growth and sustainable development.\n\nSo, he says, it\u2019s not surprising to see the foundation step forward with substantial financial support for a left-leaning environmental agenda.\n\n\u201cThe foundation was originally founded [in 1916] for the purpose of historical preservation, but it has morphed into something else in recent years,\u201d Zaccaria says.\n\nThe Rhode Island Foundation provided partial funding for a $1.3 million study from the Brookings Institution that critics view as an extension of Grow Smart\u2019s green initiatives. The foundation and its team appear at the top of a list of \u201cmajor stakeholders\u201d consulted for the report.\n\nRhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat who took office in January 2015, commissioned the study. Titled \u201cRhode Island Innovates,\u201d it was released last week and adopted by the Rhode Island Economic Development Planning Council during a ceremony held at the foundation\u2019s offices in Providence. (See the full report here.)\n\nThe Brookings Institution report, produced with Battelle, the Columbus, Ohio-based research and development giant, identifies seven industries worthy of private and public investment to spur economic growth in the Ocean State: biomedical innovation; information technology software, cyberphysical systems, and data analytics; defense shipbuilding and maritime; advanced business services; design, food, and custom manufacturing; transportation, distribution, and logistics; and arts, education, hospitality, and tourism.\n\nBattelle and Brookings, the Washington-based think tank, recommend public and private spending in those areas totaling, and possibly exceeding, $100 million.\n\nBruce J. Katz, a national urban development expert who founded Brookings\u2019 Metropolitan Policy Program, last week said he is \u201cbullish\u201d on Rhode Island\u2019s prospects. He has urged businesses to back government efforts aimed at recharging the economy.\n\nIn response to critics who see too large of a role for government, Katz tells reporters that partnerships between business and government have produced tangible results in other parts of the country. The Providence Journal quoted Katz as saying Jan. 19:\n\nIf I\u2019m a family living in Rhode Island, I want those companies and clusters and universities getting better at their job because I know I\u2019m either going to be able to get a job in one of those companies, or clusters, or I\u2019m going to have the knock-off effect.\n\n\u2018Too Cozy\u2019 With Governor, Green Interests?\n\nWhere the Brookings Institution report sees opportunities, Puyana, president of the Rhode Island Tea Party, sees \u201ca far too cozy relationship\u201d among Raimondo, federal agencies, the Rhode Island Foundation, and special interests funded through it.\n\nKatz, the first \u201ccentennial scholar\u201d at Brookings, was senior counsel and then staff director for the U.S. Senate\u2019s subcommittee on housing and urban affairs. He held top positions at the Department of Housing and Urban Development: He was chief of staff to Secretary Henry Cisneros during President Clinton\u2019s first term. He returned as senior adviser to Obama\u2019s first HUD secretary, Shaun Donovan, for the first 100 days of the administration.\n\nKatz is not identified as part of the project team on \u201cRhode Island Innovates,\u201d which cites his work six times, but he helps promote the findings.\n\nRaimondo, a venture capitalist who succeeded Lincoln Chafee as governor and previously was state treasurer, told reporters that the Brookings report was done independently of her administration.\n\nEven so, the recommendations in the think tank\u2019s study will be included in 2016-17 budget proposals the governor is set to present Feb. 2 to the Rhode Island General Assembly.\n\nBrookings spokesmen did not return several calls and emails requesting comment.\n\nA spokesman for the governor, reached Tuesday by The Daily Signal, did not respond by publication time about the state government\u2019s association with the Rhode Island Foundation and some of its favorite progressive causes.\n\nPuyana says:\n\nThe Rhode Island Foundation is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money, and that includes my money, and the money of other taxpayers, which are going to green groups that I would never voluntarily donate my money to since it supports an agenda I don\u2019t think is in Rhode Island\u2019s best interests. If you look at the groups the foundation is funding, it is a who\u2019s who list of every loony left entity that is out there.\n\nThe tea party leader specifies Direct Action for Rights and Equality, Earthjustice, and EcoRINews as being on that list.\n\nThe state\u2019s Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner has funneled about $600,000 to the foundation since 2013, government records show.\n\nThe agenda that most concerns Puyana and other tea party activists is built around smart growth policy goals aimed, he says, at \u201cpushing people out of rural areas and into more highly concentrated, densely packed urbanized communities.\u201d\n\nTowns and municipalities on the receiving end of HUD grants no longer can determine \u201cwhere and how to distribute affordable housing,\u201d Puyana says, thanks to an obscure provision known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.\n\n\u201cThis is all about HUD bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., working to take away local control on zoning so they can determine who lives where,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis is social engineering at its worst, and it is being funded with some of our own money as taxpayers, even though many of us do not support this agenda.\u201d\n\nFoundation Cites \u2018Benefits\u2019 to Residents\n\nResponding to inquiries from The Daily Signal, Chris Barnett, a spokesman for the Rhode Island Foundation, defends his organization\u2019s support for Grow Smart. In an email message, Barnett writes:\n\nFor more than a decade, we have supported Grow Smart\u2019s work revitalizing urban areas as a catalyst for economic development. It is one of more than 1,400 organizations working across sectors ranging from education and health care to the arts and the environment that we funded last year. In a state with one million people, we\u2019re sure even someone who finds fault with one of our investments still benefits from our work in many ways.\n\nBut legitimate concerns exist about the relationship among the Rhode Island Foundation, the Raimondo administration, and other elements of state government, Giovanni Cicione, founder and chairman of the Stephen Hopkins Center for Civil Rights, tells The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing now is an end run around certain transparency requirements and ethics requirements,\u201d Cicione says, citing meetings held in private that ordinarily would be public under sunshine laws. He adds:\n\nWhen the government starts to hide the ball, it makes me nervous. We have people serving in cabinet-level positions without any Senate vetting or confirmation because they are getting paid by a private foundation while working for the state.\n\nCicione says he has concluded that some members of private-public committees should be registered as lobbyists under the state\u2019s administrative lobbying law.\n\n\u201cThere are big-money donors who want to push the smart growth agenda with the state into its administrative and legal structures,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are pushing this agenda through the foundation so they don\u2019t have to go through an open and public process.\u201d\n\nZaccaria, the property rights activist, argues that Rhode Island\u2019s constitution provides cities, towns, and municipalities with \u201ca certain amount of sovereignty\u201d that \u201cnameless, faceless bureaucrats are working to abrogate.\u201d\n\nHUD directives attached to federal grant money are \u201coften in conflict with local zoning laws,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe noose hasn\u2019t started to tighten yet, but that time will come.\u201d\n\nKen McIntyre contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This is about HUD bureaucrats in Washington working to take away local control on zoning so they can determine who lives where,\u201d a tea party leader says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"This is about HUD bureaucrats in Washington working to take away local control on zoning so they can determine who lives where,\u201d a tea party leader says.", "title": "Why This State's \u2018Smart Growth\u2019 Agenda Arouses Tea Party", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160125_RIF_Feature_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-28T17:55:38+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PiBYe2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"This is about HUD bureaucrats in Washington working to take away local control on zoning so they can determine who lives where,\u201d a tea party leader says.", "title": "Why This State's \u2018Smart Growth\u2019 Agenda Arouses Tea Party", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160125_RIF_Feature_Mooney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2016-01-28T12:54:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T17:55:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rhode Island Foundation, HUD Rhode Island, smart growth, sustainable development, rhode island tea party, RhodeMap RI, Gina Raimondo, Brookings Rhode Island, Bruce Katz"}, "article_summary": "These organizations include Earthjustice, EcoRI News, the Climate Action Network, the Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island, and Grow Smart Rhode Island.\nEach has received tens of thousands in donations from the Rhode Island Foundation, according to the most recent tax forms.\nTo commemorate its 100th anniversary, the Rhode Island Foundation touts a \u201cdiverse range of projects\u201d built around Centennial Community Grants.\n\u201cThere are big-money donors who want to push the smart growth agenda with the state into its administrative and legal structures,\u201d he says.\nRhode Islanders who express concern over the Rhode Island Foundation\u2019s penchant for funding liberal causes have been particularly critical of the nonprofit\u2019s support for environmental groups standing behind a project called RhodeMap Rhode Island."}
