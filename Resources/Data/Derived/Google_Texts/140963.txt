Fried Liver Attack, Two Knights Defense and Poisoned Pawn Variation. Just a short list of many strategies used when playing chess.

Whether these terms are new to you or you’re a seasoned chess player, you’re invited to “Chess in the Park” at Krutch Park, said Michael Moore, its founder. The first of soon-to-be-more gatherings kicked off Saturday from 9 a.m.-2 p.m. and attracted a crowd.

Moore said the game promotes memory retention, cognitive skills and forward-thinking habits. He enjoys playing for mental benefits and socialization.

The idea for Chess in the Park stemmed from the success of Saint Luke’s Episcopal Church on South Chestnut Street in East Knox County.

“We wanted to have a camp that would attract youngsters,” said Rev. James Anderson, Rector for the church.

The church worked with Moore to provide a three-week-long camp in July for local children to come together in a safe place and socialize while sharpening mental skills and having fun. Anderson said the church liked Moore’s suggestion for a chess camp because it offered an alternative to sports-related camps. The camp had about 30 kids playing the game, Anderson said.

After seeing the success of the camp, Moore contacted the city’s Office of Special Events to coordinate Chess in the Park as a way to invite the public to play.

He likened chess to riding a bike.

“It’s all about memorization and repeat,” Moore said. “[The player’s] mind gets used to certain movements on the board.”

After taking a hiatus from the game, Moore said he decided to pick it back up by playing online, but it’s not the same as playing with others in person.

“If you play against the computer, there’s no margin for error,” said Moore. “Playing people, like in the park, there are emotions that go into it. Instead of just moving pieces, now it’s moving pieces that have a purpose.”

There is a variety of different strategies and styles each player brings to game, he said. Some players are quick and aggressive, while others can be slow and methodical.

“There’s so many good players in Knoxville,” he said.

One of his ultimate goals for hosting Chess in the Park is for the city to invest in permanent chess tables in the park. Moore has traveled for matches, and mentioned a recent trip to Raleigh, N.C., where the matches were held at parks with fixed tables.

He and Anderson have a simple goal: to get more people in the community involved in one of the oldest games in history.
