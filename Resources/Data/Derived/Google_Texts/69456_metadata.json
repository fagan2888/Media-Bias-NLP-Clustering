This brings to mind one of President Obama\u2019s biggest\u2014and most wayward--economic promises, from back when he was a newbie in his first term: Doubling exports between 2010 and 2015.\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Jan. 27, 2010, Obama laid out a list of priorities to jump-start a still moribund economy. This was number three: \u201cWe need to export more of our goods,\u201d Obama declared. \u201cSo tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America.\u201d\n\nDuring the next 12 months, exports jumped by 17%, a growth rate that would have nailed Obama\u2019s target (thanks to compounding) had it held up for 5 years. The following year produced a 14% gain, also impressive. After that, however, the export boom stalled, as this chart shows.\n\nView gallery .

If that forecast is right, the total gain in exports from 2010 to 2015 will end up being a scant 24% -- just one-fourth of the 100% gain Obama aimed for. \u201cI thought that goal was extremely ambitious,\u201d says Doug Handler, chief U.S. economist at IHS. \u201cExports did not go well.\u201d\n\nExports matter because most companies need to hire more as they export more \u2014 particularly in manufacturing. While job growth has been strong, at least in terms of raw numbers, the types of jobs typically associated with robust exports haven\u2019t materialized. The manufacturing sector has added nearly 900,000 jobs since the low point in early 2010, for example, but total manufacturing employment is still 1.4 million jobs below pre-recession levels of late 2007. Here's the weak bounceback in manufacturing jobs:\n\nView gallery .

The top destinations for U.S. exports are Canada, Europe, Mexico and China. Demand is particularly weak in Europe, parts of which are trying to crawl out of a triple-dip recession. Canada is beginning to suffer from plunging oil prices and an overdependence on energy. China\u2019s economy is slowing too, as many industries work off excess debt, which could go on for years.\n\n[Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App]\n\nThe U.S. economy has outperformed most other developed nations, partly because of aggressive monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve beginning in 2008, which central banks in Europe and Japan have only recently begun to mimic. The relative health of the U.S. economy is great for American companies selling here, but lousy for U.S. firms trying to export overseas. One reason the rising dollar has led to a stock-market pullback is profit concerns regarding big U.S. exporters, whose goods are becoming more expensive overseas.\n\n\n\nOverpromising on the economy\n\nObama can legitimately claim some success on the economy, with employers creating 3.3 million jobs during the last year\u2014the best pace of job growth since the boom years of the late 1990s. Obama\u2019s many critics point out that the job-market rebound occurred much later into the recovery than usual, as if Obama\u2019s policies somehow held it back. More likely, the 2007-09 recession was so severe that no set of policies plausible in the current political environment would have sped up the recovery.\n\nObama\u2019s biggest mistakes on the economy, in fact, have involved overpromising rather than lousy policies. At the very beginning of his tenure, for example, Obama said the huge stimulus plan passed in 2009 would keep the unemployment rate below 8%. It peaked at 10% in 2010, giving critics ammunition they fired for years and helping Republicans win back the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections. Fine print in the White House report accompanying the 8% projection included all the necessary caveats (such as underlying assumptions could turn out better or worse, etc., etc., etc.) which matters not at all in the wrestling wring of Washington politics.\n\nThe one statement Obama probably regrets the most is this one: \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d As Obama\u2019s signature accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, went into effect in 2013 and 2014, that turned out to be demonstrably false, with insurance carriers cancelling several million policies that didn\u2019t conform to new ACA standards. Obama\u2019s loose words earned him the uncoveted \u201cLie of the Year\u201d award from Politifact, the diligently nonpartisan fact-checking site.\n\nSince then, Obama seems to have learned what most economists already know: If you make predictions that include both figures and dates, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a gleeful takedown at the hands of your enemies. His 2015 State of the Union address, for instance, included virtually no specific goals or promises, even though he listed many policy priorities.\n\nThere\u2019s also this consolation: On the current course, U.S. exports should double, from 2010 levels, by 2022 or so. Had Obama not said \u201cover the next five years\u201d back in 2010, nobody would have anything to complain about.\n\nRick Newman\u2019s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.
