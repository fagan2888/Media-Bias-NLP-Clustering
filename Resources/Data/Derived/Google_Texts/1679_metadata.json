I have gone to it more often than not in the last five years (wish I\u2019d discovered it long ago!), and always enjoy the combination of disciplinary diversity and mission unity.\n\nThe November 2014 conference was as fine as any I\u2019ve attended, and for me the most memorable presentation was by John Finnis, the Oxford-and-Notre Dame philosopher of law. Calling Finnis a philosopher of law does not do him justice. I have seen him hold forth with great erudition and penetrating insight on Shakespeare, for instance, and it seems he can turn his attention to any subject and find something new and valuable to say. Or, what is equally important, something old and valuable that badly needs recovering.\n\nI wasn\u2019t prepared, even so, for the knockout brilliance of his CEC lecture last November, blandly titled \u201cWho Said, \u2018Blessed Are the Poor\u2019?\u201d Challenging what he calls \u201cthe Guild\u201d of \u201ccritical\u201d Bible scholars, Finnis argues that the conventional view widely accepted today that the Gospel of Mark is of earlier date than the Gospels of Matthew and Luke is quite wrong, and that the evidence is clear that Mark comes third and last in time among the synoptic Gospels. The second half of the lecture goes on to make the case for the authentic historicity\u0097the truth\u0097of the Gospels as reports by or of eyewitness testimony to the ministry of Jesus. The challenge here as well to the Guild is forceful in defense of what the Church has always taught.\n\nTo a rank amateur like me, Finnis\u2019s lecture was a spellbinding tour de force, but what do I know? A priest of Holy Cross who is on the Notre Dame faculty and attended the lecture told me immediately afterward that he could feel the value of his Notre Dame M.Div. degree plummeting by the minute, as Finnis demonstrated that a great deal of what he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nFinnis plans to publish a couple of articles in the near future that were previewed in this lecture, he says, and I am sure that these publications will cause quite a stir.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "The notable legal philosopher turns his keen analytical powers to questions of Scripture.", "title": "John Finnis on the Gospel(s) | Matthew J.
