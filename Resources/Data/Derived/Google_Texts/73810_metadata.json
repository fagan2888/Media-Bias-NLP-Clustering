For large group plans, the minimum MLR is 85%. For small group and individual plans, the minimum MLR is 80%. Insurers with MLRs below the minimum must rebate the difference to consumers.\n\nThis leaves only 15%-20% for profit and administrative expenses, including broker commissions. To comply with the law, insurers have reduced broker commissions. As the brief shows, this has had a huge impact on producers (to the tune of $300 million) who now feel they have to work twice as hard for half the pay.\n\nAccording to the brief, to meet the MLR requirement health insurers reduced profits and spending on brokers\u2019 fees, marketing and administrative efforts by $1.4 billion in 2012.\n\nBroker expenses (roughly 3% of premiums), fell by nearly $300 million in individual, small and large group markets.\n\nTotal rebates for 2012 were $513 million, half the amount paid out in 2011, indicating greater compliance with the MLR rule.\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Fund researchers used data collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as of August 1, 2013, for 2012 data and November 26, 2012, for 2011 data. Data were collected from health insurers in 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nSince 2011 there have been various failed legislative efforts that would separate broker commissions from the MLR. However, many brokers feel like it is too little too late.\n\nWhat do you think?", "article_metadata": {"description": "New report finds that MLR slashed health insurance broker commissions by $300 Million in 2012.
