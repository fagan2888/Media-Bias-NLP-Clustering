He recently admitted that another glossy presentation, in July, inadvertently set off a rise in Herbalife\u2019s stock.\n\nMany would give up. But not William Ackman.\n\nIn his crusade against Herbalife, Ackman lately has taken the fight for hearts and minds to a place where the minds can be a little smaller: Capitol Hill.\n\nThrough several K Street lobbying firms, Ackman has reached out to Democrats, especially those in the Latino caucus. His goal: To get those Democrats to use the threat of a Federal Trade Commission investigation to accomplish what Ackman\u2019s high-powered media campaign and the marketplace could not \u2013 the takedown of an entire company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia:\n\nThis is the danger of a government that is almost limitless in its power and reach. It gives private actors the incentive to use government influence to manipulate the marketplace.\n\nAckman says he won\u2019t profit from his Wall Street play. He has called the nutrition-maker\u2019s profits \u201cblood money\u201d and said he would give any profits from this to charity.\n\nHowever pure his motives, government documents reveal Pershing Square\u2019s attempt to use the federal hammer on Herbalife, spending $250,000 this year alone on such high-profile lobbyists as Moffett Group, Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, Ibarra Strategy Group and Mayer Brown LLP.\n\nDisclosures from all four firms use the same language to describe the subject of their meetings on Capitol Hill: \u201cIssues relating to enforcement of consumer protection laws and securities regulations relating to pyramid schemes.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his crusade against Herbalife, Ackman lately has taken the fight for hearts and minds to a place where the minds can be a little smaller: Capitol Hill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In his crusade against Herbalife, Ackman lately has taken the fight for hearts and minds to a place where the minds can be a little smaller: Capitol Hill.", "title": "Congressional Democrats Assist Billionaire Hedge-Fund Manager in Wall Street Feud", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/abausaphotostwo092007.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-02T00:59:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1sS7Vdt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In his crusade against Herbalife, Ackman lately has taken the fight for hearts and minds to a place where the minds can be a little smaller: Capitol Hill.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/abausaphotostwo092007.jpg"}, "title": "Congressional Democrats Assist Billionaire Hedge-Fund Manager in Wall Street Feud", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism,politics", "published_time": "2014-11-02T05:01:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-02T00:59:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Herbalife, wall street, democrats, hedge fund"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0882\"", "article_summary": "But not William Ackman.\nThrough several K Street lobbying firms, Ackman has reached out to Democrats, especially those in the Latino caucus.\nIn his crusade against Herbalife, Ackman lately has taken the fight for hearts and minds to a place where the minds can be a little smaller: Capitol Hill.\nHe has called the nutrition-maker\u2019s profits \u201cblood money\u201d and said he would give any profits from this to charity.\nAckman says he won\u2019t profit from his Wall Street play."}
