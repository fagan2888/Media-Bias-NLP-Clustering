Ted Cruz (R-TX) is slamming Marco Rubio (R-FL) over his contradictions on immigration policy as a lawmaker and his endorsement of the rampant abuse of H-1B visas by large corporations.\n\nBefore formally unveiling his immigration program in Florida, Cruz appeared on the Mike Gallagher Show. The Texan he laughed at Rubio\u2019s claims that he shares the same immigration record as Cruz.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI laughed out loud at that,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cMarco\u2019s a friend, but that statement was truly stunning. That\u2019s like Obama saying my position is the same as his on Obamacare [and] like the Ayatollah Khamenei saying my position is the same as his on the Iranian nuclear deal. It is laughingly, blazingly, on its face false.\u201d\n\nRubio again stood by his claims on Friday while addressing reporters in Florida\u2019s Sunshine Summit where he said he was \u201cpuzzled and quite frankly surprised by Ted\u2019s attacks since Ted\u2019s position on immigration is not much different than mine.\u201d\n\nCruz said Rubio opposed every single amendment both he and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) had introduced to prevent the further propelling of H-1B visa abuses and immigration issues. \u201cI introduced an amendment to the Judiciary Committee to triple the border patrol [and] increase fourfold the fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft, to put in place a strong e-verify system; to put in place a strong exit-entry system for visa overstays.\u201d He said in addition to every Senate Democrat on the committee voting against it so did the sponsors of the Gang of Eight bill, including Rubio.\n\nHe also said that he and Sessions are currently working on creating major reforms. \u201cIf I am elected president, the H-1B visa program will not be used to replace American workers and if it is, any company that attempts to do so will face serious legal penalties and even prosecution.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week in an interview on the Laura Ingraham Show, Cruz laid out the serious abuses by major corporations of the H-1B visas over the past few years. He said the program was designed to bring in true talent that was not readily available in America.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re seeing report after report after report of companies, not bringing in high-skilled workers, but bringing in people with college degrees\u2013sometimes from diploma mills\u2013and bringing them in to lay off American workers and forcing the American workers to train the people they\u2019re bringing in. That is illegal [and] it is wrong.\u201d He said he\u2019s working with Sen. Jeff Sessions on introducing legislation to fundamentally reform the abuses in the H-1B program.\n\nHe told Ingraham that he does not believe it\u2019s a good idea to increase immigration levels and with that the tripling of H-1B visas as Rubio has relentlessly sought to do:\n\nI was introducing a whole series of amendments in part to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Democrats. So, for example, the Democrats claimed they were supporting high-tech workers so I introduced an amendment on that\u2014and every Democrat voted against it. It demonstrated that this was all a political endeavor for them and that what they were saying wasn\u2019t true.\n\nEarlier in his interview with Ingraham, Cruz reminded listeners that in the 1980s Congress made a deal to grant amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants in exchange for securing the borders. But the borders never got secured.\n\n\u201cAnd today, instead of 3 million it\u2019s 12 million and the estimates are even higher than that,\u201d Cruz said. He then said certain members of Congress are attempt to do the very same thing today. \u201cThe Gang of Eight fought tooth and nail to try and jam this amnesty down the American peoples\u2019 throat\u201d and that \u201cthe Gang of Eight voted as a gang against enforcing and securing the border.\u201d\n\nAs for Rubio\u2019s amnesty plan? Cruz said \u201cthe American people quite reasonably said \u2018no.'\u201d\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz and on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before formally unveiling his immigration program in Florida, Cruz appeared on the Mike Gallagher Show.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Before formally unveiling his immigration program in Florida, Cruz appeared on the Mike Gallagher Show.", "title": "'I Laughed Out Loud': Ted Cruz on Marco Rubio Claiming They Share Same Immigration Record - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Cruz-Fla.-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/14/laughed-loud-ted-cruz-marco-rubio-claiming-share-immigration-record/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before formally unveiling his immigration program in Florida, Cruz appeared on the Mike Gallagher Show.", "creator": "@AdelleNaz", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Cruz-Fla.-Getty.jpg", "title": "'I Laughed Out Loud': Ted Cruz on Marco Rubio Claiming They Share Same Immigration Record - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "H-1B visas absues, immigration, Laura Ingraham Show, Marco Rubio, Mike Gallagher Show, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-11-14T10:34:02-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe185e\"", "article_summary": "The Texan he laughed at Rubio\u2019s claims that he shares the same immigration record as Cruz.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSen.
