Photo: Nick Moir\n\nAn elderly couple who killed their disabled son nearly 15 years ago while \u2018\u2018depressed and stressed\u2019\u2019 have been found dead in their western Sydney home.\n\nRaymond and Margaret Sutton, who were placed on good behaviour bonds over the death of their 28-year-old son Matthew in 2001, were found dead inside their Leonay home, near Penrith, on Saturday morning.\n\nMrs Sutton\u2019s brother became concerned and called the police, who broke into the couple\u2019s Pleasant Place home at 11am and found two bodies.\n\nA police spokeswoman said it was not yet clear how the pair died but murder-suicide would be one line of inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeighbours described the pair as reclusive, saying they kept to themselves since moving into the one-storey brick home about 10 years ago.\n\nThe Suttons avoided jail time in 2007 for the manslaughter of their son, who was blind from birth and intellectually disabled.\n\nThey suffered from depression and stress and were affected by an \"abnormality of mind\" when they gave Matthew a fatal dose of sedatives, the NSW Supreme Court found.\n\nA judge placed them both on five-year good behaviour bonds in 2007, saying it would be cruel and not in the community's interest to see them jailed.\n\nThe couple's barrister, Tony Bellanto, QC, said they would live with what had happened \"for the rest of their lives\" and had been living with \"stress, depression [and] hardship for 30-odd years now\".\n\nJustice Graham Barr said the couple had devoted their lives to caring for their son and \"even the last act was one born of love for him\".\n\n\"They believed that what they did was right. Of course, it was not.\"\n\nMr Sutton initially told police he found their son dead in his bed but police grew suspicious in 2003 and placed listening devices in the home, which detected the couple talking about euthanasia and lying.\n\nIn 2003, Mrs Sutton was heard saying to her husband: \u2018\u2018Long after the police have finished with us we will have to live with it anyway.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey admitted to killing their son in 2005.\n\nA neighbour, who did not wish to be identified, said the pair \u2018\u2018pretty much kept to themselves\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s sad, you don\u2019t expect something like that to happen,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nForensic officers remained at the home on Saturday evening. A report will be prepared for the coroner.\n\nLifeline: 131114\n\nSane Australia: 1800 187263", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "An elderly couple have been found dead in their western Sydney home in a possible murder-suicide.", "title": "Double death of parents who killed their son Matthew Sutton", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/double-death-of-parents-who-killed-their-son-matthew-sutton-20140614-zs7z8.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/s/8/2/h/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zs7z8.png/1402727134163.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/s/8/2/h/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zs7z8.png/1402727134163.jpg"}, "title": "Double death of parents who killed their son Matthew Sutton", "description": "An elderly couple have been found dead in their western Sydney home in a possible murder-suicide.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "An elderly couple have been found dead in their western Sydney home in a possible murder-suicide."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a08\"", "article_summary": "Raymond and Margaret Sutton leave court after being handed good behaviour bonds over the death of their son in 2001.\nRaymond and Margaret Sutton, who were placed on good behaviour bonds over the death of their 28-year-old son Matthew in 2001, were found dead inside their Leonay home, near Penrith, on Saturday morning.\nA judge placed them both on five-year good behaviour bonds in 2007, saying it would be cruel and not in the community's interest to see them jailed.\nPhoto: Nick MoirAn elderly couple who killed their disabled son nearly 15 years ago while \u2018\u2018depressed and stressed\u2019\u2019 have been found dead in their western Sydney home.\nThe Suttons avoided jail time in 2007 for the manslaughter of their son, who was blind from birth and intellectually disabled."}
