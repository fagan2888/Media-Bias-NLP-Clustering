The tribal relations associate for SoonerCare is Katie Carden. Carden says more Native Americans and native veterans need to sign up because not only are there more services available for them to take advantage of, it will pay their tribal clinics for services received. In fact, SoonerCare is the third largest payer to Indian Health Service.\n\nKatie Carden, a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, wants Native Americans to sign up for SoonerCare.\n\n\u201cWe actually have SoonerCare providers that are Indian Health Care providers,\u201d Carden said. \u201cThere's 14 tribes and all of Indian Health Services are contracted providers with SoonerCare.\n\n\u201cWhat we say is American Indians don't have to choose between SoonerCare and the Indian health care system, they can do both, they can access both,\u201d Carden said. \u201cThere are also more choices for health care because they can utilize our huge network of 39,000 providers.\u201d\n\nCarden says the two services can work hand in hand to the patients benefit.\n\n\u201cSoonerCare members are eligible to receive services within Indian Health Care systems,\u201d Carden said.\n\n\u201cThey can take there SoonerCare cards to their appointment and then that facility can be reimbursed for the care they provide to our members,\u201d Carden said. \u201cThis allows the facility to save resources for other members in their community.\u201d\n\nOne of the benefits of being a member of SoonerCare is SoonerRide.\n\nIts non-emergency transportation for members of SoonerCare, 6 days a week from 7a.m. to 6 p.m. Members need to call in and make an appointment three business days in advance.\n\nEarlier this year at the sixth annual Tribal Epidemiology Center Public Health Conference, one of the concerns raised was that of transportation needs, with an emphasis on Native American veterans.\n\n\u201cTransportation is a huge issue, not only with Native Americans, but especially with Native American veterans,\u201d Carden said. \u201cSo we are able to transport our veterans to the VA hospital also and Indian Health service appointments or appointments at the tribal clinics.\u201d\n\nCarden said one of the biggest misconceptions about SoonerCare is that it\u2019s not real insurance.\n\n\u201cIt is credible health coverage,\u201d Carden said. \u201cWith SoonerCare you will not be fined with the new ACA (Affordable Care Act) mandates on your taxes.\u201d\n\nSoonerCare is based on your household income. Guidelines can be seen by going to their website www.mysoonercare.org.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nCherokee Nation Celebrates 1839 Act of Union\n\nCherokee Nation officials are marking an 1839 date that began the creation of what became the tribe\u2019s current form of government. A ceremony in Cherokee Nation Capitol Square will recognize the 175th anniversary of the 1839 Act of Union.\n\nThe act created a unified political body for Cherokees who relocated west years before the tribe\u2019s forced removal and those who settled in the area after the Trail of Tears.\n\nCherokee officials plan to honor the milestone by planting a dogwood tree at the square. The dogwood has cultural significance to Cherokees because it can be found along the Trail of Tears and throughout northeast Oklahoma, where the tribe is based today.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nVincent G. Logan Sworn In As Special Trustee For American Indians\n\nOklahoman and former resident of Norman, Vincent G. Logan, was sworn in this week as Special Trustee for American Indians or OST. Confirmed on June 26, 2014 by members of the U.S. Senate, he was sworn in on July 7, 2014, to lead the Department of the Interior office that oversees the management of more than $4.6 billion in American Indian trust funds.\n\nA member of the Osage Nation, Special Trustee Logan is the fourth person to hold this position since OST was established in 1994. Special Trustee Logan said he the believes \u201cthe protection and preservation of Indian trust assets is one of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s most sacred trust responsibilities,\u201d and that he looks \u201cforward to supporting that critically important pillar of the trust.\u201d\n\nLogan is committed to investment education for tribal individuals and youth. He developed a training program, Your First Paycheck, based on his experience growing up in Oklahoma and receiving his first paycheck through the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program. He knows that a lack of investment knowledge limits a community\u2019s capacity for sustained growth and development.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nUpcoming Native Events:\n\nJuly 17-20, Thursday-Sunday is the 133rd Annual Otoe-Missouria Summer Encampment taking place on the Otoe-Missouria Encampment grounds, 7500 Hwy 177 (20 miles north of Stillwater) in Red Rock, OK.
