About the teams

The Tribune’s All-Hillsborough County cross country teams were selected by staff writer Scott Purks based on regular-season and postseason performances but with particular emphasis on the county and state championships. Due to the great variance in courses and race-day conditions, head-to-head comparisons between runners were generally given great consideration. The boys and girls cross country runners of the year and the boys and girls coaches of the year will be announced at the annual Parade of Athletes banquet May 19, 2014.
