As he noted in \u201cLife on the Mississippi,\u201d\n\nThere is one faculty which a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it to absolute perfection. . . . That faculty is memory. He cannot stop with merely thinking a thing is so-and-so, he must know it. . . . One cannot easily realize what a tremendous thing it is to know every trivial detail of twelve hundred miles of river and know it with absolute exactness.\n\nTwain expected the going to be as easy as a straight stretch of deep water under the light of a noonday sun. It wasn\u2019t. His memory was too close to absolute perfection, and he soon ran across snags and shoals unlike the ones to which he was accustomed south of Memphis and north of Vicksburg, an embarrassment he admitted in 1899 to a reporter from the London Times: \u201cYou cannot lay bare your private soul and look at it. You are too much ashamed of yourself. It is too disgusting.\u201d\n\nBut Twain doesn\u2019t abandon his attempt at autobiography, because the longer he stays the course\u2014for thirty-four years and through as many drafts of misbegotten manuscript while also writing nine other books, among them Huckleberry Finn\u2014the more clearly he comes to see that what he intends is not the examination of an inner child or the confessions of a cloistered id. His topic is of a match with that of the volume here in hand\u2014America and the Americans making their nineteenth-century passage from an agrarian democracy to an industrial oligarchy, to Twain\u2019s mind a great and tragic tale, and one that no other writer of his generation was better positioned to tell because none had seen the country at so many of its compass points or become as acquainted with so many of its oddly assorted inhabitants.\n\nBorn in Missouri in 1835 on the frontier of what was still Indian territory, Twain as a boy of ten had seen the flogging and lynching of Negro slaves, had been present in his twenties not only at the wheel of the steamboats Pennsylvania and Alonzo Child but also at the pithead of the Comstock Lode when in 1861 he joined the going westward to the Nevada silver mines and the California goldfields, there to keep company with underage murderers and overage whores. In San Francisco he writes newspaper sketches and satires, becomes known as \u201cThe Wild Humorist of the Pacific Slope\u201d who tells funny stories to the dancing girls and gamblers in the city\u2019s waterfront saloons.\n\nBack east in the 1870s, Twain settles in Hartford, Connecticut, an eminent man of letters and property, and for the next thirty years, oracle for all occasions and star attraction on the national and international lecture stage, his wit and wisdom everywhere a wonder to behold\u2014at banquet tables with presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt, in New York City\u2019s Tammany Hall with swindling politicians and thieving financiers, on the program at the Boston Lyceum with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Horace Greeley, Petroleum V. Nasby, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He also traveled forty-nine times across the Atlantic, and once across the Indian Ocean, as a dutiful tourist surveying the sights in Rome, Paris, and the Holy Land; as an itinerant sage entertaining crowds in Australia and Ceylon.\n\nLaughter was Twain\u2019s stock-in-trade, and he produced it in sufficient quantity to make bearable the acquaintance with grief he knew to be generously distributed among all present in a Newport drawing room or a Nevada brothel. Whether the audience was drunk or sober, swaddled in fur or armed with pistols, Twain recognized it as likely in need of comic relief. \u201cThe hard and sordid things in life,\u201d he once said, \u201care too hard and too sordid and too cruel for us to know and touch them year after year without some mitigating influence.\u201d He bottled the influence under whatever label drummed up a crowd\u2014burlesque, satire, parody, sarcasm, ridicule\u2014any or all of it guaranteed to fortify the blood and restore the spirit.\n\nTwain coined the phrase the \u201cGilded Age\u201d as a pejorative, to mark the calamity that was the collision of the democratic ideal with the democratic reality, the promise of a free, forbearing, and tolerant society run aground on the reef of destruction formed by the accruals of vanity and greed that Twain understood to be not a society at all but a state of war. The ostrich feathers and the mirrored glass, he associated with the epithet citified, \u201csuggesting the absence of all spirituality, and the presence of all kinds of paltry materialisms and mean ideals and mean vanities and silly cynicisms.\u201d His struggling with his own paltry materialisms further delayed the composition of the autobiography. For thirty-four years he couldn\u2019t get out of his own way, kept trying to find a language worthy of a monument, to dress up the many manuscripts in literary velvets and brocades.\n\nEventually faced with the approaching sandbar of his death, he puts aside his pen and ink and elects to dictate, not write, what he construes as his \u201cbequest to posterity.\u201d He begins the experiment in 1904 in Florence, where he has rented a handsome villa in which to care for his cherished, dying wife. To William Dean Howells, close friend and trusted editor, he writes to say, \u201cI\u2019ve struck it!\u201d a method that removes all traces of a style that is \u201ctoo prim, too nice,\u201d too slow and artificial in its movement for the telling of a story.\n\n\u201cNarrative,\u201d he had said at the outset of his labors,\n\nshould flow as flows the brook down through the hills and the leafy woodlands . . . a brook that never goes straight for a minute, but goes, and goes briskly, and sometimes ungrammatically, and sometimes fetching a horseshoe three-quarters of a mile around and at the end of the circuit flowing within the yard of the path it traversed an hour before; but always going, and always following at least one law, always loyal to that law, the law of narrative, which has no law. Nothing to do but make the trip; the how of it is not important so that the trip is made.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"A man at play with freedoms of his mind, believing allegiance to the truth and not the flag rescues democracy\"", "title": "Mark Twain\u2019s democratic ideal: How truth, laughter defeat \u201csweet-smelling, sugar-coated lies\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"A man at play with freedoms of his mind, believing allegiance to the truth and not the flag rescues democracy\"", "title": "Mark Twain\u2019s democratic ideal: How truth, laughter defeat \u201csweet-smelling, sugar-coated lies\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/mark_twains_democratic_ideal_how_truth_laughter_defeat_sweet_smelling_sugar_coated_lies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/mark_twain4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"A man at play with freedoms of his mind, believing allegiance to the truth and not the flag rescues democracy\"", "title": "Mark Twain\u2019s democratic ideal: How truth, laughter defeat \u201csweet-smelling, sugar-coated lies\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/mark_twain4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lewis H.
