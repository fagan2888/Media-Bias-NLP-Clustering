The usual places. But many of them might also be found in unusual spots. And they\u2019re not there for fun. They\u2019re there to get medical treatment they can\u2019t get at home.\n\nAccording to data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, as many as 41,838 Canadians \u2014 out of a population of about 35 million \u2014 left the country last year for health care treatment. More than 42,000 left in 2012, while more than 46,000 sought treatment elsewhere the year before.\n\nDestinations, according to a University of Minnesota study that looked at Canadian companies that arrange medical tourism, include Costa Rica, India, Thailand and the U.S. Some companies even send clients to Mexico, Turkey, Poland and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Fraser Institute of Canada calls the 2013 figure a conservative estimate and, though some will argue otherwise, believes it is a sizable number, one that says something deeply damning about Canadian care.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how many Canadians receive their health care in another country each year gives some insight into the state of health care in Canada,\u201d Nadeem Esmail wrote in the May/June 2013 Fraser Forum.\n\n\u201cOne of the unfortunate realities of Canada\u2019s monopolistic health care system is that some people feel they have no choice but to seek the care they need outside the country,\u201d Esmail and Bacchus Barua wrote in an op-ed published last month in a couple of Canadian newspapers. \u201cAnd who can blame them?\u201d\n\nThose who leave Canada for treatment do so for a number of reasons, but they are all related to the country\u2019s government-run health care system.\n\nSome leave due to Canada\u2019s long and sometimes deadly waiting periods. Others are treated outside the country because there is \u201ca lack of available resources or the fact that some procedures or equipment are not provided in their home jurisdiction,\u201d Esmail and Barua wrote.\n\nFurther reasons for leaving, says Fraser, include:\n\n\u0095 Concerns about the quality of medicine in a country\u2019s whose system destroys the incentives needed to build more advanced facilities and develop higher tech medicine.\n\n\u0095 Better treatment outcomes in other countries.\n\n\u0095 Avoidance of the consequences of waiting for care, which include deteriorating health and poorer post-treatment outcomes that can result in disability or even death.\n\n\u0095 Bypassing the inevitable delays in care so patients can be treated and return to their lives sooner.\n\nThe citizens of a developed nation shouldn\u2019t have to travel to less-developed nations to get their health care. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the inevitable product of a state-run system such as the one in Canada.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: Where do Canadians go on vacation?
