Republicans in the State Senate tried to block it by refusing to support the creation of an independent authority to run it. New York could have followed 36 other states in simply joining the exchange set up by the federal government, whose numerous problems were not yet evident. Instead Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo established the state \u2019s exchange by executive order, deeding it to \u201cseasoned stagehands,\u201d as Mr. Newell put it, in the Health Department.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout 508,000 of those who enrolled qualified for Medicaid and 63,000 for Child Health Plus, another government-subsidized plan; 363,000 bought private plans. The number who purchased private plans by March 31, the enrollment deadline for 2014 coverage, exceeded federal government predictions for New York by more than 60 percent. Nationwide, thanks to a last-minute surge, 7.1 million people signed up for private plans by the end of March, allowing the Obama administration to hit its goal of 7 million.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research institution, has ranked New York\u2019s exchange as the most competitive of seven states studied, based in part on the large number of companies participating and their relatively balanced market share.\n\nIn an unusual decision that had a strong impact on consumer choices, New York required insurers to offer the same type of coverage on the exchange as off.\n\nThe result was that none of New York\u2019s insurers offered out-of-network coverage for individuals, except in a small part of western New York, because they wanted to hold down costs and avoid being swamped by sick people. So regardless of whether individuals buy their plans on the exchange or off, they cannot get coverage outside a fixed network of doctors and hospitals, even if they are willing to pay more for it.\n\nWith no out-of-network coverage, \u201cNew York is a real outlier,\u201d said Mr. Scherzer, who advocates more options. \u201cBut they did it in part because they thought it would keep premiums down, which of course it does,\u201d he said.\n\nState officials say the decision served to level the playing field for insurance companies and consumers. But it has led to complaints from consumers who cannot go to the doctors or hospitals they want.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe sickest customers tend to be the most upset, like Abigail List, a 53-year-old therapist in Manhattan, who said she had to choose one of the most expensive plans, costing $300 more a month than others, so she could have coverage for her longtime cancer doctors at NYU-Langone Medical Center. \u201cI\u2019m being railroaded, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so furious,\u201d Ms. List said.\n\nThe most prestigious and specialized hospitals tend to take the fewest plans on the exchange. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the renowned cancer hospital, takes only two exchange plans for individuals, Health Republic and Oscar.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly difficult to take the pricing that some of the other insurers on the exchanges are proposing,\u201d said John Gunn, the chief operating officer for Sloan-Kettering. \u201cIt was way below our cost of providing the service.\u201d\n\nHe said Sloan-Kettering was working with about 100 patients to make sure they had access to the hospital if they needed it, either by being in network or by special arrangement.\n\nBenjamin Lawsky, the state\u2019s financial services superintendent, said that not requiring out-of-network coverage was strategic in the first year but was being reconsidered. \u201cAs we think about setting rates for Year Two, has the exchange matured enough that we think it\u2019s wise to mandate an out-of-network benefit?\u201d Mr. Lawsky said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make that decision probably in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe exchange also benefited from the state\u2019s refusal to reinstate canceled plans when President Obama said it could; state officials said restoring the plans would have caused chaos by upsetting insurance pricing.\n\nThe state\u2019s rollout was not without snags. Its website was swamped on the first day but capacity was quadrupled over the next four days.\n\nSome doctors have complained that they are mistakenly listed in plans they do not accept, or have been cut from plans they would like to be on. Empire BlueCross BlueShield, overwhelmed by early sign-ups, agreed to pay cash penalties to about 20,000 customers who did not receive their insurance cards in time for coverage in January.\n\nBut others were surprisingly willing to forgive the exchange its shortcomings.\n\nMarilyn Miller, a retired ballet dancer who now runs Pilates on Hudson in Peekskill, N.Y., had her old plan canceled. But she is happy that her new one covers regular doctor visits, and she is putting money into a health savings account in case she ever needs to see a specialist outside of her network.\n\n\u201cIt was well worth it to be able to get insurance and not have it tied to my business,\u201d Ms. Miller said.\n\nMalka Percal, 63, a copy editor who lives in downtown Manhattan, lost her freelancer\u2019s plan and her \u201creally wonderful\u201d doctor. But she likes the promise of universal health care. \u201cIs it Pollyannaish of me?\u201d she said. \u201cI have a really hopeful feeling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140413200631, "twitter": {"description": "More than 900,000 residents signed up for health plans, and premiums have dropped, though the state limited consumers\u2019 choices.", "title": "In New York, Hard Choices on Health Exchange Spell Success", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/nyregion/in-new-york-hard-choices-on-health-exchange-spell-success.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002823592"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "anemonanyc", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/nyregion/14EXCHANGE2/14EXCHANGE2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/nyregion/in-new-york-hard-choices-on-health-exchange-spell-success.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002823592", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/nyregion/in-new-york-hard-choices-on-health-exchange-spell-success.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "nyregion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 13, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "New York State,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Anemona Hartocollis", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/nyregion/14EXCHANGE2/14EXCHANGE2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "More than 900,000 residents signed up for health plans, and premiums have dropped, though the state limited consumers\u2019 choices.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/nyregion/14EXCHANGE2/14EXCHANGE2-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "More than 900,000 residents signed up for health plans, and premiums have dropped, though the state limited consumers\u2019 choices.", "CG": "nyregion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/anemona_hartocollis/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/nyregion/index.html", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "modified": "2014-04-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2014-04-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "C4DC8C0C-E148-4201-BF10-82F1C903DBFB"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "New York State", "slug": "14exchange", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140414130011, "hdl_p": "In New York, Hard Choices on Health Exchange Spell Success", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/nyregion/in-new-york-hard-choices-on-health-exchange-spell-success.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/nyregion/14EXCHANGE2/14EXCHANGE2-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More than 900,000 residents signed up for health plans, and premiums have dropped, though the state limited consumers\u2019 choices.", "title": "In New York, Hard Choices on Health Exchange Spell Success"}, "pdate": 20140413, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000002823592, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "In New York, Hard Choices on Health Exchange Spell Success", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0302\"", "article_summary": "Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the renowned cancer hospital, takes only two exchange plans for individuals, Health Republic and Oscar.\nWith no out-of-network coverage, \u201cNew York is a real outlier,\u201d said Mr. Scherzer, who advocates more options.\nIndividual premiums for Manhattan residents, for instance, dropped from $1,534 for a standard health maintenance organization, or H.M.O., in 2013 to $621 for a comparable exchange plan now.\n\u201cSo in those other states, you have health plans trying to figure it out,\u201d said Peter Newell, an analyst for the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit research organization.\n\u201cIn New York, you could sidestep a lot of problems.\u201dStill, the exchange had a rough start."}
