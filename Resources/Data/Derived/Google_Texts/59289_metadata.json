But if sports are based on what-have-you-done-for-me-lately logic, the Avs can claim to be on the upswing. They have won three of their past four games, the one loss being a one-goal loss to Washington on a night they outshot the Caps and controlled play for the most part.\n\nThe Avs were allowing an average of 38.9 shots on net at one point last week. That number is down to 34.1, and while it remains third-most in the NHL, it\u2019s progress. Roy thinks he knows why.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been possessing the puck more,\u201d Roy said. \u201cDefensively, we (are not) staying (as) long in our end. Earlier this season, we could be a minute, a minute ten or twenty in our own end. Now, it\u2019s like 10, 15, 20, 30 seconds at most. Maybe one or two times we\u2019re going to be more than 30 seconds.\u201d\n\nStarting with a practice in New York the day before the Avs played the Rangers at Madison Square Garden a couple weeks ago, Roy got after his forwards to keep things simpler and go harder to the net. Stop trying to make the perfect play, Roy implored at the practice at Chelsea Piers Sky Rink, get a little greasier in front of the net, set screens and throw pucks on net and create traffic. The Avs have scored more \u201cdirty\u201d goals since.\n\n\u201cThis is how we score goals lately. I mean, E.J. (Erik Johnson) had a wrister the other night and Jarome (Iginla) set a great screen in front of the net. Zach Redmond went to the net. Jarome \u2014 there was traffic when he took his (game-tying) shot. There\u2019s no way the goalie could have seen that shot,\u201d Roy said.\n\nWith eight regulars out of the lineup with injuries \u2014 but maybe even if they weren\u2019t \u2014 the Avs know they need to play simpler hockey. The message seems to have sunk in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting there, but I think we are just playing better fundamental hockey than we were,\u201d captain Gabe Landeskog said. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re working just as hard as our talent level.\u201d\n\nTanguay back. Winger Alex Tanguay, who missed Saturday\u2019s game with a fractured cheek bone, will return Tuesday in Arizona.\n\nTanguay will wear a full facial shield, as he did at practice Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the third time in three weeks I got hit with a puck in the face,\u201d Tanguay said. \u201cSo, I hope my time has passed. It was not fun. The first hour after it happened, you have the feeling like you want to throw up. But after I got to the hospital and got some medication, I felt fine.\u201d\n\nCOLORADO AT ARIZONA\n\n7 p.m. Tuesday, ALT2; 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Shane Doan: The captain of the Coyotes is the only player left in the NHL who played for the original incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets before they moved to Arizona. He broke in with Winnipeg in the 1995-96 season and is still a good player at age 38. He has 14 points (seven goals) through 22 games. Doan has career totals of 1,337 games and 361 goals.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nAvalanche: Reto Berra will start in goal Tuesday. He has struggled, allowing six goals on his past 36 shots, and was pulled in the first period of Saturday\u2019s game vs. Carolina. But coach Patrick Roy said he remains confident in the Swiss goalie. \u2026 Roy said No. 1 goalie Semyon Varlamov (groin injury) will not be rushed back. Varlamov didn\u2019t practice Monday. \u2026 Roy said Paul Carey was brought up from Lake Erie to replace Andrew Agozzino to give the Avs more speed for the next two games, against the Coyotes and Chicago. \u2026 Roy said defenseman Brad Stuart (hamstring) hasn\u2019t made as much progress as originally hoped, so there no longer is a timetable on his return. \u2026 Center John Mitchell (leg) didn\u2019t practice Monday and won\u2019t play Tuesday.\n\nCoyotes: Arizona\u2019s average of 28.6 shots per game ranks 25th in the NHL. \u2026 The Coyotes rank fifth in the league in faceoffs, winning 52.5 percent.\n\nAdrian Dater, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Going back to basics paying off for Avs", "title": "Going back to basics paying off for Avs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/24/going-back-to-basics-paying-off-for-avs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141124__44a5346a0d0d342e660f6a70670040efp1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141124__44a5346a0d0d342e660f6a70670040efp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-24T15:40:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:14:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda20d\"", "article_summary": "The Avs were allowing an average of 38.9 shots on net at one point last week.\nThe Avs remain last in the Central Division entering Tuesday\u2019s game with the Arizona Coyotes at Jobing.com Arena.\nBut if sports are based on what-have-you-done-for-me-lately logic, the Avs can claim to be on the upswing.\nWith eight regulars out of the lineup with injuries \u2014 but maybe even if they weren\u2019t \u2014 the Avs know they need to play simpler hockey.\nCoyotes: Arizona\u2019s average of 28.6 shots per game ranks 25th in the NHL."}
