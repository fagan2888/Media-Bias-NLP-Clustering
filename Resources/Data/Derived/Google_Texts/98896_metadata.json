Don\u2019t bet on it\n\nposted at 8:41 pm on April 29, 2015 by Noah Rothman\n\nRepublicans will take heart in McClatchy\u2019s latest headline. On Wednesday, the news outlet asserted definitively that Democrats are \u201closing\u201d their \u201cgrip on young voters.\u201d They made this pronouncement after perusing the results of the latest Harvard University survey of voters age 18-29. That poll found that only 55 percent of young people want to see a Democrat in the White House when Barack Obama leaves office. Another 40 percent favor a generic Republican to win the White House in 2016.\n\nThat\u2019s down sharply from the 66-32 percent support they gave Obama against Republican John McCain in 2008. It\u2019s also down from the 60-37 percent support they gave Obama in 2012 against Republican Mitt Romney. Instead, it\u2019s about the same as the 54-45 margin they gave Democrat John Kerry in 2004 over Republican President George W. Bush. Kerry lost the general election. Young voters are \u201cup for grabs\u201d in 2016, according to John Della Volpe, the institute\u2019s polling director.\n\nRepublican hopes ahead of 2016 will be further buoyed by a variety of other findings in this survey. 57 percent of young people favor sending American troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. 35 percent support America\u2019s role in resolving conflicts abroad; a 10-point increase from the same survey last year.\n\nSo, the longstanding near-monopoly the Democratic Party has had on the youth vote is crumbling, right? Slow down.\n\nThis poll also found that young people are relatively tuned out of the presidential race, as are most members of the general electorate this far out from Election Day. Just 21 percent of voters in this age group described themselves as \u201cpolitically engaged.\u201d In 2011, a plurality of young people polled in Harvard\u2019s survey of millennial voters predicted that Barack Obama would lose his reelection bid. Those voters also were generally described as disengaged in the political process. But when they finally tuned in, they backed the Democratic candidate.\n\nThere\u2019s every reason to believe that this familiar pattern will recur in 2016.\n\n\u201cForeign policy and immigration rate as much more important issues for older voters than younger voters,\u201d read a September, 2014, release from Pew Research Center. \u201cYoung voters are much more likely than older voters to consider the environment when casting their ballots: 64% of 18-29 year old voters say this will be very important to their vote, compared with only about half (51%) of voters 50 and older.\u201d\n\nThat same poll found that voters age 18 \u2013 29 join Democrats, college graduates, and African-Americans as the only subgroups in which a majority of respondents who approved of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn the issues, Democrats continue to enjoy the support of more young people than do Republicans. It\u2019s a historical constant, a likely outgrowth of America\u2019s progressive tax code, and a phenomenon isn\u2019t going to disappear by this time next year. While polls like Harvard\u2019s latest might provide news outlets like McClatchy with an opportunity to weave a provocative headline, but you shouldn\u2019t believe the hype. At least, not yet.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Every year.", "title": "Are young people finally giving up on Democrats?
