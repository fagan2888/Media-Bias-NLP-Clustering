Working parents pay vastly different shares of their income for child care, depending on where they live in Colorado, according to a new analysis. A single mother in Gunnison County may pay up to 85 percent of household income for child care, compared to about 12 percent in Ouray.

The report is the first in a three-part series from The Women’s Foundation, Qualistar Colorado and the Colorado Children’s Campaign to better comprehend what is driving prices, with a focus on helping low-income single working women achieve self-sufficiency.

The highest percentage of income paid by single mothers includes counties like Park and Denver (about 48 percent); Fremont (46 percent); and Delta (45 percent.)

“By looking closely at what families across Colorado are experiencing as they search for affordable care, we can see what is driving differences in local communities and begin to look for solutions to making child care more affordable for families,” said Louise Atkinson, president and CEO of The Women’s Foundation, in a statement.
