He was 71.\n\nA statement issued by the Rainwater Charitable Foundation said Rainwater died Sunday morning at his Fort Worth, Texas, home after a long battle with a rare neurological disease. He had been battling progressive supranuclear palsy since 2009 and had pumped millions into a campaign to finding a cure.\n\nMelissa Parrish, president of Rainwater Inc., also confirmed the death.\n\nAmong Rainwater\u2019s career achievements was conducting billionaire investor Sid Bass\u2019 acquisition of a major stake in the Walt Disney Co. and partnering with future President George W. Bush in the 1989 purchase of the Texas Rangers baseball team.\n\nForbes magazine listed Rainwater as the world\u2019s 663rd wealthiest person and ranked him 236th in the United States with an estimated net worth of $3 billion in 2015.\n\nThe Bass family, heirs to Texas oil wildcatter Sid Richardson\u2019s fortune, hired the Stanford Business School graduate from Goldman Sachs to manage its investments when Rainwater was 26, the statement said. In 1984, Richardson and Sid Bass invested $478 million in a struggling Walt Disney Co. and helped to install then-Paramount Pictures President Michael Eisner as Disney\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nIn 1986, when he turned 42, Rainwater went into business for himself and later helped to engineer Bush\u2019s purchase of the Rangers, foundation of Bush\u2019s personal fortune.\n\n\u201cI was so saddened to learn that my friend Richard Rainwater died this weekend. Richard had a brilliant mind and a generous heart. He was a lot of fun, inspiring to be around, and generous and courageous to the very end,\u201d Bush said in a statement issued by his office Sunday.\n\nRainwater also mentored other investors such as David Bonderman, another Bass family employee who went on to become founding partner of TPG Capital. The firm has helped to recapitalize such businesses as Neiman Marcus department stores, Continental Airlines and Burger King.\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke describes progressive supranuclear palsy as a brain disorder that causes serious and progressive problems with control of gait and balance, along with complex eye movement and thinking problems.\n\nRainwater hadn\u2019t made any public appearances since 2010, according to the charitable foundation\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThere is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened,\u201d son Matthew Rainwater said in the statement.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA5L25vcnRoLXRleGFzLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWludmVzdG9yLXBoaWxhbnRocm9waXN0LWRpZXMtYXQtNzEuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Chris Siron", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "From the Associated Press: Richard Rainwater, the son of a North Texas grocer who went on to amass a fortune as an investment manager before becoming a billionaire investor and\u2026", "title": "North Texas billionaire investor, philanthropist Richard Rainwater dies at 71", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/09/north-texas-billionaire-investor-philanthropist-dies-at-71.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-09-27T20:14:58Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "A statement issued by the Rainwater Charitable Foundation said Rainwater died Sunday morning at his Fort Worth, Texas, home after a long battle with a rare neurological disease.\nIn 1986, when he turned 42, Rainwater went into business for himself and later helped to engineer Bush\u2019s purchase of the Rangers, foundation of Bush\u2019s personal fortune.\n\u201cThere is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened,\u201d son Matthew Rainwater said in the statement.\nHe had been battling progressive supranuclear palsy since 2009 and had pumped millions into a campaign to finding a cure.\nMelissa Parrish, president of Rainwater Inc., also confirmed the death."}
