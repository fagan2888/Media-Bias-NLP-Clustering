The Tea and Fashion show, set for 2 to 4 p.m. April 24 at East Street Studios, 18880 N. East St., helps the clinic raise money to provide the free care.\n\n\u201cNow what we are also seeing is a group of individuals called the underinsured, and those are groups that can\u2019t be on Medicaid but can\u2019t afford to pay the policy,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cThere is still a need for healthcare, the Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t solve all the problems with the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nHeart and Soul is open on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month for free health care, and the dental clinic was recently launched as well, open on the first Saturday of each month. The dental clinic is estimated to cost approximately $38,000 to run each year, and Brownell said the Tea and Fashion show is the biggest fundraiser for the clinic.\n\nA silent auction, fashion show with items from Francesca\u2019s and Union Street Flowers and Gifts, shopping and catering with tea, punch and finger foods like mini scones and sandwiches will be available at the event. The shopping is new this year, and will have local apparel and accessories for sale. Brownell suggested that those who attend wishing to shop arrive at 1:30 p.m. or earlier.\n\nTickets cost $50 for individuals or $350 for a sponsored table of eight. The deadline to purchase tickets is April 22.\n\nTo purchase tickets, visit the Heart and Soul Clinic or call 317-804-5782.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://currentinwestfield.com/2016/heart-and-soul-to-hold-6th-annual-spring-fundraiser/", "type": "article", "image": "http://currentinwestfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CIW-HEALTH-0412-DentalClinic3.jpg", "site_name": "Current in Westfield", "title": "Heart and Soul to hold 6th annual spring fundraiser"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "To purchase tickets, visit the Heart and Soul Clinic or call 317-804-5782.\n\u201cThere is a big misnomer that people in Hamilton County are fine,\u201d Brownell, the executive director of the Heart and Soul Clinic of Westfield, said.\nThe dental clinic is estimated to cost approximately $38,000 to run each year, and Brownell said the Tea and Fashion show is the biggest fundraiser for the clinic.\nThe Tea and Fashion show, set for 2 to 4 p.m. April 24 at East Street Studios, 18880 N.
