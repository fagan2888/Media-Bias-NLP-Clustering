At 4-4 with a runner at second and two outs, Sborz worked the count full to Florida\u2019s No. 4 hitter JJ Schwarz. The Virginia reliever then blew a fastball by Schwarz to end the inning.\n\nSTAR OF THE GAME\n\nKenny Towns drove in Virginia\u2019s final three runs to propel the Cavaliers back into the championship series. The senior third baseman delivered a two-run double in the fifth inning to give his team a 4-3 lead, then produced the game-winning run with a seventh-inning sacrifice.\n\nKEY DECISION\n\nAfter Daniel Pinero singled with two outs in the fifth, Florida coach Kevin O\u2019Sullivan elected to bring in left-hander Kirby Snead to face Matt Thaiss, a left-handed hitter. Thaiss singled Pinero to third, and both Virginia runners scored on Towns\u2019 line-hugging double to left that put Virginia ahead 4-3.\n\nQUIRKY MOMENT\n\nWith runners on first and second in Monday\u2019s game against Florida, Sborz managed to knock down a line shot by Harrison Bader and recovered to get a forceout that helped him get out of the inning without allowing a run. Facing the same situation in Saturday\u2019s sixth inning, Sborz got Buddy Reed to hit a one-hopper back to the mound that had double play written all over it. This time, Sborz bobbled the ball and had to settle for getting Reed at first. The next hitter, Mike Rivera, singled to center to tie the game.\n\nDEFINING MOMENT\n\nPinero\u2019s sacrifice bunt put runners at second and third with one out in the seventh and left O\u2019Sullivan having to decide whether to face Thaiss or Towns. The Florida coach elected for the latter, intentionally walking Thaiss to set up a righty-righty matchup between Taylor Lewis and Towns. Towns then did what veterans are supposed to do, driving a pitch to deep right field for a sacrifice fly that put the Cavaliers up by a run.\n\nOUR TAKE\n\nFew observers expected Virginia, a team that started May in danger of not making its conference tournament, to wind up in the championship series when the NCAA tournament began. The Cavaliers might be longer on grit and guts than talent, but they again are one of the last two teams standing in Omaha.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\n\u201cThis group has a lot of pride. They have a lot of pride in playing for each other. They\u2019re going to give it everything they\u2019ve got. They\u2019re going to be prepared. It\u2019s been a lot of fun to coach them.\u201d \u2014 Virginia coach Brian O\u2019Connor", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Kenny Towns drove in three runs Saturday night as Virginia squeezed out a 5-4 win over Florida to earn a return trip to the College World Series final.
