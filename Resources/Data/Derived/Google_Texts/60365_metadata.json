They locked themselves inside, however Dandridge followed and got in through the garage. Once in the house, he pushed a juvenile to the ground, along with his sister. Dandridge then shoved his 75 year old grandmother to the floor, raised his shirt and showed them all a firearm and threatened to shoot them.\n\nHe went outside, slashed the tires on a car, and headed back to his sisters home on John King Road. He was confronted by two responding Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies.\n\nDandridge refused to comply with their demands to get on the ground. The deputies moved in and attempted to handcuff him. Dandridge fought, and struck one Deputy in the ribs with his knees while kicking his legs. They were able to place Dandridge in a patrol car. He was taken to the Okaloosa County Jail in Crestview. Neither deputy was seriously injured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Crestview man is facing multiple felonies after terrorizing his family and fighting two deputies Saturday night.", "language": "english", "author": "WJHG", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Crestview-Man-Faces-Multiple-Felonies-Terrorizies-Family-and-Fighting-Deputies-330572901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*800/Dandridge+Mark+Alan+Jr..jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Crestview man is facing multiple felonies after terrorizing his family and fighting two deputies Saturday night.", "title": "Crestview Man Faces Multiple Felonies: Terrorizes Family and Fights Deputies"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Crestview man is facing multiple felonies after terrorizing his family and fighting two deputies Saturday night.", "title": "Crestview Man Faces Multiple Felonies: Terrorizes Family and Fights Deputies", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Crestview-Man-Faces-Multiple-Felonies-Terrorizies-Family-and-Fighting-Deputies-330572901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*800/Dandridge+Mark+Alan+Jr..jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Crestview Man Faces Multiple Felonies: Terrorizes Family and Fights Deputies", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Crestview Man Faces Multiple Felonies, Terrorizes Family and Fights Deputies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce0e\"", "article_summary": "Dandridge is charged with three counts of domestic violence related aggravated assault with a weapon, domestic violence related battery, domestic violence related battery by strangulation, battery on a person 65 or older, domestic violence related child abuse without great harm, battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence, and resisting arrest \u2013 obstruction.\nDeputies say Dandridge punched his 36-year old sister in the mouth, grabbed her by the throat, and strangled until she became unconscious at her home.\nOfficials say he later fought with deputies called to the scene to protect the family.\nHe was confronted by two responding Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies.\nHe was taken to the Okaloosa County Jail in Crestview."}
