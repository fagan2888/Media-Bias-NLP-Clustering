Feinstein, the director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition on Friday reasserted something that she has said many times before, namely that the ACA doesn\u2019t conflict with the federal antitrust laws.\n\nThe statements by the FTC officials came at the end of a week that saw a federal judge in Pennsylvania refuse to block a proposed hospital merger. In that decision, Judge John E. Jones III of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania faulted the FTC for using too narrow of a market definition in evaluating the proposed merger of two Harrisburg, Pa., hospitals.\n\nThe judge also said that the changes in the health-care industry because of the ACA created a \u201cgrowing need\u201d for smaller hospitals to merge to survive. In so ruling, the court said that he was dealing with \u201cthe healthcare world as it is, and not as the FTC wishes it to be.\u201d\n\nTrue to its word, the FTC has provided notice that it will appeal that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, arguing among other points that \u201cnothing in the ACA compels anticompetitive consolidation among competing hospitals.\u201d\n\nGiven that another merger challenge brought by the FTC is proceeding in Illinois and that the parties in that action have made similar arguments, it will be interesting to see whether the FTC is vindicated in its view of the compatibility between the ACA and the federal antitrust laws.\n\nStay on top of new developments in health law and regulation with a free trial to the Health Law Resource Center.\n\nLearn more about Bloomberg Law and sign up for a free trial.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/ftc-undeterred-recent-b57982072403/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Even after a federal judge specifically pointed to changes in the health-care industry caused by the ACA as reasons to approve hospital mergers, this week two high-ranking officials in the FTC...", "title": "FTC Undeterred by Recent Health-Care Merger Setbacks"}, "csrf-token": "IxUf6z3daAa2X4zIg4SRNm-q3SM6JiKJzm02dZQno0syeRAJbAyeEylznJZWOk9wVIAjvf-Pwtdcza8AvhVmuzUyhUdfGkAW28EctA5icOs1:o4-9aaIVc7c8Rnxgk1xMyp3g2MwzhBK_CmweWSLOK2w1Hpa2B5ivHbBY9lEHAc6o7TJO5bmojxbPSMV97OrO65kNn2OpqaCoSwR5CKj6Hkc1", "description": "Even after a federal judge specifically pointed to changes in the health-care industry caused by the ACA as reasons to approve hospital mergers, this week two high-ranking officials in the FTC", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Stay on top of new developments in health law and regulation with a free trial to the Health Law Resource Center.\nThe statements by the FTC officials came at the end of a week that saw a federal judge in Pennsylvania refuse to block a proposed hospital merger.\nThe judge also said that the changes in the health-care industry because of the ACA created a \u201cgrowing need\u201d for smaller hospitals to merge to survive.\nWhatever it is, two high ranking officials of the FTC who addressed the ABA/AHLA Antitrust in Healthcare meeting in Arlington, Va. reiterated their view that pressures to coordinate care under the ACA isn\u2019t a sufficient reason for two hospitals engaging in what the FTC views as an anticompetitive merger.\nLearn more about Bloomberg Law and sign up for a free trial."}
