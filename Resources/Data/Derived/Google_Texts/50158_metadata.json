Pat McCrory (R) (AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said state Senate President Phil Berger (R) was retiring. He is running for re-election.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said Monday he would leave the door open to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act if federal officials allow his state to craft a plan that fits its own individual needs.\n\nIn an interview on WFAE, Charlotte\u2019s NPR affiliate, McCrory defended North Carolina\u2019s refusal to expand existing Medicaid programs until fixes are made.\n\n\u201cWe decided not to [expand the program] because first of all the existing Medicaid system in North Carolina is broken,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cI felt, before you expand something, why don\u2019t you fix the services to those people in which Medicaid was originally designed.\u201d\n\nAsked directly whether North Carolina would ever expand Medicaid, McCrory said nothing is off the table: \u201cI\u2019m leaving that door open. Once we fix the current system, I have not closed that door as governor.\u201d\n\nMcCrory was one of a handful of governors, along with New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie (R), Connecticut\u2019s Dannel Malloy (D) and Nebraska\u2019s Dave Heineman (R), who met over the weekend with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell on the sidelines of the National Governors Association meeting in Nashville. McCrory said he was exploring whether HHS would sign off on waivers that would allow North Carolina to craft its own plan.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to figure out is how we can get more waivers to adapt to what North Carolina needs. For example, if I expand Medicaid, can we do it in a strategic way instead of across the board?\u201d McCrory said.\n\nIf North Carolina and HHS were to agree upon waivers, McCrory would be following a well-trod path of Republican governors who accept federal money to cover more low-income Americans under Medicaid, even if they don\u2019t call it Medicaid expansion. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) and Christie accepted federal funding to expand Medicaid. So did Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), though his administration cast it as a solution individually tailored to Hoosier needs.\n\nBut passing Medicaid expansion, or anything like it, would be politically difficult, given the heavily conservative bent of the Republican-dominated state legislature. The legislature passed a measure in 2013 to prevent the state from accepting Medicaid expansion, and both House Speaker Thom Tillis (R) and state Senate President Phil Berger (R) are against expansion.\n\nMcCrory said he appreciated Burwell taking the time to meet with the bipartisan group of governors.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the hardest job in the nation,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "McCrory wouldn't be the first Republican governor to accept Medicaid expansion under cover of federal exemptions.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "McCrory wouldn't be the first Republican governor to accept Medicaid expansion under cover of federal exemptions.", "title": "N.C.
