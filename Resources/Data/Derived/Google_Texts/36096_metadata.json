Some say Mr. Obama showed indifference to the political circumstances of rank-and-file lawmakers and missed an opportunity to seize on the undercurrents of populism and anti-establishment sentiment that began coursing through the electorate after the partisan battle over health care.\n\n\u201cThe main Democrat nationally, and the only one who could be heard, was silent on the huge structural issues that more and more Americans were facing,\u201d said Stanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster who blames Mr. Obama for Democratic House losses in 2010 and 2014. \u201cHis silence on those things left the voters without much motivation to vote.\u201d\n\nMr. Greenberg said Mr. Obama and Ms. Pelosi would be remembered for making transformative changes during 2009 and 2010, when the president confronted an economic crisis, Ms. Pelosi wielded the speaker\u2019s gavel to corral support, and Senate Democrats controlled the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican filibusters.\n\n\u201cWe will look at those two years as enduring,\u201d he said. But he said Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy would also include the political death of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s once-powerful majority. \u201cPart of his legacy is the off-year elections,\u201d he said.\n\nAdministration officials reject that critique, noting the historic pattern of losses that a president\u2019s party often sustains in off-year elections and the eight House seats Democrats regained when Mr. Obama was on the ballot in 2012. They said Mr. Obama was a prolific fund-raiser and a frequent campaigner for Democratic candidates when asked; the president hosted 17 fund-raising events across the country in 2013 and 2014, they said.\n\nSome congressional Democrats said it was not enough \u2014 not necessarily because Mr. Obama could have done more but because there could never be enough fund-raising given the nature of modern political campaigns. \u201cIf the president had allocated 50 more of his days to raising money,\u201d Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, said at a reception to mark the start of the retreat in Baltimore, \u201cwe would have more Democratic members here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a speech here, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed optimism if the party draws sharp contrasts. \u201cI think we can win; I think the House we can win,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nWhite House aides said they recognized the pressure lawmakers faced.\n\n\u201cEverybody can take pride in the very difficult and necessary votes that were taken in 2009 and 2010 to make sure the country got back on its feet,\u201d said David Simas, Mr. Obama\u2019s political director. \u201cPeople recognized at the time that they weren\u2019t the most popular votes they could take. But few people would look back and say that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Simas said the president was committed to campaigning \u201cup and down the ticket\u201d for Democratic candidates. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are going to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House officials also insist that the relationship between Mr. Obama and House Democrats has grown stronger over the years as Ms. Pelosi and the president have worked closely to counter the Republican agenda.\n\nMs. Pelosi delivered the votes of a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus during budget negotiations in October, helping Mr. Obama clinch a spending deal. Ms. Pelosi personally led the effort to support Mr. Obama\u2019s Iran policy, delivering daily lists to the president of members he needed to pressure with a call.\n\nThe House Democrats in 2015 also stood firm against Republican efforts to strike funding for Planned Parenthood, overturn the president\u2019s immigration executive actions and curb the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThat cooperation will be important in the last year of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency if he hopes to make further progress. In an Oval Office meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, on Tuesday, Mr. Obama plotted possible targets of opportunity.\n\nThe three discussed approval of the president\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and agreed to push bipartisan legislation to bail Puerto Rico out of bankruptcy. They also agreed to pursue a criminal justice overhaul, as well as efforts to cure cancer, confront the opioid epidemic and improve the provision of mental health services.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut other parts of his agenda have had to be pared back, in part because of the losses in the House and the Senate.\n\nCongressional Democrats do not dispute that they have paid a political price for Mr. Obama\u2019s hardest-fought victories, especially passage of the Affordable Care Act, and an array of other legislation. But some Democrats said that Republicans, and their rhetoric, were a far greater factor than Mr. Obama in the current perception of House Democrats.\n\nRepresentative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Mr. Obama was working aggressively in support of Democratic candidates. \u201cThe president has helped out, and he is working hard,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160128110456, "twitter": {"description": "The first time the president met with House Democrats, in 2009, there were 257 of them.
