What\u2019s most astounding about his flip-flop on entitlement reform is that the biggest victim will be the progressive causes he claims to cherish.\n\nHaving risen with astounding speed from 2007 to 2009, the deficit indeed has fallen dramatically. The decline is mostly an expected consequence of economic recovery \u2014 tax collections go up, unemployment benefits go down \u2014 but Obama\u2019s tax hike is a big contributor as well.\n\nIt is also true that health costs are not rising as quickly as had been projected, which is helpful for Medicare finances. Hard economic times may have caused people to visit the doctor less often, but most experts agree that cost-bending measures in Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act played and will continue to play a role.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news.\n\nNow look into the future as seen by the scrupulously nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nFederal debt has reached 74 percent of the economy\u2019s annual output (GDP), \u201ca higher percentage than at any point in U.S. history except a brief period around World War II,\u201d the CBO says, \u201cand almost twice the percentage at the end of 2008.\u201d With no change in policy, that percentage will hold steady or decline a bit for a couple of years and then start rising again, to a dangerous 78 percent by 2024 and an insupportable 106 percent by 2039.\n\nAs a result, by 2039 the government will be shelling out interest payments equal to 4.5 percent of GDP, more than twice the average share of the past 40 years.\n\nMeanwhile, with the population aging and costs still rising, payments for Social Security and health programs including Medicare and Obamacare also will soar, the CBO estimates. By 2039 those programs will consume 14 percent of GDP, again double the average of the past 40 years. That\u2019s taking into account the good news that Podesta heralded in his tweet.\n\nPut those together and the government will be spending on entitlement programs and interest alone just about what it spends today on the entire budget. Everything else \u2014 schools, pre-K, Pell grants, national parks, mass transit, housing subsidies \u2014 will get squeezed, or taxes will soar, or both.\n\nWell, you say, why not grow the economy faster? That would be ideal. But no one is sure how to do it \u2014 and the programs Obama believes might help, namely education, research and infrastructure, are precisely what will lose out in the future he is celebrating.\n\nUnder the budget sequester, they are losing out already.\n\nThere was a time that Obama acknowledged all of this. \u201cNow, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we\u2019ll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cMore importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. . . . I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans.\u201d\n\nHe created the Bowles-Simpson task force, which came up with recommendations to put the nation\u2019s finances in order. But Obama and congressional Republicans couldn\u2019t agree on the right mix of benefit cuts and revenue increases, and Bowles-Simpson was tucked on the shelf with a lot of other commission reports.\n\nMy point here isn\u2019t to argue that Obama should try again (though he should). My point is that he should at least return to speaking honestly, which might make it a bit easier for the next round of (hopefully) more responsible leaders to make politically difficult decisions.\n\nThe real choice for the Democratic Party is whether it settles in as a reactionary defender of ever-rising payments to the older generation, no matter how well off it is, or whether it will fight for a balance between protecting the elderly and boosting the next generation with the science, schools and infrastructure the country needs to be competitive.\n\nIt is sad that Obama, never to face the electorate again, is squandering his chance to push in the right direction.\n\nRead more from Fred Hiatt\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to entitlement reform, as far as this administration is concerned: mission accomplished.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fhiatt1", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "When it comes to entitlement reform, as far as this administration is concerned: mission accomplished.", "title": "Obama\u2019s false victory over the deficit", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fred-hiatt-the-obama-administrations-false-victory-over-the-deficit/2014/10/05/a3e7a320-4b02-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/02/National-Politics/Images/04428809.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hiattf"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fred-hiatt-the-obama-administrations-false-victory-over-the-deficit/2014/10/05/a3e7a320-4b02-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Fred Hiatt, cbo, john podesta, bowles simpson, budget deficit, us budget deficit, aca, affordable care act, budget cut, federal spending, entitlements spending, medicare, social security, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/fhiatt1"}, "news_keywords": "Fred Hiatt, cbo, john podesta, bowles simpson, budget deficit, us budget deficit, aca, affordable care act, budget cut, federal spending, entitlements spending, medicare, social security, obamacare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "a3e7a320-4b02-11e4-891d-713f052086a0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe06\"", "article_summary": "Podesta was highlighting President Obama\u2019s speech at Northwestern University on Thursday in which he declared fiscal victory and an end to the \u201cmindless austerity\u201d and \u201cmanufactured crises\u201d of Washington budget debates.\nPut those together and the government will be spending on entitlement programs and interest alone just about what it spends today on the entire budget.\nMeanwhile, with the population aging and costs still rising, payments for Social Security and health programs including Medicare and Obamacare also will soar, the CBO estimates.\nBut no one is sure how to do it \u2014 and the programs Obama believes might help, namely education, research and infrastructure, are precisely what will lose out in the future he is celebrating.\nAnyone looking beyond that date should be alarmed at the satisfaction Obama proclaims despite the prospect of ever-rising government debt."}
