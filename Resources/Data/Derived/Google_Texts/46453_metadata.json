Facebook\n\nLeonid Stadnyk, an 8-foot-4 Ukrainian man, refused to be officially measured by the Guinness Book of World Records because he didn\u2019t want the attention. It\u2019s very likely, however, that he was the tallest man in the world. Stadnyk died Sunday at age 44 because of health problems.\n\nThough some people who have reached Guinness World Records are proud of it, Stadnyk shied away from publicity. He felt ashamed and burdened by his height: \u201cTo me, my height is a curse, a punishment from God, not something to celebrate,\u201d he said in a previous interview. \u201cWhat sin I have committed, I do not know. All my life I have dreamed of being just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nStadnyk reportedly disliked being so tall because it prevented him from accomplishing normal, ordinary goals like his lifelong dream of being a veterinarian, or even getting married. According to The Mirror, Stadnyk didn\u2019t want to get married because \u201cI don\u2019t want to inflict my problems on a wife. I think it would not be fair on her.\u201d\n\nThe tallest man ever recorded was Robert Wadlow, who was born in Alton, Ill., in 1918 and measured in at 8-foot-11 by the time he was 21 years old. Wadlow suffered from Gigantism \u2014 the same disorder that Stadnyk had \u2014 which makes the lower portions of his body extremely large in comparison to his head and torso. The disorder is caused by an abnormal amount of a growth hormone during childhood. People with the disorder often have to have special clothes designed specifically for them, extra large shoes, and even enormous bikes.\n\nStadnyk had a bike specially made for him, but he still felt as though this world was made for \"smaller people.\" Facebook\n\nThere are only about 10 cases of people being over 8 feet tall recorded by Guinness World Records. \u201cWe have contacted Stadnyk, but he seems like a very shy guy,\u201d a Guinness World Records spokeswoman told The Mirror. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want us around. So we have to stick to what we have.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the tallest living man in the world as recorded by Guinness World Records is Sultan K\u00f6sen, a 31-year-old Turkish man who has hit 8-foot-3. Kosen is more open to fame than Stadnyk, and even recently was married in Turkey. Photos of their wedding can be seen on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "world's tallest man, leonid stadnyk, sultan kosen, gigantism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "What was believed to be the tallest living man died at age 44 on Sunday, after suffering from gigantism.", "title": "'Tallest Man In The World' Dies At Age 44: Height Was A 'Curse'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tallest-man-world-8-foot-4-leonid-stadnyk-dies-age-44-height-was-curse-299834", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/leonid-stadnyk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What was believed to be the tallest living man died at age 44 on Sunday, after suffering from gigantism.", "title": "'Tallest Man In The World' Dies At Age 44: Height Was A 'Curse'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tallest-man-world-8-foot-4-leonid-stadnyk-dies-age-44-height-was-curse-299834", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/leonid-stadnyk.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/26/leonid-stadnyk.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-26T13:45:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-26T13:45:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "What was believed to be the tallest living man died at age 44 on Sunday, after suffering from gigantism."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd052\"", "article_summary": "Though some people who have reached Guinness World Records are proud of it, Stadnyk shied away from publicity.\n\u201cWe have contacted Stadnyk, but he seems like a very shy guy,\u201d a Guinness World Records spokeswoman told The Mirror.\nIt\u2019s very likely, however, that he was the tallest man in the world.\nFacebookThere are only about 10 cases of people being over 8 feet tall recorded by Guinness World Records.\nFacebookLeonid Stadnyk, an 8-foot-4 Ukrainian man, refused to be officially measured by the Guinness Book of World Records because he didn\u2019t want the attention."}
