The company blamed the cutbacks in part on a drop in business from health insurance clients after their annual enrollment periods ended.\n\nIt also said a customer from that industry is moving some work offshore, resulting in \u201ca negative impact ... in a few of our locations,\u201d according to a statement DialAmerica provided to The Post and Courier on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to the North Charleston layoffs, the company said it will be closing locations in Greenville and Amherst, N.Y.\n\nIn its Jan. 8 notice to a state labor official, DialAmerica said UnitedHealth Group\u2019s XLHealth division \u201cunexpectedly\u201d cut back its call center requirements Jan. 4. It also said it was unable to provide affected employees with the required 60-day advance notice about the layoffs \u201cbecause of this unforeseeable business circumstance.\u201d\n\nAll operations related to the XLHealth contract will be eliminated by Feb. 12.\n\nDialAmerica said it is working with the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Rapid Response Team for Employment and Workforce Development to \u201cprovide our employees with assistance in job placement with area employers and other related services.\u201d\n\nThe company was on the front end of a wave of corporate call centers that flocked to the Charleston region starting in the late 1990s. Others have included Verizon Wireless, Intercontinental Hotels and iQor US Inc.\n\nOn its website, DialAmerica said its U.S. centers place or field more than 300,000 calls a day on behalf of customers in industries that range from consumer products to financial services to travel.\n\nLast summer, the company was looking to recruit licensed health insurance agents to work at its North Charleston office and others in response to the Affordable Care Act. They were to handle inbound and outbound calls from plan members, renew accounts, and sell products and services.\n\nAfter the closings in the Upstate and New York, DialAmerica will have 19 U.S. locations. The firm shut down a 70-worker North Augusta call center in 2007.\n\nContact John McDermott at 843-937-5572.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "North Charleston call center eliminating up to 150 jobs, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Call centers,Department of Employment and Workforce,DialAmerica,Jobs,Layoffs,North Charleston,Telemarketers", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The operator of a North Charleston call center is eliminating up to 150 local jobs and shutting its Upstate office, blaming the moves on an unexpected and \u201csevere\u201d decline in its health care business.", "title": "North Charleston call center eliminating up to 150 jobs", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160112/160119796/north-charleston-call-center-eliminating-up-to-150-jobs", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160112/PC05/160119796/AR/0/AR-160119796.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160112/PC05/160119796/AR/0/AR-160119796.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The operator of a North Charleston call center is eliminating up to 150 local jobs and shutting its Upstate office, blaming the moves on an unexpected and \u201csevere\u201d decline in its health care business.", "title": "North Charleston call center eliminating up to 150 jobs", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160112/PC05/160119796/AR/0/AR-160119796.jpg?201601121237", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160119796}}, "keywords": "North Charleston call center eliminating up to 150 jobs , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Call centers,Department of Employment and Workforce,DialAmerica,Jobs,Layoffs,North Charleston,Telemarketers", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-12T12:25:32Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T12:37:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The operator of a North Charleston call center is eliminating up to 150 local jobs and shutting its Upstate office, blaming the moves on an unexpected and \u201csevere\u201d decline in its health care business."}, "article_summary": "The operator of a North Charleston call center is eliminating up to 150 local jobs and shutting its Upstate office, blaming the moves on an unexpected and \u201csevere\u201d decline in its health care business.\nIn addition to the North Charleston layoffs, the company said it will be closing locations in Greenville and Amherst, N.Y.\nLast summer, the company was looking to recruit licensed health insurance agents to work at its North Charleston office and others in response to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe firm shut down a 70-worker North Augusta call center in 2007.\nIn its Jan. 8 notice to a state labor official, DialAmerica said UnitedHealth Group\u2019s XLHealth division \u201cunexpectedly\u201d cut back its call center requirements Jan. 4."}
