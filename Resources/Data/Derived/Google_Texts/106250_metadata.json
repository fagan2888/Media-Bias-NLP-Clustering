Gratefulness!!!\u201d\n\nPraying hands and a smiley face with a halo on top are his favorite icons.\n\nHe also likes quoting the Bible: \u201cTurn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. (Psalm 34:14 ESV).\u201d Well, it is Sunday, after all.\n\nThis one came hours earlier: \u201cBy wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; (Proverbs 24:3 ESV).\u201d\n\nProving he also loves Proverbs: \u201cMy son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. (Proverbs 23:26 ESV)\u201d\n\nOn Friday night, just before turning in, he tweeted: \u201cHe who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend. (Proverbs 22:11 ESV)\u201d\n\nAnd, just to prove he\u2019s versatile in the Old Testament and New and not just in the pocket: \u201cJohn 3:30 Too Blessed to be Stressed. Super Bowl Winning QB Seattle Seahawks.\u201d\n\nEven in the wake of his momentously exciting NFC-clinching victory in overtime last week, Wilson was talking about God. He credited his Creator with making the game interesting through four turnovers: \u201cThat\u2019s God setting it up, to make it so dramatic, so rewarding, so special,\u201d he said.\n\nWilson\u2019s faith was on display on the field following the win over Green Bay. He joined a few other teammates who knelt on the turf \u2013 praying and crying in jubilation.\n\n\u201cTo see him in the middle of the field, immediately after the outcome of the game, kneel and to become so overwhelmed with emotion and to give God glory for giving him the ability to come back was just an amazing thing,\u201d says his pastor, William Murphy. \u201cThat\u2019s what our faith is really all about. It\u2019s about connecting with God in a way that no matter how far away you are from a win, God always has a way of bringing you back and allowing you to come out the winner.\u201d\n\nDoes all this public faith give Wilson and the Seahawks an advantage over New England next week?\n\nNot even his pastor will make that suggestion.\n\nMurphy says he\u2019s not sure that God picks a side in such competitions, but adds, \u201cI think there is some significance, though, to Russell\u2019s public display of his Christian faith and his relationship with God. I think that is substantial and I think it has some bearing on the fact that them coming back from such a major deficit was a great thing for our Christian community. I wouldn\u2019t say that God chose a side, but I would say it was a major boost.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s his advice to Wilson in the big game next week?\n\n\u201cI think as Russell\u2019s pastor, if I could give a word of encouragement, I\u2019d just say to him, \u2018Russell, you just be who you are, continue to be authentic\u2019 because I believe that is what the world needs is an authentic Christian and not a Christian who is trying to play this role of the perfect man in such an imperfect world.\u201d\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, it\u2019s just a game.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Some quarterbacks headed for the Super Bowl for the second straight year might want to talk trash.
