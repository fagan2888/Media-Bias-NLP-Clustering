One governor who seems to be bucking that trend is Michigan\u2019s Rick Snyder. But he offers a perspective on what ails the national political culture that the others could benefit from hearing.\n\nSnyder, a former business executive, has been described as an unorthodox politician who plays the game differently than many of his contemporaries. He governs conservatively but says he tries not to make ideology his principal calling card.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a proud Republican,\u201d he said in an interview on a trip to Washington last week. \u201cI\u2019ve never hidden that fact. I tell, if people ask. But I\u2019ve never gone out to tell anyone that I\u2019m a Republican in my materials or anything else \u2014 or a conservative. You\u2019re sort of creating a chasm with other people.\u201d\n\nHis Twitter handle is \u201conetoughnerd,\u201d taken from the ads he ran during his victorious 2010 primary campaign. He\u2019s invariably cheerful \u2014 except about the state of national politics.\n\nLike other citizens who live outside Washington, Snyder looks at the practice of politics in the nation\u2019s capital with disdain and disappointment. He said the standards for acceptable behavior in politics are far lower than would be acceptable in other realms, from family relationships to the business world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a great country, but can you maintain status as a great country if you spend the majority of your time fighting and blaming one another?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sustainable long-term answer. So the real question is: What\u2019s going to trigger a change enough so people say we need to bring that bar back up.\u201d\n\nOne answer is a crisis, though neither the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, nor the financial collapse and economic recession that began in 2008 brought about lasting changes in political behavior. Another is more modest political upheaval, such as the midterm elections last year that gave Republicans full control of Congress.\n\nSnyder thought that those election results might provide a fresh opportunity for changes in behavior at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Based on what has happened so far this year, he sees little about which to be optimistic.\n\nSnyder\u2019s tenure in Michigan has not been without partisan divisions and discord. He drew strong opposition from Democrats during his first term over tax policies that favored business. He provoked the ire of organized labor when he signed legislation to make a state renowned for its unions a right-to-work state.\n\nBut in contrast with some other Republican governors, he expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Last year he signed a bipartisan bill to raise the minimum wage to $9.25 an hour over four years, with inflation-adjusted increases after that. He helped push the city of Detroit into bankruptcy, a controversial action at the time, but now seen as a foundation for an urban comeback.\n\nHe acknowledged that his relationship with organized labor \u201chas had its ups and downs\u201d but said it is better today than it was when he signed the right-to-work bill. The Michigan AFL-CIO and the Michigan Education Association (along with the Detroit Chamber of Commerce) have endorsed a May 5 ballot initiative that he is promoting. The measure would raise more than $1 billion for infrastructure improvements by increasing the state sales tax from 6 cents to 7 cents and provide additional revenue for education.\n\nSnyder is conservative by instinct but results-oriented. As governor, he does not shy away from using the levers of government to solve problems. In conversation, he talks like a believer in activist government, but he argues that the current model of governance, which he dates to the Depression and New Deal, \u201cis old and getting tired\u201d and therefore in need of an overhaul.\n\n\u201cGovernment started getting involved in people\u2019s lives, and it was needed,\u201d he said. But now, after 80 years, \u201call we are is a massive accumulation of prescriptive programs largely led by the federal government. That\u2019s not a model that works well anymore. . . . We\u2019re not treating people as people, the way they deserve.\u201d\n\nTrying to get Snyder to criticize individual political leaders in Washington is fruitless. He doesn\u2019t like to assign blame or responsibility for the state of affairs in the capital, and he resisted doing so when he was in the city to accept an award for bipartisanship, along with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), from the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress.\n\n\u201cIf you spend all the time going back to critique either the president or the Congress, you\u2019re not going to solve the problem. Because you\u2019re perpetuating the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy waste time on the blame question? Let\u2019s just talk prospectively. Here\u2019s the problems, here\u2019s the issues, here\u2019s the solutions. And let\u2019s do them.\u201d\n\nHe said he is looking for that approach to governing as he assesses the candidates competing for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. His message is that voters should look not just at the ideology of the candidates but at whether \u201cthey\u2019re caught up in ideology, versus solving the problem. That\u2019s a big distinction.\u201d\n\nSo far he\u2019s not convinced any of them grasp that distinction. \u201cI think there are some good people running,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are people I know reasonably well. Jeb\u2019s [Bush] a good person. [Wisconsin Gov.] Scott Walker is a neighboring governor.\u201d\n\nAsked whether either met the standard he had enunciated, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they potentially go far enough in terms of getting out of the political discussion and getting to the problem-solving discussion. I don\u2019t want to be critical of them, because I appreciate them being proactive.\u201d\n\nHe offered a similar assessment of former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading prospect for the Democratic nomination. \u201cIf you look at her history, I think it would tend to fall more in the traditional political category,\u201d he said.\n\nSnyder said he expects to see others entering the GOP competition, though he offered no names. Asked what role he hopes to play in the selection of a Republican nominee in 2016, he said that once the ballot initiative election takes place in May, he intends to start traveling the country to talk about \u201cthe Michigan story.\u201d\n\nHe will highlight his approach to governing, the jobs created in his state and the decline in unemployment there, from a peak of 14.9 percent in June 2009 and 10.9 percent when he took office to 5.9 percent today. The rate is still higher than in neighboring Ohio, whose Republican governor, John Kasich, has been touring states with early nominating contests promoting a story of his own.\n\nSnyder\u2019s principal goal, he said, will be to draw more attention to Michigan and to lure more investment to boost the state economy. But he agreed that another result would be to put him more into the middle of a national conversation about the country\u2019s future.\n\nHe declined to speculate further. \u201cI believe it\u2019s one step at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things we need to do in terms of our nation. I think there\u2019s a better approach to governance. And I think it\u2019s clear that if you look at the long-term history, it\u2019s time for that.\u201d\n\nFor previous columns by Dan Balz,\n\ngo to postpolitics.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michigan\u2019s Snyder advises: Focus on problems, not blame-game politics and old governing models.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Michigan\u2019s Snyder advises: Focus on problems, not blame-game politics and old governing models.", "title": "A GOP governor not running for president has ideas for politicians who are", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-gop-governor-not-running-for-president-has-ideas-for-those-who-are/2015/03/28/a443795c-d4c8-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/28/National-Politics/Images/Snyder_Pardon-0d09f-3705.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@danbalz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-gop-governor-not-running-for-president-has-ideas-for-those-who-are/2015/03/28/a443795c-d4c8-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "rick snyder, governor rick snyder, rick snyder michigan, snyder one tough nerd", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a443795c-d4c8-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "rick snyder, governor rick snyder, rick snyder michigan, snyder one tough nerd"}, "article_summary": "But I\u2019ve never gone out to tell anyone that I\u2019m a Republican in my materials or anything else \u2014 or a conservative.\n\u201cIf you spend all the time going back to critique either the president or the Congress, you\u2019re not going to solve the problem.\nAnother is more modest political upheaval, such as the midterm elections last year that gave Republicans full control of Congress.\nLike other citizens who live outside Washington, Snyder looks at the practice of politics in the nation\u2019s capital with disdain and disappointment.\nBut he offers a perspective on what ails the national political culture that the others could benefit from hearing."}
