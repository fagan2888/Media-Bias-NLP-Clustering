Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) announced he is endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for president because Cruz\u2019s principled conservatism, fundraising prowess, and discipline make him the best Republican candidate to take on and defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nElaborating on his exclusive Breitbart News piece explaining his endorsement, Bridenstine told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 that since he arrived in Washington in 2013, he has \u201cseen how the D.C. incentives really challenge those of us who get to Washington, D.C. wanting to do the right thing.\u201d He said there are \u201clobbyists who fund our campaign\u201d and the \u201cthe political apparatus that wants to make sure we\u2019re in line with the leader of the party.\u201d The D.C. \u201cincentive structure is so overwhelmingly powerful\u201d that lawmakers \u201cdo things that we would never expect\u201d and \u201cvote for things we would have never expected them to vote for based on how they campaigned,\u201d according to Bridenstine.\n\nBut he said that Cruz, who arrived in D.C. at the same time as Bridenstine, actually became more conservative and principled in Washington in an era in which so many politicians get elected by promising to change Washington only to let Washington change them and their values. And that is why conservatives can be assured that Cruz will not waver or cave if elected to the White House.\n\n\u201cNobody comes to Washington, D.C. and becomes more conservative,\u201d Bridenstine marveled when discussing Cruz. \u201cNobody comes to Washington, D.C. and becomes more principled.\u201d\n\nBridenstine, who is one of the conservative movement\u2019s rising stars, said that when deciding which candidate to back for president, voters should look for someone \u201cwho has shown up, faced the giants, looked at them face to face, rejected them, and in many cases defeated them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one person that\u2019s running for president that I\u2019ve seen inside the beltway stand up to the Washington establishment over and over again, and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s politically calculating\u2026 It\u2019s because he\u2019s very principled and he\u2019s unwilling to waver on what he promised to the American people he would do when he got to Washington, D.C., and that is Senator Ted Cruz,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cWe need a full-spectrum conservative that has proven he or she can fundraise, who has proven inside the beltway that they can look at the giants, face them down and defeat them, and I think the person that matches that description better than anybody I\u2019ve seen is Senator Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nBridenstine described Cruz\u2019s battle with the D.C. political establishment on gun control, immigration, and Obamacare to remind listeners of Cruz\u2019s principled conservatism and accountability to voters.\n\nThe Oklahoma Congressman recalled that when he and Cruz first arrived in D.C. over two years ago, Republican leaders believed the party had to \u201cchange our approach to the Second Amendment\u201d after the Sandy Hook massacre. The establishment GOP leaders felt Republicans should support universal background checks, a ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons,\u201d and limits to magazine sizes. He said while establishment Republicans were moving in this direction, \u201cCruz stood up behind closed doors and said this is not going to work. This is not what our constituents want.\u201d Bridenstine reminded listeners that Cruz \u201d fought back hard against the media, against all of the D.C. graybeards,\u201d and led the charge against more gun control by going \u201cdirectly to the people.\u201d\n\nOn border security, Cruz fought Republican leaders who believed the GOP needed to pass comprehensive immigration reform with either a path to citizenship or legalization, which Bridenstine said was \u201camnesty\u201d since it rewards those who violated the laws to come into the country.\n\nOn Obamacare, Bridenstine said that Cruz, who pushed to defund Obamacare, was prescient in realizing that \u201conce the subsidies begin flowing, you will never get it repealed, and the Supreme Court will never reverse it. Once you create the constituency of dependency, it will never get stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to make sure it didn\u2019t go forward,\u201d Bridenstine said of Obamacare. \u201cTed Cruz was out in front making that case to the American people and he was making it to us in Congress.\u201d He said though Obamacare eventually got funded, Cruz was proven right by June\u2019s Supreme Court decision.\n\nBridenstine said that when the D.C. beltway establishment is going in one direction and \u201call of the \u2018smart\u2019 people say we have to do one thing,\u201d Cruz \u201cknows what the people back home are feeling and does the opposite\u2013and he comes out on top.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do it by convincing the intellectual elite in Washington,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cHe does it by speaking directly to the American people, and that is exactly what Ronald Reagan did.\u201d\n\nBridenstine also said that Cruz\u2019s discipline sets him apart from the other candidates, including Donald Trump, whom Cruz has praised for speaking out forcefully against illegal immigration. Bridenstine said Trump is \u201cbringing very important issues to the table\u201d and he\u2019s \u201clead-tackling for the issues we need to talk about.\u201d But the Congressman said that he was caught off guard by Trump\u2019s comments regarding Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-AZ) service this weekend in Iowa. Bridenstine said though McCain \u201cis not my favorite Senator,\u201d he \u201chas served his country valiantly\u201d even though they \u201cdisagree on some very critical issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot go into a general election against Hillary Clinton with someone who is not disciplined,\u201d Bridenstine said.\n\nA principled conservative like Cruz usually has trouble raising enough money to go the distance, but Bridenstine emphasized that Cruz\u2019s proven fundraising ability is what makes him different\u2013and much more viable\u2013than conservatives who have run for president before.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is a proven fundraiser, and that will be necessary to defeat the Clinton machine. True grassroots candidates, like Ted Cruz, generally struggle after the first few primary states due to funding,\u201d Bridenstine wrote in his Breitbart News piece. \u201cTed is different. He will go the distance. This alone should excite and motivate all of us who have been waiting for a full spectrum, grass-roots candidate to vie for the Republican nomination.\u201d\n\nBridenstine said \u201cthis is our opportunity\u201d to elect a true conservative president and, \u201cit\u2019s up to us to stand up and support him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Bridenstine: Ted Cruz Best Candidate to Defeat Hillary Because of Fundraising Prowess, Discipline", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jim Bridenstine: Ted Cruz Best Candidate to Defeat Hillary Because of Fundraising Prowess, Discipline", "title": "Jim Bridenstine: Ted Cruz Best Candidate to Defeat Hillary Because of Fundraising Prowess, Discipline - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4081, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/DSC_0074.jpg", "height": 2530}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/20/jim-bridenstine-ted-cruz-best-candidate-to-defeat-hillary-because-of-fundraising-prowess-discipline/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jim Bridenstine: Ted Cruz Best Candidate to Defeat Hillary Because of Fundraising Prowess, Discipline", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/DSC_0074.jpg", "title": "Jim Bridenstine: Ted Cruz Best Candidate to Defeat Hillary Because of Fundraising Prowess, Discipline - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-07-20T05:31:59-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cTed Cruz is a proven fundraiser, and that will be necessary to defeat the Clinton machine.\n\u201cNobody comes to Washington, D.C. and becomes more conservative,\u201d Bridenstine marveled when discussing Cruz.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Breitbart News Sunday, Rep.
