But now, in newly released documents published by The Huffington Post, the admitted 9/11 mastermind says violence is not the answer to spreading Islam around the world.\n\n\n\nFor eight years, Mohammed has been held in Guantanamo Bay awaiting trial. While there, he furiously worked on a three-part manifesto detailing his views on America, and the motivation behind al Qaeda.\n\nThis is his first communication with the outside world since 2009, when he was accused of terrorism by the U.S. government.\n\n\"The Holy Quran forbids us to use force as a means of converting,\" Mohammed says in these latest statements.\n\n\"Truth and reality never comes by muscles and force but by using the mind and wisdom,\" Mohammed says.\n\n\"He doesn't really have a coherent narrative for his beliefs, and it's clear he's sort of working through these issues after being exposed to interactions with his legal team on a regular basis, and coming into contact with Christians pretty regularly,\" The Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly told CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\"\n\nBut at the same time, Mohammed is not apologizing for the September 11 attacks.\n\n\"The 9/11 attacks are something he's certainly not distancing himself from (saying) that was justified because they were defending the Muslim people,\" said Reilly.\n\nFor more of our interview with Reilly check out the video above, and click here, or on the video below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was behind the unthinkable spectacle of death on September 11, 2001.
