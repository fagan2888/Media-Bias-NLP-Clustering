Denver is expanding its composting program, which could serve as many as 5,000 homes in 2014.

The Denver Compost program was launched as a pilot program in 2007 to give residents an opportunity to have their organic waste picked up separately from their trash. It became a fee-based service in 2010. Since then, approximately 2,200 households have regularly used the service.

Compost consists of items such as food, yard refuse and non-recyclable items like paper towels.

Thanks to a loan from the Department of Environmental Health, the program will add a second truck for pickup and more than double its capacity for 2014.

The $2 million loan will allow Denver Recycles/Solid Waste Management to gauge the success of the expansion and possibly grow to four trucks at the start of 2015.

“This is an opportunity for busy families to send off their compost,” said Charlotte Pitt, manager of Denver Recycles/Solid Waste Management.

The program is scattered throughout the city. Pitt said approximately 32,000 homes are eligible for the service. See addresses on the route at denvergov.org/DenverRecycles.

Postcards were mailed to eligible homes, and Pitt said around 750 new homes already signed up and will get a green composting cart to put on their curb and a 2-gallon receptacle for the home.

Signups work on a first-come, first-serve basis and the program is designed to support only 5,000 homes.

“As we expand, we want to bring it to any Denver resident who wants it,”

Public Works spokeswoman Emily Williams said.
