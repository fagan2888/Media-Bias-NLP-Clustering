The twins were born February 21 at 32 weeks and are doing fine.\n\nHowever, no one could be sure there would be a happy outcome when Crystal Springer, then 22 weeks pregnant, learned that her babies had a condition known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported previously, TTTS is rare and potentially lethal, and occurs only in identical twins. In TTTS one sibling, called the recipient, takes too much blood from the other\u2013the \u201cdonor twin\u201d\u2013who can suffer stunted growth as a result, or die.\n\nMore specifically, \u201cThe shared placenta contains abnormal blood vessels, which connect the umbilical cords and circulations of the twins,\u201d according to the Twin to Twin Transfusion Foundation. \u201cThe common placenta may also be shared unequally by the twins, and one twin may have a share too small to provide the necessary nutrients to grow normally or even survive.\u201d\n\nWhen Mrs. Springer and husband Nick, a sailor on USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, learned that Ella and Anna had TTTS, \u201cI felt like I failed them,\u201d Mrs. Springer told Bustamente. \u201cI thought I did something wrong to cause this.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cthey went right from the doctor\u2019s office to Eastern Virginia Medical School to meet with Jena Miller, MD, a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist,\u201d Bustamente explained. Dr. Miller counseled that they operate immediately because the undernourished baby could go into heart failure. Miller recommended a laser procedure\u2013performed in the womb\u2013 to separate the blood vessels.\n\nThe December 9 operation went \u201cperfectly,\u201d Miller explained, but the babies weren\u2019t out of the woods yet. \u201cDr. Miller knew still it was not time to celebrate,\u201d Bustamente told her viewers. \u201cThe twins had a 40% chance of dying since the [abnormal blood] vessels could form again.\u201d\n\nThankfully, they did not.\n\nThe couple wanted Dr. Miller to deliver the twins, because she had done so much for them and their children. She made it just in time to perform the C-Section on February 21. Anna was born healthy at 5 pounds, seven ounces. Ella weighed in at 4 pounds, seven ounces, and also was healthy.\n\nThe girls went home after six weeks in the Special Care Nursery at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, and there is every reason to believe Anna and Ella will develop normally.\n\n\u201c The new Sentara EVMS Fetal Care Center at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital provides in-utero treatment for many fetal conditions once considered life threatening or treatable only after birth,\u201d ABC Channel 13 News reported. \u201cIt\u2019s the only site of care in Virginia and one of few on the East Coast to perform laser therapy for TTTS.\u201d\n\nAnd the Springers were the first beneficiaries. As Mr. Springer told Bustamente, they have twin girls \u201cwho sleep through the night and eat well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EllaandAnna-300x200.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6458\"", "article_summary": "The couple wanted Dr. Miller to deliver the twins, because she had done so much for them and their children.\n\u201cThe twins had a 40% chance of dying since the [abnormal blood] vessels could form again.\u201dThankfully, they did not.\nAs Mr. Springer told Bustamente, they have twin girls \u201cwho sleep through the night and eat well.\u201d\nMore specifically, \u201cThe shared placenta contains abnormal blood vessels, which connect the umbilical cords and circulations of the twins,\u201d according to the Twin to Twin Transfusion Foundation.\nAs we\u2019ve reported previously, TTTS is rare and potentially lethal, and occurs only in identical twins."}
