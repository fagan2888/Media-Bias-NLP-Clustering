Clary noted that the union could use these measures to argue that hospital staffing levels are too low.\n\n\u201cOur challenge as bargainers is, how do we improve patient care and quality of care while still trying to protect the reimbursements that our hospitals need,\u201d Clary said.\n\nIn addition, the law\u2019s incentives for increased efficiency and care coordination through programs like accountable care organizations (ACOs) may accelerate the trend toward hospital consolidations.\n\nDevane said the union would like to organize hospital workers before the facilities are sold and jobs are eliminated.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re organized ahead of the game\u201d instead of after consolidation has occurred, she said.\n\nOn the other hand, Clary noted, ACOs are creating new roles for nurses, including positions as care coordinators, which offer opportunities for unions to expand their membership.\n\nThe ACA encourages care coordination through programs like the Medicare Shared Savings ACO program, which pays providers more for meeting quality and cost benchmarks.\n\nUnion officials said they are encouraging hospitals to inform staff members about the factors affecting reimbursements from the federal government, so they understand how it may affect patients and themselves.\n\nFor example, there are now penalties under the ACA for infections patients get while in the hospital. And the number of different healthcare quality measurements that could lead to penalties is slated to increase over the next three years.\n\n\u201cYou want to at least have some say over how these disciplines are happening, because in some cases, in some hospitals, it\u2019s excessive,\u201d Devane told representatives of union locals.\n\nCooper University Hospital nurse Jackie Franchetti expressed concern that various financial pressures being placed on hospitals to cut costs and improve different measurements of care is putting more pressure on nurses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really under a microscope,\u201d said Franchetti, the grievance chair for the HPAE local at Cooper. \u201cThat is a big concern, that the money goes down and we\u2019re going to be paying for it.\u201d\n\nAnother potential concern for the union is how health-and-wellness programs are implemented.\n\nJohn Abraham, deputy director for the AFT\u2019s research and strategic initiatives department, said hospitals should work with union locals to design their wellness programs.\n\nThe ACA allows employers to provide workers with a discount of up to 30 percent on their insurance premiums for participating in a wellness program. Abraham said the union wants to combat chronic illness and promote good health among its members, but also wants to prevent wellness programs from being used to penalize or fire workers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/14/0202/2052"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "ACA efficiencies could reduce federal funding to hospitals but might also create new jobs", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb2a\"", "article_summary": "On the plus side, creation of new jobs that involve coordination of patient care through accountable care organizations may provide opportunities to bolster union ranks.\nDevane said the union would like to organize hospital workers before the facilities are sold and jobs are eliminated.\nJohn Abraham, deputy director for the AFT\u2019s research and strategic initiatives department, said hospitals should work with union locals to design their wellness programs.\nThe Affordable Care Act potentially includes both pluses and minuses for hospital professionals, according to a union representing nurses and other healthcare workers.\nClary noted that the union could use these measures to argue that hospital staffing levels are too low."}
