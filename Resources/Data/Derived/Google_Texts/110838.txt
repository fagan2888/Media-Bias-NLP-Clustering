As the last week of the term inches closer, the Supreme Court today handed down four more opinions: Kingsley v. Hendrickson, Horne v. Department of Agriculture, Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment and Los Angeles v. Patel.

The justices left the most highly-anticipated cases – Obamacare and same-sex marriage – for another day. Those opinions could come as early as Thursday, and as late as the end of next week.

Here & Now’s Jeremy Hobson walks through today’s decisions with Emily Bazelon, staff writer at The New York Times Magazine, and fellow at Yale Law School.
