Go out there and win an election,\u201d Obama stated. \u201cPush to change it but don\u2019t break it. But don\u2019t break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building.\u201d\n\nObama said his top three priorities will be a budget deal, immigration reform and passing a farm bill.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work together to make government better, instead of treating it like an enemy, or purposely making it work worse,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama concluded his speech with the final line of the Pledge of Allegiance: \u201cOne Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nThe Senate approved the legislation by an 81-18 vote; the House followed suit by a tally of 285-144, with 87 Republicans in favor and 144 against, breaking an informal rule that a majority of the majority party is supposed to carry legislation. Democrats unanimously supported the bill, even though it locks in funding at levels required by across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration.\n\nBefore Obama spoke, congressional budget leaders met Thursday morning to discuss the upcoming budget talks.\n\n\u201cTalking doesn\u2019t guarantee success,\u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, told The Associated Press. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t get together, obviously you don\u2019t move forward.\u201d\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the group\u2019s goal was \u201cto get this debt under control, to do smart deficit reduction, and to do things that we think will grow the economy and get people back to work.\u201d\n\nAs part of their pact, the two sides agreed to try to reach a budget deal on spending levels and possible deficit reduction, an agreement that has been difficult for the two parties to clinch in the past. The bargainers are to report by Dec. 15.\n\nThe partial government shutdown cast a spotlight on Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, who had precipitated the crises with their demand that President Barack Obama gut his 3-year-old health care law.\n\nCruz, a freshman who engaged in a 21-hour talkathon and egged on House Republicans for the fight, was unapologetic and critical of his GOP Senate colleagues.\n\n\u201cImagine a different world,\u201d Cruz said in a Senate speech. \u201cIf all 46 Senate Republicans had stood together and said, we are united against the train wreck that is Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn fact, all Senate Republicans oppose the law; what they had challenged was the two senators\u2019 tactics.\n\nLee offered no regrets, vowing to continue the fight to repeal the health care law. \u201cThis is not over,\u201d he said in a Senate speech.\n\nTheir defiance has been wildly cheered by outside conservative groups that have made money on the months-long dispute and the far right flank that hails Cruz and Lee for what they call a principled, courageous stand.\n\nInvestors warn that despite the debt ceiling deal there could be a pullback because lawmakers will have the same fight months from now.\n\nLawmakers \u201care only deferring, not triaging, the situation,\u201d Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist with broker-dealer Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News. \u201cThat leaves me with some trepidation that we\u2019ll be revisiting this in the not too distant future.\u201d\n\nThe Dow dropped more than 100 points shortly after the opening bell.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
