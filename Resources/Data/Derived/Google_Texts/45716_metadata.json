Sam Graves (l), R-Mo., introduced HR 3188, the \u201cCost of Services and Translations Act\u201d or the \u201cCOST Act,\u201d on July 23 to amend title 31, United States Code, to end speculation on the current cost of multilingual services provided by the federal government.\n\n\n\nHR 3188, co-sponsored by Trent Franks, R-Ariz., and Steve King, R- Iowa, would create a new appendix within each federal agency\u2019s annual performance and accountability report detailing any cost associated with providing multilingual services, such as verbal, written, or other services in languages other than English.\n\n\n\nUnder \u201cDefinitions,\u201d HR 3188 states the term \u201cmultilingual services\u201d include:\n\n\n\nA) the services provided by interpreters hired by an agency;\n\n\n\nB) the services provided by an agency associated with assisting agency employees or contractors learn a language other than English that result in additional expenses, wages or salaries, or changes to expenses, wages or salaries, for the agency employees or contractors;\n\n\n\nC) agency preparation, translation, printing, or recordation of documents, records, Web sites, brochures, pamphlets, flyers, or other materials in a language other than English;\n\n\n\nD) the services provided or performed for the federal government by agency employees or contractors that require speaking a language other than English that result in wage differentials or benefits provided by the agency; and\n\n\n\nE) any other services provided or performed by an agency which utilize languages other than English and that incur additional costs to the agency.\n\n\n\nThe bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which is chaired by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and the one who decides if a bill will move past the committee stage.\n\n\n\nGovtrack.us issued a prognosis of a 14 percent chance of getting past committee and a 3 percent chance of getting enacted.\n\n\n\nFrom 2013-2015, only 15 percent of bills made it past committee and only 3 percent were enacted.\n\n\n\nGovtrack.us, the 10-year-old project of Civic Impulse, LLC and one of the world\u2019s most visited government transparency websites, helps ordinary citizens find and track bills in Congress, track their representatives\u2019 voting records, upcoming committee meetings and receive alerts by e-mail.\n\n\n\nProEnglish, the nation\u2019s leading advocate of Official English, believes the COST Act is an important bill that highlights why we need English as our official language.", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "COST Act, multi-billion dollar cost of multilingual services, proenglish official language"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf36\"", "article_summary": "Rep.
