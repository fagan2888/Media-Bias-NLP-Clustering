Today, our lame duck Congress is whittling away its time until the end of its term by interrogating an Obamacare architect who said (correctly) on tape that many Americans are stupid. While #JonathanGruber might be the new #Benghazi, at least one good thing came of it: a solid dick joke from House Oversight Chair Darrell Issa.

The remark came at the beginning of the hearing, according to the Washington Post's Colby Itkowitz,

Before the Americans are "stupid" Gruber hearing really got under way Tuesday, ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) mentioned that Issa's official portrait had been hung up in the committee room. "Thank you for saying I was hung," Issa said, without missing a beat. He then laughed.

Yes, Darrell Issa, that was a joke about your penis. A decently well-executed one. But one good joke about the male reproductive organ doesn't erase years of dicking the American people around. Don't get cocky.
