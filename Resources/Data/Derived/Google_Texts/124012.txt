INDIANAPOLIS, IN (February 13, 2015) - The deadline to sign up for Obamacare is Sunday. As you might have experienced, it can be confusing.

Covering Kids and Families has counselors available for free all day Friday to help you navigate through it all.

"Some people have come in and started the process on their own but once they get into picking plans and looking to see what each healthcare provider offers, then that’s kind of where it gets a little tricky and a little bit confusing," said Alisha Callicott, Certified Navigator Enrollment Specialist at Covering Kids and Families.

Once you enroll, you'll be covered March 1st.

Even if you think you don't need health insurance, Callicott says you'll want to do this for tax purposes.

"People that do qualify for the health insurance marketplace, you do need to be on there and enrolling before Sunday," she said. "That way come next year, 2016, when you file your taxes, you don’t want to get hit with the high penalties that they do automatically take out."

Some people might not qualify for Obamacare. In that case, the counselors can help you find a plan that you do qualify to use.

Covering Kids and Families is located near 38th and Keystone at 2951 East 38th Street. The counselors will be available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and no appointment is necessary.

After the Sunday deadline, only people with a major life change that changes their insurance coverage, such as a job loss, will be able to enroll.

"Covering Kids and Families is here. If you feel confused, we’re here. Our doors are open. Whoever needs help, we have something that we can sign you up for."
