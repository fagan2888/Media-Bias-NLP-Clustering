Gov. Dan Patrick, right, introduces Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Oct. 26, 2015, in Houston. (Photo: Pat Sullivan, AP)\n\nTo suggest that Ted Cruz cannot win the general election demonstrates a complete disconnect with the American electorate. Conservative Republicans, independents and Reagan Democrats have waited a long time to vote for a true conservative candidate. Ted Cruz is that candidate.\n\nTed Cruz will bring out voters from all walks of life. As the first Hispanic presidential candidate, Ted will generate the highest turnout of Hispanic voters in our history. They will vote for him because he shares their values of life, traditional marriage, school choice and economic freedom.\n\nHe will increase the turnout of faith-based voters because believers know another true believer by their word and deeds. He will turn out Tea Party and grassroots voters because he stands for liberty and the principles this nation was founded on.\n\nYoung families will also turn out to vote in record numbers because they will identify with Ted and Heidi and their children. Ted shares their dreams for their children because he has the same for his.\n\nThose who suggest the Republican establishment will not support Cruz don\u2019t know the Republican establishment very well. He may not be the first choice for some, but they know we must end the attack on American business. They want lower taxes, less regulation and an end to Obamacare. They will not vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nImagine a debate stage next fall with Cruz and Clinton. Which candidate will communicate a bold vision to destroy the Islamic State terrorist group, secure the border, restart our economic engine, restore the American image around the world, lower taxes for all and replace Obamacare with a sound health care plan?\n\nWhich candidate will inspire people to re-imagine an America that holds promise and hope for our children and grandchildren? Which candidate will assure the nation that it can sleep soundly again knowing we have a president whose first priority is to keep us safe?\n\nCruz will dismantle Clinton issue by issue, exposing her plan to continue the Obama policies for eight more years. It hardly seems like a fair fight!\n\nThe general election contest will be a mismatch of gigantic proportions, and Ted Cruz will be elected president.\n\nDan Patrick is the lieutenant governor of Texas.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Yg78Ui", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Those who suggest the Republican establishment will not support Cruz don\u2019t know the Republican establishment very well, writes Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Those who suggest the Republican establishment will not support Cruz don\u2019t know the Republican establishment very well, writes Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas.", "title": "Ted Cruz, true conservative: Opposing view", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/12/14/ted-cruz-presidential-election-dan-patrick-editorials-debates/77315238/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Those who suggest the Republican establishment will not support Cruz don\u2019t know the Republican establishment very well, writes Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas.", "title": "Ted Cruz, true conservative: Opposing view", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/92452f91ab5256e4a8c8d723fdaf85768eedc774/c=72-0-755-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Dan Patrick", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Dan Patrick", "title": "Ted Cruz, true conservative: Opposing view", "author": "Dan Patrick", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04f4a66eaee6e32ccef44618f6afbec794f5c2f9/c=190-0-702-683/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/631219703f01717d094e57f7ae85b4728773726e/c=72-0-755-683/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8343cf0c35d32c22dc7da28bc89a849a21dce7f1/c=0-0-908-683/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bac3a590da74b0724030ace5fc17ac92ac4a14c9/c=0-28-1018-603&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-12-14T17:11:08.077000-05:00", "shorthed": "Ted Cruz, true conservative: Opposing view", "articleid": 77315238, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc9777498c1578157217b4e4cfb1da44cba55b66/c=0-28-1018-603/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2fa6503e0fe5687847de2b1e3ce25134445c6d69/c=245-0-627-683/local/-/media/2015/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635857082932581103-OPPOSE-1-.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, 2016 presidential election, Republican Party, presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, editorials, debates"}, "article_summary": "The general election contest will be a mismatch of gigantic proportions, and Ted Cruz will be elected president.\nDan Patrick, right, introduces Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Oct. 26, 2015, in Houston.\n(Photo: Pat Sullivan, AP)To suggest that Ted Cruz cannot win the general election demonstrates a complete disconnect with the American electorate.\nThose who suggest the Republican establishment will not support Cruz don\u2019t know the Republican establishment.\nConservative Republicans, independents and Reagan Democrats have waited a long time to vote for a true conservative candidate."}
