Connecticut\u2019s lawmakers, however, will use the occasion to show support for that agenda \u2013 and promote their own.\n\nLast week Obama rolled out plans to fight cybercrime and expand broadband access, help kids go to college and give workers paid family leave.\n\nHe\u2019s expected to promote those plans, and more, at Tuesday\u2019s speech to the nation and a joint session of Congress.\n\nReps. Elizabeth Esty, D-5th District, and Jim Himes, D-4th District, have invited as their guests Daisy Cocco De Filippis, president of Naugatuck Valley Community College, and David L. Levinson, president of Norwalk Community College, respectively. The invitations indicate the lawmakers' support of Obama\u2019s plan to provide all community college students in good standing with free tuition for two years.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the plan's $60 billion price tag over 10 years.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has invited Susie Clayton, a breast cancer survivor from Canaan who struggled to obtain health care coverage before the Affordable Care Act was implemented.\n\n\u201cQuite often I would have to take a job that \u2018didn\u2019t fit\u2019 or stay in a job that was no longer \u2018working\u2019 just to have access to health coverage,\u201d Clayton said in a statement. \u201cMy entire survivorship depended on my being able to maintain and afford good coverage.\u201d\n\nMurphy said the Clayton family\u2019s premium was more than $1,500 per month. But the ACA provided the family similar coverage at $87.44 per month.\n\nIn inviting Clayton, Murphy is carrying out his role as the Senate\u2019s chief defender of the ACA. More \u201csuccess stories\u201d are expected from Murphy, and from Obama during his speech to the nation Tuesday evening.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has invited Joann Eldridge to the event. She's the widow of Justin Eldridge, a Marine who served in Afghanistan and committed suicide in 2013 after a lengthy battle with post-traumatic stress and a traumatic brain injury that went undiagnosed for a long time. Eldridge and her four children live in Oxford.\n\nIn announcing his State of the Union guest on Friday, Blumenthal promoted a bill he co-sponsored with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, named after another soldier who committed suicide. The bill aims to improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources for service members and was approved by a wide margin in the House of Representatives earlier this month.\n\n\u201cWith Joanna in the audience and veterans and their families across the country listening at home, I urge the president to address this crisis and couple it with a call for action,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nRep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, who like Blumenthal serves on an Armed Forces Committee, has invited Army Sgt. John Meadows of Ledyard. He was injured while driving a truck and now suffers from double vision and cognitive impairments. Courtney is a big proponent of improving medical care for veterans and active-duty personnel.\n\nJust hours before Obama addresses Congress and the nation, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, plans to hold a press conference with fellow opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a new trade agreement the president is pursuing between the United States and Pacific Rim countries like Chile and Japan.\n\nDeLauro is trying to stop Congress from approving \"fast track\" legislation that would allow Obama to pursue the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements.\n\nObama, meanwhile, is likely to make a pitch for the fast track legislation, and the new trade agreement in his speech.\n\nDeLauro's guest will be John Barto, vice president of Ansonia Specialty Metals, a company that says it was hurt by foreign competition and forced to close.\n\nNo statement this year\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, is not making a political statement this year. He\u2019s invited Philip Schonberger, a long-time personal friend from Connecticut.\n\nObama took the unusual step of unveiling some of his State of the Union policy proposals in detail in advance his speech.\n\n\u201cWhy stand on formalities? Let\u2019s get the ball rolling right now,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a recent stop in Tennessee.\n\nThe president is also expected to speak about the economic recovery, his efforts to establish \u201cmanufacturing hubs\u201d \u2014 regional public-private partnerships aimed at developing new manufacturing technologies \u2014 taxes and transportation.\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst, the controversial, newly elected tea party-endorsed lawmaker, has been selected to deliver the Republican response. It will be translated and separately broadcast in Spanish by South Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo.\n\nErnst won national attention with a campaign video called \u2018Squeal.\u2019 It featured her boasting about castrating hogs on the farm where she grew up. \u201cWashington is full of big spenders. Let\u2019s make \u2019em squeal,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/01/16/ct-lawmakers-to-back-obama-their-own-agendas-at-state-of-the-union/", "news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Health Care, Higher Education, Politics, Schools/Child Welfare, Washington, Affordable Care Act, Chris Murphy, community colleges, Elizabeth Esty", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/01/16/ct-lawmakers-to-back-obama-their-own-agendas-at-state-of-the-union/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Obama is expected to roll out an ambitious agenda in his State of the Union speech that could increase the distance between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
