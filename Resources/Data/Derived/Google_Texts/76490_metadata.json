Bongino explains that breaking trust with the base in both political parties started this anti-Washington rebellion.\n\nNaming the battles promised but not waged, Bongino lists: Obamacare, executive amnesty, the Cromnibus, the debt ceiling, Balanced Budget Amendment, school choice, DC Opportunity Scholarships and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cThe reason people are in open rebellion, and make no mistake they are, is not that we lost the battles. It\u2019s that we never fought them,\u201d he says. Even with all the evidence mounting, Republican leaders and the establishment continue to be deaf to their part in causing this revolt.\n\n\u201cThey understand, we\u2019re a boat at sea now. We are not moored anymore. We\u2019re in open waters and nobody can see what\u2019s ahead. We always had that lodestar, being the Constitution, that there was a no-go area that was always that star. If we navigated to it, everything would be ok and we\u2019d get home. It\u2019s gone. We\u2019re just out to sea. No one knows the destination. No one knows when the sharks are coming, when the typhoon is coming and that\u2019s why people are scared,\u201d Bongino explains.\n\nA passionate advocate for free markets and less government, Bongino is a popular speaker and guest talk radio host for several national programs. He\u2019s so passionate to \u201cget the government to have less control over your life.\u201d\n\nThe activist left, he says, has America at a tipping point since it is \u201cactively advocating the use of physical force for thought and speech suppression.\u201d He continues,\u201cthey control language,\u201d and their mere accusations and epithets stop civil discourse.\n\nCiting his appreciation of Thomas Sowell as a pragmatic, succinct intellectual, Bongino refers to a favorite exchange on welfare between the conservative and economist Helen O\u2019Bannon. Bongino decries government\u2019s so-called efforts to help people, saying, \u201cIt has actually kneecapped them.\u201d\n\nIn this 31-minute video interview, Bongino explains the dangers lurking with presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies. Protecting American jobs with tariffs, he says, will raise prices on all Americans, while starting a trade war.\n\nAs a former cop and federal agent, Bongino finds Obama \u201cprofoundly disappointing\u201d in his support and defense of law enforcement \u2014 even former President Bill Clinton, he says, had a \u201cSister Souljah\u201d moment. \u201cIt is a total disgrace,\u201d Bongino decries.\n\nAre You A Fan Of Dan Bongino?

Bernie Sanders and socialism, Bongino gets energized, saying they \u201cdo not understand what socialism is.\u201d It is the \u201cgovernment control of the means of production, not economic liberty.\u201d Describing a generation dependent on phones and iPads, he says, \u201cIf you own private property, you are not a socialist.\u201d\n\nHis podcast started less than a year ago, and has become one of the top 50 news and politics podcasts in the world, likely to reach a million listeners by June of this year. The 41-year-old ran for Congress in the predominantly-Democrat state of Maryland, won on election day but lost when absentee ballots were counted later.\n\nHis latest New York best-seller book, \u201cThe Fight: A Secret Service Agent\u2019s Inside Account of Security Failings and the Political Machine,\u201d further explains D.C. games and how they impact the American people.\n\nFor more on Dan Bongino, find him on his podcast at Conservative Review, where he is a contributing editor, or on his blog.
