It\u2019s a number designed to shock and awe and discourage voters from giving the social democrat\u2019s ideas a close look. Ad Policy\n\nBut according to the very data cited by The Journal\u2019s Laura Meckler, Sanders\u2019s highly progressive proposals wouldn\u2019t cost the United States a single penny, on net, over that 10-year window. In fact, they\u2019d cost less, overall, than what we\u2019d spend without them.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why. The lion\u2019s share of the \u201ccost\u201d\u2014$15 trillion\u2014would pay for opening up Medicare to Americans of all ages. (Meckler notes that Sanders hasn\u2019t released a detailed proposal, so she relies on an analysis of HR 676, Representative John Conyers\u2019s Medicare-for-all bill.)\n\nRather than cost us more as a society, this proposal would only shift spending from businesses and households to the federal government by replacing our current patchwork system of public and private insurance with a single, more efficient system of financing.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be a dollar-for-dollar transfer from the private to the public sector. According to Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who authored the analysis cited by the Journal, that transition would reduce American healthcare costs by almost $10 trillion over 10 years through economies of scale, better control of pharmaceutical costs, and savings on administrative bloat.\n\nFriedman also projects that, as every American got coverage, we\u2019d spend close to $5 trillion more on actual healthcare services. So we would get more healthcare and still end up saving around $5 trillion on net. In other words, Sanders\u2019s Medicare expansion would cost $15 trillion, but without it American businesses and taxpayers would spend $20 trillion over the same period, while still leaving millions uninsured.\n\nThis shows just how badly we get ripped off under our current system. And as Friedman writes at the Huffington Post, \u201cThe economic benefits from Senator Sander\u2019s [sic] proposal would be even greater than these static estimates,\u201d because they don\u2019t factor in \u201cthe productivity boost coming from a more efficient health care system and a healthier population.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s look at the rest of the Journal\u2019s terrifyingly socialist buffet of policies:\n\nAs you can see, the $5 trillion we\u2019d save on healthcare costs would more than cover the costs of the rest of Sanders\u2019s agenda\u2014offering tuition-free education at public colleges, expanding Social Security benefits, bolstering private pensions, repairing some of our aging infrastructure and establishing a fund to help cover paid family leave. That doesn\u2019t seem so frightening after all.\n\nIf the study cited by the Journal is correct, all of those benefits would not only effectively cost us nothing, we\u2019d still have $2 trillion left over to, say, cut federal deficits for the next ten years\u2014something that should warm the hearts of fiscally conservative Wall Street Journal readers. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!\n\nBut the real challenge Sanders\u2019s proposals present for the Wall Street Journal crowd is ideological. In America, our taxes are quite low relative to other advanced countries, but we shell out dramatically more out-of-pocket for social goods like healthcare, education, and retirement. In fact, in 2009 (before Obamacare\u2019s subsidies and Medicaid expansion kicked in), Americans spent almost four times as much as the citizens of other wealthy countries buying social goods on the private market. As a result, while we know that a big chunk of our paychecks are going to Uncle Sam, we don\u2019t see the same kind of benefits coming back to us as people in the rest of the developed world do. And that disparity makes Americans receptive to the right\u2019s anti-government rhetoric.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t really about costs, because the government is more efficient than private enterprise in providing social insurance and higher education. If, in some alternate universe, Bernie Sanders were able to win the presidency and enact his proposals in their entirety, it would pose an existential threat to the conservative project to convince Americans that their tax dollars don\u2019t buy much\u2014that government is all about bloat and corruption and giving their hard-earned dollars to the undeserving poor.\n\nSeen in that light, it\u2019s no surprise that The Wall Street Journal would drop this kind of bunker-busting number-bomb on the gentleman from Vermont.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bernie_sanders_national_nurses_united_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Joshua Holland", "description": "This week, The Wall Street Journal dropped a terrifyingly large number on Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s upstart campaign, warning that his proposals would carry a \u201cprice tag\u201d of $18 trillion over a 10-year period.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "This week, The Wall Street Journal dropped a terrifyingly large number on Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s upstart campaign, warning that his proposals would carry a \u201cprice tag\u201d of $18 trillion over a 10-year period.", "title": "What \u2018The Wall Street Journal\u2019 Gets Totally Wrong About Bernie Sanders\u2019s Agenda", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/what-the-wall-street-journal-gets-totally-wrong-about-bernie-sanders-agenda/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bernie_Sanders_Portland_ap_img2.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2015-09-17T13:17:51+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This week, The Wall Street Journal dropped a terrifyingly large number on Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s upstart campaign, warning that his proposals would carry a \u201cprice tag\u201d of $18 trillion over a 10-year period.", "title": "What \u2018The Wall Street Journal\u2019 Gets Totally Wrong About Bernie Sanders\u2019s Agenda", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/what-the-wall-street-journal-gets-totally-wrong-about-bernie-sanders-agenda/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bernie_sanders_national_nurses_united_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bernie_sanders_national_nurses_united_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 16th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "What \u2018The Wall Street Journal\u2019 Gets Totally Wrong About Bernie Sanders\u2019s Agenda", "keywords": "budgets, democrats, economic policy, election 2016, healthcare policy, the left, bernie sanders, medicare", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 187020, "sailthru.tags": "Budgets,Democrats,Economic Policy,Election 2016,Healthcare Policy,The Left,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "medicare", "published_time": "2015-09-16T17:03:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T13:17:51+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/ltorio/"}, "sailthru.description": "The Journal wants to shock and awe\u00a0voters with big numbers, but Sanders\u2019s proposals would save America big bucks.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bernie_sanders_national_nurses_united_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the real challenge Sanders\u2019s proposals present for the Wall Street Journal crowd is ideological.\nSeen in that light, it\u2019s no surprise that The Wall Street Journal would drop this kind of bunker-busting number-bomb on the gentleman from Vermont.\nThis week, The Wall Street Journal dropped a terrifyingly large number on Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s upstart campaign, warning that his proposals would carry a \u201cprice tag\u201d of $18 trillion over a 10-year period.\nFriedman also projects that, as every American got coverage, we\u2019d spend close to $5 trillion more on actual healthcare services.\nSo this isn\u2019t really about costs, because the government is more efficient than private enterprise in providing social insurance and higher education."}
