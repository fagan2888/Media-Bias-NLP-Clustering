Wells Fargo bank is using a same-sex couple in their advertising. And there are more,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it has dawned on me that we don\u2019t have to do business with them. At the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, we are moving our accounts from Wells Fargo to another bank. And guess what\u2014we don\u2019t have to shop at Tiffany & Co., there are plenty of other jewelry stores.\n\n\u201cThis is one way we as Christians can speak out\u2014we have the power of choice. Let\u2019s just stop doing business with those who promote sin and stand against Almighty God\u2019s laws and His standards. Maybe if enough of us do this, it will get their attention,\u201d Mr. Graham wrote.\n\nWells Fargo said the bank values the diversity of its customers and employees and has proudly supported the LGBT community for a long time, The Charlotte Observer reported.\n\n\u201cAt Wells Fargo, serving every customer is core to our vision and values,\u201d spokeswoman Christina Kolbjornsen said Monday. \u201cDiversity and inclusion are foundational to who we are as a company. Our advertising content reflects our company\u2019s values and represents the diversity of the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham\u2019s Facebook post didn\u2019t say to which bank he was moving his money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franklin Graham, evangelist and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, announced Friday that he has pulled the ministry's bank accounts out of Wells Fargo in a call to boycott gay-friendly companies.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Franklin Graham, evangelist and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, announced Friday that he has pulled the ministry\u2019s bank accounts out of Wells Fargo in a call to boycott gay-friendly companies.", "title": "Franklin Graham calls for boycott against Wells Fargo, \u2018those who promote sin\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/8/franklin-graham-calls-for-boycott-against-wells-fa/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/graham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/16/graham.jpg", "description": "Franklin Graham, evangelist and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, announced Friday that he has pulled the ministry's bank accounts out of Wells Fargo in a call to boycott gay-friendly", "card": "summary", "title": "Franklin Graham calls for boycott against Wells Fargo, \u2018those wh"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Franklin Graham, Wells Fargo, Tiffany   Co, Tiffany"}, "article_summary": "Wells Fargo bank is using a same-sex couple in their advertising.\nFranklin Graham, evangelist and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, announced Friday that he has pulled the ministry\u2019s bank accounts out of Wells Fargo in a call to boycott gay-friendly companies.\nHis remarks were an apparent reference to a Wells Fargo ad that featured a lesbian couple making plans to adopt a deaf girl, a local CBS affiliate reported.\nAt the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, we are moving our accounts from Wells Fargo to another bank.\n\u201cAt Wells Fargo, serving every customer is core to our vision and values,\u201d spokeswoman Christina Kolbjornsen said Monday."}
