The Washington Examiner opines on President Obama\u2019s remarkable claim that he saved the world economy.\n\nPresident Obama\u2026wants to be remembered for\u2026[being]\u2026the savior of the American and global economies. \u201cThere are things I\u2019m proud of,\u201d he said, citing Obamacare, then added, \u201cSaving the world economy from a Great Depression, that was pretty good.\u201d\n\nNot so fast. Looking at the economy\u2019s anemic numbers the editors are less than impressed.\n\nObama will end eight years in office without presiding over a thriving economy of the sort America enjoyed in the past. It also suggests that even the mediocre growth of recent years depended on high oil prices, which have collapsed by more than half. This is the bitter fruit of creationist economics, the erroneous belief that government activity can somehow conjure new wealth and value.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is similarly dour about Obama\u2019s economic legacy.\n\nWhen did Americans decide that 1% or 2% economic growth is acceptable, that puny wage increases are inevitable, and that we should all merely shrug and get used to the country\u2019s diminished expectations? \u2026the first quarter is further evidence of what has been the weakest economic expansion in the postwar era. \u2026All of this continues the slow-or-slower pace of this entire expansion that began nearly seven years ago. Each year has had a similar GDP dip, and growth has never exceeded 2.5% (2010). The American economy hasn\u2019t grown by more than 3% since 2005 (3.3%), the longest such stretch of malaise that we can find in the Bureau of Economic analysis tables going back to 1930. \u2026Faster growth is possible, but it will take better policies.\n\nIn a column for Bloomberg, Narayana Kocherlakota, looks at what\u2019s happened and compares it to what CBO projected would happen.\n\nit\u2019s not hard to see why many people are disappointed with the performance of the economy during Obama\u2019s time in office. In January 2009, at the beginning of Obama\u2019s first term, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a 10-year forecast for the U.S. economy, including such indicators as unemployment, gross domestic product, the budget deficit, government debt and interest rates. \u2026The unemployment rate has come closest to expectations. \u2026Elsewhere, the story is less positive. Total income growth in the U.S. has fallen well short of expectations, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms. \u2026the federal budget deficit\u2026still much larger than the CBO forecast in 2009 \u2014 as is the ratio of government debt to GDP.\n\nHere\u2019s his chart.\n\nLast, but not least, Louis Woodhill shares some numbers that capture Obama\u2019s real legacy.\n\nAmerica\u2019s elites have largely given up on growth, and are now distracting themselves with academic musings about \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d \u2026assuming 2.67% RGDP growth for 2016, Obama will leave office having produced an average of 1.55% growth. This would place his presidency fourth from the bottom of the list of 39*, above only those of Herbert Hoover (-5.65%), Andrew Johnson (-0.70%) and Theodore Roosevelt (1.41%)\n\nWhat makes this final comparison so damning is that Obama had the comparative good fortune to enter office in the middle of a recession. Which means, all things equal, that his numbers should look very positive.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s managed to compile one of the worst track records.\n\nWhen I do comparisons, I like using the interactive recession/recovery site of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, which allows users to compare every recession and recovery since the end of World War II.\n\nHere\u2019s how President Obama (red line) ranks on GDP growth.\n\nAs you can see, whether your starting point is the beginning of the recovery or the beginning of the recession, Obama is in last place.\n\nHe does slightly better on employment. He still has one of the worst records (again, the red line), but he does beat George W. Bush\u2019s also-anemic performance on job creation.\n\nBy the way, some of you may be wondering why the employment data for Obama is so weak when the unemployment rate has significantly fallen.\n\nThe answer is that the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t count people who have given up on finding a job, whereas the Minneapolis Fed data counts how many new jobs are being created.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the amount of people productively employed that matters if we want more economic output, so the Minneapolis Fed data is far more important and revealing than the official unemployment rate numbers.\n\nUnfortunately, Obama and his team haven\u2019t figured out (or simply don\u2019t care) that jobs are more likely to be created when government is smaller rather than bigger.\n\nBy the way, this analysis presumably won\u2019t be very compelling for Obama supporters because they\u2019ll simply assert things could have been much worse without his policies.\n\nThey may even believe the President\u2019s claim that he saved the American economy from a Great Depression.\n\nBut they overlook the fact that the economy normally bounces back quickly from a downturn. It was only during the 1930s, when Hoover and Roosevelt competed to impose bad policy, that a recession became a depression.\n\nThe bad news is that President Obama\u2019s policies haven\u2019t helped today\u2019s economy, but the good news is that his policies are nowhere near as harmful as the combined statist agendas of Hoover and Roosevelt.\n\nSo if we want to learn a lesson on what works, the economy\u2019s very strong boom under Reagan is a good case study. And if you want to go back further, the anti-Keynesian booms after World War I and World War II also teach important lessons.\n\nP.S. President Obama is completely correct when he points out that America\u2019s economy is generally stronger than European economies. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t seem to realize what this implies.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Business, Barack Obama, Daniel Mitchell, Economy, Economics", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Economist Dan Mitchell takes a look at President Barack Obama\u2019s economic legacy and his oft-repeated claim that he saved the world economy from disaster.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Miserable Economic Legacy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Barack-Obama-2016-White-House-Correspondents-Dinner.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2016/05/02/obamas-miserable-economic-legacy/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Economist Dan Mitchell takes a look at President Barack Obama\u2019s economic legacy and his oft-repeated claim that he saved the world economy from disaster.", "creator": "@danieljmitchell", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Barack-Obama-2016-White-House-Correspondents-Dinner.jpg", "title": "Obama\u2019s Miserable Economic Legacy | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2016/05/02/obamas-miserable-economic-legacy/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/39898", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/39898", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Business, Barack Obama, Daniel Mitchell, Economy, Economics", "article": {"section": "Policy", "tag": "economics", "published_time": "2016-05-02T22:19:57-04:00"}, "description": "Economist Dan Mitchell takes a look at President Barack Obama\u2019s economic legacy and his oft-repeated claim that he saved the world economy from disaster."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97b3\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s take a look at President Obama\u2019s economic legacy.\nThe Wall Street Journal is similarly dour about Obama\u2019s economic legacy.\nThe Washington Examiner opines on President Obama\u2019s remarkable claim that he saved the world economy.\n\u201cThere are things I\u2019m proud of,\u201d he said, citing Obamacare, then added, \u201cSaving the world economy from a Great Depression, that was pretty good.\u201dNot so fast.\nWhen did Americans decide that 1% or 2% economic growth is acceptable, that puny wage increases are inevitable, and that we should all merely shrug and get used to the country\u2019s diminished expectations?"}
