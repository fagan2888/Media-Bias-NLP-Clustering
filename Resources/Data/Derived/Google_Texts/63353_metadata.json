In our house, everybody knows that President is only the third-most important job in the family. So this weekend, I\u2019m going to take a little extra time to say thank you to Michelle for the remarkable way she does the most important job: being a mom. And I\u2019m going to give extra thanks to my mother-in-law for the role model she\u2019s always been to Michelle and the countless selfless ways in which she\u2019s helped Michelle and me raise Malia and Sasha. I am incredibly lucky to have women who help me raise, love, and look after our girls.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll also take a moment to say thank you to the women in your life who love you in that special way mothers do. Biological moms, adoptive moms, and foster moms; single moms, grandmoms and godmothers; aunts and mentors \u2013 whomever you think of when you think of Mother\u2019s Day. Or take a moment, like I will, to remember the moms who raised us, whose big hearts sustained us, and whom we miss every day, no matter how old we get.\n\nGiving flowers is always a good idea. But I hope that on this Mother\u2019s Day, we\u2019ll recommit ourselves to doing more than that: Through deeds that match our words, let\u2019s give mothers the respect they deserve, give all women the equality they deserve, and give all parents the support they need in their most important roles.\n\nThat includes paid maternity and paternity leave, sick leave, accommodations for workers who are pregnant, good health care, affordable child care, flexibility at work, equal pay, and a decent minimum wage. We ask our mothers to do more than their fair share of just about everything. Making sure they\u2019re treated fairly is the least we can do.\n\nThe idea of setting aside a Sunday in May for our mothers became an official holiday with a Congressional resolution a little more than 100 years ago. They did it on May 8 \u2013 the same day we\u2019ll celebrate Mother\u2019s Day this year. If Congress can make a holiday, surely they can back it up with the things that give it meaning. After all, that\u2019s what my mother taught me. I couldn\u2019t just say I was going to do the right thing, or say I agreed with it on principle. I had to actually do it.\n\nSo this Mother\u2019s Day, say thank you. Say, \u201cI love you.\u201d And let\u2019s make sure we show that gratitude and appreciation through acts of respect throughout the year. No one deserves that more than our moms.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "(Screen Capture)(CNSNews.com) - In a weekly address celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, President Barack Obama on Saturday called for paid \u201cpaternity leave.\u201dHe also said: \u201clet\u2019s give mothers the respect they deserve.\u201d", "title": "Obama Calls for Paid \u2018Paternity Leave\u2019 in Address Celebrating Mother\u2019s Day", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/obama-calls-paid-paternity-leave-address-celebrating-mothers-day", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/obama-mothers_day-sc-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-09T07:59:07-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-08T08:55:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-09T07:59:07-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "(Screen Capture)(CNSNews.com) - In a weekly address celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, President Barack Obama on Saturday called for paid \u201cpaternity leave.\u201dHe also said: \u201clet\u2019s give mothers the respect they deserve.\u201d", "title": "Obama Calls for Paid \u2018Paternity Leave\u2019 in Address Celebrating Mother\u2019s Day", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/obama-calls-paid-paternity-leave-address-celebrating-mothers-day", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/obama-mothers_day-sc-1.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "(Screen Capture)(CNSNews.com) - In a weekly address celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, President Barack Obama on Saturday called for paid \u201cpaternity leave.\u201dHe also said: \u201clet\u2019s give mothers the respect they deserve.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(Screen Capture)(CNSNews.com) - In a weekly address celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, President Barack Obama on Saturday called for paid \u201cpaternity leave.\u201dHe also said: \u201clet\u2019s give mothers the respect they deserve.\u201d\u201cGiving flowers is always a good idea,\u201d Obama said.\nThey did it on May 8 \u2013 the same day we\u2019ll celebrate Mother\u2019s Day this year.\nSo this Mother\u2019s Day, say thank you.\nBiological moms, adoptive moms, and foster moms; single moms, grandmoms and godmothers; aunts and mentors \u2013 whomever you think of when you think of Mother\u2019s Day.\nI hope you\u2019ll also take a moment to say thank you to the women in your life who love you in that special way mothers do."}
