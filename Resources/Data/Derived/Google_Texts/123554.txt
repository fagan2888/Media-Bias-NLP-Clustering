Parents, kids and kids at heart took off throughout the Holly Square on a scavenger hunt promising exercise, neighborhood history and a walking tour of the area.

On Saturday afternoon, the Salsa and Soul Unity Fest partnered with the Northeast Transportation Connections’ Walk Fest to promote community safety and togetherness in the Holly Square neighborhood.

Tonya Sharp, who lives in the Holly community, looked jubilant as she passed by live music along the scavenger hunt’s path.

Sharp said she was looking for a way to get some exercise while doing something fun with her 7-year-old son Chakarei Sharp. She thought the hunt in a neighborhood she knows so well would be a hoot.

“This is a dream to be able to walk around this neighborhood, get to know it better and show others around,” she said.

Sharp knew most of the answers to the clues, and Chakarei eagerly followed along.

“I’m excited to win,” he said.

Brother Jeff Fard — who helped put the event together — said this kind of camaraderie was exactly what the gathering was all about.

“This festival is a response to violence in the area, but it’s more than that,” Fard said. “This is what communities should be doing. Events like this show that this space is owned by the entire community and is not ruled by fear.”

Live music carried throughout Holly Square as attendees danced without reservation, ate and browsed through several local shops that set up booths.

Lynda Rawlins was one such reveler whose smile was almost as big as her dance moves.

“I am elated,” Rawlins said. “I am proud of my people today. We have good brothers and sisters, good music, good food. I am so happy to be here.”

Fard snapped photos and greeted the community he loves as he made the rounds.

“This community will be known for a lot more than violence,” he said as he watched people celebrate the day.
