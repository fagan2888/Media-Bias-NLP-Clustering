It imposes a disastrous socialist \"ColoradoCare\" tax and regulatory regime.\n\nIt is disastrous for Colorado jobs and the economy by adding a 10 percent state income tax to our current 4.63 percent, tripling state taxes. Businesses will flee the state and jobs will evaporate because Colorado will then have the highest state taxes in the country. Despite this massive tax, it is not health insurance and you will still be mandated to buy that too.\n\nAt a starting cost of $25 billion, it almost doubles the state government. If you think funding for education and roads are bad now, wait until they are cut more as ColoradoCare's mandatory spending increases suck up the state budget, and our economy spirals down.\n\nIt is disastrous because it sets up an uncontrolled and unaccountable government entity to run a monopolistic health program and to raise more taxes. It will drive doctors out of the state as they flee this new regime. The left's solution to a bad government scheme like Obamacare is an even worse government scheme like Amendment 69. Just say no!\n\nIt is hard to describe in a short letter how disastrous it is. I urge you to get the facts, vote no on Amendment 69, and tell your friends and neighbors to vote no too.\n\nMerle Thowe\n\nLoveland", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29932395/amendment-69-would-be-disastrous-colorado", "sailthru.section": "Letters to the Editor", "endDate": "2026-05-24T20:01:26-0600", "description": "This letter to the editor appeared in the May 25, 2016, edition of the Reporter-Herald.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29932395:view"}, "startDate": "2016-05-24T20:01:26-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29932395/amendment-69-would-be-disastrous-colorado", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "type": "article", "description": "This letter to the editor appeared in the May 25, 2016, edition of the Reporter-Herald.", "title": "Amendment 69 would be disastrous for Colorado"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "This letter to the editor appeared in the May 25, 2016, edition of the Reporter-Herald.", "title": "Amendment 69 would be disastrous for Colorado", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/opinion/letters/ci_29932395/amendment-69-would-be-disastrous-colorado", "image": "http://local.reporterherald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/reporterherald.png", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-24T20:01:26-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Amendment 69 would be disastrous for Colorado", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2016-05-24T20:01:37-0600", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2016-05-24T20:02:33-0600", "news_keywords": "Letters to the Editor, Letters to the Editor news, Loveland Colorado Letters to the Editor news, Loveland Colorado news, Letters to the Editor Loveland news, Letters to the Editor Colorado news, US Letters to the Editor news, world Letters to the Editor news."}, "article_summary": "The left's solution to a bad government scheme like Obamacare is an even worse government scheme like Amendment 69.\nAs a right thinking true liberal, I am adamantly opposed to Amendment 69.\nI urge you to get the facts, vote no on Amendment 69, and tell your friends and neighbors to vote no too.\nBusinesses will flee the state and jobs will evaporate because Colorado will then have the highest state taxes in the country.\nIt is disastrous for Colorado jobs and the economy by adding a 10 percent state income tax to our current 4.63 percent, tripling state taxes."}
