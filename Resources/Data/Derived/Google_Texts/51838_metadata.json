A drop in tax credits for up to 60 percent of enrollees \u2014 about 88,000 people \u2014 is driving down the numbers of consumers who can automatically renew through the state exchange, Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nExchange staffers said the changes in the subsidies should spur more comparison shopping for lower premiums, more questions and more demand on their call center. Its 2014-15 budget has grown by $4 million since June.\n\nStaffers on Monday requested an additional $875,000 to handle the spike in call volume. The board approved it 7-1, with one abstention.\n\nThe low premiums charged by one nonprofit insurance cooperative, Colorado HealthOP, have skewed a key index. Under the Affordable Care Act, subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-lowest-priced silver plan in each geographical area.\n\nThose premiums fell sharply and, as a result, so did tax credits across the board. Consumers are looking at an average increase of 77 percent in their share of insurance premiums unless they shop and switch. Only Mesa County escaped the shake-up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a huge market shift. We didn\u2019t think that would happen,\u201d said state Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar. \u201cI don\u2019t think the carriers have yet figured out where they ought to be in terms of what they should charge. \u2026 Our plan was to do auto-enrollment with 75 percent of clients. That fell apart.\u201d\n\nExchange officials said they also underestimated by 45 percent how many customers who enrolled in 2014 would stay enrolled. Taken together, more consumers with more questions means the staff is now forecasting 60,000 more calls, or a total of more than 158,000, between Nov. 15 and Dec. 31.\n\nThe increased expenditures won\u2019t shorten average call-waiting times, which are 15 to 30 minutes, said Adele Work, implementation manager, but it will keep callers from hearing that all operators are busy.\n\nThe stated ultimate goal is to get 80 percent of calls answered in 90 seconds.\n\nThe Service Center budget for 2014-15 had been $13.6 million. Other previous increases in staffing levels had brought that up to $16.9 million. With this latest change, the year-end forecast is $17.8 million.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t question the need for increased calls service,\u201d board member Dr. Michael Fallon said. \u201cBut we have a $4 million variance over what we discussed in June. \u2026 I want to know where the money is going to come from, and \u2018reserves\u2019 is not a great long-term answer.\u201d\n\nThe exchange has $28.5 million in operating reserves.\n\nur", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance exchange budget rises $4 million", "title": "Colorado health insurance exchange budget rises $4 million", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/10/colorado-health-insurance-exchange-budget-rises-4-million/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141028__health-insurancep1-1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141028__health-insurancep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-10T18:10:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:44:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd83e\"", "article_summary": "Consumers are looking at an average increase of 77 percent in their share of insurance premiums unless they shop and switch.\nColorado\u2019s health insurance marketplace is anticipating a $4 million hike in the cost of keeping its call center functioning.\nThe low premiums charged by one nonprofit insurance cooperative, Colorado HealthOP, have skewed a key index.\n\u2026 I want to know where the money is going to come from, and \u2018reserves\u2019 is not a great long-term answer.\u201dThe exchange has $28.5 million in operating reserves.\nExchange staffers said the changes in the subsidies should spur more comparison shopping for lower premiums, more questions and more demand on their call center."}
