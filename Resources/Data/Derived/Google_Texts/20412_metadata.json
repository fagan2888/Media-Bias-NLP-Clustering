Her younger roommate is 100-years old.\n\n\"I used to walk two miles everyday before breakfast,\" Payne recalls.\n\nPayne was born the week before the titanic sank, 102 years ago. Raised in Baldwinsville, she remembers the struggles of the great depression, the hope when penicillin was discovered. Microwaves, saran wrap, and computers were all invented during her lifetime.\n\n\"I used to stand outdoors and look up at the moon and look for the man in the moon,\" Payne remembers. \"Then, I had a chance to see it on television when they walked on the moon. I think that is marvelous.\"\n\nNow, she's excited to see what the future holds. Next month Payne celebrates the birthday of her first-born son. He'll be 80 years old. His parents were married for 64-years and they were happy, Leona says, \"...because I loved him and he loved me.\"\n\nOver the years, Payne has watched her family grow to include twelve great-grandchildren and she hopes they'll take a little advice from someone with a century of perspective...appreciate what you have, don't forget your relatives, and don't get bored.\n\n\"I have to say I've never been bored in my life. I think it is too bad that people get bored because there are so many wonderful things to do,\" Payne said.\n\nWhile National Centenarian's Day was officially marked on Monday, Payne and a few friends in her exclusive club will be honored with a centenarian party at Elderwood on Thursday. It's safe to say, Leona won't turn down a chance to have a party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At Elderwood senior facility in Liverpool Leona Payne is not the only centenarian sharing advice and stories.
