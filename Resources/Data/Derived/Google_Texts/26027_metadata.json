Tripoli\u2019s airport, under mortar fire from an Islamic militia, has shut down. Some 90 percent of the planes there have been destroyed, and no international flights are flying in or out of the country. The country is effectively shut off from the rest of the world.\n\nRelated: Libyan Mission Over, But U.S. Deeper into Africa\n\n\u201cThe government has studied the possibility of bringing international forces to enhance security,\u201d Libyan government spokesperson Ahmed Lamine said on Tuesday.\n\nYet, international assistance is a long shot. In 2011, the United States and its European NATO allies successfully used a bombing campaign to oust Muammar Gaddafi from office. However, after he was killed, both the United States and Europe turned away from Libya. A weak central government has now been unable to control rebel factions within the military.\n\nAt the same time, French forces in Mali have forced Islamists into the country\u2019s south. In a bid to win more political and economic power, they\u2019ve pushed into Libya\u2019s north, and are attempting to take Tripoli and Benghazi.\n\nThe fight for Libya comes as the Middle East descends towards a holy war for the future of the region. In Syria, Iraq, and now in Libya, radical Islamists are fighting more moderate factions for control.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Real Reason Russia Is in Iraq\n\nSo far, the United States has been unable to exert influence over events in the region. President Obama\u2019s soft power approach has yet to yield peace or slow the pace of fighting. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the violence in Libya but did not offer any solution for how the US or its allies would act to stop it.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the level of violence in Libya,\" Kerry said during a news conference in Vienna on Tuesday following talks on Iran's nuclear program. \u201cIt is dangerous and it must stop. We are working very, very hard through our special envoys to find the political cohesion ... that can bring people together to create stronger capacity in the government of Libya so that this violence can end.\u201d\n\nIll-defined U.S. Interests\n\nEdward Goldberg, a professor at Baruch College and the New York University Center for Global Affairs, says the United States may not have enough at stake to intervene in Libya this time around.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. gets less than 2 percent and falling of its oil from Libya,\u201d Goldberg said in an interview.\n\nRelated: U.S. Again Misreads the Players in Middle East Crisis\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict how Obama will react to the Libyan situation partly because he hasn\u2019t clearly defined American interests in the Middle East. The president\u2019s regional policy these last few years has been dogged by inconsistencies and missteps.\n\nFor instance, the atrocities committed by Gaddafi warranted a military response from the United States. Yet the use of chemical weapons in Syria did not, despite Obama\u2019s warning that their use would be a \u201cred line\u201d that would draw a military response. In Iraq, years of disconnect from Washington have led to the current crisis; it remains to be seen what, if any, role the American military will play there.\n\n\u201cAs we have learned from Iraq, we need to clearly define our interests,\u201d Goldberg said on Tuesday. \u201cThere is now a conflict in the [United States] between what is now needed in globalized foreign policy and the old cultural political demands of saber rattling.\u201d\n\nEuropean Response?\n\nUnlike the U.S., Europe has a clear interest in a stable Libya. In 2010, 22 percent of Italy\u2019s oil, 16 percent of France\u2019s oil, and 23 percent of Ireland\u2019s oil came from the country.\n\nSo far, European capitals have remained tight-lipped on Libya. Goldberg said that the United States could get involved if NATO or individual European nations decide to act to stabilize the country.\n\n\u201cThe economic health of Europe is important to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Obama had clearly recognized this in 2011 when he formulated a precedent-setting policy in response to the uprising in Libya. Rather than acting singularly or as the effective leader of the coalition, President Obama chose to work as a political and military minority partner with other nations, particularly European nations, whose economic interests were directly impacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is totally logical in a globalized world for the U.S. to subordinate its role,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is a policy of mutuality.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Three years ago, the United States intervened to stop Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi.
