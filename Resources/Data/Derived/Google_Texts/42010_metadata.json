In January 2014, Charter proposed to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 in cash and stock. Time Warner Cable\u2019s board rejected the offer, demanding $160 with at least $100 in cash. The next month, Time Warner Cable agreed to an all-stock deal with Comcast that valued it at about $158.82, which Comcast called off a few weeks ago amid regulatory scrutiny.\n\nNow, Charter has another opportunity to make a run at Time Warner Cable.\n\nHere\u2019s what the executives had to say at the conference:\n\nTime Warner\u2019s CEO on future M&A:\n\nMr. Marcus told the audience that he \u201cfeel[s] very good about the position Time Warner Cable is in.\u201d He said he\u2019ll measure any future M&A, where Time Warner Cable can go on its own. He said that there have been perceptions in the past that Time Warner Cable was \u201cless than open to M&A,\u201d but the announced transaction with Comcast, he said, should have disabused shareholders of that idea. \u201cWhen there was a transaction that we thought maximized value for our shareholders, we executed on it.\u201d\n\nCharter\u2019s CEO on M&A:\n\nMr. Rutledge said he would be worried about any deal that would put Charter\u2019s leverage or the debt on the company at more than five times its earnings. \u201cToo much leverage is a bad thing,\u201d he said.\n\nTime Warner\u2019s CEO on cable consolidation:\n\nTime Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said he doesn\u2019t know whether cable consolidation is inevitable. Since the dawn of the cable industry, there have been benefits to cable consolidation, he said, but \u201cthere are so many situations where industrial logic doesn\u2019t prevail.\u201d Many of the remaining players of scale other than Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications are privately-held, and there are always \u201csocial dynamics\u201d that complicate deals, he said.\n\nMr. Marcus said there probably will continue to be some consolidation, but he doubts that \u201call cable companies will find their way into one of two camps.\u201d The two-camp theory is one that Mr. Rutledge has espoused, but didn\u2019t expand upon Wednesday.\n\nTime Warner\u2019s CEO on antitrust regulators:\n\n\u201cI firmly believed when we signed and announced the Comcast deal, and I believed right up until the bitter end, that we had very compelling arguments why our deal ought to be approved by the FCC and the DOJ. And obviously the guys who get to make those decisions disagreed with us. They really didn\u2019t give us a compelling explanation of why they disagreed with us. They simply did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect to the question of whether other deals could get done, I really don\u2019t know the answer to that either, because I don\u2019t understand the rationale that informed the decision with respect to Time Warner Cable/Comcast. It\u2019s hard to make a calculus as to where the line ought to be drawn.\u201d\n\nCharter\u2019s CEO on antitrust regulators:\n\nThe short answer from Mr. Rutledge on whether Charter can get a deal for Time Warner Cable: It\u2019s nothing like the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal. \u201cWe\u2019re a very different company and a very different circumstance. We\u2019re not vertically integrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s hard and in terms of our penetration of big [designated market areas], that wouldn\u2019t substantially change either. So I think it\u2019s a very different animal from a regulatory perspective. Now, whether deals can be made or not, I don\u2019t know.\n\nRegulators, he said, think of the Newhouse family\u2019s Bright House Networks LLC, which Charter was set to buy before the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal collapsed, as one in the same as Time Warner Cable. Mr. Rutledge made it clear that he\u2019s not worried that regulators would nix a larger Time Warner Cable deal if Charter also bought Brighthouse.\n\n\u2013 Shalini Ramachandran contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As investors watch Charter Communications Inc. for any signs that a deal for cable operator Time Warner Cable Inc. could be imminent, chief executives of both companies spoke at any industry conference late Wednesday.", "title": "Charter-Time Warner Cable\u2019s CEOs Talk Consolidation", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/05/14/charter-time-warner-cables-ceos-talk-consolidation/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IB812_0424ch_P_20150424163203.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Charter-Time Warner Cable\u2019s CEOs Talk Consolidation", "description": "As investors watch Charter Communications Inc. for any signs that a deal for cable operator Time Warner Cable Inc. could be imminent, chief executives of both companies spoke at any industry conference late Wednesday.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Maureen Farrell", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "As investors watch Charter Communications Inc. for any signs that a deal for cable operator Time Warner Cable Inc. could be imminent, chief executives of both companies spoke at any industry conference late Wednesday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-05-14T17:41:05-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/05/14/charter-time-warner-cables-ceos-talk-consolidation/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-36801", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As investors watch Charter Communications Inc. for any signs that a deal for cable operator Time Warner Cable Inc. could be imminent, chief executives of both companies spoke at any industry conference late Wednesday.", "title": "Charter-Time Warner Cable\u2019s CEOs Talk Consolidation", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/05/14/charter-time-warner-cables-ceos-talk-consolidation/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IB812_0424ch_P_20150424163203.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-36801", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-05-14T17:41:43-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc97d\"", "article_summary": "Time Warner\u2019s CEO on cable consolidation:Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said he doesn\u2019t know whether cable consolidation is inevitable.\nRegulators, he said, think of the Newhouse family\u2019s Bright House Networks LLC, which Charter was set to buy before the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal collapsed, as one in the same as Time Warner Cable.\nIn January 2014, Charter proposed to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 in cash and stock.\nMr. Rutledge made it clear that he\u2019s not worried that regulators would nix a larger Time Warner Cable deal if Charter also bought Brighthouse.\nNow, Charter has another opportunity to make a run at Time Warner Cable."}
