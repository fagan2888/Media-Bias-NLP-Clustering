Nikki Haley\u2019s response to the Charleston massacre, highlighted by her call to remove the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds, has thrust her back into the national spotlight and re-ignited talk about what role she might play in the 2016 race.\n\nNot only is Haley poised to be a powerful surrogate, there's already chatter that she could make a solid Republican vice presidential candidate.\n\n\"She\u2019d be on anybody\u2019s list,\u201d Mike Huckabee, one 14 GOP presidential candidates and a former Arkansas governor, told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s done a terrific job in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nHaley has been a high-profile Republican since she won the governorship as part of the 2010 Tea Party wave.\n\nBut her call to remove the Confederate battle flag after a white male fatally shot nine black people June 17 inside an historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., has Republican presidential candidates, political observers and others suggesting her leadership in the aftermath shows she could be a pivotal player in the presidential race.\n\nIn addition, the Republican National Committee, South Carolina's U.S. senators and several of the GOP White House candidates have followed Haley in calling for the flag's removal, amid many Southerners\u2019 belief that the flag is part of their heritage, not a symbol of white supremacy.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nHaley, an Indian-American and the state\u2019s first female governor, insists her call to remove the flag was deeply personal and beyond politics, repeatedly telling reporters she couldn\u2019t \u201clook her children in the face\u201d while allowing the flag to fly.\n\nBut in a presidential campaign season, the political implications are unavoidable.\n\nJuleanne Glover, who has worked on Republican presidential campaigns for Arizona Sen. John McCain and Steve Forbes and is now a senior adviser for the international firm Teneo Strategy, agrees that Haley could be a top vice presidential pick.\n\nBut she also argues Haley could play a far bigger role in the White House race that would begin much earlier than when candidates pick a running mate in summer 2016.\n\nGlover suggested Tuesday that Haley\u2019s backing and physical presence at campaign stops across early-voting South Carolina could make or break a candidate\u2019s White House bid and that her voice on such topics as women\u2019s issues, education reform and long-term immigration policy could \u201ccreate a platform for 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe could play a pivotal role in all of these issues and in the future of the party,\u201d Glover said. \u201cShe\u2019s an American success story with a biographical narrative that lends itself to a larger, inspirational story. Friends who know her well have always been evangelical about her potential. They are not surprised.\u201d\n\nThe decision by Haley, an elected official, to end her previous support for the flag, which was moved from atop the state capitol dome in 2000, indeed put her at the forefront of the issue.\n\nHowever, she was not the first high-profile Republican to speak out.\n\nHaley made the announcement, amid mounting public outcry, five days after the incident and three days after 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and 2016 GOP candidate Jeb Bush called it a symbol of racism.\n\nWithin the crowded GOP field, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham support the flag being taken down, while Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum have not taken a specific public stance. The field is expected to swell to 16 candidates.\n\nAs a female and a minority official, the 43-year-old Haley indeed has the potential to become a major figure in the new guard of the Republican Party.\n\nBut some political observers suggest she is still a work in progress.\n\nHaley was elected last year to a second term with roughly 56 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a South Carolina gubernatorial candidate in 24 years. But she won in an overwhelmingly Republican state and would likely need to broaden her appeal to be selected as a running mate.\n\nIn addition, the former state legislator, who has an accounting degree from Clemson University, has largely focused on job growth and state economic development and less on race and women\u2019s issues.\n\nAnd she has occasionally clashed with Democrats and Republicans alike in the state legislature.\n\nHaley upset black Democrats in part over her refusal to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare and for supporting a state voter-identification law they consider discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the week before the Charleston church killings, Haley signed into a law a bill requiring police officers to wear body cameras that was championed by Democratic state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, killed while leading a bible study inside the church.\n\nShe also got support from Pinckney, an ardent progressive, for an economic-development plan to dredge the Savannah River.\n\nStill, College of Charleston political Professor Kendra Stewart said Haley has perhaps an even more \u201ccontentious\u201d relationship with the GOP-controlled legislature, with which she has clashed over spending, ethics reform and state agency control.\n\nStewart said Haley also has offended assembly leaders by criticizing them publicly and vetoing their legislation, which has resulted in efforts to override her vetoes.\n\nGlover thinks Haley has had to battle with the old guard in both parties to achieve her political goals but acknowledges \u201csome of the legislative tussles have not always helped burnished her image.\u201d\n\nAnother big issue is simply the political calculations of picking any vice presidential candidate -- which includes such factors as the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee and whether the GOP nominee is, for example, a strong conservative or more of a moderate who would gain wider appeal with somebody like Haley.\n\nStewart suggests that Haley\u2019s odds increase if Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination or if an East Coast moderate like Christie is the Republican choice.\n\n\u201cIf Clinton wins, it would be wise for Republicans to have a female or non-white male on the ballot,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cShe\u2019s very appealing to the Republican Party\u2019s more conservative base. She would add some strength to that part of the ticket.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Lauren Blanchard contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential Primaries", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-06 11:11:15 EDT", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "South Carolina Gov.
