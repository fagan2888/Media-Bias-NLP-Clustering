Bloomberg's list puts Larry Robins' Glenview Capital up 84% through October.\n\nOverall, it's an improvement over last year, when the best hedge fund, Deepak Narula's Metacapital Management returned almost 40% betting on mortgage bonds, while the industry's average was a 1.3% return.\n\nBut it's still not great.\n\nGlenview's strategy was to go into stocks and go in big \u2014 a strategy that worked for the funds that had the stones to try it. For its part, Glenview specifically targeted healthcare stocks knowing that the Affordable Care Act would give them a boost.\n\nOnly 16 hedge funds on Bloomberg's list out-performed the S&P, which closed the year up about 30%.\n\nOnly 16 hedge funds ignored the bears, levered up, and let stocks take them.\n\nSounds kind of scary, actually. Who's not afraid of a bubble?\n\nOne more thing \u2014 even thought this average performance is pretty dismal, investors are still pouring money into hedge funds. According to a report from eVestment, industry assets are at $2.8 trillion, which is only 3% from an all-time high.\n\nMoreover, industry inflows in November were at $71 billion, almost double last year's.\n\nCheck out the top 30 funds on Bloomberg's list here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Linette Lopez", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The best hedge fund of 2013 returned 84% while the industry average returned about 8%.", "creator": "lopezlinette", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/best-hedge-fund-of-2013-beat-average-10x-2014-1", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/52cd6cf869bedd53211099f0-506-253/its-crazy-how-much-better-2013s-best-hedge-fund-did-than-almost-everyone-else.jpg", "title": "It's Crazy How Much Better 2013's Best Hedge Fund Did Than Almost Everyone Else", "site": "clusterstock", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "clusterstock,moneygame", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Hedge Funds, Markets, Bloomberg, Linette Lopez", "description": "The best hedge fund of 2013 returned 84% while the industry average returned about 8%.", "author": "Linette Lopez", "sailthru.date": "2014-01-08", "sailthru.title": "It's Crazy How Much Better 2013's Best Hedge Fund Did Than Almost Everyone Else", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52cd6cf869bedd53211099f0-50-50/its-crazy-how-much-better-2013s-best-hedge-fund-did-than-almost-everyone-else.jpg", "news_keywords": "Hedge Funds, Markets, Bloomberg, Linette Lopez", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52cd6cf869bedd53211099f0/its-crazy-how-much-better-2013s-best-hedge-fund-did-than-almost-everyone-else.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-01-08", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/linette-lopez"}, "sailthru.description": "The best hedge fund of 2013 returned 84% while the industry average returned about 8%.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The best hedge fund of 2013 returned 84% while the industry average returned about 8%.", "title": "It's Crazy How Much Better 2013's Best Hedge Fund Did Than Almost Everyone Else", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/best-hedge-fund-of-2013-beat-average-10x-2014-1", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/52cd6cf869bedd53211099f0-1190-625/its-crazy-how-much-better-2013s-best-hedge-fund-did-than-almost-everyone-else.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "It's Crazy How Much Better 2013's Best Hedge Fund Did Than Almost Everyone Else", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52cd6cf869bedd53211099f0/its-crazy-how-much-better-2013s-best-hedge-fund-did-than-almost-everyone-else.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "clusterstock"}, "article_summary": "Part of what stands out about it is the huge gap between how well the best hedge fund did, and the year's average hedge fund performance.\nIn 2013, the average hedge fund was up 8.2% through December.\nOverall, it's an improvement over last year, when the best hedge fund, Deepak Narula's Metacapital Management returned almost 40% betting on mortgage bonds, while the industry's average was a 1.3% return.\nOne more thing \u2014 even thought this average performance is pretty dismal, investors are still pouring money into hedge funds.\nOnly 16 hedge funds on Bloomberg's list out-performed the S&P, which closed the year up about 30%."}
