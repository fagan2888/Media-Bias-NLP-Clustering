The plan will likely be the subject of public hearings next year, and could apply as soon as the 2017 fishing year, said commission spokeswoman Tina Berger.\n\nThe winter fishery, which formerly took place in the early months of the year, is currently shut down over concerns about low population, and fishermen haven\u2019t been able to catch shrimp there since 2013.\n\nLimiting access to the fishery is a subject of consternation in the industry, and some believe capping participation is unfair to younger fishermen who are trying to gain a foothold in the business. Others doubt that limiting the number of fishermen will effectively reduce the catch of shrimp and instead favor a shorter season or a low total catch limit.\n\nBut Gary Libby, a Port Clyde shrimp trawler and member of the shrimp board, said limiting the number of fishermen can halt the \u201cgold rush\u201d mentality that has impacted the shrimp fishery over the years. The number of boats in the fishery has varied greatly over the years, from nearly 400 in 1988 to less than 150 in 2006, largely because of the shrimps\u2019 availability and fluctuating market price.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have that gold rush, maybe you don\u2019t have the dips we\u2019ve had in recent years,\u201d Libby said. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of stability in the fishery.\u201d\n\nPatrick Keliher, commissioner of Maine\u2019s Department of Marine Resources, does not support the idea, which he called \u201cnot the solution to controlling the shrimp harvest.\u201d\n\nKeliher added: \u201cIn fact it would just be another blow to those fishermen who traditionally held a diverse group of licenses, which is the historic nature of Maine\u2019s commercial fisheries.\u201d\n\nOther fisheries impose similar limits on fishermen, however. Maine\u2019s lobster fishery, for example, is limited access and the elver and scallop fisheries are \u201cclosed fisheries,\u201d meaning there is a cap on new licenses.\n\nScientists have said rising temperatures in the Gulf of Maine are a threat to the shrimp, which are also sought by some fishermen from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Maine\u2019s catch of shrimp fell from nearly 5 million pounds in 2012 to less than 600,000 pounds in 2013.\n\nFishery managers also have to soon determine if there will be a shrimp fishery in the winter of 2016, and some say it looks unlikely. The shrimp board will consider the results of a recent survey at a meeting in November and could make a decision then.\n\nMaggie Hunter, a member of the shrimp board\u2019s technical committee, said the status of Maine shrimp remains poor.\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t many medium sized shrimp that are coming along,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the name of the Maine government agency is the Department of Marine Resources, not Department of Marine Resource.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine shrimp might come back on the market eventually but there could be fewer fishermen catching them.", "Author": "PATRICK WHITTLE", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Maine shrimp might come back on the market eventually but there could be fewer fishermen catching them.", "title": "Maine shrimp fishery may allow fewer fishermen in future", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/22/maine-shrimp-fishery-may-allow-fewer-fishermen-in-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/7cf85495ab1cd4257f0f6a7067008f40.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/7cf85495ab1cd4257f0f6a7067008f40.jpg", "title": "Maine shrimp fishery may allow fewer fishermen in future", "description": "Maine shrimp might come back on the market eventually but there could be fewer fishermen catching them.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9b4\"", "article_summary": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Maine shrimp might come back on the market eventually but there could be fewer fishermen catching them.\nMaggie Hunter, a member of the shrimp board\u2019s technical committee, said the status of Maine shrimp remains poor.\nFishery managers also have to soon determine if there will be a shrimp fishery in the winter of 2016, and some say it looks unlikely.\nBut Gary Libby, a Port Clyde shrimp trawler and member of the shrimp board, said limiting the number of fishermen can halt the \u201cgold rush\u201d mentality that has impacted the shrimp fishery over the years.\nMaine\u2019s catch of shrimp fell from nearly 5 million pounds in 2012 to less than 600,000 pounds in 2013."}
