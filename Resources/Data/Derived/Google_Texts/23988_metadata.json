Next year, he\u2019s anticipating a 1 percent to 1.5 percent increase in total employment in Spokane and Kootenai counties, which would be similar to\u2014or slightly higher\u2014than the rise in employment this year. Several factors\u2014rising interest rates, unpredictability caused by the Affordable Care Act\u2014could hamper that growth, however.\n\nIn the real estate market, investors are showing strong interest in multifamily housing projects, with other types of commercial properties garnering strong interest. The exception is the office market, which is characterized as still being in recovery. Even that market, though, is stronger than it had been in recent years.\n\nSpokane-area home sales through the first 11 months of 2014 increased 4.6 percent, compared with the year-earlier period, and median sale prices rose 2.1 percent. Continued, sustainable growth is projected for the next two years.\n\nOne longtime Spokane-area homebuilder says this fall has been his busiest in six years, and he\u2019s expecting a strong start to 2015. Commercial contractors also are projecting a good level of activity next year, although they note that many companies, from a staffing standpoint, aren\u2019t back to prerecession levels yet.\n\nA couple of the big projects that have been in the works all year\u2014the Davenport Grand Hotel and the Spokane Convention Center expansion across the street from it\u2014are expected to come on line later next year, and those involved in the tourism trade expect the new or expanded venues to draw more events and visitors.\n\nConventions to be held here next year include the World Science Fiction Society convention in August, which is expected to draw between 5,000 and 7,000 people; the 2015 international Adventist-Laymen\u2019s Services Industries conference, also in August and slated to attract 3,000 delegates; and the Council of Undergraduate Research conference, which about 3,000 people are due to attend in April.\n\nRetail sales are expected to improve as consumer confidence rises. One mall operator here is projecting a 2.5 percent increase in sales in 2015, which is similar to the gains reported this year. Others say sales are increasing despite continued pressure from online retailers.\n\nIn the finance sector, Spokane-area banks and credit unions expect loan and deposit growth to remain strong next year. Some are expecting interest rates to increase toward the middle of the year, and they speculate that could lead to more lending activity in the first half of the year.\n\nThe outlook for the health care sector is somewhat murky as the industry adapts to broad implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome industry executives say they have seen some positives from a larger insured population, but they say it\u2019s too early to say conclusively whether the federal program is benefitting the industry.\n\nOne economic development manager is reporting an increase in technology startup activity during the past 18 months, and others in the industry say sales are increasing, with one manufacturer reporting record sales and expecting another record year in 2015.\n\nIn the agricultural industry, the market for soft-white wheat, the predominant crop in Eastern Washington, could be softer next year due to a plentiful supply worldwide. That market is further challenged by current crops that suffered from dry conditions this past fall, followed by a hard freeze. Industry experts say, however, that demand is better than it is for other types of wheat.\n\nOn the other side of the state line, Kootenai County is seeing its job market tighten up; in October, it reported a 3.9 percent unemployment rate. While the county will lose a major employer in Kimball Office Inc., which has announced plans to close its Post Falls plant next year, growth in other areas of the manufacturing sector is expected to offset that loss.\n\nWood-products producers report stronger demand and higher prices as new-home construction ticks upward. That demand is expected to increase at a greater rate next year, along with a projected increase in new-housing starts nationwide.\n\nIn the mining sector, prices for both gold and silver are down from a year ago, but still high by historic standards. Some experts, however, expect prices and demand to cycle back upward in the next year or two.\n\n\u2014Linn Parish", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97f7\"", "article_summary": "Others say sales are increasing despite continued pressure from online retailers.\nMost economic sectors in the Inland Northwest experienced growth this year, and even those that faced challenges are somewhat optimistic about 2015.\nThat demand is expected to increase at a greater rate next year, along with a projected increase in new-housing starts nationwide.\nIn the finance sector, Spokane-area banks and credit unions expect loan and deposit growth to remain strong next year.\nOne mall operator here is projecting a 2.5 percent increase in sales in 2015, which is similar to the gains reported this year."}
