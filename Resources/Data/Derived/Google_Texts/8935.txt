Seconds before a car burst into flames, three people rescued a North Fort Myers man from the vehicle. On Thursday, he wishes to thank the strangers who pulled him from the burning SUV.

Without their help, Joel Metz said he might not be here. All he remembers is having a "sugar attack" where he explained he was feeling lightheaded and then blacked out.

"I wasn't supposed to go that day," said Metz.

He was cruising down US-41 just two miles from his home when it happened.

"I just felt really lightheaded and that was it."

Metz said a soda bottle rolled under his brake, and when he went grab it, everything got fuzzy.

"Next thing you know, I am being pulled out of my vehicle by two angels," said Metz. "All I remember is there was just blood and extreme pain in my leg."

People he didn't even know rescued him before his SUV exploded.

A manager from Discount Liquor heard it, called 9-1-1, and watched as the "angels" saved Metz.

"He not only grabs me out of my truck, he goes to get a fire extinguisher and tries to put my vehicle out for me," said Metz.

As of Thursday night, Metz was in pain as he now suffers from a broken leg and bruised organs.

"It just hurts when I breathe. I have a chunk missing out of my time. I have a chunk missing out of the bottom of my chin, stitches," he said. "When I look at those [pictures of the SUV], it is the most frightening thing to know I could've died that day."

But he does have a good attitude as he said he's happy to be alive and thankful to be home.

"I'm just glad that I'm alive. I'm just really, really glad I get to see my little boy enjoy this Christmas."

The three people who helped Joel out are complete strangers. He said if they are interested, he'd love to meet them in person to say thank you.
