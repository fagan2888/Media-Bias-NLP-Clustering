Their constituents don\u2019t like Obama, or his polices, and they have to somehow convince them that they\u2019ll be somewhat independent when it comes to fighting for their interests.\n\nNatalie Tennant, the Democratic candidate in West Virginia\u2019s Senate race, is trying to disseminate that message of independene with this ad rebuking Obama\u2019s energy policy. It was released at the end of July. She says that she\u2019ll protect coal jobs in West Virginia and \u201cstand up to leaders of both parties who threaten our way of life.\u201d She then proceeds to turn off the power to the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s strong stuff. But when asked about her support of Obama earlier this week by a disgruntled West Virginia resident at a Democratic campaign event, Tennant walked a waffled line. The gentleman on the video expressed frustration over the EPA\u2019s new regulations.\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t help that a tracker captured this exchange, Tennant\u2019s campaign manager, Major General Allen Tackett, didn\u2019t do her any favors by interjecting saying that Tennant agrees with Obama on \u201cmost of his policies.\u201d He later said he misspoke (via Metro News):\n\n\u201cThey were right up in Natalie\u2019s face and becoming very obnoxious. They kept saying, \u2018Why do you support Obama? Why do you support Obama?\u2019 I just tried to come to her defense and I made the statement, \u2018Well, because she supports some of the policies\u2019 and I misspoke,\u201d Tackett said. \u201c(I said it) Just in the heat of the moment, just trying to defuse the situation.\u201d\n\nAs the Charleston Daily Mail reported on August 5, Tennant isn\u2019t your typical Democrat running this year. She\u2019s against expanded background checks on firearms and the employer mandate of Obamacare. But, that might not be enough to carry her to victory this November, as she still carries the Democrat label. In 2010, that label virtually wiped out the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat coalition in Congress due to the nation's negative reaction over the passage of Obamacare.\n\nYet, this exchange does capture what National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar was saying about authenticity and the role it\u2019ll play in this election cycle. You can see how some people might find Tennant inauthentic given her interview on Fox And Friends last week:\n\nOn average, Tennant\u2019s Republican opponent, Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito, is ahead in the polls with a comfortable nine-point lead. If Capito is elected this fall, she'll be the first Republican to hold a West Virginia Senate seat in nearly sixty-years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inauthentic. .05/26/2016 19:10:55PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Inauthentic.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Natalie Tennant's Pro-Obama Past Comes To Haunt Her In West Virginia Race", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/08/08/natalie-tenants-proobama-past-comes-to-haunt-her-in-west-virginia-race-n1876661", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/133/6b2b233c-94ac-4fa7-b6aa-a265674ad609.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Inauthentic.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Natalie Tennant's Pro-Obama Past Comes To Haunt Her In West Virginia Race", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/08/08/natalie-tenants-proobama-past-comes-to-haunt-her-in-west-virginia-race-n1876661", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/133/6b2b233c-94ac-4fa7-b6aa-a265674ad609.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Natalie Tennant's Pro-Obama Past Comes To Haunt Her In West Virginia Race, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "If Capito is elected this fall, she'll be the first Republican to hold a West Virginia Senate seat in nearly sixty-years.\nNatalie Tennant, the Democratic candidate in West Virginia\u2019s Senate race, is trying to disseminate that message of independene with this ad rebuking Obama\u2019s energy policy.\nShe says that she\u2019ll protect coal jobs in West Virginia and \u201cstand up to leaders of both parties who threaten our way of life.\u201d She then proceeds to turn off the power to the White House.\nBut when asked about her support of Obama earlier this week by a disgruntled West Virginia resident at a Democratic campaign event, Tennant walked a waffled line.\nThey kept saying, \u2018Why do you support Obama?"}
