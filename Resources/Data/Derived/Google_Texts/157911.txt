Gov. Chris Christie has dropped his appeal to legalized same-sex marriages today, hours after gay couples began immediately taking advantage of a court ruling that compelled the state to become the 14th in the nation to recognize same-sex nuptials.

Marsha Shapiro and Louise Walpin, who were married at 12:01 a.m. today and were one of six couples in the legal case to allow same-sex marriage in New Jersey, join Here & Now’s Jeremy Hobson to share their reaction.

On Friday, a unanimous state Supreme Court rejected the Christie administration’s request to delay the implementation date of same-sex weddings.

Last month, a lower-court judge ruled that New Jersey must recognize gay marriages starting Monday.

The Republican governor, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, had been asking the state’s top court to overturn that ruling, and not to force the state to recognize same-sex marriage until the appeal was resolved.

The court agreed to hear the overall case in January but announced Friday it would not delay the start of the marriages, in part because it said the state is not likely to prevail in its arguments next year.

In an email Monday morning, the governor’s office said it was withdrawing its appeal, because the chief justice on Friday left no ambiguity about the court’s view.
