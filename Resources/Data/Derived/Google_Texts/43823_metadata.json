But he reports the situation has improved -- that the Church of England clergy are becoming more robust in their faith, not less.\n\n\n\nThe story opens with a strong rhetorical flourish:\n\nAs a prerequisite for the job of being a Church of England priest, it would seem not unreasonable to expect a belief in God to be fairly essential. But this is not the case, according to a poll of Anglican clergy which found that as many as 16 per cent are unclear about God and two per cent think it is no more than a human construct.\n\n\n\nIt is 30 years since David Jenkins, then the Bishop of Durham, caused controversy by casting doubt on the resurrection, but it appears that such unorthodox views are widespread amongst Britain\u2019s priests.\n\nThe story offers details from the poll, but then puts these numbers into historical context:\n\nClergy were significantly more likely to hold unorthodox beliefs the older they were and the longer they had been in the ministry. Nearly 90 per cent of those ordained since 2011 believe in God compared with only 72 per cent of those who became priests in the 1960s, the research discovered.\n\nThe article works towards its close with a quote from one of the atheist clergy.\n\nThe Rev David Paterson, a retired Church of England priest, said there was no conflict in preaching while being unable to believe in God. \u201cWithin my congregation I would take the line that how you feel about God is not in the least dependent on whether you think God exists or not. I preach using God\u2019s terminology, but never with the suggestion that God actually exists.\u201d\n\nAnd then comes a quote from a conservative expressing indignation that \u201csomeone could be a priest at the same time as not believing in God\u201d.\n\nContinue reading \"Heavens above!\" by George Conger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reporting on religion surveys can be a perilous business, but journalist \r\nJonathan Wynne-Jones shows how the job can be done well.\r\n\r\nHis\u00a0article in\u00a0The\u00a0Independent\u00a0titled\u00a0\u201cTwo per cent of Anglican \r\npriests\u00a0don't believe in God, survey finds\u201d invites the reader into the \r\nstory with a catchy lede, yet it offers a sober and balanced interpretation \r\nof the results.\r\n\r\nSome expecting a story bashing the Church of England might cry foul, and \r\nclaim Wynne-Jones was engaging in a bait and switch -- offering a story \r\nthat appeared to confirm the pottiness of the local vicar.
