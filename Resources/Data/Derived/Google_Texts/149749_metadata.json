Green had played his best game of the season \u2014 11 points and three assists in nearly 18 minutes Wednesday night against the Miami Heat \u2014 and with it started to rebuild something that had been eroding ever so slightly in his coach, Brian Shaw.\n\nTrust.\n\n\u201cIt felt good,\u201d Green said. \u201cJust coming out here when my name was called, and just making the most out of the opportunity. And just trying to show Coach, get some trust, and get some more playing time when I\u2019m out there.\u201d\n\nAnd along the way, show up on SportsCenter\u2019s top plays for making a buzzer-beating, long 3-pointer to end the third quarter.\n\nIt has been an eventful season for Green, a rookie one year removed from when he last played in college at Virginia Tech. His first action in the NBA could be considered a complete success: six points, making all three of his shots, in 10 minutes Nov. 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nAnd then \u2026 a string of struggles.\n\nThe low point was in the Nuggets\u2019 three-game road trip last weekend. Green \u2014 like most of the rest of the bench \u2014 put back-to-back subpar performances on the court. Green\u2019s was in relief of starter Ty Lawson. That had Shaw wondering if the Nuggets needed to look outside for point guard help and shaking his head, trying to figure out what he was going to do in the meantime.\n\nGreen saw the comments and took them to heart. He responded with poised play.\n\nIt started when Shaw went to him early in Wednesday\u2019s game with a question.\n\n\u201cWhen you were at Virginia Tech, what did you do best?\u201d Shaw asked.\n\n\u201cScore,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cGo out and do that,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBe who you are.\u201d\n\nAnd Green did.\n\n\u201cOnce he said that to me \u2026 I said, \u2018All right,\u2019 \u201d Green said. \u201cI just went out there, had a scoring mentality, making plays and it all paid off. I really appreciated Coach saying that to me. It helped me a lot.\u201d\n\nAll isn\u2019t solved with the Nuggets\u2019 reserve ball-handling situation, but Green helped ease some of the anxiety surrounding it. Lawson had been playing long, difficult minutes, and Shaw was concerned about wearing him out.\n\nFor the time being, at least, thanks to Green\u2019s showing, it has been placed on the back burner.\n\n\u201cHopefully, going forward he can build off of that and continue to play solid minutes for us,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nSaid Green: \u201cI hope so. It\u2019s still a process. I\u2019m still a rookie. I\u2019m still young. Every day for me, every day I go into practice, everything I do is just showing him that I can give Ty a break. I know he plays a lot of minutes; just giving him a breather here and there, sticking me in there to show I can control the team and hold my own I think would be good for myself, Ty and the team.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT HOUSTON\n\n6 p.m. Saturday, ALT 2; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on James Harden: The former Arizona State star has been every bit the powerful offensive force he\u2019s always proven to be, recently taking over the NBA scoring lead at 26.4 points per game. He\u2019s getting to the free-throw line regularly, averaging nearly 10 attempts per game \u2014 and then cashing in on 89 percent of those tries.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets: They expect to be without Danilo Gallinari, who is dealing with a couple of bone bruises on his right knee. He\u2019ll probably take the weekend off to rest. \u2026 Nate Robinson (back) and JaVale McGee (tibia) are questionable for the game. \u2026 This is the first meeting between the Nuggets and Rockets this season.\n\nRockets: Dwight Howard has missed 11 consecutive games because of right knee soreness, but he\u2019s aiming for a return against the Nuggets. Howard is averaging 18.8 points and 11.3 rebounds. \u2026 Houston has five losses on the season, and interestingly enough, three of those have come at the Toyota Center. One of those was to the lowly Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets, however, have won five of their past six at home, including two straight.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets find some relief for Ty Lawson with Erick Green", "title": "Nuggets find some relief for Ty Lawson with Erick Green", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/12/nuggets-find-some-relief-for-ty-lawson-with-erick-green/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212_112033_SP30BKNNUGGS_2JL5430.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212_112033_SP30BKNNUGGS_2JL5430.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-12T21:28:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T12:17:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOnce he said that to me \u2026 I said, \u2018All right,\u2019 \u201d Green said.\nHOUSTON \u2014 The relief written all over his face, Erick Green could finally speak about accomplishments completed, not those yet to achieve.\nIt has been an eventful season for Green, a rookie one year removed from when he last played in college at Virginia Tech.\nHis first action in the NBA could be considered a complete success: six points, making all three of his shots, in 10 minutes Nov. 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nIt helped me a lot.\u201dAll isn\u2019t solved with the Nuggets\u2019 reserve ball-handling situation, but Green helped ease some of the anxiety surrounding it."}
