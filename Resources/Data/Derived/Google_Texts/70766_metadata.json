I often feel like if you could see sit where I sit and see what I see, you\u2019d find that the community pharmacist is a greatly underutilized component of our nation\u2019s healthcare system; that we could do a lot more to close the gap on provider access, lower the cost of care and ultimately improve health outcomes for millions of Americans, just by enabling the pharmacist on the corner to practice at the top of their license.\n\nThat\u2019s why we put together RxImpact as a special edition of Drug Store News for federal and state legislators, policymakers, news media and other critical stakeholders outside of retail pharmacy industry, to help bring greater awareness of the full impact community pharmacy can have as our nation tries to improve an overburdened health care system.\n\nThe stories that follow provide a myriad of examples of what community pharmacy can do \u2014 and is doing everyday \u2014 to help improve health care.
