The posture aims to invigorate Democrats hungry for a fight with the GOP and casts the former secretary of state as a general election candidate well-positioned to take on Republicans like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker.\n\nThe strategy allows Clinton to play offense without having to start intraparty bickering with Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has drawn tens of thousands of people to events recently and is surging in most polls. It also allows her to define a potential Republican nominee early, as President Barack Obama did with Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThe latest example came Tuesday when Clinton called out Walker on education at a community college in Claremont, New Hampshire, labeling the Wisconsin governor as someone who \"delighted in slashing the investment in higher education in his state.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Hillary Clinton weighs in on Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly Replay More Videos ...

I don't know why he wants to raise taxes on students, but that is the result.\"\n\nLate late month, Clinton knocked Bush just minutes before the former Florida governor and Republican candidate addressed the same audience.\n\n\"I don't think you can credibly say that everyone has a right to rise and then say you are for phasing out Medicare and repealing Obamacare,\" Clinton said, using Bush's Right to Rise super PAC name to indirectly, but clearly, hit the 2016 Republican candidate. \"You cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote.\"\n\nAnd Monday in New Hampshire , Clinton assailed Rubio, the Florida senator who many Democrats believe could be a strong challenger, over his remarks at Thursday's GOP debate that he opposes abortion in all instances\n\n\"What Marco Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican Party is today as anybody else on that stage, and it is deeply troubling,\" Clinton said. \"And it should be to the press, not just to those of us who have been doing this work for so long.\"\n\nClinton's battles with Republicans have even played out on social media\n\nPart of a larger strategy\n\nBut the attacks are more than just rhetoric. They signal an effort by the campaign to show Democrats -- some of whom may be tepid about supporting the former first lady or drawn by Sanders' liberal fire -- that Clinton will stand up for her party and her positions.\n\nThe fact that Clinton has called Walker, Rubio and Bush out by name is noteworthy given she has yet to mention Sanders or Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley in any speeches or responses to questions about them -- despite sharing a stage with the candidates last month.\n\nClinton has even started to signal that she is looking past her own primary debates, another sign she is steadily urging Democrats to begin thinking of her as the party standard-bearer who has the strength to stand up to Republicans.\n\n\"I am so looking forward to debating whomever emerges from their [the GOP] process,\" Clinton said Monday at an event in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nThe refrain is something Clinton likely wouldn't have said shorty after she launched her campaign in April, when her aides and advisers went to great lengths to tamp down on talk of a Democratic coronation. At nearly every turn early in the campaign, Clinton and her advisers looked to assure voters that the campaign was not a march toward the nomination and that Clinton would \"fight for every vote\" in the primary.\n\nJUST WATCHED Clinton explains why she went to Donald Trump's wedding Replay More Videos ...

And have said they have to do it because most Republicans have kept a laser-like focus on Clinton.\n\nThe recent uptick has largely been tied to last week's GOP debate, which drew an astonishing 24 million viewers.\n\nClinton has mentioned the debate in most of her campaign stops since the 17 Republicans took the stage in two events. \"Really, I admire you greatly for that,\" Clinton said to the New Hampshire voters on Tuesday who admitted to watching both debates.\n\nAhead of last week's Republican showdown, Joel Benenson, Clinton's top strategist, predicted that continual focus on Republicans, whether from Clinton or during the debate, would be \"problematic\" for the GOP.\n\n\"The focus on them is going to shine a spotlight on an array of issues that are not only antithetical to many Americans, but on economic issues. Their policies are horrendous,\" Benenson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton has vowed since day one that her campaign will take nothing for granted and stay focused on the Democratic primary.", "pubdate": "2015-08-11T20:11:10Z", "author": "Dan Merica, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton has vowed since day one that her campaign will take nothing for granted and stay focused on the Democratic primary.", "pubdate": "2015-08-11T20:11:10Z", "title": "Clinton trains rhetoric on Republicans despite touting focus on the primary", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/hillary-clinton-primary-republican-attacks/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150811164212-hillary-clinton-august-10-2015-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150811164212-hillary-clinton-august-10-2015-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/hillary-clinton-primary-republican-attacks/index.html"}, "keywords": "Government and public administration, Politics, US political parties, US Republican Party, 2016 Presidential election, Bernie Sanders, Elections and campaigns, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, New Hampshire, North America, Northeastern United States, Political candidates, Political Figures - US, Primaries and caucuses, Scott Walker, United States, US Democratic Party, US Federal elections, US Presidential elections, politics, Clinton trains rhetoric on Republicans despite touting focus on the primary - CNNPolitics.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/dmerica"}, "lastmod": "2015-08-11T21:05:46Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2714\"", "article_summary": "At nearly every turn early in the campaign, Clinton and her advisers looked to assure voters that the campaign was not a march toward the nomination and that Clinton would \"fight for every vote\" in the primary.\nThe fact that Clinton has called Walker, Rubio and Bush out by name is noteworthy given she has yet to mention Sanders or Maryland Gov.\nAnd have said they have to do it because most Republicans have kept a laser-like focus on Clinton.\nCampaign aides feel that contrasting Clinton with Republicans is beneficial for them because the differences are stark.\nClinton has mentioned the debate in most of her campaign stops since the 17 Republicans took the stage in two events."}
