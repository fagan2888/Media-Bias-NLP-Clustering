The search is focusing on an area around Highway 69 to Okmulgee.

The search for two men who went missing during Rocklahoma a little more than two weeks ago continued Saturday.

Search parties joined up in Mayes County, and while things are moving along, there is still no update on 20-year-olds Cody Parrick and Benjamin Barber's location, or what may have happened.

The two were last heard from on May 22, 2015 and agencies have done ground and air searches of the three-county area between the concert grounds in Pryor to Okmulgee where the two friends live.

Saturday, even with all the walking and the high temperatures, the search party showed up ready to work.

The command post for Saturday's search was set up in Muskogee where volunteers were asked to show up around 8:00 in the morning.

That party was led by law enforcement, but in Mayes County, where the men were last seen, another search party was led by one of the men's parents.

As in all the other searches, the groups spread out to look through grass, water and tree lines. The ground search is focusing on the U.S. Highway 69 corridor north and south of Muskogee and routes to Okmulgee.

Police said since the stretch of road is likely the way the men took to and from Rocklahoma, it's a top search area.

Even though the searching hasn't turned up much, Parrick's mother, Greta Richards, is hopeful.

"I've been out searching every day, walking the roads, I've searched through the leads, I've searched through pictures, I've done all that I know to do and that's really the only way I can keep my sanity is just to keep doing those things, keep that hope going and I do, I just feel hopeful, I think it will have a good outcome," she said.

The men were last seen driving a silver Pontiac minivan with the Muscogee Creek Nation tag B8E23.

At 8:30 Saturday night, a vigil will be held for the two men at the Rocklahoma grounds.
