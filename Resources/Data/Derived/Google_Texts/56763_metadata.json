Including the Texans. New research written up in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper finds that \u201ccowboy\u201d doctors \u2014 who deviate from professional guidelines, often providing more aggressive care than is recommended \u2014 are responsible for a surprisingly big portion of America\u2019s skyrocketing health costs. The paper concludes that \u201c36 percent of end-of-life spending, and 17 percent of U.S. health care spending, are associated with physician beliefs unsupported by clinical evidence.\u201d\n\nWhoa, Nelly. That means cowboy doctors are a half-a-trillion-dollar problem. But mightn\u2019t they also be good? Wouldn\u2019t many of us want a go-for-broke maverick when we\u2019re in dire medical straits? I asked Prof. Skinner, who\u2019s also a researcher at the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, to elaborate. Our conversation, lightly edited:\n\nSo how would you define a cowboy doctor?\n\nCowboys go it alone. They have developed their own rules and they don\u2019t necessarily adapt those rules to what the clinical evidence would suggest. So if you actually talked to what we term a \u2018cowboy doctor,\u2019 he or she would say, \u2018I get good results with this procedure for this type of patient.\u2019 That\u2019s why we found it so interesting: they go beyond what the professional guidelines recommend. And it\u2019s not as if they were out there before the professional guidelines got there. Sometimes pioneers are doing things that the guidelines haven\u2019t figured out yet. But we found no suggestion that subsequent guidelines were consistent with what these physicians were actually doing.\n\nSo is it stubbornness, then?\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s stubbornness but it\u2019s individuality. It\u2019s the individual craftsman versus the member of a team. And you could say, \u2018Well, but these are the pioneers.\u2019 But they\u2019re less likely to be board-certified; there\u2019s no evidence that what they\u2019re doing is leading to better outcomes. So we conclude that this is a characteristic of a profession that\u2019s torn between the artisan, the single Marcus Welby who knows everything, versus the idea of doctors who adapt to clinical evidence and who may drop procedures that have been shown not to be effective.\n\nYes, the extent of the variation in medical practice is striking. But I was most struck in your paper by how big a piece of the health-cost problem this could be. Can you quantify that?\n\nWe were surprised, too. What we show is that the opinions of these physicians \u2014 in particular, opinions that are outside of the clinical guidelines \u2014 explain as much as 17 percent of total variation in health care spending, which is, roughly speaking, 3 percent of GDP.\n\nWow. What is that in billions?\n\nThe association we found suggests it\u2019s almost half a trillion dollars.\n\nCan you give me a concrete example of how a cowboy doctor could drive up costs?\n\nWhat we chose to look at was a very common problem and a very expensive disease, particularly among the elderly: congestive heart failure. Our approach was to develop vignettes that characterized typical patients that a doctor might see. For example, an 85-year-old male with severe congestive heart failure who appears in the doctor\u2019s office. We provide detailed clinical characteristics about that patient, and then say to the doctor: \u2018Here are maybe six or seven different options. Which ones would you choose?\u2019 And they could check all of them, they could check none of them, it was really up to them.\n\nFor example?\n\nOne example was that they could basically just make the patient feel better. They could send him home with increased oxygen. They could perhaps talk about the possibility of palliative care. These are patients who are very much at risk of dying over the coming year. Or they could send them to the hospital to try to get some of their fluids under control. But the alternatives were very much more aggressive. They were treatments where there\u2019s either no evidence of any improvement or there\u2019s actually some evidence that these treatments could harm the patient. They will certainly lead to this poor 85-year-old man spending a lot of time in a hospital bed with very uncertain benefits.\n\nWhat might those more aggressive treatments be?\n\nFor example, admitting the patient to the Intensive Care Unit. The doctor is told that the patient is uncomfortable but if you increase his oxygen he\u2019s comfortable and he feels better. One of the aggressive options is to admit this patient to an ICU, where it\u2019s not clear what the benefits are for that patient but it is clear that admitting the patient would lead to a substantial increase in Medicare billing.\n\nWhat might guidelines-based care cost compared to cowboy care in this case?\n\nWe can look at percentages: What we find is that cowboy doctors were associated with nearly 60 percent greater spending among patients near the end of life.\n\nOK but\u2026.As patients, or family members of patients, don\u2019t we all feel like we want cowboy doctors? The kind who pull all the stops and go for the long shots even if hope is dim?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question, but I would actually prefer not to have a cowboy doctor. Simply because, if I\u2019m 85 years old, and I\u2019m at high risk of dying anyway, I would want to be comfortable. I do not want to go to an ICU. And in fact, hospitals have all kinds of exotic diseases that can very badly affect frail elderly people. There are real downsides.\n\nThere seems to be a real shift toward less aggressive end-of-life care, but what about all the rest of us? Aside from the fact that we\u2019re contributing to the high health costs in this country, what would you say to the run-of-the-mill patient about the downsides of having a cowboy doctor?\n\nI would be uncomfortable about doctors who are basing their decisions on their own intuition rather than on clinical studies, randomized trials. And the reason is that, for example, a surgeon might say, \u2018I get good results with this procedure.\u2019 And he or she probably does, but the problem is that the surgeon never sees what happens to the patients who don\u2019t get the procedure. And so they have really no basis for comparison except for kind of an intuition or a sense that, \u2018Well, after I did the surgery, my patient improved.\u2019\n\nA personal case: I had back problems and I went to my back surgeon. Here at Dartmouth, it just happens that the surgeons are very conservative \u2014 and he said something like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be the one to put a knife in your back without my being convinced that this will improve your outcome.\u2019 And as it turned out, I got better anyway, which happens a lot. But if they do operate on you, they never know that you might get better anyway.\n\nI know people\u2019s intuitions aren\u2019t always good. You know, men think they can pick stocks better than women and they end up doing worse. We know that. I don\u2019t want my medical decisions to be left to someone\u2019s intuition.\n\nThis goes beyond the scope of the paper, but how does this translate into useful information for medical consumers?\n\nThe Internet should be used with caution because there is so much misinformation, but there is also quite a bit of valuable information, particularly from trusted medical sources like the National Institutes of Health. So if the doctor is telling you, \u2018I think we should do this procedure\u2019 and you go online and find a study that says the patients who are like you didn\u2019t seem to improve with that procedure, I think you should at least print out the study and bring it to the doctor and say, \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019\n\nOr ask the doctor, \u2018What\u2019s your evidence?\u2019\n\nExactly. Or go see a different doctor.\n\nYou found that cowboy doctors are a bit more likely to be older guys, but not by much. You also found that cowboys are likelier to be in solo practice, right?\n\nYes, that was a strong result, that people in solo practice are more likely to be cowboys. Group or staff-model HMOs or hospital-based practices, and board-certified cardiologists, tend to be more conservative.\n\nThe Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care has been doing this work for years, finding striking regional differences in medical care and spending. How much does it look like the cowboy thing explains of all that?\n\nWhat we find is that by just going into a region and asking a handful of doctors about how they would treat a hypothetical 85-year-old male with congestive heart failure \u2014 how often they would have the patient come back for visits \u2014 measures like that explain over 60 percent of the variation in regional spending across the United States. We were very surprised.\n\nSo how does that happen? Why are there so many more cowboys in one place than another?\n\n\n\nThat is a great question. I think cowboys maybe like to practice together, they hire one another. But that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been looking at quite a bit. We\u2019re working on it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that 'cowboy doctors' -- mavericks who treat more aggressively than the accepted guidelines suggest -- are responsible for a surprisingly big chunk of America's high health costs, possibly as much as half a trillion dollars.
