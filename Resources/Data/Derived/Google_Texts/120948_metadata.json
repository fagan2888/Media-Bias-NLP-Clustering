Ted Cruz said Saturday that the GOP lost the government shutdown budget battle because some congressional Republicans turned on others, but that he doesn\u2019t think they will make the same mistake during the next political impasse.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that in the future the Senate will listen,\u201d Cruz, the tea party favorite and freshman senator from Texas, told a convention in Austin of the Texas Medical Association.\n\nCruz staged a more than 21-hour quasi-filibuster in the Senate late last month, helping spark a budget fight in the Republican-led House that partially shuttered the government in an attempt to sever funding for the nation\u2019s new health care law.\n\nThen, with the country facing a debt default, leaders in the Democratic-led Senate brokered a deal to end the standoff \u2013 which Cruz dismissed as \u201cselling the American people down the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t win a fight when your own team is firing cannons at the people who are standing up and leading, which are the House Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal sets up the potential for another budget showdown in January. Senate GOP leaders, however, have suggested that there won\u2019t be a repeat of the shutdown or a potential default crisis like in recent weeks.\n\nBut addressing reporters after his speech, Cruz would not say that another fight won\u2019t be coming.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of time to consider the particular practical or strategic decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if he was worried about retaliation from more senior Republican leaders in the Senate, Cruz said, \u201cI try very hard not to worry about the politics and the internal back-and-forth in Washington.\u201d\n\nMany attendees gave Cruz a standing ovation at the end of his speech.\n\nSome political observers now see Cruz as Texas\u2019 most popular Republican. But his approval ratings across the country may be slipping.\n\nNational polls have shown that while Americans in general don\u2019t love the health care law, they oppose defunding it \u2013 especially if it means shutting down the government. And many of Cruz\u2019s Senate colleagues have bemoaned the shutdown for tarnishing the GOP\u2019s image.\n\nCruz also took questions from the audience and was asked if ideology driving Washington could outweigh political pragmatism.\n\n\u201cThe arguments I have laid out today have not been ideological,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThese were the essence of practical.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 U.S. Sen.
