Car washes across the Wichita area were busy with customers trying to get their cars cleaned following a winter storm.

Joe's Car Wash was busy with people wanting to get road salts off of their vehicles.

"I just got my car a few months ago and I really don't want that ruining my paint," said one customer.

Road salts can be corrosive on metal and paints. With time, the salts can damage cars.
