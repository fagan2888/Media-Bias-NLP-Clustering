There weren\u2019t a lot of local shops opening up. There weren\u2019t a lot of people saying, \u2018Hey, we want to skate,\u2019 \u201d said Franklin Alves, a senior at University of South Florida St. Petersburg.\n\nAlves and classmate Will Harris are among a diverse group of enthusiasts who have spoken at City Council meetings in recent months in favor of lifting the skating ban and building the park.\n\nBoth are avid riders of longboards, which are typically 60 inches or longer and a popular, inexpensive way for college students to get around campus, Alves said.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nMany of the organizers of Saturday\u2019s Go Skate St. Pete event have been shredding the pavement in Pinellas County since well before Alves and Harris were born.\n\nIn St. Petersburg\u2019s previous skating heyday, superstars like Tony Hawk would fly in from Los Angeles to Child\u2019s Park for competitions held in back alleys, said Cleo Coney, 50.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have X-Games; we didn\u2019t have ESPN; but it kept us busy after school,\u201d he said.\n\nDowntown restaurateur Jon La Budde, who participated in a race from The Pier to Albert Whitted Airport, remembers piecing together his first board by hand.\n\n\u201cWe were taking the skates, you know, regular skates, and putting them on pieces of wood,\u201d he said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event, which coincided with the national Go Skateboarding Day, brought out a large cross-section of skaters, some on shortboards, others on longboards, children, teens, 30-somethings with toddlers and the \u201cold school\u201d crowd in their 50s, who encouraged youngsters to take advantage of the free helmets offered.\n\nWoodworker Jon Stine opened Local Longboard Company a few months ago on Central Avenue with a specialty in the longer, more stable boards \u2014 \u201cCadillacs,\u201d as he calls them \u2014 that appeal to those who may have less to prove on the ramp.\n\n\u201cI used to street skate and ramp half pipe and all that stuff when I was younger, but I haven\u2019t done that in a number of years. I wanted to kind of get back into it and this was the next logical step,\u201d Stine said.\n\nBack in the 1990s, long-time skateboarders recall, the city began viewing their presence as a nuisance and menace to public property. A ban was put in place from the waterfront to 16th Street and from Fifth Avenue North to Five Avenue South.\n\nEarlier this year city council members expressed support for lifting that ban, but no votes have been cast.\n\nThe council last month also endorsed the concept of a 40,000-square-foot skate park that could go in exactly where Saturday\u2019s event was held along Spa Beach.\n\nThose who prefer sliding down stair railings or flying off ramps could congregate at the skate park rather than pull such moves on downtown sidewalks.\n\nA new public skate park also could become a regional attraction for skaters in downtown St. Petersburg, said Tim Simmons, who runs the indoor Schoolyard Skate Park north of downtown and recently opened a retail store at 1618 Central Avenue.\n\n\u201cWe hope to see a new public park. That would be great for local skaters,\u201d he said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 21 Jun 2014 17:53:20 -0400", "Description": "ST.
