There\u2019s never been a genre more strip-mined, yet zombies are more popular than ever. Why?\n\nThe Walking Dead's handsome cast.\n\nAMC Z Nation is a more low-budget affair.\n\nSyFy Related Content\n\nNow in its fifth season, AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead is cable\u2019s top-rated show, even beating football. Meanwhile, SyFy\u2019s low-rent Z Nation has gotten renewed for a second season. And you may have noticed that roughly half of Netflix\u2019s titles are shitty zombie flicks from World War Z on down. Even AMC\u2019s largely worthless recap show, Talking Dead\u2014worthless unless you value celebrity guests conjecturing about events on Walking Dead\u2014was the seventh-highest-rated cable show last week.\n\nZombies stopped being scary long ago. For all the advanced gore effects, the Walking Dead zombies aren\u2019t a fraction as menacing as the shamblers in lousy blue makeup from George A. Romero\u2019s 1978 Dawn of the Dead. Anyone can just stroll up to a Walking Dead zombie and stab it in the head. Boink! If G. Gordon Liddy\u2019s claim that he could kill someone with a pencil always seemed farfetched, he could take out a whole horde of Walking Dead pussy zombies with a single fucking #2 Ticonderoga. One character even recently blasted a bunch of them apart with a fire hose. They\u2019re water-soluble.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing innovative about TWD, apart from putting hardcore gore into the non-geek mainstream\u2014and on a prestige platform alongside Mad Men and Breaking Bad. Sometimes it seems like the show everyone complains about but compulsively watches anyway. (Also an enjoinder to you Facebook narcissists: Shaddap with the night-of-broadcast spoiler reactions. Some of us still use TiVo.)\n\nBased on Robert Kirkman\u2019s juggernaut Image comics series that\u2019s run since 2003, TWD\u2019s yet another saga of survivors in a contemporary zombie apocalypse\u2014a copy of a copy of a survivalist fantasy that ought to be earning Romero massive weekly royalty checks. But it\u2019s well-made and has a cast solid enough to sell the show\u2019s countless pages of tin-eared bickering dialogue. And despite ups and downs in story quality\u2014it\u2019s on its third show-runner\u2014the fifth-season premiere scored more than 17 goddamn million viewers.\n\nZ Nation is way down the food chain. SyFy\u2019s show is shot in Spokane\u2014which you\u2019ll notice, if you\u2019ve been there recently, doesn\u2019t need much of a makeover to stand in for an apocalyptic zombie wasteland. The show also features plenty of familiar faces from Seattle\u2019s film scene, including TV news guy Lowell Deo. Z Nation is also proof that zombiephiles will consume anything. It\u2019s wretched. Yet with only 1.3 million viewers on average, it\u2019s surviving. Unoriginal even by genre standards, it follows\u2014say it with me\u2014survivors in a contemporary zombie apocalypse, here trying to transport a bite-resistant survivor whose blood could create a vaccine.\n\nSyFy\u2019s made a cottage industry of preposterously cheap, poorly-acted-but-fun trash, epitomized by Sharknado. But Z Nation is painful, not fun: A ridiculous zombie baby in the first episode; a couple\u2019s argument as they offhandedly whack zombies on a fuel-station catwalk. Even the generally competent Harold Perrineau (Lost) seems embarrassed to be involved; his line readings are so stiff they deserve their own cremations and funerals.\n\nBut back to my midterm-night epiphany: The Republicans were clearly winning, even though they\u2019d done nothing but obstruct on an historic level for the prior six years. No solutions. Nothing to help working people. And they intended to make things worse for the middle class and poor if they gained the Senate: getting rid of Obamacare, tax cuts for hedge-fund managers, and oil pipelines in your backyard. The doctrine of trickle-down economics would create even more of an oligarchy ruling a nation of overworked, debt-ridden serfs.\n\nAs a comic-book writer with a zombie title (Rotten) on my CV, I\u2019ve been asked again and again why zombies are so popular. And I\u2019ve always had a handful of explanations. First, viewers are more sophisticated, and the old-time monsters are too schlocky to buy into. Modern zombies are more relatable. Second, zombies tap into some of our most primal fears, including cannibalism. Third, there\u2019s the terror of getting absorbed into a group that changes you into something subhuman and mindless\u2014or seeing it happen to a loved one. Like losing a family member to the Tea Party. And lastly, zombie horror is cheap to make. Throw makeup on some friends and tell \u2019em to stagger around like Johnny Depp at the Hollywood Film Awards.\n\nWhat\u2019s this got to do with the midterms? My explanations were wrong. I hadn\u2019t taken the GOP\u2019s ruthlessly idiotic Galt\u2019s Gulch fantasies to their logical extension. About 45,000 people had been dying each year without health care, and Obamacare is taking a bite out of that with some nine million new enrollees. Eliminate the ACA, and the dead start multiplying again. The GOP\u2014exemplified by Paul Ryan\u2014doesn\u2019t believe in the safety net, and wants to ream Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. Then there\u2019s the jihad against regulations, also known as those oppressive rules that keep business from destroying the environment and hurting humans. Without which the country will more and more resemble Z Nation Spokane. Or Kansas, where governor Sam Brownback slashed taxes and turned his state from petri dish to toilet bowl. And he got re-elected.\n\nNo government for help. Every man for himself, armed to the teeth. That\u2019s not a zombie show so much as the official Republican party platform, if you listen to conservative talk radio. Before the election I\u2019d noted the weird convergence of generally intelligent zombie fans with the teabagger/Glenn Beck lunatics: a shared fixation on survivalist fantasies. Funny coincidence, I thought.\n\nThen it hit me on Election Day: All the zombie-apocalypse prepper folks were really skilled political trend-watchers. They weren\u2019t nerds who took it too far. They were perceptive. Better than the talk-show pundits. These zombie shows aren\u2019t just entertainment. They\u2019re practice.\n\nmarkrahner.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The answer to the whole zombie conundrum came to me on the", "og": {"site_name": "Seattle Weekly", "description": "The answer to the whole zombie conundrum came to me on the night of the midterms two weeks ago, like an arrow through the brain.", "title": "The Voting Dead: How Zombies Predicted the Midterms", "url": "http://", "image": "http://archive.seattleweekly.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=$oKrvnZl31InQkT0MmBpos$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvH$LVMZmmVw$2kqe04jowwWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "ZOMBIE, DEAD, ZOMBIES, NATION, WALKING, APOCALYPSE, MIDTERMS, VIEWERS, AMC, MILLION,", "fb": {"app_id": 500578586675733}, "msvalidate.01": "3443F17DFB93961891E95B1452B50579", "google-site-verification": "HB1ruhwjr9G2iMWnFITxFS9YXCHqRDvxfYM7NFy7KA0"}, "article_summary": "For all the advanced gore effects, the Walking Dead zombies aren\u2019t a fraction as menacing as the shamblers in lousy blue makeup from George A.
