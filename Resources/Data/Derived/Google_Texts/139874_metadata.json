U.S. Representative Robert Hurt laughs when asked which prompted his decision to not run for a fourth term.\n\n\u201cI was first elected in 2000,\u201d the Republican legislator says in a phone interview from Washington. \u201cI was 30 years old. I never envisioned doing that as a career.\u201d\n\nHe says leaving Congress is something he and his wife Kathy have been talking about for months. \u201cEvery year you serve, it\u2019s more difficult to make a decision not to run,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd at age 46, \u201cmy desire is to look for other ways to serve,\u201d he says.\n\nHurt\u2019s first elected office was the Chatham Town Council. In 2002, he went to Richmond to the House of Delegates and in 2008, to the Senate. In 2010 he challenged incumbent Democrat Tom Perriello for the 5th District seat and won.\n\nGridlock in Washington is \u201cfrustrating,\u201d he says, but was not the reason he decided not to run. \u201cI hope with the new leadership, we\u2019ll see more progress on that front with Paul Ryan,\u201d he says.\n\nOn January 6, Hurt voted for the 60th or so time to repeal the Affordable Care Act. As for legislation not destined to be vetoed, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve always put forward legislation with bipartisan co-sponsors with a focus to create jobs.\u201d\n\nHe cites the Commonsense Permitting for Job Creation Act that he introduced last year, co-sponsored by Democratic senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, which has not made it out of committee.\n\nHurt serves on the House Financial Services Committee and says he\u2019s looking for ways to make it easier for businesses to get capital and turn it into jobs, which is particularly an issue in economically hard hit Southside.\n\nSince Hurt announced he was not seeking reelection, three Republicans\u2014state Senator Tom Garrett, Bedford developer Jim McKelvey and conservative think-tanker Michael Del Rosso have tossed their caps into the ring. Hurt says he\u2019s not endorsing anyone.\n\nAnd while he says the future is an open book, he\u2019s pretty sure it will include practicing law in Chatham.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Rep.
