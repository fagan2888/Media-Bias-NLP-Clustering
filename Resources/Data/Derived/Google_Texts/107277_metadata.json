Since joining the Peoria, Ill.-based Samaritan Ministries in 2007, the family also has benefited from others, even receiving $35,000 to pay for Stephen Bratton's surgery for kidney cancer.  For decades, Samaritan, one of the nation's three longest-serving health-sharing ministries, has appealed to thousands of self-described Christians who seek health care coverage but don't want or can't afford insurance.  Advertising on Christian radio stations and in Christian publications, the ministries' popularity has expanded since passage of the Affordable Care Act, requiring almost all Americans to have health coverage.  Unlike traditional insurers, the ministries still can prohibit coverage for preventive medical screenings, birth control and pre-existing conditions.  Members contribute more than $180 million per year for each other's health care costs, according to the Washington, Ill.-based Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries, the lobbying organization for Samaritan and Medi-Share Christian Care Ministry of Melbourne, Fla., established in 1993.  Advocates estimate the market for the ministries to be as large as 11 million nationwide, attracting Christians in search of affordable coverage who believe they are obligated to carry the health care burdens of one another.  Critics say people who rely on these ministries do not have regulatory protection available to the traditionally insured.  \"Since there is no oversight of sharing ministries, there likely is no outlet for consumers to appeal,\" said David Gonzales, executive director of the Texas Association of Health Plans.  Samaritan, Medi-Share and a third ministry, Christian Healthcare Ministries in Barberton, Ohio, require prospective members to attest to being Christians and living Christian lifestyles and abstaining from tobacco, alcohol and drug use and sex outside of marriage.  Health-sharing ministries appear to operate much like insurers did before the Affordable Care Act's passage, keeping costs low by denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and setting benefit caps, said Elena Marks, president and CEO of Houston's Episcopal Health Foundation, a charitable organization and not a health-sharing ministry.  Since 2009, there's been a little uptick in membership.  The Rev. Howard S. Russell, president and CEO, said in an email that membership has grown about 45 percent since the health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act opened.", "vf": {"section": "business", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-5706783"}, "author.name": "By Lora Hines", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "Every month, Nikki Bratton and her husband, Stephen, a pastor, contribute $400 toward someone else's medical expenses in lieu of paying for insurance coverage for themselves and their seven children.
