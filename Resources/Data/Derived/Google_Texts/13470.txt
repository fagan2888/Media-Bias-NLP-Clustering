SACRAMENTO --

American Red Cross kicked off its home fire preparedness campaign event, Goal 1000, in Sacramento Saturday morning.

The organization teamed up with Sacramento Metro Fire and Sacramento City Fire Departments to canvas more than 35 Sacramento region neighborhoods. The goal was to install 1,000 new smoke alarms in homes in one day free of charge. According to Lilly Wyatt with Red Cross, they were able to install just over 500 alarms.

Research from fire officials helped the Red Cross pick the neighborhoods to go to. The areas chosen are prone to house fires.

One neighborhood focused on was in the area of Agitha Way. Miguel and Debbie Lachica were surprised Saturday when Red Cross knocked on their door, but after replacing two non-functioning smoke alarms, they said they were very thankful for the opportunity.

"Having these free alarms installed in your house is a great service," said Debbie.

Chris Dargan with Metro Fire said he sees an increase in house fires during the holidays because of Christmas trees, decorations and cooking. He said working smoke alarms will help people get out of their house during a fire before it's too late.

The Red Cross does smaller canvassing events around Sacramento, but according to Wyatt, Saturday's event was the largest one they have done here.

Volunteers and officials will hit the streets of Sacramento again on January 16th.
