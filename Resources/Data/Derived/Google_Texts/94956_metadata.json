They found that for nurses with caseloads of at least 10 patients, risk of patient death is 20 percent higher than for patients whose nurses have caseloads of six or fewer. Ball and her team further found increasing the number of available healthcare assistants rather than nurses had no effect on the mortality rate.\n\nThe results, Ball told the Telegraph, demonstrate why hospital leaders should prioritize patient safety over their bottom lines. \"When determining the safety of nurse staffing on hospital wards, the level of registered nurse staffing is crucial; hospitals with higher levels of healthcare support workers have higher mortality rates,\" she said. \"Patients should not be asked to pay the price of receiving care from a less skilled and less educated member of staff, just to make up for the failure of the system to ensure enough registered nurses.\"\n\nThese results back up similar research conducted in the U.S., including a 2013 study that found nursing staff ratios directly affect readmissions at pediatric hospitals. Nurses in several states, including New Jersey, Minnesota and Oregon, have lobbied extensively to impose mandatory nurse-to-patient ratios, while opponents of such measures have argued hospitals can achieve similar improvements at lower cost, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the Telegraph article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFrom coast to coast, nurses push for staffing level legislation\n\nNurses afraid to speak out about dangerous staff shortages\n\nNursing staff ratios directly impact pediatric hospital readmissions\n\nNurse-patient staffing ratio study returns insufficient data\n\nHospitals, nurses clash on staffing ratios", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nurse advocates have long argued that improved staffing ratios boost patient safety, and a new study published in the British Medical Journal backs that up, finding that patients are at much higher risk of death when their nurse is responsible for more than six patients at once.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Nurse advocates have long argued that improved staffing ratios boost patient safety, and a new study published in the British Medical Journal backs that up, finding that patients are at much higher risk of death when their nurse is responsible for more than six patients at once.", "title": "Short-staffing of nurses hikes patient mortality by 20 percent", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/short-staffing-nurses-hikes-patient-mortality-20-percent/2016-02-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,mortality rates,National Health Service,Nurse Staffing,nurse staffing ratios,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The results, Ball told the Telegraph, demonstrate why hospital leaders should prioritize patient safety over their bottom lines.\nThey found that for nurses with caseloads of at least 10 patients, risk of patient death is 20 percent higher than for patients whose nurses have caseloads of six or fewer.\n\"When determining the safety of nurse staffing on hospital wards, the level of registered nurse staffing is crucial; hospitals with higher levels of healthcare support workers have higher mortality rates,\" she said.\nBall and her team further found increasing the number of available healthcare assistants rather than nurses had no effect on the mortality rate.\nThese results back up similar research conducted in the U.S., including a 2013 study that found nursing staff ratios directly affect readmissions at pediatric hospitals."}
