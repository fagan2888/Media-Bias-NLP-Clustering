MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell challenged Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Bobby Mook ahead of Thursday's Democratic debate to defend the Democratic candidate's presence on a Verizon picket line. How can she have the audacity to stand with the striking employees, Mitchell asked, if she has accepted over $225,000 from the company?

"Time and again in her career, Hillary Clinton has stood with people against powerful interests," Mook insisted.

The MSNBC anchor gave Mook a second chance to explain Clinton's hypocrisy. He again deferred a straight answer, this time changing the subject to Bernie Sanders' Senate campaign that was funded by the NRA.

Mitchell tried a third time, only to get a recycled answer.

Bernie Sanders' presence with the picketers, meanwhile, has not been questioned. Even before the strikers started striking, the Vermont senator was defending their cause, arguing how Verizon has mistreated its employees.

At Thursday's debate, Sanders and the CNN moderators pressed Clinton to release the transcripts of her Wall Street speeches. She said she would do so once all the other candidates release theirs, making voters wonder, what is she hiding? Her corporate interest ties have already hurt her image with liberal voters.

It's no wonder Sanders is described as a "man of the people," while Clinton's favorability ratings keep dropping.
