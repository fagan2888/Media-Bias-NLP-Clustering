Naturally, the individual mandate tax isn't being called the individual mandate tax. Instead, it's creepily being called the \"shared responsibility tax.\" In other words, \"you need to pay for other people's healthcare so Obamacare won't collapse\" or \"other people's health problems are now your problems, time to pay up.\" Americans for Tax Reform has the details:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Internal Revenue Service today quietly released a series of Obamacare \u201cHealth Care Tax Tips\u201d warning Americans that they must obtain \u201cqualifying\u201d health insurance \u2013 as defined by the federal government \u2013 or face a \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d when filing their tax returns in 2015. The term \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d refers to the Obamacare individual mandate tax, one of at least seven tax hikes in the healthcare law that directly hit families making less than $250,000 per year.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cFour Tax Facts about the Health Care Law for Individuals\u201d the agency writes:\n\n\n\nYour 2014 tax return will ask if you had insurance coverage or qualified for an exemption. If not, you may owe a shared responsibility payment when you file in 2015.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Individual Shared Responsibility Payment- An Overview\u201d the agency warns Americans they must prove they were covered each and every month of the year:\n\n\n\nFor any month in 2014 that you or any of your dependents don\u2019t maintain coverage and don\u2019t qualify for an exemption, you will need to make an individual shared responsibility payment with your 2014 tax return filed in 2015.\n\nWhat this means is the IRS will be policing whether or not an individual has health insurance. If they don't, they must pay the tax. The IRS will also be looking at who has \"Cadillac\" health plans for further taxation.\n\nMy next bumper sticker: honk if I'm paying for your healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS is reminding people that the individual mandate still exists and that it must be paid and submitted with tax returns in 2015..05/24/2016 1:17:13AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The IRS is reminding people that the individual mandate still exists and that it must be paid and submitted with tax returns in 2015.", "title": "- IRS: Don't Forget to Pay Your Obamacare Tax With Your Tax Return Next Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/02/26/irs-dont-forget-to-pay-your-obamacare-tax-with-your-tax-return-next-year-n1800712", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/56/24fd6d36-d16a-47ca-9216-1b96bffdf5ab.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The IRS is reminding people that the individual mandate still exists and that it must be paid and submitted with tax returns in 2015.", "title": "- IRS: Don't Forget to Pay Your Obamacare Tax With Your Tax Return Next Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/02/26/irs-dont-forget-to-pay-your-obamacare-tax-with-your-tax-return-next-year-n1800712", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/56/24fd6d36-d16a-47ca-9216-1b96bffdf5ab.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "IRS: Don't Forget to Pay Your Obamacare Tax With Your Tax Return Next Year, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1301\"", "article_summary": "Naturally, the individual mandate tax isn't being called the individual mandate tax.\nInstead, it's creepily being called the \"shared responsibility tax.\"\nIf not, you may owe a shared responsibility payment when you file in 2015.\nThe term \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d refers to the Obamacare individual mandate tax, one of at least seven tax hikes in the healthcare law that directly hit families making less than $250,000 per year.\nThe IRS is reminding people that the individual mandate still exists and that it must be paid and submitted with tax returns in 2015."}
