The deal will create a healthcare system that will include 11 acute care hospitals, four specialty children\u2019s hospitals and several other facilities.\n\nThe proposed plan is part of a continuing trend of hospital mergers that have been taking place for years in the Garden State.\n\nAccording to Kerry McKean Kelly, the vice president of communications for the New Jersey Hospital Association, one of the goals of healthcare reform is \u201cto provide improved care at less cost, and you can accomplish that by working together in a larger system of healthcare where you can better coordinate care under one umbrella.\u201d\n\nShe said financial pressures in healthcare today is a major factor that\u2019s driving mergers.\n\n\u201cBeing part of a larger system can give a hospital a greater negotiating clout at the bargaining table when they\u2019re negotiating insurance contracts,\u201d she said. \u201cA merger can give a hospital access to something that it needs to improve its operations, it could be more capital to build and modernize, it could be a new service line.\u201d\n\nMcKean Kelly said many times when hospital mergers take place, \u201cpatients will enjoy easier access to the broader benefits of a larger system, so that could mean individual services in the hospital, it could mean certain specialists. There are many new services that could be brought to the fore as part of a larger system.\u201d\n\nShe also said sometimes hospital mergers can increase the flow of research dollars, especially when it involves larger academic medical centers.\n\n\u201cIf you bring those together in a larger system of care and they can increase their research capabilities, then I think there\u2019s the potential for them to draw in more grant dollars and research money,\u201d she said.\n\nAs to whether hospital mergers save patients money, she said there are differing opinions.\n\n\u201cThere would be some that would suggest less competition could lead to increased cost, but others would say that efficiencies and other potential benefits of mergers could help reduce costs,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to McKean Kelly, in some instances hospital mergers have saved struggling hospitals that might have been on the verge of closing.\n\nShe also noted the merger trend doesn\u2019t mean New Jersey residents won\u2019t be able to get the same individualized care they\u2019re used to.\n\n\u201cYou might become a larger organizational structure, but it remains most important to be that local community hospital that\u2019s always available 24/7 focused on patients first,\u201d she said. \u201c(In New Jersey) we still do have a number of hospitals that have remained independent and they are successfully going it alone, so there is no one right way to do this.\u201d\n\nAnother merger that was recently approved by the Christie administration will bring together two other hospital systems in the Garden State: shore-based Meridian Health and Raritan Bay Medical Center in Middlesex County. The deal will bring Meridian\u2019s coverage farther north, from Monmouth and Ocean counties into Middlesex County.\n\nThe NJ Department of Health and the Attorney General\u2019s office spent at least eight months reviewing the proposed plan before it was approved. Meridian is also waiting for approval to merge with Hackensack University Medical Center.\n\nAccording to a recent NJ Advance Media article, many hospitals in the state have scrambled to form merger since the Affordable Care Act was proposed in 2009. Hospital CEOs across the country began considering mergers when fears began to arise about the loss of Medicare funding that was used to fund Obamacare. The law urges healthcare facilities to take emphasis away from costly inpatient services and instead shift the focus to outpatient care and preventative medicine.\n\nIn a 2012 report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that analyzed hospital consolidations throughout the country, researchers found that hospital consolidation \u2013 at least in some areas of the country \u2013 resulted in higher costs to patients. The report also showed that \u201chospital competition improves quality under an administered pricing system.\u201d\n\nToniann Antonelli contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2016/01/RS6264_154202749%281%29.jpg", "sailthru.author": "davidmatthau", "description": "The New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office is expected to soon approve a proposed merger that will ultimately create the state's largest hospital chain.", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey 101.5", "description": "The New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office is expected to soon approve a proposed merger that will ultimately create the state's largest hospital chain.", "title": "What do NJ's recent hospital mergers mean for patients?", "url": "http://nj1015.com/what-do-njs-recent-hospital-mergers-mean-for-patients/", "image": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2016/01/RS6264_154202749%2525281%252529.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nj1015", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-18 22:54:24", "sailthru.title": "What do NJ\u2019s recent hospital mergers mean for patients?", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-wkxw, tsmmarket-trenton, tsmtype-local, hospitals, newsletter, health, new-jersey-news, anycategorynews", "fb": {"admins": 100002025987268, "app_id": 309166499099898}, "keywords": "hospital mergers, obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office is expected to soon approve a proposed merger that will ultimately create the state's largest hospital chain.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2016/01/RS6264_154202749%281%29.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "article_summary": "As to whether hospital mergers save patients money, she said there are differing opinions.\nThe proposed plan is part of a continuing trend of hospital mergers that have been taking place for years in the Garden State.\nAccording to McKean Kelly, in some instances hospital mergers have saved struggling hospitals that might have been on the verge of closing.\nThe deal will create a healthcare system that will include 11 acute care hospitals, four specialty children\u2019s hospitals and several other facilities.\nThe New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office is expected to soon approve a proposed merger that will ultimately create the state\u2019s largest hospital chain."}
