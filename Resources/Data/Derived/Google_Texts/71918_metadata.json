In particular, Mills declared that the \u201cdisaster\u201d of Obamacare has caused some medical insurance premium costs to surge by 30 percent in his area.\n\nPeople seem to think that Mills, 42, resembles the A-List actor in his long-hair, World War Z phase, according to Politico, although politically the two men probably aren\u2019t a match:\n\n\u201cMills, with his jaw-length blond locks and muscular physique, has been compared to the heartthrob movie star by everyone from a national party official to adoring teenage girls. And if it seems a little trivial and objectifying \u2014 he is, after all, running in one of the more closely watched, competitive House races in the country \u2014 Mills doesn\u2019t mind\u2026 Mills is courting conservative working-class Democrats and rallying the base by campaigning as socially conservative \u2014 he opposes abortion rights and staunchly favors gun rights \u2014 and pro-jobs. And he\u2019s trying to capitalize on frustration with Obamacare by fashioning himself as a health care expert, pointing to his experience overseeing the health care plans at his company.\u201d\n\nMills is also an advocate for domestic violence victims.\n\nThe first-time and somewhat unconventional candidate says he was inspired to run for federal office because of the so-called hunting camp doctrine:\n\nThe first time I went hunting with my dad, I complained about the food. He took me aside. He said, \u2018Let me tell you how this works. If you complain about the food, you get the job to be the cook.\u2019 So that\u2019s the hunting camp doctrine. If you complain about something, you get the job to fix it. And I\u2019ve been complaining about our abnormally high unemployment in our part of Minnesota and also what Obamacare is doing \u2026 we are paying more and getting less\u2026\u201d\n\nMills is campaigning for Congress on a platform of job creation and real healthcare reform among other issues.\n\nAnother Brad Pitt lookalike, Doug Pitt (the actor\u2019s younger brother) created some buzz last year by appearing in a series of commercials for Virgin Mobile Australia.\n\nDo you see a physical resemblance between movie star Brad Pitt and U.S. House of Representatives hopeful Stewart Mills?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A businessman said to be a Brad Pitt lookalike is running for Congress this year.
