The country is one big pothole right now.\u201d\n\nRelated: The U.S. Still Won\u2019t Invest In 21st Century Infrastructure\n\nA new construction season is upon us after a brutal winter that left huge potholes and crumbling highways and bridges in its wake. Yet state officials across the country are reluctant to sign off on new projects without the certainty that federal dollars will continue to flow into their programs.\n\nLaHood, a former Republican representative from Illinois who served in the Obama Cabinet, is co-chair of Building America\u2019s Future, a bipartisan coalition of elected officials seeking increased investment in the nation\u2019s sagging infrastructure. In its most recent report card, the American Society of Civil Engineers put the U.S. infrastructure spending gap at $125 billion a year just to maintain and repair highways and bridges. It gave the nation\u2019s infrastructure a D+ and pointed to a tremendous backlog and desperate need for modernization.\n\nRelated: Governors Join Obama in Infrastructure Spending Plea\n\nFor the most part, Republican and Democratic lawmakers and the White House have been flailing for more than a year in search of agreement on a new long-term transportation and infrastructure program \u2013 and more important, how to pay for it. But the politicians and policymakers appear as far from the finish line as ever.\n\nA May 31 deadline is looming for expiration of the temporary funding approved before last November\u2019s election that is keeping the federal Highway Trust Fund from going broke. There has been plenty of talk about major new initiatives and creative financing mechanisms to get beyond traditional reliance on the federal gasoline tax \u2013 but nothing seems to be gaining traction.\n\nAnd President Obama has repeatedly bemoaned what he views as this country\u2019s second-rate infrastructure programs when compared with those of China and other global economic rivals. \u201cIf they [China] need to build some stuff, they can build it. And over time, that wears away our advantage competitively,\u201d the president said in a speech to business leaders last December.\n\nRelated: Obama Says China\u2019s Infrastructure Puts the U.S. to Shame\n\nLast month, China persuaded 57 countries, not including the U.S., to join its new $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) \u2013 a major victory that upstaged Obama and the World Bank.\n\nShort of a miraculous turnabout in talks in the next couple of weeks, experts say, Congress will likely do what it does best: kick the can down the road and approve another short-term fix.\n\n\u201cThere really are no developments on the Hill to follow,\u201d LaHood said. \u201cNobody is doing anything. The House wasn\u2019t even in session this week, and there\u2019s just nothing happening. The Senate was in, but they were obviously working on other things, like passing the Iran nuclear bill, which is an important thing.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats echoed LaHood\u2019s concerns but blamed the problem on the new Republican leadership of Congress.\n\n\u201cOur friends on the other side of the aisle haven\u2019t issued a peep about what to do about it,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said at a news conference on Thursday, according to The Washington Post. \u201cPlease tell us how you intend to avoid a highway shutdown.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Winter Ravaged Roads and Bridges Need a Gas Tax Makeover\n\nSen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-MD) fretted that the summer highway construction season has been launched and yet scores of construction projects in his state are being threatened by a lack of fresh funding. \u201cEvery one of these projects requires a long-term partnership with the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer, Cardin and others asserted that the current temporary levels of spending should be expanded to the level that the White House suggested last month in its six-year, $78 billion transportation plan.\n\nIf the president\u2019s proposal prevailed, it would boost annual spending by about $25 billion, according to the Post. But the bills under consideration by House and Senate Republicans would keep funding near the current level of about $50 billion a year.\n\nPrecisely how much should be spent and where to find the funding remains the unsolved mystery.\n\nRelated: How Tax Reform Could Help Save U.S. Infrastructure\n\nLast summer, when the Highway Trust Fund faced insolvency because of slumping federal gas tax revenues, Congress intervened at the last minute and shifted $10.8 billion from the general fund to keep the highway fund from going bankrupt. The trust fund is financed strictly with revenues from 18.4 cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline, which has not been raised in more than 20 years and is not adjusted for inflation.\n\nLaHood and many state transportation officials and business groups favor a simple boost in the gas tax by as much as 10 cents per gallon. But others have different ideas.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chair Paul Ryan (R-WI) has said he is exploring ways to generate billions of dollars in fresh revenues needed to prop up the Highway Trust Fund through comprehensive tax reform.\n\nObama for his part has proposed a one-time, 14 percent tax on nearly $2 trillion of foreign earnings as a way to fund infrastructure projects. Major American companies are supposed to pay a 35 percent tax on overseas earnings, but many avoid that by using a legal loophole that allows them to keep the earnings in other countries indefinitely.\n\nObama and many on Capitol Hill have come to the conclusion that a strict reliance on the federal gas tax and periodic shifts in federal funds to keep the federal highway program operating no longer is an option. They believe the best funding solution is to restructure the corporate tax system to generate fresh revenues.\n\nRelated: Obama Wants Long-term Infrastructure Plan, Not Keystone\n\nUntil there is a meeting of the minds in Washington, state officials and highway advocacy groups will be nervously awaiting a decision.\n\n\u201cClearly states are having to be very careful now because until funding is put in place beyond May 31, they can\u2019t make any assumptions,\u201d explained Rocky Moretti, director of policy and research for TRIP, a private non-profit transportation research organization. \u201cUnfortunately, they have to be very conservative at a time when there are significant needs \u2013 both with declining pavement conditions and significant numbers of structurally deficient bridges.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he said, vehicle travel that was stagnant throughout the Great Recession is finally beginning to pick up again. \u201cSo the transportation needs are mounting just as the federal transportation spigot potentially could be turned off on May 31,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a champion of highways and infrastructure,", "title": "Congress Likely to Kick the Can Down America\u2019s Potholed Road", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/10/Congress-Likely-Kick-Can-Down-America-s-Potholed-Road", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04062012_Money_Bridge_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/10/Congress-Likely-Kick-Can-Down-America-s-Potholed-Road", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04062012_Money_Bridge_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a champion of highways and infrastructure,", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo the transportation needs are mounting just as the federal transportation spigot potentially could be turned off on May 31,\u201d he said.\nA May 31 deadline is looming for expiration of the temporary funding approved before last November\u2019s election that is keeping the federal Highway Trust Fund from going broke.\nSchumer, Cardin and others asserted that the current temporary levels of spending should be expanded to the level that the White House suggested last month in its six-year, $78 billion transportation plan.\nShort of a miraculous turnabout in talks in the next couple of weeks, experts say, Congress will likely do what it does best: kick the can down the road and approve another short-term fix.\nObama for his part has proposed a one-time, 14 percent tax on nearly $2 trillion of foreign earnings as a way to fund infrastructure projects."}
