Frank, Massachusetts Democrat, helped defeat Bush administration proposals to rein in the two federal loan giants. The housing market crashed in 2008 on thousands of bad subprime home loans, triggering the Great Recession, from which this nation still has not recovered.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to roll the dice again. According to the 5-4 majority opinion at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, housing lawsuits based on race no longer need proof of intentional discrimination.\n\nIn other words, even defendants with no racist intent can be sued for racist outcomes if a plaintiff can prove \u201cdisparate impact.\u201d That\u2019s when a race-neutral policy results in negative outcomes for an identifiable minority.\n\nIn a 2007 school districting case involving Seattle and Louisville, and in a 2009 case over merit testing of firefighters in New Haven, Conn., the court had chipped away at reverse-racial remedies, with Chief Justice John Roberts noting in the 2007 ruling that, \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s Thursday ruling in the housing case, which no doubt prompted toasts in the White House along with Justice Roberts\u2019 second major opinion upholding Obamacare, came courtesy of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nThe \u201cswing\u201d justice joined the court\u2019s four liberals in blessing disparate impact in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project.\n\n\u201cIt permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote, handing the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other liberal groups a new, loosely defined weapon to accuse someone of racism absent credible evidence.\n\nOnce again, nothing escapes Justice Kennedy\u2019s infamous \u201canimus\u201d detector. (See Lawrence v. Texas and Romer v. Evans.)\n\nA friend of the court brief in the Texas case filed by the American Civil Rights Union states: \u201cThe plain text of the Fair Housing Act prohibits only intentional discrimination, and cannot be construed to provide for disparate impact liability. Indeed, that plain text can only be read to unambiguously preclude disparate impact liability.\u201d\n\nWell, what do words mean anyway, to paraphrase Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s acidic comment in his Obamacare case dissent?\n\nCombined with a renewed effort by liberals to once again loosen credit qualifications for federally backed housing loans to minorities, a perfect storm may again be brewing.\n\nHousing Bubble 2.0, anyone?\n\nIf you want a case study in how liberals create catastrophic problems, blame others, and then offer the same lethal \u201ccures,\u201d check out a just-released study on housing and race. Commissioned by the ACLU, the 34-page \u201cImpact of the U.S. Housing Crisis on the Racial Wealth Gap Across Generations\u201d gets it backward.\n\n\u201cThe financial crisis was sparked by a housing market collapse that had its roots in racial discrimination,\u201d say Social Science Research Council authors Sarah Burd-Sharps and Rebeccah Rasch. \u201cIt resulted in mass foreclosures that impacted racial minorities with disproportionate ferocity.\u201d\n\nWell, yes, blacks constitute a greater percentage of the poor, and the poor are hurt more than anyone by economic downturns. It\u2019s also true that more of black families\u2019 wealth is tied up in housing equity, which is why they got hit harder by the housing market crash. The government has no business making them more vulnerable to unscrupulous lenders who saddle them with inflated interest, balloon payments and other conditions that often result in foreclosures.\n\nPassed by Congress in 1977 and signed by President Jimmy Carter, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) put a gun to the head of bankers to offer home loans to people they knew could not afford to pay them back. It triggered lawsuits designed to weaken safeguards against bad loans.\n\nThe CRA got a retro-rocket boost during the Clinton administration, as related by former Fannie Mae chief credit officer Edward Pinto in a 2009 City Journal article: \u201cDuring the first 15 years of the act\u2019s existence, total announced commitments under the CRA totaled $9 billion. But starting in 1992, volume exploded. Over the next 16 years, from 1992 to 2008, announced CRA commitments totaled $6 trillion.\u201d\n\nAs a community activist in Chicago, Barack Obama \u201cwas a pioneering contributor to the national subprime real estate bubble, and roughly half of the 186 African-American clients in his landmark 1995 mortgage discrimination lawsuit against Citibank have since gone bankrupt or received foreclosure notices,\u201d the Daily Caller reported in 2012. \u201cAs few as 19 of those 186 clients still own homes with clean credit ratings.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the ACLU\u2019s report do the crucial roles played by the CRA, community activists and government regulators get a mention, other than a policy recommendation for regulators to once again loosen credit requirements.\n\nHave we learned anything from all of this?\n\n\u201cI hope by next year we\u2019ll have abolished Fannie and Freddie,\u201d Barney Frank told an interviewer in August 2010. \u201cIt was a great mistake to push lower-income people into housing they couldn\u2019t afford and couldn\u2019t really handle once they had it.\u201d\n\nBut they will probably do so again, since lenders may face a disparate impact lawsuit if they don\u2019t do it.\n\nIf Mr. Frank finally got it, why can\u2019t everyone else?\n\n\u2022 Robert Knight is a senior fellow for the American Civil Rights Union and a Washington Times contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember when Barney Frank insisted in 2003 that \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not in a crisis,\" and \"I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing?\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Remember when Barney Frank insisted in 2003 that \u201cFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not in a crisis,\u201d and \u201cI want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing?\u201d", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Supreme Court: Housing lawsuits charging discrimination no longer need proof", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/28/robert-knight-supreme-court-housing-lawsuits-charg/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/28/6_282015_b3-knig-housing-dic-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/28/6_282015_b3-knig-housing-dic-28201.jpg", "description": "Remember when Barney Frank insisted in 2003 that \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not in a crisis,\" and \"I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing?\"", "card": "summary", "title": "ROBERT KNIGHT: Supreme Court: Housing lawsuits charging discrimination"}, "Author": "Robert Knight", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Federal National Mortgage Association, Barney Frank, American Civil Liberties Union, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation"}, "article_summary": "According to the 5-4 majority opinion at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, housing lawsuits based on race no longer need proof of intentional discrimination.\nThe \u201cswing\u201d justice joined the court\u2019s four liberals in blessing disparate impact in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v.
