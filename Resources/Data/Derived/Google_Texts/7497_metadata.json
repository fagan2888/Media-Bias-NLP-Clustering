John Hickenlooper amid budget cuts in 2011, reopened Tuesday as a repurposed facility intended to aid the state\u2019s homeless population.\n\nAfter intense back-and-forths and political wrangling at the state Capitol this year, lawmakers passed a measure that appropriated funds to bus the state\u2019s homeless to the rural facility to receive substance-abuse support services, medical care and job training.\n\nA news release from Hickenlooper\u2019s office said the facility opened Tuesday to serve 14 homeless individuals, while a news release by House Democrats placed the total at 27.\n\nConfusion did not stop there.\n\nWhen asked for confirmation, Hickenlooper\u2019s spokesman, Eric Brown, confirmed the total at 14, though in a tweet Monday Roxane White, Hickenlooper\u2019s chief of staff, said 27.\n\nFort Lyon opening tomorrow with our first 27 folks. Helping Vets and people who are homeless. Visit during #PedalthePlains \u2014 Roxane White (@RoxPWhite) September 2, 2013\n\n\u201cThis project will give homeless veterans and others new opportunities,\u201d Hickenlooper said in a statement. \u201cThe men and women who go to Fort Lyon will learn the skills they need to get back on their feet.\u201d\n\nThe program is not limited to homeless veterans, and Fort Lyon\u2019s repurposing is part of Pathways Home Colorado\u2019s effort to become more strategic in preventing and ending homelessness, according to a news release.\n\nFacing a budget shortfall two years ago of more than $1 billion, Hickenlooper closed the prison to save the state cash \u2014 a move that killed about 200 jobs in Bent County, where poverty rates were hovering near 35 percent.\n\nLate last year, Hickenlooper\u2019s office asked the Joint Budget Committee to reserve about $6 million over the next two years to repurpose the sprawling campus to serve the homeless. But after committee members toured the facility Jan. 21, they rebuffed Hickenlooper\u2019s request and later voted unanimously against allotting funds in the state budget to the facility.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s staff worked closely with lawmakers to pass the plan that will cost taxpayer\u2019s about $3.9 million next year with increasing costs in the years to come.\n\nAccording to a news release from Hickenlooper\u2019s office, after at least one-year of residency at Fort Lyon, clients will be eligible to receive a Section 8 housing voucher from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to return to permanent housing in another community.\n\nThe facility is slated to hold 200 residents by next July.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased we were able to get the new Fort Lyon up and running in only three months,\u201d said Rep. Leroy Garcia, D-Pueblo, who was a leading lawmaker of the initiative. \u201cMy thanks to everyone in the Lower Arkansas Valley who worked so hard to make this happen.\u201d\n\nFollow Kurtis on Twitter: @kurtisalee", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Eric Brown,Fort Lyon,Gov.
