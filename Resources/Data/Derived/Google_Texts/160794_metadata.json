Never mind that it\u2019s not a federal mandate, \u201cIt was developed by the National Governors Association, through a panel led by Delaware Gov. Jack Markell (D) and then-Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (R).\u201d\n\nBUT OBAMA I tell you. He tells you what chair to sit in with ObamaCare and now he\u2019s taken hold of our minds by trying to educate Americans. Well, the far right isn\u2019t having it.\n\nMichelle Malkin tells us we are wrong not to be paranoid, for a national data base is being made for kids information (sorta like a Sarah Palin Death Panel, only less effective as a scare tactic due to her smaller platform), \u201cThey don\u2019t loathe anti-Common Core parents because these parents are \u201cparanoid.\u201d They fear them because \u201cparanoid\u201d is the political demagogue\u2019s word for active, alert, and well-informed.\u201d\n\nYes, if by \u201cwell-informed\u201d one means misinformed. It turns out that the data mining is voluntary and has nothing to do with Common Core. Also, like so many things the Right suddenly finds objectionable, it was going on long before Common Core.\n\nThe point of the story? Obama scares conservatives a lot and so now they hate education. Prepare to be inundated with \u201cnon partisan\u201d fear stories about Common Core.\n\nCommon Core is the new conservative Benghazi, IRS (insert crazed, planted scandal here). Conservatives are calling it \u201cObamaCore\u201d, in what some say is a reflection of their frustrated inability to repeal ObamaCare (something everyone but the conservative base knew was not going to happen, and the Republican leaders stoked those cheap flames of misinformed outrage).\n\nReid Wilson at The Washington Post explained on Tuesday that conservatives have introduced 100 bills to \u201cslow or reverse\u201d Common Core, \u201can 85 percent increase over the year before\u201d, even though their paranoia is unfounded.\n\nBack in October, PolitFact rated the mind control fear mongering claims \u201cPants on Fire\u201d. You see, Common Core is not even a curriculum. It\u2019s standards. \u201cDetermining the curriculum is left up to local school boards, districts, and teachers.\u201d So, it\u2019s sorta like mind control only not.\n\nIn a long \u201cguide to Common Core\u201d published by USNews on March 6th by Allie Bidewell, the person she uses to lead us through the Common Core maze is Rick Hess from The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI). She never tells the reader that the AEI is a private, conservative, partisan institution or that some AEI members were leading architects of George W Bush\u2019s public policy. Dick Cheney, John Bolton and former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz are associated with the organization \u2014 not exactly the folks many would want driving our education policies.\n\nRick Hess, who is an articulate scholar, also has a Wiki Page that was marked in January of this year as possible spam, \u201cThis article reads like a news release, or is otherwise written in an overly promotional tone\u2026\u201d And again, \u201cThis article contains wording that promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information.\u201d But heck, his page is up in time for him to be used as an \u201cnon partisan\u201d expert, as his Wiki page claims, so that\u2019s handy when you have a narrative to weave.\n\nHess, who is big on Libertarianish sounding things like \u201ceducational entrepreneurship\u201d and school \u201creform\u201d brought about by cost cutting (LOL), was the undisclosed conservative lens through which the public got to view the alleged demise of Common Core on USNews. Hess followed up his disguised policy push with a March 26 (today) article in the National Review that reads exactly like the conservative argument to ObamaCare.\n\nOn March 20, Hess argued in the National Review that Common Core wouldn\u2019t be an issue in the midterms and if the Tea Party really want to see something done, it will only happen if Tea Party candidates win out over establishment Republicans (very subtle Mr Hess), which he ended with this opportunity for alert Tea Partiers, \u201c\u2026 in this case, on how well (or poorly) the fancy new assessments work, on whether the public finds the test scores credible, and on whether parents find the homework and new lessons compelling.\u201d\n\nJust five days later, and voil\u00e0! Guess what was trending today (written Tuesday), the day after Indiana dropped out of Common Core? Via Yahoo:\n\nA Facebook update from a father frustrated with the Common Core math program at his son\u2019s school is making the Internet rounds after the father Jeff Severt expressed (via what looks like a kid\u2019s homework assignment) how convoluted the teaching approach is.\n\nHow did this note get noticed? Oh, it was posted to the \u201cPatriot Post\u201d Facebook Page and picked up by Glenn Beck. This isn\u2019t mentioned specifically in the article, but it is captioned thusly and the first link goes to Beck. The Patriot Post declares that the time is now for Americans (white Americans it seems) to decide whether to be slaves or freemen. This article is shared right next to a picture of a car with a bumper sticker reading, \u201cDoes your Obama sticker make you feel stupid yet?\u201d\n\nThe Patriot Post has been endorsed, according to their website, by Senator Rand Paul, Jim DeMint, and Dick Armey.\n\nThe Yahoo article notes, \u201cThe Facebook post (which by Tuesday had generated 4,400 likes, 4,300 shares, and 700 comments debating the issue) coincides with news that on Monday, Indiana became the first state to formally withdraw from the Common Core standards.\u201d\n\nSo the story was posted on Monday, the 24, just 4 days after Hess noted that Common Core\u2019s success or failure would be determined by factors like parents finding the homework compelling. It was written up in Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze on Monday the 24th, Yahoo on Tuesday the 25th, and it\u2019s trending by Wednesday the 26th.\n\nDO YOU GET IT YET? COMMON CORE IS HATED BY RANDOM PARENTS AND A WHOLE STATE JUST DROPPED IT. This is just like the proof that the IRS was \u201ctargeting conservatives\u201d (also debunked), which was provided by conservatives who had been found guilty of illegally assisting the GOP. (The media didn\u2019t feel you needed to know that last part.) Then followed a summer of lies, later debunked.\n\nIf you want to laugh before you cry, read that WaPo article. Wilson explains that this whole big to-do regarding Indiana\u2019s alleged \u201csovereignty\u201d being protected doesn\u2019t actually mean that they won\u2019t be using Common Core. Or Common Core principles. In fact the new standards look a lot like the old standards, it\u2019s just got a different name. Sort of like how Kentuckians love ObamaCare so long as it\u2019s not called ObamaCare. Wilson notes, \u201cThat\u2019s similar to the approach several other states are taking: Pass standards nearly identical to Common Core, but under a different name.\u201d\n\nThis is the moment when it\u2019s fair to say we are not actually discussing ideology or ideas. This \u201cdebate\u201d is about nothing other than a new way to mask a partisan poutrage over Obama having any power at all, under the guise of alleged objections to policies.\n\nThe issue here isn\u2019t whether Common Core is any good or not. Common Core is being pushed by the business community among others and it is not an Obama initiative. The issue is that the public is being duped again about the origins, partisan nature and purpose of the criticisms. And this set up looks a lot like the IRS set up, with coordinated timing of planted sources and claims, that taken together create a publicly accepted narrative that may or may not have any truth to it whatsoever.\n\nImage: From Patriot Post, later reposted on Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze and Yahoo", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives think President Obama has taken hold of their minds via Common Core, in his attempt to educate the country.
