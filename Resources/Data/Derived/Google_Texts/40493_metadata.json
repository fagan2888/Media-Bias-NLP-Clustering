Does Benito the Brilliant learn from his mistakes? Oh no. He claims even more executive power. And if we don\u2019t like it? \u201cSue me,\u201d he says. So much for the rule of law and statesmen serving the public interest. That\u2019s all so yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Keystone Cops in Congress give themselves a raise, take a full week off for July 4th, play games with travel expenses, exempt themselves from ObamaCare, \u2018investigate\u2019 96 scandals, and spend our money like drunken IRS agents on paid holiday.\n\nThe Weeping Speaker threatens to sue Benito for being Benito, then accepts an invitation to play a round of golf, proving again he is only interested in playing around. Benito, driving an agenda with wedge issues, knows the Weeping Speaker is putting poorly, but still insists on getting strokes. No matter how you slice it, polls indicate that people observing the game wish Benito would pound sand in the traps he sets for himself.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe fable of the consent of the governed: Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer want constitutional amendments to shut down free speech coming from conservatives and corporations. These clowns help orchestrate Benito\u2019s three-ring circus designed to distract you so they can steal your money, then destroy your liberty. The majority strongly opposes this government\u2019s economic policies; the majority opposes ObamaCare and same sex marriage. Do the power-mongers care? Nope. Crack a whip, direct the audience to another sideshow, promote the bearded lady, and stuff \u2018em full of government cotton candy, all the while talking preventive medicine.\n\nThe VA medical system is filled with corruption and mismanagement to the point that vets are dying waiting to see a doctor. What was once hailed a shining example of the efficacy of government healthcare is revealed as something of a slaughter house. Now we learn that over 10,000 applications for care met up with death panels. Vets who served with honor as volunteers survived combat only to face neglect and a fatal reception back home. This administration provides better healthcare, on our dime, to 90,000 new illegal immigrants flooding across the southern border. Troop morale and national security are not as important as promoting sodomy, dodging Benghazi, and campaigning against all forms of traditional decency.\n\n\u201cSo sue me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nPresident Benito promotes the \u2018honor\u2019 system, telling ObamaCare enrollees to provide accurate information to secure subsidies. The system is abused, adding billions in cost. He tells illegal immigrants to honor the \u2018honor\u2019 system and voluntarily comply with status hearings. It\u2019s never happened, and never will happen. When the leader, supposedly the one setting the example, exemplifies dishonor, then calls on others to be honorable, what else can you expect? Honor is dishonored from the top down.\n\nPerhaps the IRS will let us go on the \u2018honor\u2019 system? (But no such system for 85 million gun owners, eh Benito?)\n\nPerhaps Benito wants Hamas to go on the \u2018honor\u2019 system as he insists that Israel show restraint and turn over more land to serve as missile launch sites? Maybe we can ask ISIS, Assad, Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Taliban, and Al Qaeda to abide by an \u2018honor\u2019 system and make nice with the world? Making nice and distributing \u201cI\u2019d like to teach the world to sing\u201d CDs has released the dogs of war. Benito the vacuous creates vacuums filled by abhorrent terrorists.\n\n\u201cSo sue me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMost everyone with at least a half a brain and one eye open knows that economic Armageddon is right around the corner. Benito does everything possible to make sure it will be as damaging as possible. What does he want to talk about instead of dealing in economic realities? Raising the minimum wage, which will aggravate unemployment and bankrupt small business. Brilliant. It\u2019s like ignoring Katrina, then providing the people an umbrella, calling it good while you jet to Hawaii for another $4 million round.\n\n\u201cSo sue me.\u201d\n\nWhere are the Keystone Cops when you really need them?\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where are the Keystone Cops when you really need them?", "author": "Allan Erickson", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Where are the Keystone Cops when you really need them?", "title": "Obama Just Gave America The Middle Finger...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obamapointing.jpg", "height": 368}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/obama-just-gave-america-middle-finger/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Where are the Keystone Cops when you really need them?", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obamapointing.jpg", "title": "Obama Just Gave America The Middle Finger...", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-07T17:54:16-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Minimum Wage", "published_time": "2014-07-07T17:54:16-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack obama, illegal immigration, islam, minimum wage, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb04f\"", "article_summary": "He tells illegal immigrants to honor the \u2018honor\u2019 system and voluntarily comply with status hearings.\nBenito does everything possible to make sure it will be as damaging as possible.\nDoes Benito the Brilliant learn from his mistakes?\nPerhaps the IRS will let us go on the \u2018honor\u2019 system?\n\u201cSo sue me.\u201dAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowPresident Benito promotes the \u2018honor\u2019 system, telling ObamaCare enrollees to provide accurate information to secure subsidies."}
