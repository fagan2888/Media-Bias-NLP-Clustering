To not get fined. The NFL are on the opposite side of that curve, with the memes to prove this is getting a little bit ridiculous.\n\nIs this a witch hunt? Yes and now. The NFL has fined Brian Urlacher $100,000 in the past for wearing a hat during Super Bowl media events endorsing a company the NFL hasn\u2019t signed off on, so Lynch won\u2019t be the first to get fined for something like wearing a beast mode hat.\n\nBut it does feel as if the NFL has the hots for his money. He shows up to media events and simply says one sentence. Some find it funny, others find it disrespectful. but in any case, with the deflated balls slowly fading away from sight, Lynch\u2019s media \u201cantics\u201d are taking central stage.\n\nSo will he or won\u2019t he get fined?

He won\u2019t care so much.\n\nImages: Source", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "memes,nfl jokes,seattle seahawks,marshawn lynch", "msvalidate.01": "3EF31A54BDD2054ECFA3016840F8E64A", "fb": {"app_id": 253088684753848}, "description": "It seems that the main goal for Marshawn Lynch in the days leading up to the Super Bowl?
