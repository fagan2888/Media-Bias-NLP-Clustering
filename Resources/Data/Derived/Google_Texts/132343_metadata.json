Many of them believe Islam is inherently violent and some were convinced that Irving\u2019s mosque had harbored an illegal Shariah court\u2014a rumor that grew out of a voluntary mediation service for North Texas Muslims called the \u201cIslamic Tribunal.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, BAIR\u2019s event page for today\u2019s rally claims the Richardson-based Islamic Association of North Texas \u201chas a documented history of funding terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe News could find no such documentation, aside from false blog reports that the Richardson mosque was implicated in a famous terrorism trial.\n\nAnd BAIR spokesman David Wright\u2019s suspicions sounded more nuanced in an interview with The News.\n\nHe said that two people convicted in the 2008 Holy Land Foundation trial lived in Richardson, and that he wants authorities to investigate the city\u2019s major mosque.\n\nWright said he has been trying to meet with members of the mosque. He wants to open up their books to assure they are not actively funding terrorist organizations.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong in the end, fine: I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Wright said as he prepared for Saturday\u2019s demonstration. \u201cNobody really got hurt. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\n\nThe big deal, as critics see it, is the long-barreled guns BAIR\u2019s members bring to their protests \u2014 including their first rally outside the Richardson mosque in October.\n\nWright said the guns are only to protect his group from Islamic extremists who might act out violently if they see Islam being disrespected \u2014 similar to what happened in May in a foiled terror attack in Garland.\n\n\u201cI do not like the fact that it may scare children or that it may scare women,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI do not like that at all. I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d\n\nThe mosque\u2019s imam, Shpendim Nadzaku, looked on from a distance as television camera crews busied Wright and the other protesters Saturday afternoon. Nadzaku pondered Wright\u2019s words about the guns not being used to intimidate members of the mosque.\n\nImagine if a family in their own home saw a neighbor walking up and down their sidewalk with guns, Nadzaku said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to cause them to be alarmed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe imam didn\u2019t buy the self-defense explanation, either.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the police force is for,\u201d Nadzaku said the protesters\u2019 need for protection. \u201cWhen is it going to become this vigilantism where everybody decides to take the law into their own hands?\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, a car passed by the imam and a group of counter-protesters supporting the mosque. The driver honked. A passenger flashed a peace sign. Nadzaku held up two fingers in return.\n\nOn the other side of the road, the BAIR protesters had received a few one-finger salutes from driving onlookers, as well as loud, spoken vulgarities.\n\nA member of the mosque, who did not provide his name to The News, had engaged Wright in a debate on his own behalf as news cameras, photographers and reporters huddled around.\n\n\u201cNobody was listening to me two or three weeks ago \u2014 not one person,\u201d Wright said motioning to reporters around him. \u201cNow look, now look, now look how many people are now listening to me.\u201d\n\nTheir conversation continued. Wright reiterated his suspicions about the mosque. The mosque member asked to see proof of Wright\u2019s claims. Wright countered by asking for proof the mosque was innocent. They argued over refugee policy and BAIR\u2019s protest tactics.\n\nA few minutes later, cameras started clearing out. So did the armed protesters.\n\nCONDEMNATION IN DALLAS\n\n\n\nBAIR\u2019s first protest in Richardson didn\u2019t draw much attention. But the group\u2019s rally weeks later outside the Irving mosque made national news and was met by one of the suburb\u2019s largest spontaneous demonstrations.\n\nAs BAIR returned to Richardson today, a coalition of activists, churches and political groups gathered in Dallas to counter their message with the most organized demonstration since the Islam dispute began in North Texas.\n\nEndorsed by national organizations, religious groups and the Dallas County Democratic Party, the \u201cUnited Against Racism and Hate\u201d rally gathered in Fair Park at 1 p.m. and marched to the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center a few blocks away.\n\nBut even before the march began, participants faced some turmoil.\n\nThe march was originally advertised as a rally outside Irving\u2019s mosque \u2014 a counter-protest to a Ku Klux Klan group that had planned to come today.\n\n\u201cThat is the ultimate symbol of hate in the United States,\u201d said Alia Salem, who runs the local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim advocacy group.\n\nBut amid a flurry of media attention, the Klan moved its rally into 2016.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to continue on,\u201d Salem said. \u201cTo have an opportunity to oppose this continuous cycle of hate being hurled at the Muslim community.\u201d\n\nShe hoped to expand the movement even further \u2014 countering hate rhetoric against minority groups across the United States, and even pivoting into a political movement in the next round of city and state elections.\n\nMore than 500 had signed up to attend by early in the week \u2014 when Irving mosque officials asked them not to come.\n\nThe peace marchers hadn\u2019t asked the mosque if it wanted yet another demonstration during afternoon prayers, said Zia Sheikh, the Islamic Center of Irving\u2019s imam.\n\n\u201cThey have the good intention to stick up for us, but there has to be some level of respect,\u201d Sheikh said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our mosque to become a staging ground for rallies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re exhausted,\u201d Salem agreed.\n\nAfter a meeting several days ago with mosque officials, Salem and other rally participants worked out a last-minute shift to Dallas. No one knew how much the changes would hurt attendance.\n\nLOST AT HER OWN RALLY\n\n\n\nFive minutes after Saturday\u2019s peace rally was set to start, Tonya Cadenhead and Cody Lynch circled Fair Park, wondering exactly where it was.\n\nThey considered this a bad sign, as they had helped organize the event.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on then what does that mean for everybody else?\u201d Lynch wondered as Cadenhead stared into a map on her phone.\n\nThe two friends had put together last month\u2019s rally to support Irving\u2019s mosque, surprised as everyone else when it drew scores and national press.\n\nBut they had nearly pulled out of this week\u2019s followup after a confusion of last-minute venue changes and disagreements with the mosque.\n\nNow, holding peace signs against the wind in south Dallas, they couldn\u2019t find a single demonstrator and worried the sequel had backfired.\n\nAfter a quarter hour, a man in a pink checkered hat crossed their paths and pointed into the empty distance. \u201cIt\u2019s starting,\u201d he said.\n\nCadenhead and Lynch hurried ahead, groaning when a DART train blocked their path.\n\nBut when it passed, they saw another train march out of the park.\n\nHundreds had come: holding hands and umbrellas and hand-drawn signs. Christians from Irving and Muslims from Plano, marching past blocks of gawkers to huddle beneath a statue of Martin Luther King. Jr. on a carpet of turned leaves.\n\n\u201cThe hate isn\u2019t going to stop so we shouldn\u2019t let the rain stop us,\u201d a triumphant Salem yelled into the crowd.\n\nA man in the back beat a wooden spoon against a paper drum as the speakers took their turns. In between a pastor and a rabbi, Cadenhead got to say a few words.\n\nThe Starbucks barista turned fledgling social organizer said she had only wanted to comfort the Muslims in Irving after armed men came last month.\n\nNow, to cheers, she spoke of a \u201csnowball of a movement that\u2019s going to take over D-FW.\u201d\n\nHEALING IN IRVING\n\n\n\nLeft alone by the crowds, Irving mosque leaders have been inviting people from churches and synagogues across Irving to join them Sunday afternoon for a dialogue about faith \u2014 no reporters allowed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do away with this stereotype of \u2018everybody in Irving hates Muslims,\u2019 said City Council member Dennis Webb, who pastors a church and will host the \u201cOne Irving\u201d forum with nearly a dozen other faith leaders at the mosque.\n\n\u201cEven in my congregation \u2014 a predominantly African-American congregation \u2014 a lot of them share the same feeling and fears\u201d about Islam, Webb said. \u201cThat they\u2019re all terrorists. Stuff like that.\u201d\n\nWebb blamed Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne for \u201cstirring up the fears\u201d earlier this year, when she spread rumors of a Shariah court on TV, pushed a symbolic City Council vote to enforce the constitution, and later spread false reports that she had stopped Shariah in Irving.\n\nThe Shariah court myth has since joined claims that the Quran commands Muslims to murder nonbelievers and countless other rumors treated as fact in anti-Islamic circles.\n\nSo when Frank Joseph goes to the mosque on Sunday, the Irving rabbi plans to tell his neighbors how his friendships with Muslims have enriched him. And he hopes to correct misperceptions about the Quran by comparing its bloodier passages to the holy texts of his own religion.\n\nFor example, Joseph cited a biblical passage in which God tells King Saul to kill an entire tribe of people, including children \u2014 then punishes the king for not slaughtering them thoroughly enough.\n\n\u201cSomeone could look at the Old Testament and say the Jewish people believe in killing every last man, woman and child. But that\u2019s a complete distortion,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cThere\u2019s no correlation between that and how the Jewish people practice.\n\n\u201cJudaism has evolved over the past 3,000 years.\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t look at the Quran and say this is how Islamic people practice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL2Etd2Vla2VuZC1vZi1hbmdzdC1vdmVyLWlzbGFtLWd1bnMtaW4tcmljaGFyZHNvbi1tYXJjaGVycy1pbi1kYWxsYXMtYW5kLWEtcXVpZXQtY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLWluLWlydmluZy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Avi Selk", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "By Daniel Houston and Avi Selk Updated 5:30\u00a0p.m. This post will be updated through Saturday.
