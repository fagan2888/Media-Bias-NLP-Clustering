The gross domestic product rose during the third quarter at a revised 4.1 percent annual mark, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Commerce Department said yesterday.\n\nThe president also promised to take action in January on the findings of his advisory panel on U.S. government surveillance of phone and Internet communications, and said he\u2019s confident the National Security Agency hasn\u2019t been \u201csnooping\u201d on Americans. He also said he sees the possibility of a resolution with Iran on nuclear power, \u201cthe first time that we\u2019ve seen that in almost a decade.\u201d\n\nUps, Downs\n\nAs another national public opinion poll showed the president\u2019s job approval at the lowest point of his presidency - - a CNN survey published yesterday put his approval rating at 41 percent -- Obama said he is more concerned about maintaining progress on health care, jobs and other fronts.\n\nAsked if this was the worst year of his presidency, Obama told reporters: \u201cThat\u2019s not how I think about it. I have now been in office five years, close to five years. Was running for president for two years before that and, for those of you who cover me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.\u201d\n\nThe president said the botched rollout of the website signing people up for health insurance is his fault, yet said the program offers promise for many.\n\n\u201cThe health-care website problems were a source of great frustration,\u201d the president said. \u201cI now have a couple million people, maybe more, who are going to have health care on Jan. 1, and that is a big deal. That\u2019s why I ran for this office.\u201d\n\n\u2018Screwed It Up\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen it came to the health-care rollout,\u201d he said, \u201cthe fact is, it didn\u2019t happen in the first month, the first six weeks, in a way that was at all acceptable.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd since I\u2019m in charge, obviously we screwed it up.\u201d\n\nObama said he will act in January on the recommendations of an advisory panel suggesting changes in NSA surveillance. He\u2019ll decide which suggestions \u201cmake sense\u201d and which need further work, he said.\n\nThe Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, a five-member panel, offered 46 policy changes this week that would allow surveillance to continue while limiting worldwide collection of communications by the NSA.\n\nThe proposals, which Obama isn\u2019t obligated to adopt, are in response to a domestic and international backlash over the extent of U.S. surveillance exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. While promising changes, the president said he doesn\u2019t believe the NSA has abused its power.\n\nNot \u2018Snooping\u2019\n\n\u201cThe NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around,\u201d he said, while \u201cwe may have to refine this further to give people more confidence\u201d because of evolving technology.\n\nThe president also said \u201cthere is the possibility\u201d of a resolution to the dispute over Iran\u2019s nuclear development.\n\n\u201cThat has been a challenge for American national security for over a decade now, and that is getting Iran to, in a verifiable fashion, not pursue a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time we\u2019ve seen that in a decade.\u201d\n\nThe president attributed his decision not to attend the Winter Olympics Games in Sochi, Russia, to a busy schedule at home. Asked about his inclusion of gay athletes in the U.S. delegation to the games -- at a time when Russian policies toward homosexuals are attracting global criticism -- he said his delegation \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d\n\nThe White House said on Dec. 17 that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden wouldn\u2019t attend the Winter Games opening ceremonies on Feb. 7. The U.S. has had tense relations with Russia over foreign policy, human rights and Snowden, whom Russia has harbored since arriving there under U.S. indictment.\n\nObama said he is busy dealing with health care, the NSA surveillance and other issues in Washington.\n\n\u201cI would love to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be going to a lot of Olympic Games post-presidency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mark Silva", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama, citing an improving economy and the enrollment of 1 million people in his health-care plan, said the country was poised for a strong year in 2014.", "title": "Obama Cites Improving Economy Aided by Obamacare in 2014", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-21/obama-cites-improving-economy-aided-by-obamacare-in-2014", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ic01QrBZ_tV0/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Mark Silva", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Barack H Obama", "news_keywords": "Health,Barack H Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-21/obama-cites-improving-economy-aided-by-obamacare-in-2014", "parsely-title": "Obama Cites Improving Economy Aided by Obamacare in 2014", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-12-21T05:00:00.001Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "President Barack Obama, citing an improving economy and the enrollment of 1 million people in his health-care plan, said the country was poised for a strong year in 2014.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2013-12-21T05:00:00.001Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "President Barack Obama, citing an improving economy and the enrollment of 1 million people in his health-care plan, said the country was poised for a strong year in 2014.", "title": "Obama Cites Improving Economy Aided by Obamacare in 2014", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-21/obama-cites-improving-economy-aided-by-obamacare-in-2014", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ic01QrBZ_tV0/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama, citing an improving economy and the enrollment of 1 million people in his health-care plan, said the country was poised for a strong year in 2014."}, "parsely-post-id": "MY4URU6TTDSA01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ic01QrBZ_tV0/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d87\"", "article_summary": "Asked if this was the worst year of his presidency, Obama told reporters: \u201cThat\u2019s not how I think about it.\nObama said he is busy dealing with health care, the NSA surveillance and other issues in Washington.\nPresident Barack Obama, citing an improving economy and the enrollment of 1 million people in his health-care plan, said the country was poised for a strong year in 2014.\n\u201cI now have a couple million people, maybe more, who are going to have health care on Jan. 1, and that is a big deal.\n\u201cAnd I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America.\u201dThe president\u2019s remarks came amid signs the economy is growing."}
