There is room for debate about the size of the tax and about how the proceeds should be deployed. But there should be no doubt that, given the current zero tax rate on carbon, increased taxation would be desirable.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Gas Prices Drop, Gas Taxes Might Finally Rise\n\nSummers\u2019 call for a carbon tax came just a day after prominent Republicans discussed the possibility of an increase in the federal gas tax to shore up the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which will run out of money this May.\n\nThe tax has been at 18.4 cents per gallon, without being adjusted for inflation, for more than 20 years. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) has advocated raising that tax to match inflation by 12 cents over two years as a means of creating a dedicated source of funding \u2013 a sort of user fee \u2013 for the federal highway system. Appearing with Corker on Fox News Sunday, Sen. John Thune (R-SD), who will chair the Commerce Committee in the new Senate, said he couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of raising the tax.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we take anything off the table at this point,\u201d Thune said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize we have a problem and issue that we need a solution for and we need to look at all the possible ways [to] address the problem.\u201d\n\nCorker\u2019s proposed gas tax is less far-reaching than Summers\u2019 proposal, which presumably would hit all emitters of carbon, from cars to factories. Yet the fact that both sides are even considering a move is notable.\n\nRelated: Pope Francis to Rally Catholics Against Global Warming\n\nSummers\u2019 argument for a broader tax is largely economic. \u201cThat which is not paid for is overused,\u201d he writes. This applies to energy in the U.S. because the use of fossil fuels creates what economists call \u201cexternalized costs.\u201d When a driver burns a gallon of gas in his car, he is paying for all the costs of extracting and refining oil and delivering gasoline to a filling station. However, he is not contributing anything toward the remediation of the effects of air pollution caused, in part, by his own vehicle\u2019s exhaust.\n\nThe same argument applies to power plants that release damaging emissions or foul waterways. The full price of their operations is not reflected in their costs. A carbon tax would attempt to capture the currently externalized costs of burning fossil fuels \u2013 basically compensating broader society for the costs it now bears to the advantage of people and companies that use large amounts of carbon-emitting energy.\n\n\n\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nTo be sure, any increase in taxes at the producer level would ultimately find its way to the consumer. Economic pressures, however, cut both ways. Producers compete on price, and if one method of production or delivery becomes expensive, it should spur innovation to find cheaper alternatives. Consumers reward producers who offer lower cost by giving them more business, and cleaner energy becomes a competitive advantage.\n\nYet as Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed out on his blog Monday, a modest increase in the gas tax might be all that advocates of taxing carbon can reasonably hope for.\n\nRelated: States Are Spending More as Economy Improves\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s probably more realistic \u2013 or less unrealistic \u2013 given the makeup of the new Congress and where they are on taxes to think smaller and more targeted,\u201d wrote Bernstein, who has argued for raising the gas tax.\n\n\u201cA gas tax is, of course, also a tax on carbon, but a few cents a gallon (say a nickel/gallon a year phased in over three years) won\u2019t be felt by drivers either now or even down the road when gas prices go back up.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A former Treasury Secretary argues that low gas prices and continued declines in the cost of oil make this the ideal time to introduce a tax on carbon emissions.", "title": "Low Oil Prices Pave the Way for New Carbon Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/05/Low-Oil-Prices-Pave-Way-New-Carbon-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/north-dakota-oilprice_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/05/Low-Oil-Prices-Pave-Way-New-Carbon-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/north-dakota-oilprice_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A former Treasury Secretary argues that low gas prices and continued declines in the cost of oil make this the ideal time to introduce a tax on carbon emissions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2a8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWith the recent steep fall in oil prices and associated declines in other energy prices, it has become overwhelming.\n\u201cThe case for carbon taxes has long been compelling,\u201d Summers wrote.\nOn Monday morning, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a largely pro-business Democrat, published a column in The Washington Post calling for the imposition of a carbon tax.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationTo be sure, any increase in taxes at the producer level would ultimately find its way to the consumer.\nThere is room for debate about the size of the tax and about how the proceeds should be deployed."}
