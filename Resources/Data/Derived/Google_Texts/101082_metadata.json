These tales are entertainment for the outer party, just exhilaration as they boo the other tribe unless they motivate people to political action. {2nd of 2 posts today.}\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s class warfare, all right. But it\u2019s my class, the rich class, that\u2019s making war, and we\u2019re winning.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Warren Buffet, quoted in the New York Times Magazine, 26 November 2006.\n\nBrick by brick the New America slowly rises on the ruins of the Second Republic. As we see in this week\u2019s headline \u201cSenate passes Republican budget with deep safety net cuts\u201c. It\u2019s a full-court press to reconfigure the US government to benefit the 1%. Excerpt:\n\nThe Senate passed a Republican-authored budget plan early on Friday that seeks $5.1 trillion in domestic spending cuts over 10 years while boosting military funding. \u2026 which is similar to one passed by House Republicans on Wednesday. \u2026 They also showcase the fiscal vision for Republicans, who now control both Houses of Congress for the first time since 2006 and are eager to demonstrate their ability to govern. \u2026 The Senate budget seeks to eliminate U.S. deficits by 2025 without raising taxes through deep cuts to social safety net programs, investments in transportation and education and other domestic programs. At the same time, it proposes to boost defense spending by adding about $38 billion to an off-budget war funding account, and offers core Pentagon budget increases in subsequent years.\n\nThis is just the first step. We can expect more drastic measures in the future, shifting taxes from the 1% to us and cutting government benefits. The Hill explains (Note: block grants are a means to shift spending to the States, for easier slashing):\n\nA conservative budget released by the House Republican Study Committee (RSC) on Monday would balance in five years by cutting $7.1 trillion in spending over the next decade. \u2026 In fiscal 2016, it would give the Pentagon a $570 billion base budget, much more than the $523 billion the Pentagon would have under the House GOP budget. It would also meet President Obama\u2019s nearly $51 billion request for the Defense Department\u2019s war fund, known as the overseas contingency operations (OCO) account. \u2026 The RSC blueprint would lower nondefense discretionary spending for domestic programs next year to $405 billion, $88 billion below the baseline set by the 2011 deal. Altogether, discretionary spending next year would total $975 billion under the RSC\u2019s budget, much lower than the $1.018 trillion top-line number established by the 2011 law. Over the 10-year window, the RSC budget would cut nondefense spending by $1.3 trillion and increase defense spending by $435 billion. Between 2016 and 2025, the budget would reduce \u201cunnecessary mandatory spending\u201d by $1.7 trillion. This amount excludes cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The RSC plan would repeal ObamaCare through a budget tool known as reconciliation. \u2026 The conservative budget seeks the same sort of reforms to the tax code embraced by previous Ryan budgets but dropped this year by Price \u2014 like \u2026 reducing the top individual and corporate rates to 25%. It would also roll back tax increases won by President Obama, such as the hike to the top dividend rate from 15% to 20%. And it would make changes to programs like the earned income tax credit, a tax break for the working poor that Republicans believe has too much fraud. \u2026 the RSC budget would reform Medicare by 2020 by converting it to a premium-support system that would offer a range of coverage options to people born in 1955 or after. The plan would gradually phase in an increase in the eligibility age for those born in 1960 or after and would raise it by two months each year until the eligibility age reaches 67. The budget would also transform Medicaid by combining it with the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which expires later this year, and providing states with block grants. \u2026 For Social Security, the RSC blueprint would eventually raise the full retirement age to 70 and would impose chained consumer price index (CPI) for Social Security benefit calculations. The proposal, which Obama had offered in previous budgets and then dropped, would result in lower benefits. To address infrastructure issues, the budget calls for shifting the authority to state and local governments, and phase out the federal government\u2019s authority over five years. The plan also says Congress should lower the federal gas tax, which currently funds the Highway Trust Fund. To balance the budget through cuts, the RSC proposes eliminating or repealing a slew of government programs such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Election Assistance Commission, the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Labor Relations Board and a program that taxes Christmas trees. The plan would also reduce funding to the Environmental Protection Agency, the IRS and foreign governments.\n\nWhy do we vote these people into office?\n\nWhen Thomas Frank published What\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America (2005) I considered his explanation to be specious about why the people of Kansas voted against their economic interests. Time has shown that he was right and I was wrong. From the excellent review in The New Yorker:\n\nKansas, once home to farmers who marched against \u201cmoney power,\u201d is now solidly Republican. In Frank\u2019s scathing and high-spirited polemic, this fact is not just \u201cthe mystery of Kansas\u201d but \u201cthe mystery of America.\u201d Dismissing much of the received punditry about the red-blue divide, Frank argues that the problem is the \u201csystematic erasure of the economic\u201d from discussions of class and its replacement with a notion of \u201cauthenticity,\u201d whereby \u201cthere is no bad economic turn a conservative cannot do unto his buddy in the working class, as long as cultural solidarity has been cemented over a beer.\u201d The leaders of this backlash, by focussing on cultural issues in which victory is probably impossible (abortion, \u201cfilth\u201d on TV), feed their base\u2019s sense of grievance, abetted, Frank believes, by a \u201ccriminally stupid\u201d Democratic strategy of triangulation. Liberals do not need to know more about NASCAR; they need to talk more about money and class.\n\nFor More Information\n\nIf you liked this post, like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
