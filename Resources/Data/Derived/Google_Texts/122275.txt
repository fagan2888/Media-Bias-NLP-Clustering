Anyone who lived through the great debt-limit showdown of 2011 gets a pain deep in his gut when contemplating what’s next. Two years ago, Republicans refused to raise the debt limit unless they got concessions like spending cuts, spending caps, and a strict balanced budget amendment. Two years ago, Democrats negotiated, then walked away. An impasse that made everyone look like idiots ended with a compromise that made them look like … well, idiots. A select committee—nicknamed “the supercommittee”—was empowered to stop the next crisis.

That plan did not work.

Washington is now careening into another fight over the debt limit, with Republicans and Democrats basically at their old battle stations. The deficit’s shrinking, so Republicans talk less about debt than about delaying or defunding Obamacare. President Obama was re-elected, so Democrats are less fearful than they were in 2011. Otherwise, this showdown is playing out precisely the way it did last time.
