Cory Gardner, his Republican challenger, took place on Oct. 7, 2014, in the Denver Post Auditorium. Below are clips of each candidate\u2019s responses to each question. All video by Eric Lutzens, Hyoung Chang, Lindsay Pierce and Mahala Gaylord of The Denver Post. To improve load time, we\u2019ve put three videos on each of eight pages.\n\nMr. Gardner: You\u2019ve been accused of waging an eight-year battle to outlaw birth control. Please explain where you stand on birth control, including your positions on the IUD and the morning-after pill.\n\nMr. Udall: We know you support a woman\u2019s right to choose. But given the advances in the scientific understanding of fetal development, where pregnant mothers know at which week their babies grow fingernails and can swallow, would you support a ban on late-term abortions? And if so, at what week?\n\nSeparate questions for both candidates regarding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMr. Udall, you\u2019re up first. In your first Senate debate in 2008 when you were asked about health-care reform, you said, \u201cI\u2019m not for a government run-solution.\u201d You voted for the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded the government\u2019s Medicaid coverage for millions of low-income Americans. How is this not a government-run solution?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Abortion,Affordable Care Act,birth control,Cory Gardner,Denver Post debate,health insurance,ISIS,late-term abortion,Mark Udall,minimum wage", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Denver Post debate between U.S. Senate candidate Mark Udall, Democratic incumbent, and Rep.
