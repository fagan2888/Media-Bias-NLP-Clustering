(Photo: National Storm Prediction Center)\n\nHigh winds and gusts between 40 and 50 miles per hour Saturday caused power outages in the Louisville area through Sunday morning.\n\nLG&E reported just 153 customers in Jefferson County \u2013 less than 1 percent of its customers in the county \u2013 were without power as of 11 a.m. Sunday.\n\nDuke Energy reported 104 customers in Clark County and 31 in Floyd County were still affected Sunday morning.\n\nWind gusts peaked Saturday at 57 in Jefferson County, while counties across the river in Indiana saw gusts in the low 40s to mid-50s, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHigh winds loosened power lines and dropped them dangerously low over Interstate 265 in southwestern Metro Louisville Saturday, forcing police and firefighters to block the roadway in both directions between Bardstown Road and Billtown Road. The road was closed after reports poured in at 4:20 p.m. and Metrosafe dispatchers said there was no estimate on when the Gene Snyder would reopen.\n\nThe gusts also knocked out power to about 5,000 LG&E customers from Valley Station to LaGrange Saturday. The utility said that multiple outages affected Pleasure Ridge Park, St. Matthews and Prospect, mostly because of trees snapping and dropping on utility lines.\n\nKU also reported Lexington, Georgetown, Elizabethtown and other east-central Kentucky communities were hit with scattered outages.\n\nReporter Grace Schneider can be reached at 502-582-4082, or by email, gschneider@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1MKoRU1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Power restored to most by Sunday morning after winds cause outages from Valley Station to LaGrange", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Power restored to most by Sunday morning after winds cause outages from Valley Station to LaGrange", "title": "Power restored to most of Kentuckiana", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2016/04/02/high-winds-knock-out-power-around-metro-area/82561920/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Power restored to most by Sunday morning after winds cause outages from Valley Station to LaGrange", "title": "Power restored to most of Kentuckiana", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b30c049099160734d5aee26c6aa49f2816f9314/c=0-60-414-474&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/2016 in weather", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/2016 in weather", "title": "Power restored to most of Kentuckiana", "author": "Grace Schneider", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b73aa2933426ff97bbec8c8819d5ba247718ed6/c=7-0-408-534/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3d0c63279c9a759adec5266c19213cb4733b2d0/c=0-60-414-474/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/02688248afd5956723c5874769472310bdbad3c1/c=0-111-414-422/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/675b4ec28dcefe70dc986ac9306299c94322d28c/c=0-150-414-384&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-03T12:19:08.093000-04:00", "shorthed": "Power restored but still high winds today", "articleid": 82561920, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d745f72509562424d8cf2ff738d5fe068730929/c=0-150-414-384/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18620ced357c0cb2787f5e06ef9be2cab891bf9a/c=57-0-356-534/local/-/media/2015/12/22/Louisville/Louisville/635863798794425270-COnvectivemap.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "power outages, LG&E, weather, high winds, Grace Schneider"}, "article_summary": "LG&E reported just 153 customers in Jefferson County \u2013 less than 1 percent of its customers in the county \u2013 were without power as of 11 a.m. Sunday.\n(Photo: National Storm Prediction Center)High winds and gusts between 40 and 50 miles per hour Saturday caused power outages in the Louisville area through Sunday morning.\nThe gusts also knocked out power to about 5,000 LG&E customers from Valley Station to LaGrange Saturday.\nDuke Energy reported 104 customers in Clark County and 31 in Floyd County were still affected Sunday morning.\nThe area in yellow on this map contains Louisville, which is under a slight risk for severe weather Wednesday night."}
