The price of medical vaccines has soared in recent years, from single to triple digits in some cases, a worrying sign for doctors and public health budgets, according to the New York Times.

Childhood vaccines are considered vital to public well-being and they must be covered at no out-of-pocket cost under Obamacare.

But old vaccines have been reformulated and enter the market at much higher prices, while new vaccines are introduced at “once-unthinkable” prices.

Since 1986, the cost of vaccinating a child until age 18 under private insurance has shot from $100 to $2,192, according to the Times.

The federal government pays for about half of all children’s vaccines and its costs have increased 15-fold, the newspaper reports.
