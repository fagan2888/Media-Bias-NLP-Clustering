His experiences during those excursions \u2014 particularly a long wait for a doctor after an accident in Guyana \u2014 inspired him to create Remote Area Medical (RAM), a nonprofit that delivers medical care to people living in places often characterized as \u201cthe middle of nowhere.\u201d\n\nLess than 10 years after the group\u2019s inception, however, Brock\u2019s attention turned to the United States \u2014 where he saw that access to consistent, affordable medical care posed a challenge for millions of people living in the Appalachia, along the Southern poverty belt, and other low-income pockets of the country.\n\n\u201cThe United States has to find a way to help those who can\u2019t afford health care,\u201d Brock told ThinkProgress, pointing out that teeth and eyes are often the first to go among people who lack regular access to doctors. \u201cSeventy percent of the people who come to RAM\u2019s events come to get their teeth and eyes fixed.\u201d\n\nLater this month, Americans can get an inside look into one of those RAM events when the documentary Remote Area Medical hits movie theaters. The film focuses on a three-day pop-up clinic the nonprofit hosted in the rural community of Bristol, Tennessee in 2012. While the region is best known as the \u201cbirthplace of country music,\u201d the documentary doesn\u2019t focus on the town\u2019s contribution to the genre.\n\nInstead, viewers will get to meet some Bristol residents as they endure long waits in the cold to receive the eye care, dental care, medical exams, vaccinations, and follow-up care they desperately need but can\u2019t afford through conventional means.\n\n\u201cWe want to inspire people to volunteer for RAM but we also want people to see what it\u2019s like to live without health care,\u201d Farihah Zaman, Remote Area Medical\u2018s co-director, told ThinkProgress. \u201cStatistics are often divorced from reality because they don\u2019t show the faces of who it affects and why it happens. What\u2019s heartbreaking about this story is that the resources exist but they\u2019re not available to everyone.\u201d\n\nIn the film, more than 1,000 community members converge on the grounds of the Bristol Motor Speedway and Dragway and anxiously wait as a RAM volunteer passes out pink numbered slips that will grant them admission into the facility. For many of the residents featured, this visit would count as their first doctors\u2019 appointment in decades.\n\nThat makes the clinic\u2019s visit especially critical for Bristol residents, like one woman who\u2019s in a fight against time as her teeth degenerate. Another woman yelps in joy after receiving a pair of prescription glasses. An elderly man also schedules follow-up care for his newly discovered blood pressure problems. Later in the film, in what illustrates the public health issues at hand, a woman lights up a cigarette moments after learning that she could have lung cancer.\n\n\u201cEven if this was a culture where people don\u2019t do the healthiest things, people should still feel the empathy that we felt,\u201d \u201cRemote Area Medical\u201d co-director Jeff Reichert told ThinkProgress. Reichert and Zaman worked on the film after Reichert\u2019s aunt told them of her experiences as a volunteer at a RAM pop-up clinic in Tennessee. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting yourself in these people\u2019s shoes because it\u2019s not right that they can\u2019t get this care, even if it\u2019s self-inflicted. If you were a member of Congress, how would you know about what the people in these communities are going through?\u201d\n\nSince shooting for the film wrapped up in 2012, the national health care landscape has changed drastically, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. A recent New York Times analysis of enrollment data showed that the health care law has lowered the uninsured rate among those previously without coverage \u2014 including people of color, women, people living in low-income communities, and those with preexisting conditions. Today, many of those people can afford their health care costs, thanks in part to federal subsidies to purchase private insurance or federal assistance to enroll in public insurance.\n\nBut not much has changed for many people living in the Appalachia and parts of the Southern poverty belt. More than four years after President Barack Obama signed the landmark legislation into law, about four million people still don\u2019t have coverage due to state governors\u2019 reluctance to expand Medicaid to additional low-income people whose income falls between the current eligibility level and the state poverty line.\n\nThe states that have refused expansion had higher uninsurance rates to begin with, and are home to people who tend to be poorer and sicker than the residents in other states. To make matters worse, they\u2019re missing out on the federal funding designated for states that expand Medicaid, which has caused clinics and emergency rooms to close throughout rural areas of the United States. In turn, that has created more \u201cmedical deserts,\u201d or places where medical services aren\u2019t in close proximity.\n\nThat\u2019s why Brock has wasted little time in getting Congress\u2019 attention. During three different trips to the Capitol, he has recounted his experiences with RAM and railed against laws that prevent licensed health care professionals from working across state lines, which often worsens the doctor shortage in rural areas. The philanthropist\u2019s efforts played a part in 11 states changing their laws governing where doctors could practice. Earlier this year, Brock and other activists petitioned lawmakers to enact an \u201cOpen Border for Doctors\u201d law in Florida.\n\nSince Brock appeared before Congress, more than a dozen lawmakers have also made visits to RAM pop-up clinics. He said two visitors in particular \u2014 Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Harry Reid (D-NV) \u2014 expressed shock at what they saw and the stories they heard. Reid documented some of his experiences there in the congressional record.\n\n\u201cIn the May 22 congressional record, there\u2019s a whole page about RAM,\u201d Brock told ThinkProgress. \u201cSen. Corker was also easily taken aback by what he saw in the Appalachian and he has pledged to get something done. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has also been interested for years so I\u2019m becoming optimistic that [health care coverage for all Americans] might happen.\u201d\n\nEven if expanded Medicaid coverage were to reach every state, however, reducing the prevalence of chronic illnesses also depends on people\u2019s lifestyle choices. Throughout the Remote Area Medical film, Bristol community members can be seen enjoying cigarettes, fast food, and high-sugar drinks \u2014 the key causes of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nSo Brock has a surprise for those who visit future RAM pop-up clinics: short films about shopping and eating healthy.\n\n\u201cWe have a captive audience \u2014 more than 1,000 people waiting hours for a dentist appointment,\u201d Brock told ThinkProgress. \u201cStarting in 2015, we will show a series of movies about health, nutrition, and exercise. They\u2019ll be both informative and amusing. We want people to see that they have to take the time to shop smart if they want to be healthy.\u201d\n\nRemote Area Medical hits theaters in New York City on Nov. 28 and in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5th.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A new documentary gives Americans a peek into the impoverished communities where people are struggling to get the care they need.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A new documentary gives Americans a peek into the impoverished communities where people are struggling to get the care they need.", "title": "What Life Without Medical Services Is Like For Residents In Rural Towns", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/25/3596516/documentary-rural-health-access/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RAM-photo-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new documentary gives Americans a peek into the impoverished communities where people are struggling to get the care they need.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RAM-photo-2-321x214.jpg", "title": "What Life Without Medical Services Is Like For Residents In Rural Towns", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RAM-photo-2.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RAM-photo-2.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T09:05:12+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe139f\"", "article_summary": "Health What Life Without Medical Services Is Like For Residents In Rural Towns CREDIT: Remote Area Medical A scene from REMOTE AREA MEDICAL, directed by Jeff Reichert & Farihah Zaman.\nThroughout the Remote Area Medical film, Bristol community members can be seen enjoying cigarettes, fast food, and high-sugar drinks \u2014 the key causes of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\u201cIn the May 22 congressional record, there\u2019s a whole page about RAM,\u201d Brock told ThinkProgress.\n\u201cWe have a captive audience \u2014 more than 1,000 people waiting hours for a dentist appointment,\u201d Brock told ThinkProgress.\nInstead, viewers will get to meet some Bristol residents as they endure long waits in the cold to receive the eye care, dental care, medical exams, vaccinations, and follow-up care they desperately need but can\u2019t afford through conventional means."}
