Press\u2019 book is a reflection on all the ways President Obama failed to live up to his promises and his liberal-progressive potential, particularly on the issues of health care, gun control and climate change. While liberals and progressives may certainly agree that Barack Obama didn\u2019t quite deliver on many of his promises, one must wonder if Press isn\u2019t being a little too harsh.\n\nAppearing on HuffPost Live, Press said that the word he has most often heard from liberals and progressives (including Democratic members of Congress) is \u201cdisappointment.\u201d But is that all President Obama\u2019s fault? Press observes what other pundits have pointed out: \u201cWe tend to project our own hopes, desires and aspirations on the person we\u2019re supporting . . . we did that with Bill Clinton . . . and we did that with Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, liberals and progressives had (and continue to have) high hopes and expectations \u2013 particularly after thirty years of right-wing economic policy that have brought the middle class to its knees and continues to exacerbate poverty and hardship across the nation. But did we \u2013 and do we \u2013 expect too much?\n\nOn the other side of the equation, Press points out: \u201cI also think they over-promise . . . President Obama. He was going to make gun control [his] Number One priority from Day One . . . he didn\u2019t do anything about gun control for the first four years . . . he didn\u2019t do anything about immigration reform . . . he didn\u2019t live up to those promises.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe liberals tend to . . . never be satisfied . . . we\u2019ll demand a lot, and even if you do deliver, we\u2019ll probably say, \u2018What took you so long?\u2019\u201d\n\nPress is particularly critical of Obama in his failure to provide a \u201cpublic option\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was being debated. \u201cObamacare is as close to universal health care as we\u2019ve ever been \u2013 but it\u2019s still a hodgepodge and it is a big bonanza for private insurance companies. There\u2019s still 30 million Americans without health insurance . . . we still cannot negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.\u201d He criticizes President Obama for taking single payer off the table from the get-go, and not even fighting for the public option against a recalcitrant Congress.\n\nBill Press makes valid points. President Obama has made some serious errors during his presidency, including giving approval to oil companies for Arctic drilling operations, choosing a drug industry insider to head the FDA, and his questionable support for the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, we did expect a great deal from President Obama. After what we had been put through under Mad King George W.\u2019s Reign of Error, we needed someone to believe in \u2013 and too many of us expected Barack Obama to be a superman. President Obama has failed in a number of ways, but so did We The People. The Congress President Obama has had to work with has been resistant to virtually every idea the he has had. Because President Obama is (A) African-American, (B) a democrat, and (C) has a \u201cfunny, furrin-soundin\u2019\u201d name, he has received more abuse from the mainstream corporate media than any Executive before him. Yet, he continues to carry on with quiet class and dignity.\n\nIn the end, President Obama\u2019s failures are as much our own as they are his. It is something Press readily acknowledges: \u201cWhy did I write this book? The timing right now is a lesson that we have learned . . . we cannot elect another Progressive and then just sit back and expect them to do everything that we want them to do. We\u2019ve got to make them do it \u2013 we\u2019ve got to keep the pressure on.\u201d\n\nBill Press\u2019 statement recalls what President Franklin Roosevelt said to labor leaders when they presented him with their plans: \u201cI agree with you, I want to do it \u2013 now, make me do it.\u201d It is something that Bernie Sanders has noted when he reminded us that electing him President was not going to be enough. That is something the Press appreciates about Sanders and his call for \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d Press points out, \u201c[Bernie] says the next President can\u2019t sit there without rallying the American people.\u201d But he also adds, \u201cWe [the People] can\u2019t sit there and elect somebody without ourselves out on the streets \u2013 in front of the White House, in Congress . . . making sure the Progressive agenda is carried out.\u201d\n\nLet our experience with President Obama these past eight years be a lesson to us all. A President\u2019s failure to advance a Progressive agenda is not just on the shoulders of the person holding Executive office. In a representative democracy, the responsibility is on all of us.\n\nDemocracy is not a spectator sport.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "KJ McElrath", "og": {"site_name": "The Ring of Fire Network", "description": "Respected liberal talk show host and former California Democratic chairman Bill Press has a new book out, entitled Buyer\u2019s Remorse: How Obama Let Progressives Down.
