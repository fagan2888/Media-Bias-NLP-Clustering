First-time candidate Dominick Impastato won the Kenner City Council's 5th District seat in a landslide Saturday, defeating former Mayor Phil Capitano. They were the only two candidates running to succeed the term-limited Kent Denapolis.

Impastato ran an energetic, door-to-door campaign and had the backing of Mayor Mike Yenni. He helped write the Kenner 2030 strategic plan as part of Yenni's economic development committee.

On the council, Impastato figures to be an ally for the mayor. He said he wants to increase participation in recreation programs and civic associations. His foremost campaign pledge, however, was not policy related: He promised to maintain cooperation and professionalism on the council.

The more combative Capitano held the 5th District seat before winning a special election for mayor in 2004. He was defeated when he ran for the full term in 2006.
