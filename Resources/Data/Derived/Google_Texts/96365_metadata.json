Even Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre referred to that scenario during the week.\n\nEvidently, CU\u2019s plan Saturday did not include Trojans junior quarterback Cody Kessler throwing four touchdown strikes in the first quarter before the Buffaloes\u2019 offense had time to work up a sweat.\n\nRiddling the Colorado secondary with downfield throws all afternoon in the Trojans\u2019 56-28 romp, Kessler set a single-game school record with his seventh touchdown pass \u2014 a 24-yarder to wide receiver Steven Mitchell midway through the third quarter.\n\nThat put Southern California up 49-14. But the Trojans had been cruising much earlier.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely an ugly first half,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nIn establishing the new mark, Kessler broke a tie with multiple Trojans, including former USC star Matt Barkley, who burned the Buffaloes for six touchdown passes in 2012.\n\n\u201cHe was too good today,\u201d MacIntyre said of Kessler. \u201cThey were able to get things on the play-action today.\u201d\n\nA crowd of 74,756 at the historic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum watched Southern California (5-2, 4-1 Pac-12) remain atop the Pac-12\u2019s South Division standings.\n\nWell into its fourth year as a member of the Pac-12, Colorado (2-5, 0-4 Pac-12) is still trying to gain traction in the pass-happy league. CU appeared to make some strides in recent weeks, losing at California in double overtime and then by five points to Oregon State.\n\nBut this one resembled blowout losses by the Buffs in 2013.\n\nJust 14 minutes into the game, Southern California was up 28-0 and already had 210 yards of offense after the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWe took all the steps in the right direction the last two games,\u201d said Colorado junior wide receiver Nelson Spruce. \u201cBut we came out flat today. The bye week hurt us.\u201d\n\nColorado was in a giving mood. The Buffaloes committed two defensive penalties on the game\u2019s opening possession that helped USC march 84 yards in 10 plays \u2014 capped by a 16-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to Nelson Agholor, a fleet junior who would pull off a hat trick with three TD receptions, capped by a 75-yarder early in the third quarter.\n\nCU\u2019s opening offensive possession did not last nearly that long. After two nice runs by tailback Tony Jones, Colorado sophomore quarterback Sefo Liufau had his first pass attempt intercepted by Southern California\u2019s talented sophomore safety Su\u2019a Cravens, who darted in front of intended receiver Shay Fields for the pick.\n\nPHOTOS: USC beats Colorado 56-28\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s on me,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cWe can\u2019t make turnovers and expect to win.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans needed just six plays to make it 14-0 on another TD pass to Agholor. Colorado desperately needed a defensive stop and got it with a three-and-out. Or so it seemed. But safety Marques Mosley ran into the punter, USC retained possession and got another TD pass from Kessler.\n\nMercifully for Colorado, Kessler\u2019s day ended as the fourth quarter began, when he was replaced by backup quarterback Max Browne. Kessler finished 19-of-26 passing for 319 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nKessler was helped by a big game on the ground from junior running back Javorius \u201cBuck\u201d Allen, who gained 128 yards on just 15 carries, with a touchdown.\n\nHighlights were few for CU. But Spruce did catch his 11th touchdown pass of 2014. The 5-yarder in the third quarter tied CU\u2019s single-season record set in 2003 by Derek McCoy.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nGame balls\n\n1. Cody Kessler, QB, Southern California \u2014 The junior passed for seven touchdowns and 319 yards \u2014 in three quarters before taking the rest of the game off.\n\n2. Nelson Agholor, WR, Southern California \u2014 His 75-yard TD reception early in the third quarter was his third score of the day. NFL scouts, no doubt, took note.\n\n3. Southern California defense \u2014 Led by defensive end Leonard Williams and safety Su\u2019A Cravens, the Trojans made life miserable for the Buffaloes.\n\nTom Kensler, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Southern Cal starts fast in blowout of CU Buffs", "title": "Southern Cal starts fast in blowout of CU Buffs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/18/southern-cal-starts-fast-in-blowout-of-cu-buffs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__cu-ucsp1.jpg", "height": 475}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__cu-ucsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-18T19:30:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:26:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1125\"", "article_summary": "Nelson Agholor, WR, Southern California \u2014 His 75-yard TD reception early in the third quarter was his third score of the day.\n\u201cWe took all the steps in the right direction the last two games,\u201d said Colorado junior wide receiver Nelson Spruce.\nSouthern California defense \u2014 Led by defensive end Leonard Williams and safety Su\u2019A Cravens, the Trojans made life miserable for the Buffaloes.\nThat put Southern California up 49-14.\nJust 14 minutes into the game, Southern California was up 28-0 and already had 210 yards of offense after the first quarter."}
