It\u2019s not an estimate of how many had gained coverage because of the law\u2019s preexisting condition protections. Or an estimate of how many would lose their insurance if the law were repealed.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting House Republicans in favor of repeal with email blasts that highlight benefits of the law. It\u2019s true that the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover all children, under age 19, regardless of preexisting conditions. And the law includes the same protection for adults. But it\u2019s simply not true that 657,000 kids in Pennsylvania would lose their health care without the law.\n\nThe email criticizing Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, who favors repeal, is headlined: \u201c#CostsOfRepeal: Congressman Fitzpatrick\u2019s Repeal Would Take Health Care Away from 657,000 Children in Pennsylvania with Preexisting Conditions.\u201d (The emails encourage use of the Twitter hashtag #CostsOfRepeal.) The message goes on to say: \u201cKids with preexisting conditions like asthma and diabetes would be the latest victims of Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick\u2019s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with 657,000 at risk of losing their coverage in Pennsylvania \u2013 sending us back to the days when insurance companies were free to deny coverage to sick kids, or charge them exorbitant premiums.\u201d\n\nThe National Journal printed a similar DCCC message that mentions both children being denied coverage and \u201c129 million Americans \u2013 including 5,489,162 people in Pennsylvania\u201d who \u201ccould be denied coverage.\u201d The 129 million figure is for all non-elderly Americans with a preexisting condition and also comes from an administration report.\n\nEven the softer \u201cat risk of losing their coverage\u201d wording is inaccurate. Instead, the figures represent the high-end of Obama administration estimates of everyone with preexisting conditions \u2014 whether they are already covered with private insurance or a government program such as Medicaid, or are uninsured. If, for some reason, all of those 657,000 kids in Pennsylvania were thrown into the individual market, they could potentially be at risk of being denied coverage or charged higher premiums, without the preexisting condition protections of the ACA.\n\nA November 2011 report from the Department of Health and Human Services estimated that as many as 17 million children nationwide had a condition that could lead to denial of coverage or higher rates on the pre-ACA individual market. That\u2019s the high-end of the administration estimate. The low estimate was 4 million, which is the number that would be eligible for high-risk pools. The HHS report adds to that children with \u201ccommon conditions that major insurers generally use in medical underwriting,\u201d bringing the total to 17 million.\n\nOf course, every child with some type of preexisting condition wasn\u2019t seeking coverage on the individual market before the ACA was passed, and they wouldn\u2019t be if it were repealed. Many had coverage on their parents\u2019 employer-based policies; others had Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program coverage. Employer plans wouldn\u2019t deny insurance coverage due to preexisting conditions, and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) limits \u201cpreexisting condition exclusion\u201d periods, when a policy could refuse coverage of a condition for a certain time period for new workers that have lacked continuous coverage.\n\nThe report acknowledged this, saying: \u201cGenerally, pre-existing conditions matter less for people insured through employers that have a large risk pool and can therefore spread the cost of workers\u2019 illnesses or injuries. In addition, some insurance protections already exist for people changing jobs.\u201d\n\nMost Americans get coverage through an employer, and the law doesn\u2019t change that by much. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of Americans with work-based plans will be 158 million in 2018 because of the law, 7 million fewer than would have been the case without the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe administration does have a point, as we said when we wrote about this report before. Some of those with work-based jobs and a health condition may stay at their current jobs simply because of the health benefits, worried about seeking coverage elsewhere. The report notes that employees with preexisting conditions \u201cwould be vulnerable without the new law.\u201d\n\nSure, they could be, if they had to, or wanted to, seek coverage on the individual market. And the DCCC would be accurate to say that these hundreds of thousands of kids in Pennsylvania, and millions nationwide, enjoy added protections because of the Affordable Care Act. But repealing the law wouldn\u2019t \u201ctake health care away from 657,000 children in Pennsylvania with preexisting conditions,\u201d as the email attacking Fitzpatrick says.\n\nThe congressman has voted repeatedly to repeal the law, but has said he favors replacing it and has proposed legislation that would provide an opportunity for those with preexisting conditions to buy insurance. Fitzpatrick, who was defeated in a reelection race in 2006 by Democrat Patrick Murphy, regained his seat in the House in 2010. He\u2019ll campaign to keep his office next year, making him a likely target of Democrats.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Many had coverage on their parents\u2019 employer-based policies; others had Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program coverage.\nIt\u2019s not an estimate of how many had gained coverage because of the law\u2019s preexisting condition protections.\nIt\u2019s true that the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover all children, under age 19, regardless of preexisting conditions.\nBut it\u2019s simply not true that 657,000 kids in Pennsylvania would lose their health care without the law.\nThat number comes from an Obama administration estimate for all children living in Pennsylvania, under 18, with some kind of preexisting condition."}
