In three other states \u2014 Montana, South Dakota and Alaska \u2014 more than 45 percent of people had gone more than a year without seeing or talking to a doctor.\n\nAlthough access to medical care varied greatly by state, the researchers found little difference when they grouped states according to their response to the ACA (also known as Obamacare).\n\nAmong the 25 states (plus the District of Columbia) that expanded their Medicaid programs in the wake of the federal law, 66.7 percent of residents had seen or spoken with a doctor in the last year, on average. In the other 25 states that did not expand Medicare, the figure was 65.2 percent \u2014 a difference too small to be considered statistically significant.\n\nThe researchers did find a slight but real difference in residents\u2019 likelihood of having a usual place of care: 83.4 percent had a medical home in states that expanded Medicare, on average, compared with 81.8 percent in states that didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMany factors likely influence rates of healthcare utilization, and rates may change as the length of time since ACA implementation increases,\u201d the report authors concluded.\n\nThe findings are based on adults ages 18 to 64 who participated in the CDC\u2019s National Health Interview Survey. The report was produced by the agency\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92016 Los Angeles Times\n\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "article_metadata": {"title": "How often do you go to the doctor?
