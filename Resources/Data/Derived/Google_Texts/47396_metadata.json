But GOP deficit hawks want to offset the bill\u2019s price tag with savings down the road.\n\nDemocrats said they\u2019d pursue a few changes of their own. They want to fund the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for four more years instead of the two-year extension included in the bill.\n\nDemocrats also want to boost women\u2019s health through one of several funding avenues and remove Medicare\u2019s annual caps on physical, speech and occupational therapies.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to amend this bill to death. We want three simple amendments,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said.\n\nThe legislation earned 392 votes in the House and would permanently nix cuts to doctor\u2019s payments, thus heading off an annual headache for lawmakers who have always temporarily papered over the cuts but have never found the money to pay for a permanent repeal.\n\nThe legislation would pay for a partial repeal by requiring some wealthy seniors to pay more for Medicare \u2014 but it still would leave a $141 billion deficit.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, wants Congress to apply budget rules to the bill, which would mean all of the $141 billion would eventually have to be paid for by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI think we need to have that vote, and I think it needs to pass,\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, said of Mr. Lee\u2019s proposal.\n\nMr. Sessions later said there was \u201ca reluctance\u201d on the part of Senate Republican leaders to allow amendments.\n\nGOP leaders want to act swiftly on the package, arguing Congress is on the cusp of a milestone that will save money in the long run, and leave lawmakers with one less recurring headache over the regular patches.\n\nMr. McCarthy, California Republican, said \u201ctaking away these cliffs\u201d will be one of his top priorities as majority leader.\n\nMr. McCarthy also said he expects it will be fairly simply to reach an accord on a budget between the House and Senate, who both passed blueprints that erase deficits within a decade.\n\n\u201cI do not see much difference between the two,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nDemocrats, though, have vowed a fight, saying they don\u2019t see much good in either budget.\n\n\u201cNot only is the Republican budget immoral, it is bad economic policy,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent who leads Democrats on the Budget Committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fresh from a two-week vacation, Congress is back and already struggling to meet a pair of looming deadlines, with no prospect for a budget and little progress on breaking a stalemate on Medicare spending.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fresh from a two-week vacation, Congress is back and already struggling to meet a pair of looming deadlines, with no prospect for a budget and little progress on breaking a stalemate on Medicare spending.", "title": "Budget, Medicare spending deadlines loom before Congress", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/13/budget-medicare-spending-deadlines-loom-before-con/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/13/4_132015_ap872225495258201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/13/4_132015_ap872225495258201.jpg", "description": "Fresh from a two-week vacation, Congress is back and already struggling to meet a pair of looming deadlines, with no prospect for a budget and little progress on breaking a stalemate on Medicare spend", "card": "summary", "title": "Budget, Medicare spending deadlines loom before Congress"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Senate, Congress, House"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNot only is the Republican budget immoral, it is bad economic policy,\u201d said Sen.
