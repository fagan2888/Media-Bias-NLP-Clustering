Weather Channel’s Jim Cantore barely batted an eye — but did swing his knee out — when a random college bro ran into him during a live weather report about Winter Storm Leon on Tuesday night.

The student betrayed his photobomb (or, videobomb, if you will) by yelling as he ran toward Cantore, possibly giving Cantore time to prepare. After the student ran off, Cantore turned back to the camera, saying, “Obviously, here at the College of Charleston, they’re already having a good time.”
