From January 2011 through August, West Virginia\u2019s private-sector job growth ranked dead last among the 50 states.\n\nThough recent Environmental Protection Agency rules crippling the coal industry have made things worse, slow job growth in West Virginia is nothing new; from January 1995 through August, the state\u2019s private-sector job growth ranked 44th.\n\nIn a September poll, West Virginia MetroNews found 60 percent support for right-to-work among likely voters.\n\nRELATED: Labor bosses\u2019 big loss could bring right-to-work to Kentucky\n\nWest Virginia House Speaker Tim Armstead and Senate President Bill Cole expressed support for right-to-work Sunday after a local economist shared findings from a study of the policy\u2019s likely impacts.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat who is term-limited in 2016, would veto a right-to-work bill if it were sent to his desk.\n\nSince breaking a decades-long Democratic stranglehold in the West Virginia Legislature in 2014, Republicans have worked with Tomblin to change laws favoring union bosses at the expense of workers and taxpayers.\n\nTomblin signed a bill in May loosening the grip of construction unions by ending mandatory \u201cproject labor agreements\u201d for contractors \u2014 but he has tussled with Republicans over the calculation of \u201cprevailing wages\u201d used for public projects.\n\nChris Stadelman, Tomblin\u2019s communications director, told Watchdog the governor \u201cdoes not believe West Virginia needs a right-to-work law.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight-to-work has been discussed for a number of years, although Gov. Tomblin has never had a company cite that as a significant issue when considering whether to invest in West Virginia, and the state continues to see new and expanding businesses locate here,\u201d Stadelman said.\n\nStadelman did not comment on whether Tomblin would veto a right-to-work bill.\n\nGarrett Ballengee, executive director of West Virginia\u2019s free-market Cardinal Institute, told Watchdog the state\u2019s voters \u201care tired of the status quo in West Virginia, as it leads to mediocrity at best and embarrassment at worst.\u201d\n\nWhile many West Virginians see right-to-work as a driver of economic growth in the South, union-backed interest groups are against letting workers opt out of paying unions, Ballengee said.\n\n\u201cLabor leaders will be especially hesitant to change the status quo as they\u2019re the primary beneficiaries of the way things are,\u201d Ballengee noted.\n\nKeith Pauley, chairman of the Cardinal Institute board of directors, said it\u2019s \u201cjust not fair\u201d to require any West Virginian to pay a union to have a job.\n\n\u201cVery few workers in West Virginia actually voted to join a union. Their parents didn\u2019t even vote to join a union. It was actually their grandparents who unionized their workplace,\u201d Pauley wrote in an email to Watchdog.\n\nPauley said Indiana\u2019s implementation of right-to-work and Kentucky\u2019s passage of right-to-work at the local level in 12 counties serve as examples for West Virginia.\n\nIn Kentucky \u2014 West Virginia\u2019s neighbor to the west \u2014 Governor-elect Matt Bevin promised during his campaign to fight for right-to-work, but majority Democrats in the Kentucky House have blocked the policy in previous sessions.\n\nFacilitated by a state-level Republican resurgence under President Obama, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin have implemented right-to-work since 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers may be in a race this winter to see whether West Virginia or neighboring Kentucky becomes the 26th right-to-work state.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Lawmakers may be in a race this winter to see whether West Virginia or neighboring Kentucky becomes the 26th right-to-work state.", "title": "Will West Virginia become the 26th right-to-work state? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/west-virginia-capitol-state-of-wv.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-16T13:02:22+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/247259/west-virginia-right-to-work/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Lawmakers may be in a race this winter to see whether West Virginia or neighboring Kentucky becomes the 26th right-to-work state.", "title": "Will West Virginia become the 26th right-to-work state? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/west-virginia-capitol-state-of-wv.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-11-16T12:54:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T13:02:22+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "west virginia right to work, right to work west virginia, wv rtw, wv right to work, west virginia worker freedom, west virginia union dues, west virginia union fees, cardinal institute"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers may be in a race this winter to see whether West Virginia or neighboring Kentucky becomes the 26th right-to-work state.\nPauley said Indiana\u2019s implementation of right-to-work and Kentucky\u2019s passage of right-to-work at the local level in 12 counties serve as examples for West Virginia.\nIn a September poll, West Virginia MetroNews found 60 percent support for right-to-work among likely voters.\nBecause the Legislature could override a veto with a simple majority in each house, Republicans could make West Virginia a right-to-work state by March even if Democrats voted in lockstep against it.\nWest Virginia\u2019s economy suggests state labor laws are in desperate need of reform."}
