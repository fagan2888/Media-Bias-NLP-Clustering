Protesters took to the street again on Sunday to voice their outrage, using gunfire, hurling firebombs, rocks and even Molotov cocktails at police officers, who responded with tear gas, smoke bombs, rubber bullets, and a call for hundreds of more officers in riot gear to join the fight.\n\nOn Monday, after nine days of rioting, Gov. Jay Nixon announced that he would deploy the National Guard to the area in an effort to bring peace.\n\nThe clashes may be in Missouri, but they\u2019ve affected nearly every town in the United States, leading to protests in various cities and making citizens question their own town\u2019s law enforcement strategy as well as ongoing racial tensions around the country.\n\nAcknowledging the added toll the violence has probably taken on local students, the St. Louis Rams, owned by Denver billionaire Stan Kroenke, reportedly provided tickets to high school players in the area to the Rams\u2019 preseason game against the Packers this past Saturday.\n\nRobert Klemko of MMQB.com was on the scene in Ferguson over the weekend, providing updates and talking to folks in the region. (Klemko was even temporarily arrested by police during the clashes.) On Monday, in his weekly \u201cMonday Morning Quarterback,\u201d Peter King shared Klemko\u2019s latest bit of information from St. Louis:\n\nRams manager of fan development & alumni relations Kyle Eversgerd put in a call to coaches at McCluer High, McCluer North and McCluer South; there would be 75 free tickets awaiting each team if they chose to come to Saturday\u2019s preseason game at the Edward Jones Dome. \u201cIn light of everything going on it just kind of hit me,\u201d says Eversgerd, whose job includes outreach with local high schools. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine with all that stuff going on, how tough it must be to practice. We were able to get them away from it all.\u201d So as hundreds of protesters faced off with police on the now-infamous West Florissant Avenue on Saturday night in Ferguson, leaving a man critically wounded by gunfire just yards from the homes of area children, the boys from three local teams were at their first NFL game, watching Aaron Rodgers and Sam Bradford from the 400 level. Said McCluer coach Mario MacDonald, \u201cOur kids are focused on this season, but I worry about them out here, to be honest.\u201d At McCluer, MacDonald estimates more than 75% of his roster comes from single-parent homes, and most would not have been able to otherwise afford tickets that average about $100. The game was a welcome distraction; many McCluer players are angry with police and inclined to protest after Michael Brown\u2019s shooting death here a week ago. On the bus ride to the game, players saw protesters on Florissant and started chanting, \u201cHands Up! Don\u2019t Shoot!\u201d Then they focused on football.\n\nOn Saturday, Klemko wrote about Bears defensive lineman David Bass, who grew up in St. Louis County and encountered racial profiling \u2014 and still does.\n\n\u201cWhen I go home I get pulled over just because,\u201d Bass told Klemko. \u201c\u2026 When they don\u2019t know who you are, all you are is black. They don\u2019t know that I graduated from college, or that I\u2019m in the NFL. But when they find that out, they want to stop and have a conversation.\u201d\n\nCheck out Klemko\u2019s full feature on Bass, as well as the latest news on the Rams\u2019 response to the unrest in Ferguson.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ferguson,Missouri,St. Louis Rams,Stan Kroenke,tickets", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/18/report-st-louis-rams-give-free-tickets-kids-ferguson-mo/28856/", "site_name": "First-and-Orange", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/rams-packers-495x327.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "St. Louis Rams give out free tickets to kids in Ferguson, Mo., according to report"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Report: St. Louis Rams give out tickets to high school athletes in Ferguson, Mo.", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/18/report-st-louis-rams-give-free-tickets-kids-ferguson-mo/28856/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/rams-packers-495x327.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The St. Louis Rams, owned by Denver billionaire Stan Kroenke, have reportedly given out tickets to high school players in Ferguson to the team's preseason game against Green Bay last Saturday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd179\"", "article_summary": "On Saturday, Klemko wrote about Bears defensive lineman David Bass, who grew up in St. Louis County and encountered racial profiling \u2014 and still does.\nOn the bus ride to the game, players saw protesters on Florissant and started chanting, \u201cHands Up!\nMore than a week after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., the unrest in the St. Louis suburb reached its worst level yet.\nThe game was a welcome distraction; many McCluer players are angry with police and inclined to protest after Michael Brown\u2019s shooting death here a week ago.\nAcknowledging the added toll the violence has probably taken on local students, the St. Louis Rams, owned by Denver billionaire Stan Kroenke, reportedly provided tickets to high school players in the area to the Rams\u2019 preseason game against the Packers this past Saturday."}
