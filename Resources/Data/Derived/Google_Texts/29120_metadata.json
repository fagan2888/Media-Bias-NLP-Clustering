Todd Young and U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly have sponsored bills in the House and Senate, respectively, that would restore 40-hours-per-week as the federal definition of full-time work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a change that Indiana employers say is needed, as they have responded to the Obamacare rule by reducing hours for part-time workers below the 30-hour rule. This has reduced hours for thousands of Hoosier workers at restaurants, retailers, school corporations, municipalities and colleges.\n\n\n\nThe 30-hour rule created enough concern among school corporations\u2014which have part-time bus drivers, cooks and other personnel\u2014that 39 of them in Indiana have sued the Obama administration to nullify Obamacare\u2019s taxes on government employers that do not provide affordable health benefits.\n\n\n\nThe Indiana Chamber of Commerce strongly favors the Forty Hours Is Full Time Act, as the Donnelly-sponsored bill is known. And Ivy Tech Community College President Tom Snyder went to Washington this month to testify in favor of Young\u2019s bill, which is called the Save American Workers Act.\n\n\n\nBut the fix proposed by Young and Donnelly would harm more than it would help, according to an analysis by the University of California-Berkeley\u2019s Labor Center. It found that Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour rule puts 2.3 million workers at risk for having their hours reduced.\n\n\n\nBut reinstituting the 40-hour rule would put more than 6.5 million workers at risk for reduced hours, according to a December report. It would also effectively kill the employer mandate, which requires employers with 50 or more workers to provide affordable health insurance coverage, or else pay a $2,000 per-worker penalty when the workers instead buy coverage in Obamacare\u2019s individual insurance exchanges.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Forty Hours is Full Time Act would make it nearly costless for employers to reduce work hours to avoid the penalty given the ease of moving from a 40-hour to 39-hour work schedule,\u201d wrote Ken Jacobs and Dave Graham-Squire, researchers at the UC-Berkeley Labor Center. \u201cThe Forty Hours is Full Time Act would effectively eliminate the employer requirements under the Affordable Care Act. It would result in a reduction of employer-sponsored insurance and a shift of costs from employers onto the federal government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn spite of this prediction, it appears that Donnelly\u2019s bill is gaining support in the Senate Finance Committee, said Susan Rider, a benefits broker at Indianapolis-based Gregory & Appel who tracks federal legislation related to health benefits.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny employer that has folks with variable hours is dramatically affected,\u201d Rider said.\n\n\n\nDonnelly, a Democrat, co-sponsored the bill last summer with Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is my view\u2014based on what I hear from Hoosier employees and employers\u2014that we need to fix the definition of \u2018full-time employee\u2019 under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Donnelly said this month in a statement. \u201cI hope we can work together, both Democrats and Republicans, to make the health care law work better for Hoosier families, employees, and employers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey have attracted 11 more co-sponsors, although only one is a Democrat.\n\n\n\nThat makes the bill\u2019s fate in the Democrat-controlled Senate uncertain at best.\n\n\n\nYoung\u2019s bill has attracted 205 sponsors, all but six of them Republicans.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe new class of employees dubbed the \u2018Obamacare 29ers\u2019 continues to grow,\u201d Young said before taking testimony Feb. 4 on his bill. He cited the UC-Berkeley research on how Obamacare's 30-hour rule puts workers at risk, but not its research on how restoring the 40-hour rule would affect more workers. \u201cThe closer we get to January 1, 2015, the more I suspect we\u2019ll continue to see the ranks of 29ers grow.\u201d\n\n\n\nIvy Tech plans to reduce the hours of about 1,000 of its 4,500 adjunct professors. Those are the professors who teach 12 or more credit hours per semester. That\u2019s because Obamacare\u2019s regulations, which are still being written, call for the out-of-class preparatory time of adjunct professors to be counted as working hours. Ivy Tech expects the Obama administration to require two hours of prep time to be counted for every hour in class. So only by limiting its adjunct professors\u2019 teaching to nine hours per semester can the college keep their total number of hours worked under 30 per week.\n\n\n\nIf Ivy Tech did provide health insurance to those 1,000 adjunct professors, it would cost the school $10 million to $17 million, Snyder estimated.\n\n\n\n\u201cLike many community colleges, our funding does not allow us to absorb large unfunded mandates such as any employee who exceeds 30 hours being offered health insurance,\u201d Snyder said. \"The potential penalties we could face for exceeding these 30 hours, knowing that we have thousands of adjuncts, of course is not an option we could even consider.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the researchers at the UC-Berkeley Labor Center think there is a better solution to the challenge. Lawmakers could pro-rate Obamacare\u2019s penalties, so that they increase with the number of hours an employee works. Part-time workers nowhere near the 30-hour threshold would result in only small penalties if they were not provided health insurance, but workers with nearly 40 hours of work would come closer to the full $2,000 penalty, making it more likely that employers would offer health benefits to them.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers Young and Donnelly push restoration of 40-hour definition of full-time, but critics say their bills would gut Obamacare's employer mandate and lead to a decline in employer insurance coverage.", "csrf-token": "YPa9YC0AS8HdJkUItkz71uytv7+mM2ycMuO/RrDyvew=", "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers Young and Donnelly push restoration of 40-hour definition of full-time, but critics say their bills would gut Obamacare's employer mandate and lead to a decline in employer insurance coverage.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hoosier lawmakers attack Obamacare's 30-hour rule"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "Lawmakers Young and Donnelly push restoration of 40-hour definition of full-time, but critics say their bills would gut Obamacare's employer mandate and lead to a decline in employer insurance coverage.", "title": "Hoosier lawmakers attack Obamacare's 30-hour rule"}, "keywords": "insurance,Congress,Ivy Tech,benefits,employers,workers,health,care,adjunct,affordable,Donnelly,hours,rule,time,obamacare\u2019s,young,0-hour", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb696\"", "article_summary": "He cited the UC-Berkeley research on how Obamacare's 30-hour rule puts workers at risk, but not its research on how restoring the 40-hour rule would affect more workers.\nIt found that Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour rule puts 2.3 million workers at risk for having their hours reduced.\nIt\u2019s a change that Indiana employers say is needed, as they have responded to the Obamacare rule by reducing hours for part-time workers below the 30-hour rule.\nLawmakers could pro-rate Obamacare\u2019s penalties, so that they increase with the number of hours an employee works.\nIf Ivy Tech did provide health insurance to those 1,000 adjunct professors, it would cost the school $10 million to $17 million, Snyder estimated."}
