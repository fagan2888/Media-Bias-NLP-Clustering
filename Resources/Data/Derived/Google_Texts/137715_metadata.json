But she saved her strongest words for criticizing the Republican contenders, who she said \u201cseemed determined to lead us right back into the past\u201d on those and other issues.\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to turn back the clock, they should be joining us in saying loudly and clearly saying no \u2014 no to discrimination, once and for all,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI am asking them, please, don\u2019t make the rights, the hopes of any American into a political football for this 2016 campaign.\u201d\n\nFollowing the court\u2019s decision Friday morning, several Republican presidential hopefuls, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, called for a constitutional amendment allowing states to define marriage as they wish.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who has repeatedly argued for \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control measures since the shootings last week, also drew attention to a vote by the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday against an amendment that would have channeled increased funding to the Centers of Disease Control to study gun violence.\n\n\u201cHow can you watch massacre after massacre and take that vote?\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nShe proceeded to critique the Republicans systematically on a long list of issues, from the Affordable Care Act to climate change to women\u2019s reproductive health, and without using his name, again rebuked Donald J. Trump for referring to Mexican immigrants in his campaign announcement speech this week as rapists and criminals.\n\nMrs. Clinton opened her speech, though, by addressing the court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling directly. She called it a triumph for love, equality and the country, and read aloud the concluding portion of the court\u2019s majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision confirms we\u2019ve been working toward equality as a nation, step by step, case by case, court by court, and that equality has been right there in the Constitution all along,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThere is something quite remarkable about that.\u201d\n\nHer remarks came before the Democratic Party of Virginia\u2019s annual Jefferson Jackson Dinner at George Mason University here. Before taking the stage, she spent the afternoon in Charleston, where she attended the funeral of Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a state senator and the pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, who was killed there along with eight others in a mass shooting last week.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s visit to Virginia was the first since declaring her candidacy in April. It is also one of her first campaign events outside the early primary states. She has close ties to Democrats in the state, but Virginia is expected to be hotly contested in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150626224022, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Pinckney, Clementa C (1973-2015);Trump, Donald J", "keywords": "Clinton Hillary Rodham,Pinckney Clementa C (1973-2015),Trump Donald J,Gun Control,Presidential Election of 2016,Same-Sex Marriage Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships,Fairfax (Va),Virginia,Uncategorized", "description": "In Virginia, Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked her Republican presidential rivals for resisting stricter gun controls and opposing the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of same-sex marriage.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Nicholas Fandos", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Nicholas Fandos", "byl": "Nicholas Fandos", "twitter": {"description": "In Virginia, Hillary Rodham Clinton attacked her Republican presidential rivals for resisting stricter gun controls and opposing the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of same-sex marriage.", "title": "Praising Supreme Court, Hillary Clinton Assails G.O.P.
