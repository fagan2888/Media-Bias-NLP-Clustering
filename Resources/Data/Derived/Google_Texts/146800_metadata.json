State and federal wildlife managers have suggested that the animals should no longer be categorized as `threatened' under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIf the US Fish and Wildlife Service accept the proposal, hunting of great bears could once again be started in the Yellowstone area.\n\nBonnie Rice, an official with the Sierra Club chapter in Montana, says, \"The grizzly bear is arguably the most beautiful and powerful symbol of our wild heritage. It is vital they make a full recovery so they don't slide back towards extinction\".\n\nThe Yellowstone Ecosystem Grizzly Bear Recovery Area covers parts of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, including all of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.\n\nGrizzlies were first listed as `threatened' under the ESA in 1975. At the time the number was just 136.\n\nWildlife agencies reports that at present, the number is over 650. As a result, there have been some dangerous encounters between bears and humans, including hikers and ranchers. In August, four people received minor injuries in two different bear attacks in and near Yellowstone National Park.\n\nAlaska has an estimated 30,000 grizzlies. Those bears have never been listed as endangered and hundreds are hunted every year.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9bb\"", "article_summary": "State and federal wildlife managers have suggested that the animals should no longer be categorized as `threatened' under the Endangered Species Act.\nIn the region around Yellowstone National Park, the number of grizzly bears has increased.\nThe Yellowstone Ecosystem Grizzly Bear Recovery Area covers parts of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, including all of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.\nIn August, four people received minor injuries in two different bear attacks in and near Yellowstone National Park.\nBonnie Rice, an official with the Sierra Club chapter in Montana, says, \"The grizzly bear is arguably the most beautiful and powerful symbol of our wild heritage."}
