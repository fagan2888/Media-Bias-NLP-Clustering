The other, a report from the Department of Labor and the president's Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that a failure to extend benefits could cost businesses 240,000 jobs in 2014.\n\nLawmakers from both parties are currently involved in budget negotiations that must produce a fiscal blueprint for the coming year by Dec. 13. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, has been pushing hard to include an extension of unemployment benefits in the eventual package, but Republicans, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., have resisted, warning that much of their rank-and-file cannot support a package that includes such an extension. To date, negotiators have not tipped their cards one way or another about the parameters of any final deal.\n\nReaction to the latest unemployment figures released Friday offered both parties an opportunity to press their case on unemployment benefits. In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner signaled his opposition to an extension, saying the relatively positive November jobs report \u201cshould discourage calls for more emergency government \u2018stimulus.\u2019\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., disagreed. \u201cThe last thing our economy needs is another round of Republican refusals to act to strengthen our recovery and put people to work,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat Americans need now is for Republicans to come together with Democrats to extend the unemployment insurance set to expire for more than a million Americans over the holidays.\u201d\n\nIn his address on Saturday, the president urged Congress to put aside the bickering, reminding Republicans that unemployment benefits have been routinely extended before, even during healthier economic periods.\n\n\u201cFor decades, Congress has voted to offer relief to job-seekers \u2013 including when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that economic lifeline is in jeopardy. All because Republicans in this Congress \u2013 which is on track to be the most unproductive in history \u2013 have so far refused to extend it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this holiday season,\u201d he added, \u201clet\u2019s give our fellow Americans who are desperately looking for work the help they need to keep on looking.\u201d\n\nIn the weekly Republican address on Saturday, Rep Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., continued hammering Obamacare, saying she\u2019s \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the health care law.\n\n\u201cI say this not only as a congresswoman and chair of the Republican Women\u2019s Policy Committee; I say it as a nurse and the mother of a son in college,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s often women who make the health care decisions for our families. We put a lot of time and thought into these choices and how they\u2019ll affect our budgets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to talk about a \u2018war on women,\u2019 look no further than this health care law,\u201d she added, co-opting a favorite attack line Democrats frequently lob at Republicans.\n\nAfter relaying stories from constituents whose insurance has been canceled or become dramatically more expensive under Obamacare, Ellmers said, \u201cThese families wouldn\u2019t be in this boat if those who wrote the law had listened to hardworking taxpayers instead of relying on insurance companies and big businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president won't scrap this law, isn't it time for him to delay it for all Americans before it does further harm?\u201d she asked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama warned that job-seekers and the whole economy will pay the price if unemployment benefits expire as scheduled on Dec. 28", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-presses-republicans-to-extend-unemployment-insurance/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/07/33510471-c631-465e-9899-6b08d63748a2/thumbnail/1200x630/fd89577687a88bf69d6c28ce17a7ae4c/Screen Shot 2013-12-07 at 11.21.50 AM.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "President Obama warned that job-seekers and the whole economy will pay the price if unemployment benefits expire as scheduled on Dec. 28", "title": "Obama presses Republicans to extend unemployment insurance"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama warned that job-seekers and the whole economy will pay the price if unemployment benefits expire as scheduled on Dec. 28", "title": "Obama presses Republicans to extend unemployment insurance", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obama-presses-republicans-to-extend-unemployment-insurance/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obama-presses-republicans-to-extend-unemployment-insurance/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-presses-republicans-to-extend-unemployment-insurance/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/07/33510471-c631-465e-9899-6b08d63748a2/thumbnail/1200x630/fd89577687a88bf69d6c28ce17a7ae4c/Screen Shot 2013-12-07 at 11.21.50 AM.png", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-presses-republicans-to-extend-unemployment-insurance/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obama-presses-republicans-to-extend-unemployment-insurance/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe247d\"", "article_summary": "Reaction to the latest unemployment figures released Friday offered both parties an opportunity to press their case on unemployment benefits.\n\u201cUnemployment insurance is one of the most effective ways there is to boost our economy,\u201d he explained.\nPresident Obama pushed Congress to extend unemployment insurance in his weekly address on Saturday, warning that if the benefits expire as scheduled on Dec. 28, job seekers and the economy as a whole will pay the price.\nThe other, a report from the Department of Labor and the president's Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that a failure to extend benefits could cost businesses 240,000 jobs in 2014.\n\u201cFor decades, Congress has voted to offer relief to job-seekers \u2013 including when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today,\u201d he said."}
