(AP) \u2014 The sound system next door is making it hard for Olga Lopatina to love thy neighbor: Christ the King church.\n\nSince last summer, the church has been broadcasting the sounds of bells and hymns to its Burlington neighborhood, a joyful noise unto the Lord that some here think is just an unholy racket.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the volume, but the timing and type of tune that irks Lopatina, who said she loves the natural sound of bells after growing up in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really music,\u201d she complained of the hymns as she stood in her backyard one recent evening after yet another unwelcome serenade. \u201cThis one, it t sounds like a teenage iPhone recording, like the first generation ring tones that you pay 99 cents.\u201d\n\nThe dispute has fueled online jokes \u2014 some that posters felt were disrespectful of their faith \u2014and complaints that the bells violate Burlington\u2019s noise ordinance. A meeting with a mediator was scheduled for March but was postponed until May 18.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising the tolling of the electronic bells has struck a chord with some neighbors in the largest city in Vermont, a state deemed the least religious in the nation by a Gallup Poll last year.\n\nLarry Miller said not only is the noise intrusive but he finds it offensive from a religious perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not my religion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe recorded chimes are played three times of day from the church which also has a school \u2014 at noon, when the kids are let out of school at 2:45 p.m. and at 6 p.m. \u2014 and after funerals and weddings. The church, which did not return a message seeking comment, had agreed to some modifications to the volume and length of the recordings but critics question whether it has stuck to them.\n\nSome in the south-end neighborhood enjoy the chimes and music or at least aren\u2019t bothered by them.\n\nDavid Workman, a parishioner whose daughter attends the school, said as a Roman Catholic the ringing of bells and playing of hymns \u201care religiously significant.\u201d\n\nIt would be nice to have a bronze cast bell and someone to pull on the rope but that would be costly, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked living in a place where I could hear bells. You used to be able to hear the St. Joe\u2019s bells or the congregational church bells in downtown Burlington,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something I like about that. It makes the city seem not too big.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joyful noise or unholy din? New church \u2018bells\u2019 mean discord", "title": "Joyful noise or unholy din?
