SunGard provides software and various types of processing services for the public sector, as well as financial firms and the education industry.\n\nOwners of Wayne, Pennsylvania-based SunGard seem to have struggled to boost the company's value in recent years. One of the largest leveraged buyouts that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, SunGard is one of the longest-held investments in PE history.\n\nThe company has been backed by the same group of buyout firms since 2005. The consortium includes Silver Lake Partners LP, TPG Capital LP, Bain Capital LLC, Blackstone Group LP (NYSE: BX), Goldman Sachs Capital Partners LP (NYSE: GS), KKR & Co LP (NYSE: KKR) and Providence Equity Partners Inc. The seven firms teamed up and spent $11.4 billion for the company.\n\nIn 2012, the firms facilitated a $720 million dividend through SunGard. In 2014, they spun off SunGard's disaster recovery unit - roughly a third of its revenue.\n\nAnnual revenue at SunGard increased in 2014 by 2 percent to $2.8 billion.
