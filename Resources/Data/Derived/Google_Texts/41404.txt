(CNN) — It isn’t that the 42-year-old man had done anything wrong to infuriate Elytte Barbour and his wife.

The couple – married three weeks — just wanted to kill someone together, police said.

And Troy LaFerrara happened to be the unlucky one.

The Barbours are accused of luring LaFerrara through a sex ad on Craigslist, and stabbing and strangling him to death.

Barbour told police he and his wife had tried to kill others. But the plans didn’t work out.

“So they continued to try to find someone,” police said.

“LaFerrara was just the one with whom the plan worked.”

LaFerrara’s body was found in the backyard of a home in Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia, on November 12.

He had been stabbed 20 times and strangled, police said.

The last number dialed on his cell phone led police to the Barbours.

At first, the wife, 18-year-old Miranda Barbour, denied knowing the victim. But presented with more and more evidence that police had gathered, she confessed.

According to the police affidavit, this is what happened:

Miranda Barbour told police she would use Craigslist to meet men — “men who wanted companionship,” and were willing to pay her for it.

On November 11, she met LaFerrara at a mall in nearby Susquehanna, picked him up in her red Honda CRV and drove to Sunbury.

Elytte Barbour was hiding under a blanket in the back seat, he said. The couple had agreed on a pre-arranged signal so that he would know when “it was time to kill the victim.”
