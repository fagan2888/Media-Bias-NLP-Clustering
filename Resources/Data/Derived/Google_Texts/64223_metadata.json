At the same time, the health care industry at large is looking to reduce the use of unnecessary, expensive tests.\n\n\n\nIt's little wonder that investors aren't as trigger-happy for medical device companies as they were 10 years ago.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Like other startups, medical device entrepreneurs need to demonstrate a market for their products or services.
