(RELATED: White House Veto Threat Makes a Pretty Good Case Against Obamacare\u2019s Employer Mandate)\n\nHowever, at a hearing held by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Patty Murray argued that the proposed legislation would exacerbate the problem it seeks to solve, while at the same time shifting healthcare costs from businesses to taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThis bill would actually create the problem it claims to solve,\u201d Murray said, citing a Congressional Budget Office report which found that there are far more workers who put in 40 (or slightly more) hours per week than workers who put in 30 (or slightly more) hours.\n\nAs a result, the CBO estimates that, \u201croughly 1 million fewer people would enroll in employer-based coverage\u201d if the new law passes, at least half of whom would likely go on to enroll in government-subsidized plans.\n\nBased on the CBO\u2019s findings, Murray concluded that \u201cthis bill isn\u2019t only bad for workers\u2014it would also shift the costs of providing coverage from businesses to taxpayers, driving up the deficit by $53.2 billion over the next decade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Republican legislation puts big corporations and their profits ahead of working families and their health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill is corporate welfare,\u201d Warren added. \u201cI\u2019m against adding $53 billion to the deficit so that corporations can push their costs and responsibilities onto the government.\u201d\n\nSeveral witnesses who testified at the hearing disputed those claims, saying the 30-hour rule hurts workers by forcing companies to cut jobs, hours and/or wages in order to comply with the employer mandate.

It would also \u201cshield most full-time workers without health insurance from being subjected to the possibility of losing 11 or more hours per week.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised that the Senate will vote on the bill, which passed the House earlier this month by a 252-172 vote.\n\nFollow Peter Fricke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
