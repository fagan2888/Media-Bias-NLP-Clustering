LANDOVER, Md. — Robert Griffin III departed with his left ankle in a splint, and DeSean Jackson walked off gingerly supporting his left arm and shoulder Sunday in the first quarter of the Washington Redskins’ game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The Redskins announced that neither would return.

Griffin was hurt while making an acrobatic, leaping, across-the-body throw near the sideline while being pursued by linebacker Paul Posluszny. Griffin landed awkwardly on his ankle as he finished the throw and then tumbled out of bounds. The pass was caught by Jackson for an 11-yard gain.

While play continued, Griffin’s leg was placed in a splint. He wiped his brow and waved, saluted and gave a thumbs-up signal to the crowd as he was carted along the sideline toward the players’ tunnel. The fans chanted “R-G-3!”

It was the latest setback for a promising but injury-marred career. Griffin missed all or part of four games in his record-setting rookie season of 2012 due to various injuries, including a torn right ACL that led to reconstructive knee surgery.

Griffin also tore his right ACL in college at Baylor.

On the Redskins’ next series, Jackson was hurt when he got tangled with safety Josh Evans on an incomplete pass. Jackson walked off the field and down the tunnel instead of heading to the sideline. The team announced he had an injured left shoulder and was questionable to return; minutes later, he was downgraded to out.

Jackson was the Redskins’ prized free agency acquisition this year after he was cut by the Philadelphia Eagles. He signed a three-year, $24 million contract that includes $16 million guaranteed.
