Training a physician can take up to a decade; the Colosseum was perhaps ironically built in less time.\n\nWith predictions of massive physician shortages gaining headway across the healthcare industry, how is overall physician and patient focus changing? Can the healthcare industry be rebuilt in a decade?\n\nWhy are physicians pulling a disappearing act?\n\nThere may soon be up to 31,000 fewer primary care physicians and up to 63,000 fewer non-primary care physicians, estimates The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Surgical specialists are reportedly among the ones most likely to close their doors.\n\nPhysicians are perhaps increasingly overwhelmed by declining profits. The total number of independent physicians has decreased from 57% in 2000 to 39% in 2012.\n\nNearly half of physicians who quit treating patients within an active medical practice choose to do so because of regulatory and administrative burdens, says the Texas Medical Association (TMA). Nearly one-quarter of physicians quit because of ICD-10 implementation challenges.\n\nAround half of physicians over the age of 60 may reportedly retire because of ICD-10 claims being denied or delayed. Nonetheless, with reports of ICD-10 implementation thus far generally smooth, perhaps it is uncertain to what extent such claims will become a reality.\n\nWithin the next ten years, there could be up to 90,000 fewer physicians nationwide. Those patient populations residing in either rural areas or inner cities already facing physician shortages are perhaps expected to be hit the hardest.\n\nWith employee costs for health insurance rising, high deductibles increasing, and out-of-pocket costs on the up and up, healthcare consumers are actively searching for alternatives regarding their healthcare options.\n\nGreater transparency may be an answer. Some leading organizations, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), are responding to this need with its \u201cDoctor Lookup\u201d feature and the Hospital Quality Star ratings system, both of which may still have some kinks to work out along the way.\n\nIs throwing ACA money around the answer?\n\nOne apparent strategy to help alleviate the possibly devastating physician shortage aftermath is through sizable multi-million dollar Affordable Care Act (ACA) funding efforts to help coerce people to enter the healthcare field through generous scholarships and loan repayment systems.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded over $240 million last month, including nearly $176 million in ACA funding, to help strengthen the primary healthcare workforce.\n\nAwards include a $23 million grant for nursing students in exchange for a minimum two-year work agreement and $11 million in loan repayment for those completing a primary care residency in rural and urban areas.\n\nThese financial awards are designed to encourage more people \u2013 i.e. registered nurses, physician assistants, as well as physicians \u2013 to pursue degrees and employment within the healthcare space.\n\nFaculty loan repayment is also part of this deal as professor shortages across the board have been reported. Adjunct professors, even those at prestigious private research universities and the like, may be feeling this sting the most as those with multiple degrees and impressive resumes are often struggling to maintain job security and earn enough to make a decent living.\n\nHHS\u2019s faculty loan repayment system offers over $1 million to help keep health professions educators from leaving their faculty positions behind, although it is perhaps not yet known if such is enough to make a sizable impact.\n\nAre concierge physicians the secret to success?\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Perhaps the latest focus is the widespread implementation of concierge services where physicians\u2019 revenue may be advantageously stimulated by premium charges for personalized physician care.\n\nAside from those working within the healthcare space, patients may now be exploring more affordable options with a greater focus on meeting preemptive care needs.\n\nFor a monthly or yearly fee, patients can receive an interactive medical experience, including access to a medical spa, nutritional counseling, and fitness and wellness services.\n\nDirect physician access via email or cell phone may also be included. Other options include same-day appointments and round-the-clock care.\n\nThe average annual fee for concierge services is between $1,400 and $1,700 per patient, says the Heritage Foundation. Two out of three concierge practices reportedly charge no higher than $135 monthly per patient.\n\nSeven percent of primary care physicians \u2013 i.e. internists, family doctors, and pediatricians \u2013 offer direct pay/concierge medicine, reports the Physician Foundation in a 2014 physician survey with 20,000 respondents.\n\nThirteen percent of respondents say they plan to transition to this type of practice to some extent, either in whole or in part. Additionally, 17 percent of those physicians age 45 or younger confirm they will make this transition in due time.\n\nAffordable direct primary care may be becoming a more mainstreamed option within both the short-term and long-term future of the healthcare industry.\n\nThe concept of restructuring the physician landscape over the next decade and keeping not only physicians, but perhaps even more importantly, those who teach physicians, from leaving needs to be one that remains active on the radar of healthcare executives if the healthcare industry is to be saved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With predictions of massive physician shortages gaining headway across the healthcare industry, how is overall physician and patient focus changing?", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/how-physician-shortages-are-transforming-healthcares-future", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_12_4197801169.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "How Physician Shortages Are Transforming Healthcare\u2019s Future"}, "twitter": {"description": "With predictions of massive physician shortages gaining headway across the healthcare industry, how is overall physician and patient focus changing?", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_12_4197801169.jpg"}, "title": "How Physician Shortages Are Transforming Healthcare\u2019s Future", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "With predictions of massive physician shortages gaining headway across the healthcare industry, how is overall physician and patient focus changing?\nFaculty loan repayment is also part of this deal as professor shortages across the board have been reported.\nThere may soon be up to 31,000 fewer primary care physicians and up to 63,000 fewer non-primary care physicians, estimates The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).\nAffordable direct primary care may be becoming a more mainstreamed option within both the short-term and long-term future of the healthcare industry.\ninternists, family doctors, and pediatricians \u2013 offer direct pay/concierge medicine, reports the Physician Foundation in a 2014 physician survey with 20,000 respondents."}
