Stephen Greenhouse of \u201cThe New York Times\u201d wrote about this recently. I spoke with him earlier.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, has it finally gotten too far that people are essentially bringing their staffs in just to try to keep the doors open on Thanksgiving Day?\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE, THE NEW YORK TIMES: You know, last year, all the news is that more and more stores were opening on Thanksgiving, in theory, to please consumers, and then there\u2019s such a crush on Black Friday. They were competing to move things up to Thursday.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a backlash, as you say, Hari, where a lot of retailers see that a lot of consumers don\u2019t like the idea of shopping on Thanksgiving, and they think that, you know, workers should have the day off. So, some prominent retailers \u2014 Costco, Marshall, GameStop \u2014 have all kind of not just announced but they\u2019re boasting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to remain closed on Thanksgiving. It shows that we care about our workers. It shows that we care about the holiday. It shows we care about their families.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s really an interesting tug-of-war now about whether to stay open to please consumers or stay closed kind of to please workers and it\u2019s, I think, very good public relation to remain closed.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, I know that Walmart kind of pushed back and said, \u201cLook, we\u2019re almost like airports and gas station, and we\u2019ve been open on Thanksgiving for 20 years.\u201d\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: So, you know, on one hand, you know, Walmart can say, we\u2019re a supermarket, and a lot of supermarkets are open Thanksgiving morning because in case you the need the cranberries or cranberry sauce, or God forbid you forgot a turkey.\n\nBut on the other hand, you know, the other part of the Walmart is the \u2014 you know, very competitive retailer that moved Black Friday into Thursday the way many other retailers have, and that meant it needed a lot more workers. That meant kind of pressured \u2014 invite a lot of consumers to \u2014 you know, get up from their Thanksgiving table at 4:00 p.m. and rush over to Walmart and wait in line for two hours to shop. And, you know, Walmart has in ways seen that\u2019s a problem. You know, it\u2019s going to remain open on Thanksgiving.\n\nBut it saw that so many consumers are unhappy about having to wait an hour or two or three hours online on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, for Black Friday sales, it says Black Friday is magically going to become a five-day affair, where the Black Friday sales will be spread. And that might mean \u2014 you know, fewer people will be needed to work on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. So, I mean, this is also a big, big moment that starts the season. And for retailers, this last stretch of the year is incredibly important to their bottom line, right?\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: Absolutely. You know, they called it Black Friday because in theory, they\u2019ve been running in the red all year long and, finally, on Black Friday, they\u2019re making money.\n\nI had this interesting interview, Hari, with the head PR guy for Nordstrom, and he said, we used to be closed on July 4th, we used to be closed on New Year\u2019s Day, but our consumers pushed us to open those days. So, now, we\u2019re open in New Year\u2019s Day and July 4th. But he said, but so far, thus far, our consumers and shoppers aren\u2019t pushing us to open on Thanksgiving, and if they do, then even we great, prestigious Nordstrom might do that as well.\n\nSo, there really are a lot of conflicting pressures. A lot of workers really don\u2019t want to work that day. And a lot of consumers, you know, if they could get a good bargain that day, they\u2019re happy to go.\n\nBut, you know, there was this poll done last year by the University of Connecticut where, you know \u2014 more than 90 percent of shoppers say they really don\u2019t love to go out running for Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving Day and just 7 percent said they\u2019re happy to. So \u2014 but maybe a lot of retailers are eager not to miss that 7 percent.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. Steven Greenhouse of \u201cThe New York Times\u201d joining us from Chicago, thanks so much.\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: Thanks.
