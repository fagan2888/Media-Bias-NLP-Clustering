Tuesday, November 19th, the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and the Los Angeles Association of Health Underwriters (LAAHU) are looking to smooth that path by hosting an enrollment fair at Pasadena City College.\n\nInitially, attendees will hear a ten-minute breakdown of what is required for individuals in regard to the ACA. People may call and reserve a time for a one-on-one meeting with an insurance professional (call 626.795.3355).\n\nQuestions will be answered and, if desired, agents will sign up people for new insurance coverage. Twenty certified insurance specialists, several Spanish-speaking, will be available. Reservations may be made for 2 p.m., 3:30 p.m., or 5:30 p.m.\n\nDeirdre Kennedy, President of LAAHU and a Certified Health Reform Specialist who has been working, studying, and lobbying for a workable health care system, encourages people to make an appointment. Using an insurance broker, she tells us, costs the individual absolutely nothing. She asked that we emphasize this point as it is a common misperception. And using a health insurance broker significantly increases one\u2019s understanding of the options available and rates are calculated. For example, when cost is initially calculated on the Covered California site, one\u2019s gross income is used, which is not indexed for cost of living. It is only when one actually applies MAGI\u2014modified adjusted gross income\u2014that one\u2019s monthly cost for health insurance may be truly determined (and possibly lowered).\n\nKennedy walked us through the national AHU site and encouraged readers\u2014if they are unable to attend Tuesday\u2019s enrollment fair\u2014to take a look. Once logged onto the page, look below \u201cAbout Us\u201d and click on \u201cFind an agent.\u201d Type in your zip code and put a radius of ten to fifty miles. Before hitting \u201center,\u201d scroll down to \u201ccertified to sell health insurance exchange marketplace coverage,\u201d and click on California. This will provide you with a list of professional insurance brokers who can help you navigate ACA\u2014with no added cost to you.\n\nAffordable Care Act Enrollment Fair\n\nTuesday, Nov. 19th, 2-7 p.m.\n\nPasadena City College, Crevelling Lounge, 1570 E.
