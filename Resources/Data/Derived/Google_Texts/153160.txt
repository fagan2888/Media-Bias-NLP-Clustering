Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has axed a popular twice-monthly comedy show that for 22 years cheered up its patients.

“They told me they have new management, there are new changes, and one of them is my show,” said funnyman Maury Fogel, the creator of “Keeping Them in Stitches.”

“It’s a shame, because no money was coming out of their pockets,” he said of the hospital. “We just gave them a few laughs.”

The all-volunteer show ran twice a month for 22 years and featured rising and established stars, including “King of Queens” star Kevin James and Conan O’Brien head writer Mike Sweeney.

“You have to keep it clean. They’re not drinking, and it’s 3 o’clock in the afternoon, and there are grandmothers and little kids” in the audience, said standup comic Josh Hyman, who did the show about two dozen times.

“They didn’t want you talking about death or cancer, and no race or sex jokes,” he noted.

“It’s an amazing practice. People came to Maury and begged him to be in the show.”

And many of the those who performed were themselves touched by cancer.

Manhattan comic Nikki Chawla’s late older sister, Amarjit, battled breast cancer, and giving back to the hospital “was a blessing for me, as a sister and as a comedian,” she told The Post.

As a survivor of testicular cancer, Manhattan com­edian Eric Piescohe felt volunteering was a way of “giving back,” he said, adding, “We’re all very befuddled” by the program’s abrupt end.

Patients said the show was great medicine.

“It was just awesome . . . just to forget about everything,” recalled Ramon Jimenez, 31, of East Orange, NJ, who saw the show five years ago while battling a tumor in his throat. “It was just good to laugh.”

The hospital refused to explain why the program was cut.

“We have not discontinued patient recreation programs for our MSK patients,” said a hospital spokeswoman.

“We have different performers who currently perform comedy for MSK patients and their visitors.”
