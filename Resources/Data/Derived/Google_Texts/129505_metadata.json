GOP lawmakers in Congress have demonstrated their commitment to this goal with literally dozens of votes to repeal \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nBut these efforts generally come with an important caveat: they\u2019re hollow. Republicans know these efforts won\u2019t become law, at least not anytime soon, so it\u2019s all for show \u2013 GOP lawmakers are effectively pounding their chests in a display intended to make themselves feel better.\n\nWhen the debate is less theoretical and more practical, Republican bravado isn\u2019t quite so effortless. Take yesterday, for example, where Arkansas\u2019 new GOP governor was weighing whether to kill the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion policy.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson announced [Thursday] morning at UAMS that he will ask the legislature to fund the private option through the end of 2016. He will create a task force to come up with a new plan for 2017 and beyond. Hutchinson said that the new plan should cover the beneficiaries currently covered by the private option, but be more sustainable in terms of cost.\n\nThis outcome was hardly assured. Hutchinson, a former congressman elected governor just a few months ago, would not take a position on Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid-expansion policy during the campaign. Just 24 hours ago, it was not at all clear whether he intended to take coverage away from 200,000 low-income Arkansans.\n\nBut as it turns out, it was a step the Republican governor just wasn\u2019t prepared to take. There\u2019s a larger significance to this that extends past Arkansas.\n\nLet\u2019s make this plain: there\u2019s a big difference between Republicans saying, \u201cWe hate the president, so your family will no longer have access to basic medical care,\u201d and Republicans actually doing it. Plenty of GOP governors have blocked Medicaid expansion in their states in part because of this dynamic \u2013 once families have health care coverage, it becomes extremely difficult for Republican policymakers to announce they\u2019ve decided to take those benefits away, leaving struggling Americans with practically nothing.\n\nGetting Medicaid expansion approved in Arkansas wasn\u2019t easy , but faced with the option of killing the policy, Hutchinson found it easier to keep it alive for a couple of years while he considers alternatives. His motivation seems pretty straightforward: after a month on the job, the governor didn\u2019t want to be the guy to take health security from 200,000 of his own constituents.\n\nAlso keep in mind, as Greg Sargent noted yesterday, the policy is working: \u201cThanks in part to Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion \u2013 a.k.a. the Private Option \u2013 the state showed one of the steepest drops in the uninsured rate in the country.\u201d\n\nHating \u201cObamacare\u201d is one thing; confronting the reality of \u201cObamacare\u201d succeeding is something else.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s important to emphasize that Hutchinson\u2019s announcement yesterday was not the final word on the subject, and Arkansas\u2019 Republican-led legislature will still have to approve the governor\u2019s preferred approach. To put it mildly, that won\u2019t be easy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In theory, Republicans are desperate to scrap ACA benefits.
