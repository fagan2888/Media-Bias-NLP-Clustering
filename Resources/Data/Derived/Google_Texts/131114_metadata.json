A screenshot provided by Tobin shows the message \u201cHACKED BY MECA,\u201d along with a masked figure in front of the Dome of the Rock, an Islamic shrine in disputed East Jerusalem, along with smoke and a series of slogans such as, \u201cIn Allah we trust. For Allah we work. Death to Israel. Free Palestine. Jerusalem is ours.\u201d\n\nTobin said the department shut down its website and database immediately after he was made aware of the hacking attack. The agency got its backup database running on Tuesday so its investigators can continue their work.\n\n\u201cOperations here are moving forward as if nothing happened,\u201d Tobin said.\n\nTobin said the agency is working with the Arizona Department of Administration to determine how the attack occurred. It has also notified the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe department\u2019s website is still down for maintenance. Tobin said the agency is trying to determine whether to get its website up again or simply shift its components over to the Arizona Department of Agriculture, which is scheduled to take over many of the department\u2019s duties next year. At Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s urging, the Legislature during the 2015 session passed a bill that will dismantle the Department of Weights and Measures and shift its duties to other agencies.\n\n\u201cIt may make more sense to kind of coordinate it under Ag\u2019s website sooner than later,\u201d Tobin said.\n\nAccording to news reports, MECA has hacked a broad array of targets across the globe. In December, the group hacked the website for a school district in Little Rock, Ark. It took over the website for the small Quebec town of Terrasse-Vaudreuil in January. In May, it targeted Auckland University in New Zealand. And in April, it hacked Art and Sol, a Scottsdale-based performing arts program for children.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Weights and Measures\u2019 website is out of commission after a weekend attack by a hacking group known as the Middle East Cyber Army.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Jeremy Duda", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "The Department of Weights and Measures\u2019 website is out of commission after a weekend attack by a hacking group known as the Middle East Cyber Army.", "title": "Hackers hit Department of Weights and Measures website", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2015/06/09/hackers-hit-department-of-weights-and-measures-website/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2015/06/ADWM-cyber-attack-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hackers hit Department of Weights and Measures websiteArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, arizona department of weights and measures, hackers, website, middle east cyber army,arizona department of weights and measures,hackers,middle east cyber army,website", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Weights and Measures\u2019 website is out of commission after a weekend attack by a hacking group known as the Middle East Cyber Army.\nDoug Ducey\u2019s urging, the Legislature during the 2015 session passed a bill that will dismantle the Department of Weights and Measures and shift its duties to other agencies.\nJerusalem is ours.\u201dTobin said the department shut down its website and database immediately after he was made aware of the hacking attack.\nTobin said the agency is working with the Arizona Department of Administration to determine how the attack occurred.\nDirector Andy Tobin said the agency\u2019s website was hacked on Sunday."}
