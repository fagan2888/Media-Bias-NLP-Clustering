GOP strategist Karl Rove told Fox News Monday morning that Donald Trump should be careful whom he lectures on “choking.”

Trump took a shot at Mitt Romney during this weekend’s Iowa Freedom Summit — which potential 2016 candidate Romney skipped — saying Romney “choked” in 2012. (He also told Jeb Bush to make like a tree.)

“I love Mitt Romney being lectured by Donald Trump on choking,” Rove said. “Trump is the guy who constantly chokes on the idea of becoming a candidate. He says he’s gonna run and then, like in 2012, goes out and gives a lousy speech in Las Vegas and ultimately decides his TV show is more important than his presidential campaign.”

Trump had only a couple hours before told the same network that he was “very, very seriously” considering a 2016 run.

For all that, Rove went on to say that Romney made a mistake in attending the Iowa Summit in 2012, where he said he was “severely conservative,” a statement that came back to haunt him in the general.
