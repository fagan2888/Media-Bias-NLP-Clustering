(Friday) will definitely be about Patrick. Such a big name, big presence in Quebec City. It\u2019s exciting for me to see the reaction for Patrick coming home.\u201d\n\nSakic made his Quebec City homecoming as a player in 2002, the first time the Avs played a preseason game there. He has fond memories of coming back onto the ice in that game and taking a curtain call along with Avs teammates Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, who both also played for the Nordiques.\n\nSakic and his youngest son, Chase, also participated in an international peewee tournament in Quebec City a couple of years ago. Sakic was the coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice \u2014 not as nice as going back and playing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is where I started so it will special, but like I said, the best time was in 2002 with Peter and Adam.\u201d\n\nRoy, who gathered in front of a Peyton Manning-sized media scrum Thursday morning at the Bell Centre, spoke in French and English about his Montreal/Quebec homecoming. He began his Hall of Fame career as a Canadiens goalie, winning the Stanley Cup twice, before being traded to Colorado in 1995. Roy said his players are probably as excited about this trip as himself, and he didn\u2019t leave any healthy veteran at home.\n\n\u201cWhen all the guys saw that we had two exhibition games in the province of Quebec, all the vets wanted to be a part of it,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThey all want to come to Montreal and Quebec. They\u2019re excited about these two games.\u201d\n\nAvs captain Gabe Landeskog missed Monday\u2019s first preseason game and Tuesday with a minor back ailment. But he wasn\u2019t going to sit out these games.\n\n\u201cWith Patrick\u2019s history here and the history of our team in Quebec City, that\u2019s certainly a trip you want to be on,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cLot of history and looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Second-year Avs goalie Reto Berra played well in the 3-2 overtime loss to Montreal, and defenseman Ryan Wilson (plus-2) led Colorado in ice time. \u2026 Montreal\u2019s Alex Galchenyuk won it 3:28 into overtime, two seconds after the Avs\u2019 Nick Holden was released from the penalty box. \u2026 Colorado killed a 5-on-3 disadvantage in OT. \u2026 Nathan MacKinnon assisted on both Colorado goals, by defenseman Tyson Barrie and Landeskog. \u2026 Veteran forwards Jarome Iginla, Alex Tanguay and Daniel Briere did not play Thursday but will be in the lineup Friday, Roy said. Defensemen Erik Johnson, Jan Hejda and Brad Stuart are also scheduled to play in the Quebec City rematch. \u2026 The Avs have 28 of 40 players on the trip, and prospects Ben Street, Bruno Gervais, Dennis Everberg, Daniel Maggio and Borna Rendulic played Thursday. Among those, Everberg looked the most poised and might have a chance to make the team out of camp, particularly if injured third-line forwards John Mitchell (migraines) and Jamie McGinn (back) aren\u2019t ready for the Oct. 9 season opener. Neither player is on the trip.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic headed to Avs\u2019 birthplace", "title": "Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic headed to Avs\u2019 birthplace", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/25/patrick-roy-joe-sakic-headed-to-avs-birthplace/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140925__20140926_B2_SP26HKNSAKICp2.jpg", "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140925__20140926_B2_SP26HKNSAKICp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-25T21:12:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:01:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e0b\"", "article_summary": "19 said the homecoming is more about someone else \u2014 Avalanche coach Patrick Roy \u2014 than himself.\nSakic and his youngest son, Chase, also participated in an international peewee tournament in Quebec City a couple of years ago.\nDefensemen Erik Johnson, Jan Hejda and Brad Stuart are also scheduled to play in the Quebec City rematch.\nSuch a big name, big presence in Quebec City.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but I think especially for Patrick,\u201d Sakic said before Thursday\u2019s preseason game against the Canadiens, who will also face the Avs on Friday at the Colis\u00e9e Pepsi in Quebec City."}
