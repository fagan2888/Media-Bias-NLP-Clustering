The compromise plan requires the administrator of Notre Dame\u2019s employee plan, Meritain Health Inc., and the insurer for students, Aetna Inc., to pay for birth control coverage and establishes a method to reimburse those entities.\n\nHowever, Notre Dame objected to that arrangement because it still forces the university to be complicit in an act that is contrary to Catholic moral teaching.\n\nThe Court ruled two-to-one to uphold the judge\u2019s denial of the university\u2019s request for a temporary injunction.\n\nJudge Richard Posner, who wrote the majority opinion, dismissed the university\u2019s moral argument, writing:\n\nIf the government is entitled to require that female contraceptives be provided to women free of charge, we have trouble understanding how signing the form that declares Notre Dame\u2019s authorized refusal to pay for contraceptives for its students or staff, and mailing the authorization document to those [insurance] companies, which under federal law are obligated to pick up the tab, could be thought to \u201ctrigger\u201d the provision of female contraceptives.\n\n\u201cWe are left with the question, what does Notre Dame want us to do?\u201d Judge Posner asked.\n\nPresumably, Notre Dame wants the federal government to do what it always has (or has not) done \u2014 mind its own business and not interfere with how private institutions operate.\n\nIn his dissent, Judge Joel M. Flaum noted that other religious institutions have been granted injunctions when they have challenged the law, writing:\n\nNotre Dame tells us that Catholic doctrine prohibits the actions that the government requires it to take. So long as that belief is sincerely held, I believe we should defer to Notre Dame\u2019s understanding.\n\nNotre Dame spokesman Paul Brown released a statement to the local South Bend Tribune noting that the university\u2019s \u201cconcern remains that if government is allowed to entangle a religious institution of higher education like Notre Dame in one area contrary to conscience, it\u2019s given license to do so in others.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur lawyers are reviewing the 7th Circuit ruling and contemplating next steps,\u201d Brown said.\n\nA report in the Wall Street Journal noted that after Notre Dame failed to receive the injunction, it instructed its insurance plan administrator to inform school employees they are eligible for the separate contraception arrangement while the case continues.\n\nHowever, noted the Journal, the ruling \u201cisn\u2019t the final word on Notre Dame\u2019s case. It only determines that the school to date hasn\u2019t made a strong enough showing to block the requirement while a full legal challenge continues in court.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame is but one of many organizations, both religious and secular, that have fought against compliance with the HHS contraceptive mandate on ethical grounds. Some cases have even been appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe most successful win thus far was in favor of a religious order called The Little Sisters of the Poor, who were granted an injunction by the Supreme Court on January 24. In making its decision, the High Court ruled that if the Little Sisters of the Poor assert in writing \u201cthat they are non-profit organizations that hold themselves out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services,\u201d the administration is barred from enforcing the requirement for contraceptive coverage in employee healthcare plans.\n\nThe Supreme Court order noted that the injunction will remain in place until the underlying lawsuit, Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius, is resolved.\n\nAnother case that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear oral arguments on has been brought by Hobby Lobby, the national chain of arts and crafts stores known for its founders' strong Christian beliefs. (All of its stores are closed on Sundays.) Hobby Lobby has been scheduled to present oral arguments against the Department of Health and Human Services' \"preventive services\" mandate before the Court on Tuesday, March 25.\n\nThe Christian Post reported on January 13 that Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners, David and Barbara Green, filed a lawsuit against HHS in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma regarding the controversial mandate in September 2012.\n\nA specific point of contention for the Green family was the providing of the \u201cmorning after\u201d and \u201cweek after\u201d pills, which are considered abortion-inducing and, therefore, contrary to the family\u2019s pro-life views.\n\nHobby Lobby President Steve Green told the Christian Post in an interview last June that \u201cour Founders gave us the religious freedoms that we have today and as a business we have the right to live according to those freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government is saying we have to provide prescriptions that are abortive and that violate our conscience, because we believe that life begins at conception and it\u2019s something that we have no desire to fully fund, which is what the mandate requires,\u201d said Green.\n\nOther colleges besides Notre Dame are fighting against ObamaCare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, including Dordt College, a Christian Reformed college in Iowa, and Cornerstone University, a non-denominational Christian college in Michigan, which filed suit against HHS last October.\n\n\u201cThis filing is first and foremost an effort to preserve and protect our religious freedom as guaranteed by the First Amendment,\u201d Joseph Stonewell, president of Cornerstone University, told the media. \u201cGiven our conviction that life begins at conception and our commitment to the sanctity of life, we find the mandate to provide our faculty, staff and students with insurance that provides access to abortion-inducing prescriptions unacceptable.\u201d\n\nAnother college batting the HHS mandate is Florida\u2019s Ave Maria University, which, after its first lawsuit against the mandate was dismissed in March of last year, filed a second lawsuit in August. The suit read, in part:\n\nThe University's sincere religious beliefs forbid it from facilitating, participating in, paying for, training others to engage in, or otherwise supporting contraception, sterilization, or abortion.\n\nThe university\u2019s president, Jim Towey, wrote a guest editorial published by Investors Business Daily on February 11, in which he noted the inconsistency between the White House\u2019s grant of reprieve for medium-size businesses\u2019 compliance with the Affordable Care Act for economic reasons, while \u201cthe owners of the Hobby Lobby retail chain, David and Barbara Green, get no such relief.\u201d\n\nWrote Towey:\n\nThe Greens are not alone in their beliefs. I serve as president of Ave Maria University, a Catholic university, and our religious beliefs also prevent us from complying with the mandate.\n\nMany institutions fighting against the HHS mandate in court are being represented by the Beckett Fund, which describes itself as \u201ca non-profit, public-interest legal and educational institute with a mission to protect the free expression of all faiths.\u201d Among its clients are the aforementioned Notre Dame, Little Sisters of the Poor, Hobby Lobby, Cornerstone University, and Ave Maria University \u2014 as well as Colorado Christian University, Wheaton College, Liberty University, American Family Association, Tyndale Publishers, Seneca Hardwood, and many more.\n\nThe Becket Fund has lists of the status of both the non-profit and for-profit organizations it represents on its website, with links providing information related to each case.\n\nOrganizations willing to fight the HHS mandate are fortunate to have this resource available to defend their interests and their values.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "federal court, ruled, against, Notre Dame, university, injunction, exempting, complying, ObamaCare, contraceptive mandate", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/17729-court-rules-against-notre-dame-on-contraception-mandate", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/9773ae71c6be24ffae649d517596cd02_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A federal court denied the University Notre Dame an injunction exempting it from complying with ObanaCare\u2019s contraceptive mandate. by Warren Mass", "title": "Court Rules Against Notre Dame on Contraception Mandate"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/9773ae71c6be24ffae649d517596cd02_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are left with the question, what does Notre Dame want us to do?\u201d Judge Posner asked.\nOrganizations willing to fight the HHS mandate are fortunate to have this resource available to defend their interests and their values.\nPresumably, Notre Dame wants the federal government to do what it always has (or has not) done \u2014 mind its own business and not interfere with how private institutions operate.\nHowever, Notre Dame objected to that arrangement because it still forces the university to be complicit in an act that is contrary to Catholic moral teaching.\nA report in the Wall Street Journal noted that after Notre Dame failed to receive the injunction, it instructed its insurance plan administrator to inform school employees they are eligible for the separate contraception arrangement while the case continues."}
