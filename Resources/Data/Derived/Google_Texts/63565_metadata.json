But one organization is reminding Americans about what it calls three \"legal alternatives.\"\n\nAs of now, consumers have until January 31, 2016, to enroll in a 2016 insurance plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Coverage can start as soon as January 1, 2016, if someone enrolls or changes plans by December 15.\n\nAs was the case last time around, people who don't have health insurance and don't have an exemption may have to pay a tax penalty \u2013 and the fee is going to be higher this time around.\n\nEven so, Twila Brase, a registered nurse and president of Citizens' Council for Health Freedom, says people have options.\n\n\"We have what's called the three legal alternatives to ObamaCare,\" she offers. \"We believe that we will start hearing from a lot of people, because that has been the case over the last two enrollment periods. In fact, our RefuseToEnroll.org is one of the most popular pages on our website.\"\n\nShe continues: \"They do not have to sign up for ObamaCare. It is not required. It is not actually even required to be insured. People have to understand what the alternatives are and what their opt-out options are.\"\n\nAccording to Brase and Citizens' Council for Health Freedom, the three legal alternatives to ObamaCare are: (1) obtain private health insurance, (2) claim one or more of the exemptions in ObamaCare, and (3) go uninsured and pay the tax penalty.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2015/11/02/icydn-you-can-legally-opt-out-of-obamacare", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935599/obamacare-logo_800x500.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "Once again, open enrollment is under way for ObamaCare.
