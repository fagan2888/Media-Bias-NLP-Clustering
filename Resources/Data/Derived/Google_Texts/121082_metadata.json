They have collapsed, however, under the reflexive antipathy toward the Affordable Care Act by conservatives in the state legislature.\n\nThe result: Tens of thousands of Missouri\u2019s workers go without health insurance compared to states that expanded Medicaid, according to a study by Families USA. Expansion states, on average, saw a 25 percent decline in their rate of uninsured workers, compared to just 13 percent for Missouri \u2014 a difference of nearly two to one.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this way. State/federal partnerships, like Medicaid expansion, have a history of success and have been a hallmark of Republican governance for more than a century.\n\nConsider the Land Grant College Act of 1862, sponsored by Congressman Justin Morrill \u2014 a founder of the Republican Party \u2014 and signed by Republican President Abraham Lincoln. Under the Act, the federal government gave states federal land they could manage or sell to endow colleges specializing in agriculture and engineering. The states would pay for the construction and maintenance of the schools.\n\nSince 1862, more than 20 million people \u2014 many who could not have otherwise afforded it \u2014 have graduated from the 100 Land Grant colleges that were created in every state and territory.\n\nAnother example is the Federal Highway Act of 1956, which created the Interstate Highway System. Republican President Dwight Eisenhower decided the project had to be a state/federal enterprise because otherwise our nation \u201cwould be a mere alliance of many separate parts.\u201d\n\nStudies have shown that every $1 invested in the Interstate System returned $6 in economic benefits.\n\nMedicaid expansion is in the best tradition of these historic state/federal partnerships. Helping low-income Missourians get health care is an investment in human capital every bit as important to our future as building universities and roads.\n\nIn Missouri, Medicaid is very restrictive. Parents of dependent children cannot receive coverage if their incomes exceed a meager 22 percent of the federal poverty level, approximately $370 a month for a family of three. Other adults \u2014 singles and childless couples \u2014 can\u2019t get coverage even if they have no income at all.\n\nMedicaid expansion would extend eligibility to adults with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 or about $2,130 a month for a family of three.\n\nThe majority of the expansion population \u2014 about 300,000 in Missouri \u2014 are working men and women who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid, but not enough to be eligible for subsidies on the health care exchange.\n\nThe federal government would pay 95 percent of the cost in 2017, sliding to a permanent 90/10 ratio by 2020 \u2013 the precise split of the Highway Act.\n\nThe Missouri Legislature should revisit Medicaid expansion during this year\u2019s session with a vision that extends beyond short-term election cycles, but rather looks toward the horizon and builds for generations to come \u2014 as great Republican leaders like Lincoln and Eisenhower did.\n\nRon Pollack is executive director of Families USA, the national organization for health care consumers.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1Szx9LJ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Over the past several years, arguments for Medicaid expansion in Missouri have been made using sound economic, budgetary and public health rationales.
