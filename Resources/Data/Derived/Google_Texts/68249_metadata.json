Al Sharpton, as using events like Ferguson to fundraise and increase their own media profiles.\n\nAnd some local residents \u2013 likely including those people in the video \u2013 are concerned that nationally known figures such as Mr. Jackson coming to Ferguson could distract attention away from the issues of civil rights and possible police brutality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of protesters in Ferguson, Mo., confronted civil rights activist Jesse Jackson in a McDonald's parking lot, saying they believed he was in the town for his own gain and not to support protesters.", "Author": "Phillip Swarts", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A group of protesters in Ferguson, Mo., confronted civil rights activist Jesse Jackson in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot, saying they believed he was in the town for his own gain and not to support protesters.", "title": "Ferguson protesters confront Jesse Jackson: \u2018When you going to stop selling us out?\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/23/ferguson-protesters-confront-jesse-jackson-when-yo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/police-shooting-missourijpeg-00d16.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/16/police-shooting-missourijpeg-00d16.jpg", "title": "Ferguson protesters confront Jesse Jackson: \u2018When you going to s", "description": "A group of protesters in Ferguson, Mo., confronted civil rights activist Jesse Jackson in a McDonald's parking lot, saying they believed he was in the town for his own gain and not to support proteste", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Social Issues, Politics, Jesse Jackson, Ferguson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd75a\"", "article_summary": "Critics have accused Mr. Jackson and other civil rights leaders like him, such as the Rev.\n\u201cWhen you going to stop selling us out Jesse?\u201d a protester shouts at Mr. Jackson in a video captured of the incident and first posted by conservative news site Western Journalism on Friday.\nA group of protesters in Ferguson, Mo., confronted civil rights activist Jesse Jackson in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot, saying they believed he was in the town for his own gain and not to support protesters.\nThe officer, Darren Wilson, maintains that Mr. Brown was a threat, but the incident has set off a string of protests about civil rights abuses by the police.\nWhen you gonna stop selling us out, Jesse?\u201d the person continues."}
