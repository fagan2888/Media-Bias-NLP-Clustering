(AP) \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday called the slaying of four Marines and a sailor at a Chattanooga reserve center the act of a \u201cperverted jihadist.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments came at a memorial to the five servicemen killed in a shooting rampage by Kuwait-born Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.\n\n\u201cThese perverse ideologues, warped theocrats, they may be able to inspire a single lone wolf to commit a savage act, but they can never, never threaten who we are,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhen this perverted jihadist struck, everyone responded.\u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s strong words contrast with the official comments of investigators who have not yet been able to determine a motive behind the attack. The FBI has said it has not been able to determine whether the 24-year-old Abdulazeez was \u201cradicalized\u201d before the July 16 attacks and has been treating him as a homegrown violent extremist.\n\nSpeaking before Biden, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said officials may never know \u201cwhat combination of disturbed mind, violent extremism and hateful ideology\u201d was behind the shooting, but vowed that the United States would present a strong response.\n\n\u201cThe few who threaten or incite harm to Americans \u2014 violent extremists or terrorists, wherever they are \u2014 will surely, very surely, no matter how long it takes, come to feel the long arm and the hard fist of justice,\u201d Carter said.\n\nThose killed were Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall Smith and four Marines: Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson Holmquist, Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan and Lance Cpt. Squire \u201cSkip\u201d Wells, who just moments before had texted his girlfriend in Savannah, Georgia, the words \u201cACTIVE SHOOTER.\u201d\n\nAbdulazeez began the July 16 rampage by opening fire on a military recruiting center before driving his rented Mustang about 7 miles across town to a reserve center, crashing through the gates and killing the five servicemen. Abdulazeez died in a shootout with police.\n\nFriends and neighbors recalled Abdulazeez as a happy, polite young man. But a picture has also emerged showing a darker side, with Abdulazeez\u2019s family saying he struggled with depression from his early teens, abused drugs, couldn\u2019t keep a job and was considering bankruptcy.\n\nAbdulazeez spent several months with an uncle in Jordan last year as part of an agreement to get him away from drugs, alcohol and a group of friends his parents considered a bad influence, a person close to the family has said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid business repercussions.\n\nBiden, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in May, said he could relate to the grief of the victims\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the privilege of knowing any one of them personally,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut oh, I knew them. Confident, determined, trustworthy, compassionate and always, always loyal.\n\n\u201cI knew them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were my son. And so many other sons I know.\u201d\n\nBeau Biden was a major in an Army National Guard unit that deployed to Iraq in 2008.\n\nThe vice president drew applause for concluding his remarks with a defiant message for anyone who would target the United States.\n\n\u201cWe have a message for those perverted cowards around the world: America never yields, never bends, never cowers, never stands down \u2014 (but) endures, responds, and always overcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cFor we are Americans, and never, never underestimate us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a bad, bad bet to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/themes/wtop/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Chattanooga-Shooting-150x150.jpeg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "WTOP", "description": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
