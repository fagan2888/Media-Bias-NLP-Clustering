Scott Tipton said he was outraged by the findings, and reflect complaints he had heard from constituents.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply troubling that ailing vets have been forced to wait so long to receive the care they were promised or discarded altogether, enduring additional pain and suffering and even losing their lives as a result. The problems facing the VA are systemic and need to be addressed immediately,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe cannot relent in pressing the agency to correct these problems,\u201d Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said in a statement. \u201cThe VA must do better, and soon. It needs to be more responsive, more transparent and more efficient. And it needs to improve its process for building new facilities \u2013 like the one in Aurora. Our veterans have earned that.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Coffman, a Marine Corps veteran who sits on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said the findings are unacceptable.\n\n\u201cIt will take a lot of work to change a culture of bureaucratic incompetence and corruption that is ingrained in the VA. \u201cI look forward to finding a bipartisan solution,\u201d Coffman said in a statement.\n\nThe audit found that the agency\u2019s complicated appointment process created confusion among scheduling clerks and supervisors, the department said.\n\nThe audit said a 14-day goal for seeing first-time patients was unattainable given the growing demand among veterans for health care and poor planning. The VA has since abandoned that goal.\n\nAt the Grand Junction veterans hospital, 115 patients waited 90 days or more for their first appointment.\n\nNew patients waited an average 44.64 days for an appointment at Denver compared to 3.47 days for an established patient.\n\nThe audit said 13 percent of VA schedulers reported supervisors telling them to falsify appointment dates to make waiting times appear shorter.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Many vets wait more than 30 days for their initial appointments at VA", "title": "Many vets wait more than 30 days for their initial appointments at VA", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/09/many-vets-wait-more-than-30-days-for-their-initial-appointments-at-va/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-09T13:30:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T13:30:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "More than 1,600 patients had to wait 30 days or more for their first appointments at the Denver VA hospital, according to the Veterans Affairs Department.\nNew patients waited an average 44.64 days for an appointment at Denver compared to 3.47 days for an established patient.\nAn additional 64,000 who enrolled in the VA health care system over the past 10 years have never had appointments.\nOur veterans have earned that.\u201dRepublican Rep.
