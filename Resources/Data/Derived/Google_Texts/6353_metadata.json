That was down from $69 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile facing a tougher environment in both its health care and insurance businesses, executives at Boston-based Partners said the biggest financial drag on their operations in the April-to-June period was an $89 million operating loss at Neighborhood Health Plan, a Medicaid managed care insurance subsidiary that Partners acquired in October 2012. That loss included a $26 million accounting charge for a reserve to cover expected additional losses in the current quarter.\n\nPeter K. Markell, the Partners chief financial officer and treasurer, said Neighborhood Health Plan has received an influx of 60,600 members from MassHealth, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, since Jan. 1.\n\nThe insurer is being reimbursed at rates set last fall by state actuaries, based on the health experience of MassHealth members previously enrolled in Neighborhood Health Plan. But Markell said actual medical claims from the new members have been much higher.\n\nNeighborhood Health \u2014 along with Network Health and Boston Medical Center\u2019s Health Net Inc., two other Medicaid plans that have also seen an influx of higher-cost MassHealth members \u2014 has been negotiating with state officials over ways to ease financial burdens. Beside the higher than anticipated costs from new MassHealth members, those burdens also includes unexpected expenses from a new hepatitis C drug and problems with the state\u2019s health insurance website.\n\n\u201cWe would like them to mitigate some of the losses we\u2019ve incurred in 2014 and correct the situation going forward,\u201d Markell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokeswoman for MassHealth said state officials weren\u2019t immediately available to discuss the situation.\n\nNeighborhood Health Plan president Deborah C. Enos said her organization had expected to add a smaller number of new members as MassHealth recategorized members under provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, switching many from state insurance programs to plans administered by the Medicaid managed care organizations.\n\n\u201cWe clearly didn\u2019t expect as many as we got, and what we certainly didn\u2019t expect was the (health care) utilization and cost patterns,\u201d Enos said. \u201cWe got fixed rates that did not anticipate the actual costs being incurred by the new MassHealth members.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.508462687", "eomportal-id": 923767, "description": "Partners HealthCare posted a $34 million operating loss -- its largest quarterly operating deficit in years -- citing a surge of more than 60,000 patients with expensive medical claims submitted to its insurance arm.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Partners HealthCare posted a $34 million operating loss -- its largest quarterly operating deficit in years -- citing a surge of more than 60,000 patients with expensive medical claims submitted to its insurance arm.", "title": "Hit by surge of Medicaid patients into its health plan, Partners posts operating loss - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/08/06/hit-surge-medicaid-patients-into-its-health-plan-partners-posts-operating-loss/7vPpuGHmawyJABAXuVdRJJ/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 02:26:43 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Partners HealthCare,Neighborhood Health Plan,operating loss,Peter K.
