Johnson was often derided for being egocentric, but when it came time to sign his landmark bill creating Medicare, 50 years ago this July, he graciously insisted on sharing the credit with the 81-year-old Harry Truman. At almost the last moment, Johnson decided to change the location from Washington to Truman\u2019s presidential library in Independence, Mo.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Johnson noted that in 1945, the newly installed President Truman had called for national health insurance, planting \u201cthe seeds of compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick, and serenity for the fearful.\u201d Johnson then presented his host with the nation\u2019s first Medicare card. Deeply moved, Truman later wrote in a letter to Johnson that the ceremony was \u201cthe highlight of my post-White House days.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in King v. Burwell, a case that, if resolved against the Obama administration, could endanger some of the fundamentals of President Obama\u2019s health care program.\n\nJust as Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act was based on elements of Johnson\u2019s Medicare, some of the most important domestic achievements by presidents throughout history have been based on the pathbreaking efforts of a predecessor. Acknowledging his debts to Truman in health care, education and civil rights, Johnson privately told him that his presidential record was unequaled, adding, \u201cIt makes all of us look like pygmies.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who replaced John F. Kennedy, intensely identified with Truman, who succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both men were relative outlanders who entered the White House after the sudden death of an elegant, Northeastern Harvard man and then suffered from scathing comparisons drawn between the living and the dead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI always felt sorry for Harry Truman and the way he got the presidency,\u201d Johnson once said in private. \u201cBut at least his man wasn\u2019t murdered.\u201d The two leaders were sufficiently close that Truman would reprimand Johnson to his face. In May 1968, when Johnson arrived at Truman\u2019s house in Independence for a visit, he said, \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to be,\u201d Truman replied. \u201cIt\u2019s your own damn fault. If you\u2019d have left on time, you\u2019d have gotten here on time!\u201d\n\nAs he exulted over his 1964 landslide, Johnson graciously told Truman: \u201cAs long as I\u2019m in that office, you\u2019re in it. And there\u2019s not a privilege of it, or a power of it, or a purpose of it, that you can\u2019t share. And your bedroom is up there waiting for you, and your plane is standing by your side.\u201d He assured Truman, \u201cWe all love you,\u201d and said he would \u201cdo anything in the world that would make you happy.\u201d\n\nVilified over the failing war effort in Vietnam as the 1960s wore on, he told Truman, who had been castigated over Korea, \u201cI\u2019ve been reading history and saw how much hell you had, and you handled it pretty good, and I just thought maybe I could learn something from you.\u201d When Johnson went to Independence in May 1968, Truman assured him he was \u201cright on Vietnam,\u201d and the president later said, \u201cI feel stronger when I leave him.\u201d\n\nOn the day after Christmas in 1972, Truman died. Although Johnson hated going to funerals and knew he was suffering from advanced cardiovascular disease, he went, along with Lady Bird, to salute his old friend, whose final honors took place at the Truman Library, not far from where Johnson had signed that Medicare bill.\n\nLady Bird Johnson much later told me she felt that the emotional shock of viewing the coffin of Truman, with whom her husband felt such empathy, was a factor that hastened Lyndon Johnson\u2019s own death, less than a month later, of a heart attack.\n\nAs president, Johnson could not have been courting Truman for quick political payoff. In the mid-1960s, Truman was by no means the popular figure \u2014 embodying plain speaking, decisiveness, honesty, common sense and a modest lifestyle \u2014 that he became after his death. When the Gallup Poll at the end of 1964 listed the world\u2019s \u201cmost admired\u201d men, Truman did not make the top 10.\n\nIn his generosity toward Truman, Johnson was showing his outrage at what he considered to be the shortsightedness of many historians. He gloomily predicted to friends that he, like Truman, would suffer from the regional prejudice of the many scholars who were reared or educated in the Northeast.\n\nJohnson was also trying to establish high benchmarks for his own benefit. His White House aide Larry Temple recalled that by promising Truman presidential planes and other perquisites, Johnson was trying to establish \u201ca precedent for getting the same thing for himself\u201d when he retired. Johnson also offered Truman special medical assistance from the military, which he later cited to his successor, Richard M. Nixon, as grounds for receiving similar treatment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was one reason that Johnson allowed Truman to bask in his aura as he signed Medicare. Remembering that ceremony in Independence, Johnson hoped that, one day, some future president might do the same kind of thing for him.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150228100012,
