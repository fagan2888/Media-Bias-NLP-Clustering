The Party, according to the Washington Post, is debating its shape, post-Obama, and the populists are winning. The Post\u2014and it is hardly alone in this view\u2014sees a widening split, both \u201cstylistic [and] substantive,\u201d between \u201cthe establishment and a newly energized populist wing,\u201d led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Bill de Blasio. (The next time Rush Limbaugh says that Democrats want the rest of the country to be just like Cambridge, Massachusetts, or New York City, it\u2019s going to be harder to argue with him.)\n\nPopulism, at present, is less a platform than a gestalt. It boils down to a few basic inclinations: to have the rich pay more in taxes, to have the government provide more in services, to decry inequality of income and opportunity, and to get tougher (preferably a lot tougher) on Wall Street and mollycoddled corporations. And, not least, to feel perfectly comfortable saying all of the above.\n\nThis is stronger stuff, certainly, than Democratic politicians have offered in a quarter century or more, and reveals a slackening\u2014if not quite a release\u2014of the centrist hold on the Democratic imagination. Since 2011, at least, President Obama has sounded these themes consistently, and, as reports Friday revealed, the Administration\u2019s budget request for 2015 calls, without apology, for an increase in spending on programs to benefit the middle class.\n\nBut the power and the appeal of populism are in the process of being wildly overstated by both the right and the left, each for its own purpose: the right, to instigate a Democratic civil war, and the left, to win one. Activists like Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, say that the populists not only are doing \u201cbattle\u201d with \u201cthe corporate wing of the Party,\u201d they are prevailing. Markos Moulitsas, the founding syllable of Daily Kos, has told The Atlantic that, \u201con everything from economic populism to marriage equality to gun control,\u201d the Democratic Party has moved to the left.\n\nThere is a good deal of truth to Moulitsas\u2019s view. Still, 2014 is likely to be a frustrating year for the Party\u2019s populists. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for good reason, is far less concerned with creating more Warrens than with saving the Landrieus and Pryors and Hagans it\u2019s already got\u2014red-state senators who are running for re\u00eblection and away from the President, the Affordable Care Act, and anything that smacks of old-school, large-scale federal intervention in the economy. Organized labor will keep up the fight for economic justice\u2014\u201craising wages for all workers is the issue of our time,\u201d Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O, said this week\u2014but with these Democratic senators under electoral duress, putting the Party\u2019s control of the chamber in jeopardy, a more full-throated liberalism is likely, for the time being, to be leashed, even muzzled.\n\nThis cannot augur well for the new populism. Looking beyond this election cycle, there is little reason to expect the populist moment to endure\u2014or to transform, to any substantial degree, the Democratic Party. Absent a cataclysmic event\u2014say, another economic collapse\u2014Democrats are likely to remain stubbornly middle-of-the-road in temperament and in their agenda; odds are against a sharp leftward turn that mirrors the sharp rightward turn that the G.O.P. has taken. There are at least two reasons for this, the first being that Democrats have learned something from past elections, principally that the farther out you venture (or are seen to venture) toward the ideological margins the more likely you are to lose.\n\nThis would seem a truism if the Republican Party weren\u2019t so blind to it. One could call it the Cruz fallacy, although Senator Ted Cruz is only one of a seemingly endless chain of conservative politicians and commentators who have said something like the following: \u201cIf you look at the last forty years, a consistent pattern emerges. Anytime Republicans nominate a candidate for President who runs as a strong conservative, we win. And when we nominate a moderate we lose.\u201d Extremism, happily enough, really is no vice electorally; the key to victory is ideological purity.\n\nThis is a typical misreading of the 1980 election\u2014the idea that Reagan won the White House not because of the state of the U.S. economy or events in the Middle East or the sad ineptitude of Jimmy Carter but mainly because he offered voters an undiluted conservatism. It is also the founding myth of modern Republicanism, so there\u2019s no sense in trying to talk them out of it. Hence the lament, every time the Republicans do lose, that the Party should have put forward a \u201creal conservative,\u201d instead of Ford/Bush/Dole/McCain/Romney, milquetoasts all. As hard as it is to imagine Mike Huckabee performing better than John McCain did in the fall of 2008, or Rick Santorum posing more of a challenge to Obama, in 2012, than Mitt Romney did, this remains, for many Republicans, an article of faith.\n\nOf course, there are Democrats who believe that a \u201cleft turn\u201d is the way to win elections in a \u201crout.\u201d This can be called the Westen fallacy, after Drew Westen, a psychologist and sometime strategic consultant, who has been making this case in the Times and elsewhere. Yet few Democrats are hitting the turn signal. Almost across the board, moderation prevails. It is not only corporate contributions, as Westen and other progressives darkly suggest, that bind Democrats closely to the political center and inure them to class-based appeals. It is the Party\u2019s institutional memory of being tagged\u2014successfully\u2014as something alien, an affront to middle-class culture and values. If four-letter words like \u201cA.C.L.U.\u201d don\u2019t pack the punch that they once did, it\u2019s because leading Democrats, for a generation now, have steadily refused to fit the old caricature. This takes vigilance. Governor Jack Markell, of Delaware, recently warned his fellow-Democrats never to forget \u201cwhere the people of the country are,\u201d unless they want to repeat the electoral debacles of 1972 and 1984.\n\nThere\u2019s another, perhaps deeper, reason for this. Even in their heart of hearts, even where the ideological id runs free, most Democrats do not thrill to the populist mantra of higher taxes and bigger government. Reforms such as universal pre-kindergarten and an increase in the minimum wage are broadly popular\u2014and the Party, locally and nationally, is pursuing them. And there is great, if largely untapped, enthusiasm for the populist crusade to reduce the role of money in politics. But, on the whole, Democrats\u2019 eagerness for, and confidence in, governmental action is thin and equivocal. According to the Pew Research Center, the share of Democrats who think \u201cit\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to take care of people who can\u2019t take care of themselves\u201d is no higher today than it was twenty-five years ago. (Meanwhile, Republican support for that idea has plummeted.) A Gallup poll last December showed that a majority of Democrats, fifty-six per cent, view \u201cbig government\u201d as a greater threat to the nation\u2019s future than \u201cbig business\u201d\u2014a number that must, to some extent, reflect concerns about government eavesdropping, but is also consistent with polls taken well before the Snowden revelations about the N.S.A. The decades-long societal slide of our faith in government continues\u2014not without interruption, but without real hope for a reversal. In this sense, the chief obstacle to a populist future might be the populist agenda itself.\n\nThat\u2019s why, even as they advocate new and expanded federal programs, populists would do well to develop a platform that does not rest, in most instances, on the appropriations process. So much of the real action is elsewhere now, outside the nation\u2019s capital, a lot of it in the private sector\u2014a source of creative, disruptive energy that progressives ought not to reject reflexively but to harness, where possible, to the social aims that they seek. This would not constitute stale split-the-difference liberalism; it would be pragmatism, of an improvisational, even enlightened sort, and might just help Democrats realize their ideals.\n\nSo go ahead and call centrism soulless, craven, corporatist, or anything you like. But, during recent decades, Democrats have found the political middle ground to be vast and bountiful. That territory has also been increasingly abandoned by Republicans, who tend to cluster on the edge of cliffs. Why would Democrats want to join them there?\n\nJeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Clinton, is the author of \u201cSupreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court\u201d and is a partner at West Wing Writers.
