Health-care companies in the S&P 500 have had the fewest negative earnings surprises and the most positive ones for the quarter from April to June, according to Goldman Sachs.

The brokerage says that as of Aug. 7, 49 of the 53 health-care companies in the index had reported, and only 8% — four companies — had a negative surprise, while 84%, or 42, had positive surprises. That far exceeds the 75% of financial firms that had positive surprises and handily beats the overall average of 67%.

Further, the upside surprise of S&P health-care firms was 6%, beating the 5% posted by financials and double the S&P average of 3%. It also leads all sectors in revisions to second-half earnings estimates, rising by an average of 3.3%, with average sale forecasts up nearly 1%.

Health care has ranked with utilities and information technology as the top market performers, with all up 9% year-to-date, the report says. It also appears health care is still hot in the second half of the year.

“The health-care sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by 80 [basis points] since the end of June and valuations reflect the sector’s strong fundamentals,” the report goes on to say. “Along with consumer staples, the health-care sector ranks as the most expensive in the S&P 500.”
