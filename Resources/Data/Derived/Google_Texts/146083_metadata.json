The tear-jerking video is quickly warming hearts around the world, and in only a few days has already been viewed over a million times on YouTube.\n\nHoward, 92, and his wife Laura, 93, have been married for 73 years, but it\u2019s clear that their love has not faded over the years. The footage was captured by the couple\u2019s granddaughter, Erin Solari, who explained that the song Howard sang, You\u2019ll Never Know by Rosemary Clooney, is the couple\u2019s \u201clove song\u201d and used to comfort Laura when Howard was away at war in WWII.\n\n\u201cAt family gatherings, it was not uncommon for the two of them to sing this song together, each taking a verse and serenading the other,\u201d Solari wrote on YouTube. \u201c In fact, after 50 years of marriage, they renewed their vows and performed this song as a duet for the entire family at the reception.\u201d\n\nAlthough Laura is now blinded by macular degeneration, she still gazes into her sweetheart\u2019s eyes, and for a moment the couple seem lost in each other\u2019s company. According to Solari, at the time the video was posted, her grandmother Laura was given only a week to live, but she has now been deemed well enough to return back home. She is still resting peacefully in her own bed, surrounded by her family\u2019s love and is aware of the international fame her video has caused.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "true, love, lasts, 92, year, old, man, serenades, dying, wife, hospital, bed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A heart-warming video of a 92-year-old man singing to his dying wife is quickly going viral.", "title": "Try To Keep A Dry Eye Watching This 92-Year-Old Man Serenade His Dying Wife", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/true-love-lasts-92-year-old-man-serenades-dying-wife-hospital-bed-353716", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/22/true-love-lasts-92-year-old-man-serenades-dying-wife-hospital-bed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A heart-warming video of a 92-year-old man singing to his dying wife is quickly going viral.", "title": "Try To Keep A Dry Eye Watching This 92-Year-Old Man Serenade His Dying Wife", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/true-love-lasts-92-year-old-man-serenades-dying-wife-hospital-bed-353716", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/22/true-love-lasts-92-year-old-man-serenades-dying-wife-hospital-bed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/22/true-love-lasts-92-year-old-man-serenades-dying-wife-hospital-bed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-22T13:20:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T13:20:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A heart-warming video of a 92-year-old man singing to his dying wife is quickly going viral."}, "article_summary": "A video featuring a 92-year-old man singing to his dying wife has recently gone viral after the couple\u2019s granddaughter posted the footage online.\nHoward, 92, and his wife Laura, 93, have been married for 73 years, but it\u2019s clear that their love has not faded over the years.\nShe is still resting peacefully in her own bed, surrounded by her family\u2019s love and is aware of the international fame her video has caused.\nThe footage was captured by the couple\u2019s granddaughter, Erin Solari, who explained that the song Howard sang, You\u2019ll Never Know by Rosemary Clooney, is the couple\u2019s \u201clove song\u201d and used to comfort Laura when Howard was away at war in WWII.\nThe tear-jerking video is quickly warming hearts around the world, and in only a few days has already been viewed over a million times on YouTube."}
