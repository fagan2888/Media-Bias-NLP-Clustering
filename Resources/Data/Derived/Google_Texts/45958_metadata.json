Chuck Schumer (D-NY) ripped the hypocrisy behind Ted Cruz\u2019s promise to filibuster any Obama Supreme Court nominee during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\nCruz promised that he would filibuster any Obama nominee to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court.\n\nVideo:\n\n\n\nABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos\n\nTranscript via ABC\u2019s This Week:\n\n\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u2014 does that mean that you\u2019re going to filibuster anyone \u2014 anyone that President Obama nominates?\n\nCRUZ: Absolutely. This should be a decision for the people, George. We\u2019ve got an election. And, you know, Democrats \u2014 I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton or with Bernie Sanders and take the case to the people, what vision of the Supreme Court do you want?\n\nLet the election decide it. If the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election.\n\nBut you know what, I don\u2019t think the American people want a court that will strip our religious liberties. I don\u2019t think the American people want a court that will mandate unlimited abortion on demand, partial birth abortion with taxpayer funding and no parental notification. And I don\u2019t think the American people want a court that will write the Second Amendment out of \u201cThe Constitution.\u201d\n\nLater during the same program, the number two Democrat in the Senate, and a member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) lit into Cruz, \u201cYou know, the Constitution, Ted Cruz holds the Constitution, you know, when he walks through the halls of Congress. Let him show me the clause that says president\u2019s only president for three years. Does this mean we don\u2019t hold hearings on anything? The president shouldn\u2019t nominate Cabinet ministers? It certainly might mean the Republicans shouldn\u2019t repeal Obamacare in the fourth year.\u201d\n\nVideo of Sen. Schumer on ABC\u2019s This Week:\n\n\n\nABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos\n\nThe Republican argument that the Constitution is invalidated because it is an election year is a contrived bit of nonsense that the right would never use if a Republican president was in his final year in office and faced with an unexpected Supreme Court vacancy.\n\nCruz\u2019s filibuster threat is another attempt by the senator from Texas to use the United States Senate as a prop for his presidential campaign. Republicans are facing the prospect of being punished by the voters if they obstruct Obama\u2019s nominee. What Cruz suggested was more self-serving political suicide from the man who brought the Party of Lincoln the government shutdown.\n\nSchumer nailed it. Republicans love the Constitution until they are called upon to fulfill their constitutional duties. There is nothing in the Constitution that states that Supreme Court nominees can only be nominated and confirmed in non-presidential election years. The ploy to block Obama\u2019s nominee is more empty pandering to the base that is likely to cost the Republican Party both the Senate and the White House in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
