But if the DNA evidence remains intact, Worthy said, it will be critical in matching serial rapists in Wayne County and across the country. \u201cWe have over 100 people that have come to the city of Detroit, gotten away with rape and gone on to rape others,\u201d Worthy told the council. \u201cOur rapists have gone to 21 other jurisdictions and raped again. It is not a Detroit-only problem. They have gone on to rape with impunity.\u201d Worthy said it took nine months to sort through the kits and locate corresponding reports to create a database to prevent future cases from being lost. The problem, she said, was \u201cnot a Detroit problem,\u201d it\u2019s an international problem. Each kit, Worthy added, cost about $1,200 to $1,500 to process. An overwhelming majority of the victims want to go forward to ensure their rape case is prosecuted, she said, adding the the process can last at least five years. \u201cIt\u2019s not like television,\u201d Worthy told the council. \u201c It doesn\u2019t take just a few seconds to test a rape kit for DNA. It\u2019s a very long process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The processed kits have helped identify close to 100 serial rapists linked to sex crimes in several jurisdictions", "title": "Detroit is still fighting to process close to 10,000 untested rape kits", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The processed kits have helped identify close to 100 serial rapists linked to sex crimes in several jurisdictions", "title": "Detroit is still fighting to process close to 10,000 untested rape kits", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/10/detroit_is_still_fighting_to_process_more_than_10000_untested_rape_kits/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/460x.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The processed kits have helped identify close to 100 serial rapists linked to sex crimes in several jurisdictions", "title": "Detroit is still fighting to process close to 10,000 untested rape kits", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/460x.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Detroit, Rape, Rape Culture, rape kits, Sexual assault, sexual violence, Violence Against Women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec1a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Detroit, Rape, Rape Culture, rape kits, Sexual assault, sexual violence, Violence Against Women, Life News, NewsA Michigan county prosecutor has been leading the fight to process more than 10,000 untested rape kits in the Detroit area despite being \u201cseverely\u201d underfunded and understaffed in the effort.\nThe problem, she said, was \u201cnot a Detroit problem,\u201d it\u2019s an international problem.\n\u201cWe have over 100 people that have come to the city of Detroit, gotten away with rape and gone on to rape others,\u201d Worthy told the council.\n\u201c It doesn\u2019t take just a few seconds to test a rape kit for DNA.\nBut if the DNA evidence remains intact, Worthy said, it will be critical in matching serial rapists in Wayne County and across the country."}
