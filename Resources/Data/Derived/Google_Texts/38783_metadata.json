Fewer still came up with ideas of how to make it politically palatable if the court favoured the administration.\n\n\u201cFive years in, this is no longer about a law,\u201d said a triumphant president in an address from the White House Rose Garden. \u201cThis is not about the Affordable Care Act as legislation, or Obamacare as a political football. This is healthcare in America.\u201d\n\nBut despite the euphoria in the West Wing on Thursday over what Obama considers a mission accomplished, one uncomfortable question remains: what about the uninsured Americans, an estimated 35 million people, who have not so far been helped by Obamacare?\n\nOne answer lies in persuading those Republican-controlled states which have resisted its local implementation to take up an offer from the federal government to pay for extended Medicaid coverage. This was designed to fill the gap between those adults not poor enough to qualify for existing Medicaid assistance but not wealthy enough to pay for their own insurance on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nBut even if every state in the country was persuaded to adopt the Medicaid expansion, there would still be millions whose basic healthcare plans \u2013 often full of limitations and co-pays \u2013 fell short of what many progressives see as the long-term goal: making sure every American has access to healthcare in their hour of need.\n\nThis is certainly what the president\u2019s passionate rhetoric implies he is seeking.\n\n\u201cThe rugged individualism that defines America has always been bound by a shared set of values,\u201d Obama told the Catholic Health Association earlier this month, \u201can enduring sense that we\u2019re in this together, that America is not a place where we simply turn away from the sick, or turn our backs on the tired, the poor, the huddled masses.\u201d\n\nThe president has also conceded that the complex system of the private insurance and public marketplaces at the heart of the ACA is not necessarily where he would chose to begin if he was designing a healthcare system from scratch.\n\nIn the past, Obama has been more forceful still in advocating for an alternative model \u2013 often known as the \u201csingle-payer\u201d system \u2013 in which the state takes on full responsibility for purchasing healthcare from private hospitals: a form, in effect, of universal Medicaid that looks more like the Medicare system in place for the elderly.\n\n\u201cA single-payer healthcare plan, that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see,\u201d Obama was recorded telling supporters in a video believed to have been shot in 2003 .\n\n\u201cBut we may not get there immediately,\u201d he added, with prescient understatement. \u201cFirst we have got to take back the White House, we have got to take back the Senate and we have got to take back the House [of Representatives].\n\nThe single-payer system most often cited as a possible model is that in place in Canada. While few, if any, US politicians have advocated the full nationalisation of healthcare in place in the UK, a step in that direction would be a major symbolic shift in American political thinking.\n\nRelated: John Roberts saved Obamacare again \u2013 and used Antonin Scalia\u2019s words to do it | Scott Lemieux\n\nBut such a huge step is precisely what many Democrats now argue is necessary \u2013 not only to deal with the remaining gaps in the system, and relatively poor overall health outcomes by international standards, but as a way to tackle soaring costs that have only partially been brought under control by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the United States in the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare to all [its citizens] \u2013 and 35 million of our citizens today still lack insurance \u2013 it would have been an outrage to throw 6.4 million more people off health insurance,\u201d said leftwing presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in a statement welcoming the court decision.\n\n\u201cWhat the United States should do is join every other major nation and recognize that healthcare is a right of citizenship,\u201d he added. \u201cA Medicare-for-all, single-payer system would provide better care at less cost for more Americans.\u201d\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley, the other main challenger from the left to the Democratic 2016 frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, was slightly more cautious but expressed similar sentiment.\n\n\u201cNow that the supreme court has, once again, upheld the Affordable Care Act, we must continue to build and improve upon this hard won-progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the national goal of universal coverage now affirmed, we must reduce costs by improving wellness.\n\n\u201cInnovations for better coordinated care, personalised medicine, and the alignment of profit incentives to promote wellness make all of this possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Clinton has favoured the pragmatism of Obama in office rather than the universal healthcare ambitions of the younger Obama.\n\nHaving endured the scars of trying, and failing, to push through similar reforms during her husband\u2019s presidency, the former secretary of state is cautious about getting too far ahead of the political realities.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t perfect, but the evidence is clear: it\u2019s working,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nBut like the White House, Clinton said the journey was far from over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve fought for the promise of quality, affordable healthcare for every American for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to stop now.\u201d\n\nThe big question for her, and other mainstream Democrats, is this: if they can stop Republicans from rolling back Obamacare, should they shoot for something a little more perfect next time around?\n\nguardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2015", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Doctor-examines-skin-rash-on-a-man-with-chickenpox-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Obamacare ruling: What about the 35 million people who are still uninsured?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadd5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve fought for the promise of quality, affordable healthcare for every American for decades,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t perfect, but the evidence is clear: it\u2019s working,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u201cThis is not about the Affordable Care Act as legislation, or Obamacare as a political football.\nThis is healthcare in America.\u201dBut despite the euphoria in the West Wing on Thursday over what Obama considers a mission accomplished, one uncomfortable question remains: what about the uninsured Americans, an estimated 35 million people, who have not so far been helped by Obamacare?\n\u201cNow that the supreme court has, once again, upheld the Affordable Care Act, we must continue to build and improve upon this hard won-progress,\u201d he said."}
