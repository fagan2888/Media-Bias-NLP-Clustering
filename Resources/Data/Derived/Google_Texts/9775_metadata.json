It\u2019s not that Perlstein has changed, but the stature of his subject matter most certainly has. Barry Goldwater had long been a neglected, if not a forgotten historical figure, and Perlstein\u2019s sharply observed account of his turn at the apex of American politics earned wide praise from conservatives for exactly the same reason that his account of Reagan\u2019s rise has earned such enmity. A bogus plagiarism charge was even mounted to not only muddy the waters, but to actually try to prevent publication of his work.\n\nBecause the shift in conservatives\u2019 attitudes has been so dramatic, fewer have noticed how others have also shifted. Perlstein, understandably, has picked up on it.\n\n\u201cMy stupidest reviews come from centrists desperate to cling to myth of a sensible right,\u201d he tweeted on Dec. 15, linking to his response to a review by Jacob Weisberg in the journal Democracy. Weisberg, not incidentally, is working on his own Reagan biography, but there\u2019s something much deeper than preemptive turf war tensions brewing between them. And when UC Berkeley economist/econoblogger Brad DeLong tweeted back, \u201cOK, I will grant you Jacob Weinberg. Who else?,\u201d Perlstein responded, \u201cSam Tanenhaus. Damon Linker [here] (he wasn\u2019t all that bad). Robert Kaiser [here],\u201d clearly indicating he had a body of reviews in mind. (When Salon spoke with him, Perlstein added Geoffrey Kabaservice and Michael Kimmage to the list.)\n\nPerlstein\u2019s got a point. Dispelling centrist and progressive myths about the right has been one of his key motivating factors as a historian from the beginning, and nobody really likes having their myths smashed to pieces\u2014though some mind a lot more than others. However, Perlstein\u2019s myth busting is not just to \u201cexpose conservative hypocrisy\u201d or some related concern, as some have mistakenly supposed, but to get centrists and progressives to actually see what conservatives are doing, and why it\u2019s not hypocritical in light of their worldview and values. \u201cTo beat conservatism, grasshopper, learn to think like a conservative,\u201d Perlstein wrote in a blog post I\u2019ll return to below. Thus, far from distorting his vision with respect to conservatism, as his centrist critics suppose, Perlstein\u2019s political commitments fuel his motivation to be accurate, precise and insightful.\n\nAll this seems to go right over his critics\u2019 heads, and indeed much of their criticism devolved into methodological griping\u2014some of it sloppy to the point of being grievously inaccurate. At first Perlstein expressed a reluctance to respond, when Salon contacted him. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to say too much because it\u2019s kind of ungrateful to complain about reviews. I really am flattered and thrilled,\u201d he began, echoing his opening remarks in the Atlantic, when he responded to its review by Sam Tanenhaus, titled \u201cThe Gonzo Historian.\u201d But he did open up, though he repeatedly qualified his remarks. \u201cI\u2019m getting reviewed in the Atlantic. I\u2019m on the bestseller list, getting to travel around and write books. It ain\u2019t that raw. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s helping advance an understanding of what\u2019s going on in America.\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping our historical discussion.\u201d\n\nThe root of such thinking is at least twofold: first, a belief in a left-right political spectrum in which both sides are mirror reflections of one another, and second, a belief in a \u201cbalanced\u201d center that can somehow maintain its elevated position above the fray, untouched by the sordid realm it\u2019s irrevocably embedded in\u2014what longtime journalism critic Jay Rosen mockingly describes as \u201dthe view from nowhere.\u201d It\u2019s a weird contradictory pair of assumptions, each questionable in its own right, but which combine so awkwardly as to discourage any critical self-reflection. It is, in fact, its own strange mythic worldview\u2014a point we\u2019ll return to below.\n\n\u201cThese people who identify themselves as non-ideological, or post-partisan, or centrist, position themselves as not interested in ideology, but they\u2019re perfectly obsessed with ideology, they\u2019re just drenched in ideology, because they\u2019re always weighing every utterance of themselves or others for bias,\u201d Perlstein observed. \u201cIf you believe that there must be some abstract idea of left or right\u2026 you\u2019re always going to be taking an ideological temperature, instead of just seeing the text, clearly, and evaluating it on an invention evidentiary basis.\u201d\n\nHence the repeatedly bubbling-up assumption that any critical remark he makes about Reagan must implicitly be praise for liberals, whose faults he is blind to, right? Er, not so much. \u201cI\u2019m not very nice to liberals,\u201d Perlstein noted. \u201cOne of my reviewers said that Carter [in this book] is almost like a con man. I don\u2019t have too many heroes in these books. Maybe Martin Luther King, he\u2019s pretty much the only one.\u201d\n\nThe reason is fairly simple: He\u2019s not that enamored with power. \u201cWhat gets a little creepy with this is Reagan\u2019s a winner, right? And I suspect a lot of these guys identify with a winner. They identify with power. And I see my role as standing outside of power and trying to understand it.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Perlstein said, \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to me, it kind of reminds me of Lionel Trilling\u2019s old jape about conservatives, that they don\u2019t have any real ideas, they\u2019re just irritable mental gestures that resemble ideas, so there\u2019s really not a lot of\u2013it\u2019s very reactive.\u201d\n\nTurning back to the tweet, and the \u201cmyth of a sensible right,\u201d if we focus on the American right itself, what Perlstein is pointing out must surely be true\u2014if the right were \u201csensible,\u201d as centrists and progressives generally understand the term, they\u2019d have packed up shop following Goldwater\u2019s defeat. Not being \u201csensible\u201d in those terms is part of their defining core. The interesting question, then, is just what does that mean? How do different sorts of logic work? If one sort of logic applies to \u201csensible\u201d/\u201creasonable politics,\u201d then what sort of logic applies to \u201cinsensible\u201d/\u201cunreasonable politics\u201d\u2014and this instance of it in particular?\n\nTwo things must be noted right away: First, that Perlstein is talking about the American right collectively, not about any one individual in particular. The behavior he\u2019s referring to is what we can observe about how the actually existing American right behaves in situation after situation\u2014doubling down in opposition to any kind of gun safety legislation after Newtown, for example, or refusing to pass comprehensive immigration reform after losing the 2012 election\u2014when all \u201creasonable\u201d expectations point directly in the opposite direction. Particular individual conservatives who do act reasonably certainly exist, and if they\u2019re prominent enough they get publicly disowned for their troubles, unless they choose and manage a more graceful exit. The above-mentioned Damon Linker, author of \u201cThe Theocons,\u201d is one such individual, and like several others has come to be seen as more of a centrist (think John Dean or Kevin Phillips, though not Bruce Bartlett), though that\u2019s not where he began.\n\nSecond, that there\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with a political movement being \u201cunreasonable\u201d\u2014it depends on what they\u2019re being unreasonable about. After all, the leaders of black slave rebellions such as Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vessey and Nat Turner were surely unreasonable in their demands, and generations later, their unreasonableness triumphed. So merely noting that the American right is not sensible or reasonable does not automatically say nearly as much as some people seem to think about the subjects described; one must ask what they\u2019re unreasonable about\u2014and why. This is not an attempt to attack and slander, but to truly understand.\n\nIn his responses to Tanenhaus and Weisberg, Perlstein focused primarily on what they got wrong about his book descriptively\u2014clearly demonstrable failures to accurately reflect the content they were commenting on. This is the most basic level on which a reviewer should be held to account. But his tweet points to a deeper argument that goes to the issue of overarching interpretation, and suggests a connection between the two\u2014the constant ideological straining to assert the existence of a sensible right produces distorted readings of his work, with mundane sorts of careless misreading as one of its telltale consequences.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s one of centrism\u2019s primary conceits that only those to its left or right are tainted by ideology, but just how the center escapes from the world of politics it\u2019s in the center of\u2014that, my friends, never gets explained. Instead, we get repeated displays of ideologically loaded assumptions\u2014it\u2019s just that the ideology involved is a centrist one. To show what I mean, here\u2019s a passage from Weisberg\u2019s review:\n\nIf he were willing to look more critically at the left, the way he does at the right, Perlstein might give more weight to the visible bridge of Reagan\u2019s stated views. By the mid-1970s, the failures of Great Society liberalism were evident: Despite some popular and meaningful accomplishments like Medicaid, the poorly thought-out War on Poverty was arguably doing more harm than good. Broken welfare and public housing systems were not liberating the urban poor, but trapping a new underclass in a new kind of poverty. Crime, bad schools, and the threat of busing were driving the middle class away from America\u2019s cities.\n\nThere are multiple problems with this passage, some of which can be illuminated by quoting from a March 2013 Perlstein blog post at the Nation on the Democrats\u2019 internal ideological struggles, where he touches on this exact same period of time\u2014along with references to other eras when related struggles raged. Because he\u2019s not pre-committed to balancing powerful figures on \u201cboth sides\u201d against one another, what he actually says completely escapes Weisberg\u2019s mental universe, or at least so it would appear.\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War didn\u2019t bring ideological unity back to the Democrats, Perlstein notes; rather \u201cthe first post-Vietnam election, post-Watergate, in 1974, inaugurated today\u2019s order of battle between the right- and left-leaning wings of the party.\u201d He writes that Reagan had warned that the influx of new Democrats elected that year\u2014mostly from the suburbs\u2013would lead to \u201ca flood of expensive, spectacular, and ill-conceived legislation which can\u2019t be derailed or even tempered by the voices of moderation,\u201d but he turned out to be spectacularly wrong:\n\nThirty-six-year-old Gary Hart was more or less the ideologist of the bunch. His memoir of the McGovern presidential campaign, which he had managed two years earlier, called liberalism \u201cnear bankruptcy.\u201dTime called him a \u201cliberal.\u201d \u201cTraditional \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 slogans,\u201d he wrote back in an angry letter to the editor, \u201care simply not adequate to cope.\u201d He said the best way out of the energy crisis was \u201cto work together. There will be a lot more cooperative ventures between the environmentalists and the energy developers.\u201d His stock speech, \u201cThe End of the New Deal,\u201d argued that his party was hamstrung by the very ideology that was supposed to be its glory\u2014that \u201cif there is a problem, create an agency and throw money at the problem.\u201d It included lines that could have come from Commentary, the neoconservative magazine Jerry Brown, who was friends with Hart, liked to read and quote. Like: \u201cThe ballyhooed War on Poverty succeeded only in raising the expectations, but not the living conditions, of the poor.\u201d (That was false: the poverty rate was 17.3 percent when LBJ\u2019s Economic Opportunity Act was enacted in 1964 and 11.2 percent as Gary Hart spoke.)\n\nWhat this passage shows is that a) Perlstein is quite aware of the complexities Weisberg alludes to, b) as well as the policy lies woven into Weisberg\u2019s recitation of the conventional wisdom retrospective on the era, but that c) these complexities were playing out within the Democratic Party, not in the GOP, the primary locus of political developments chronicled in \u201cThe Invisible Bridge,\u201d where d) that book\u2019s primary protagonist utterly failed to see the complexities that Weisberg claims are fatally missing from his story; e) moreover the fact that ideological centrists like Hart and Brown were the \u201cnew blood\u201d in the Democratic Party fundamentally contradicted Reagan\u2019s portrayal of how the Democrats were relentlessly pulling the country leftward to its doom.\n\nBottom line: Perlstein shows that a nuanced picture of political history can coexist perfectly well with a simultaneous tale of stark ideological polarization in a polity as large and complicated as America\u2019s. If anything, this brief description of what was happening with the Democrats makes Perlstein\u2019s case even stronger, since it provides precisely the sort of rich complexity his critics claim that he lacks. Moreover, just because his extended book project recounts the multi-decade history of a dominant sociopolitical movement, that does not mean for a minute that he thinks it exhausts the history of the era\u2014it is those like Weisberg and Tanenhaus and others who misread him who are guilty of this confusion, not Perlstein.\n\nBut that leaves undiscussed the precise nature of the unreasonable right as Perlstein understands it\u2014and this is precisely where his critics ought to have focused their attention, had they not been ideologically so befuddled. Of course, the right is not unreasonable in its own terms\u2014but that\u2019s just the point. The problem that Perlstein is pointing to is not so much a problem with the right\u2014as his centrist critics mistake him to be saying\u2014it\u2019s a problem with the rest of us not understanding the nature of the right, what it\u2019s up to, and what constitutes reasonable behavior in light of what it is. The fullest answer to that comes from Perlstein\u2019s book project itself, of course. But he\u2019s dealt with it frequently in other venues as well, including two series of blog posts at the Nation from 2013. The first, in early 2013, ran under the banner \u201cNothing New Under the Wingnut Sun,\u201d and it illustrated how key features of the conservative movement today have been around for decades, but it includes commentary on why those features came into being in the first place. The second series, under the banner \u201cThinking Like a Conservative,\u201d takes us deeper inside conservative thought processes, illuminating the perspective from which their actions are not unreasonable at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right attacked an acclaimed historian's Reagan book.
