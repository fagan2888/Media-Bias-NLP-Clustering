Just weeks after having her baby, doctors delivered devastating news to an Iowa mom.

The little moments in life make big battles easier to fight for Danielle Pint.

“No matter how rough it gets, there's always hope,” Pint said.

Pint isn't talking about the challenges of raising three young boys, she's talking about her health. Two years ago, doctors diagnosed the young mother with breast cancer.

"Treated it and went into remission," she said.

But the cancer returned when she least expected it.

“I think I was more in denial. I wanted to believe what everyone told me, ‘Oh, when you're 30 and pregnant it’s so different, everything changes,’” Pint said.

Pint felt a lot of pain during her third trimester of pregnancy. She never thought there would be a problem, but as her baby was growing inside her, so was the cancer.

The young mother didn't catch it until after Garret was born.



“Not only had it come out of remission, but it was already at stage 4,” she said.

From her breast to her bones, her lung and liver, the disease spread.

“Some doctors think it’s because of all the hormonal changes while I was pregnant that caused it to come back,” Pint said. "But, I really, I can't go there at all. It's a miracle that he was even born, and it's a miracle that I want to hang onto."

Hanging on to hope, her family finds strength and support from friends and from their faith. They need it more than ever moving forward with treatments.

“I've never felt so loved and supported as I do right now,” she said.

The family needs financial support, too. Pint’s husband had left his job to start a new career when the cancer came back, and the family doesn't have health insurance. Friends are hosting a fundraiser this Saturday from 1-5 p.m. at the Reed Center in Bellevue.
