Its physical therapy department, with a staff of 60, features some state-of-the-art equipment, like the Alter-G anti-gravity treadmill \u2014 pretty much what it sounds like \u2014 and a gizmo that analyzes your balance when you step on board, to help therapists determine an appropriate rehab program.\n\nRecently I stopped by for a celebration of the Life Care Center's latest honor, an Excellence in Quality national award from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living. The Sarasota nursing home is now one of only 18 gold-level winners in the country since 1996, and the first-ever facility in Florida to achieve the distinction.\n\nUsing the program's Malcolm Baldridge quality criteria administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Willingham and her staff constantly analyzed their own performance as they moved up in the annual rankings, from bronze to silver to gold. Willingham believes the discipline of this process helped make a good team better.\n\nShe is especially proud of the Alter-G therapy tool, which involves encasing the legs in a suit inside a chamber that creates a sense of weightlessness.\n\n\"People who can't bear any weight on their legs have told us that this is the first time in years when they have been able to experience themselves walking,\" she said.\n\nAlso new at Life Care is one of the company's specialized rehab wings for cardiovascular patients. The 10 private rooms are furnished with homelike touches and massage recliners, designed to help people recover after hospitalizations for heart procedures.\n\n\"This is for those patients who could go home from the hospital and don't need 24-hour skilled nursing,\" Willingham explained, \"but for whatever reason are not able to get the care they need at home \u2014 if they live alone or their loved one isn't able to look after them. They have their privacy and freedom, but they wear monitors, so that if anything goes wrong they get immediate attention.\"\n\nPrograms like this cardio wing, tailored to an elder's specific needs and personal preferences, reflect a new awareness that person-centered care must replace the dehumanizing one-size-fits-all nursing home operations of the past. As the lines continue to blur between home and facility, and short- and long-term care, elders will be getting better care at more reasonable prices.\n\nSOUTH COUNTY HELP\n\nSome 300 people with Parkinson's disease who live in South Sarasota County now have a place in North Port where they can find educational and emotional support.\n\nThese patients, says Neuro Challenge Foundation executive director Judith L. Bell, \"have been asking for resources, educational seminars and support groups closer to home.\" So donors helped make office and meeting space available at 5600 Peace River Road. Carisa Campanella, a foundation care coordinator, is available to meet with families there on Wednesdays and Fridays by appointment.
