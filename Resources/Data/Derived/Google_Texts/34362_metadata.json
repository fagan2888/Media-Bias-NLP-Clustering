U.S. Private First Class Bradley Manning, also known as Chelsea Manning, pled guilty to providing cables to Mr. Assange.\n\nSince June 2012, Mr. Assange has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning about a sexual assault case. However, he and his associates provided help to Mr. Snowden when he fled to Russia last year.\n\nMr. Assange said he personally faces prosecution by a federal attorney in Virginia, despite reports that the U.S. investigation into his activities had been dropped.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, now it continues,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said Friday it is clear that President Obama would not have unveiled his new spying reforms had it not been for leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers, calling Mr. Obama's address on the controversy \"embarrassing.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said Friday it is clear that President Obama would not have unveiled his new spying reforms had it not been for leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers, calling Mr. Obama\u2019s address on the controversy \u201cembarrassing.\u201d", "title": "Wikileaks\u2019 Assange: Obama\u2019s snooping speech \u2018embarrassing\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/17/wikileaks-assange-obamas-snooping-speech-embarrass/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/24/4_242013_b3-assange8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/24/4_242013_b3-assange8201.jpg", "description": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said Friday it is clear that President Obama would not have unveiled his new spying reforms had it not been for leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and other", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wikileaks\u2019 Assange: Obama\u2019s snooping speech \u2018embarra"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Julian Assange, Edward Snowden"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda735\"", "article_summary": "As for the content Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, Mr. Assange said he was not impressed.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s embarrassing for a head of state to go on like that for 45 minutes and say almost nothing,\u201d Mr. Assange told CNN.\nMr. Assange said he personally faces prosecution by a federal attorney in Virginia, despite reports that the U.S. investigation into his activities had been dropped.\nPrivate First Class Bradley Manning, also known as Chelsea Manning, pled guilty to providing cables to Mr. Assange.\nSince June 2012, Mr. Assange has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning about a sexual assault case."}
