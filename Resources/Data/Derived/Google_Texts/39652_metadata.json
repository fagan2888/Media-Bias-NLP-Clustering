Hope nobody stayed awake late for a discussion of how to combat climate change as the top seven GOP presidential candidates debated in South Carolina.\n\nAnd nobody held their breath for a thoughtful examination of the growing wealth disparity or how to improve health care or protect Social Security. That stuff\u2019s for liberals and Democrats or \u201cweak\u201d people, as Republican front-runner Donald Trump might call them.\n\nNo, Thursday\u2019s main mood on the Fox Business Network was an exchange of verbal horse manure among all seven, especially the night\u2019s three winners\u2014Mr. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio. Everyone ended up with the same look and the same smell.\n\nImagine, for example, Mr. Trump emerging on the high road after an exchange of innuendos and cheap shots about New York City. It came after Mr. Trump continued to wonder if the foreign-born Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, is really a \u201cnatural-born\u201d American, as the Constitution insists for presidents.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s The New York Times. They\u2019re almost always wrong.\u2019\n\nMr. Cruz then overplayed his hurt feelings as he painted Mr. Trump as a typical New York liberal.\n\n\u201cEveryone understand the values in New York City are socially liberal, pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage and focus around money and the media,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cNot a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.\u201d He implied strongly that Mr. Trump is a fake conservative.\n\nMr. Trump, a television professional, senses the mood of the medium. He slowed his tempo and lowered his tone of voice. Instead of answering on Mr. Cruz\u2019s chosen ground, he spoke of Ground Zero and 9-11 and how nearly 3,000 people died in a terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan in 2001.\n\n\u201cNo place on earth could have handled that more beautifully, more humanely, than New York,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump added that \u201cthe smell of death\u201d lingered for months in Lower Manhattan and that \u201ceveryone in the world loved New York\u201d in those sympathetic times. Then, throwing a loose handful of schmutz at the alleged Texan who admits he was born in Canada of a Cuban father, Mr. Trump said \u201cThat was a very insulting statement that Ted made\u201d about New York.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Cruz noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s mother was from Scotland but gallantly said he would not make it an issue. Turning to other rivals, Mr. Trump called Jeb Bush \u201cweak.\u201d\n\n\u2018This guy\u2019s a petulant child. I hope the President is watching tonight. We are going to kick your rear end out of the White House.\u2019\n\nAnd on it went. Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, said Democratic leader Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation. Mr. Rubio said President Obama considers America \u201can arrogant power that needs to be cut down to size.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump repeated his demagoguery about immigrants who are not women and children but big, strong, young men who might be \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d terrorists and not really refugees from the Syrian civil war. Mr. Cruz, when questioned about a New York Times story regarding his fishy finances, called it a \u201chit piece\u201d and explained it as an accounting mistake.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the best hit The New York Times has got, they better go back to the well,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, without denying any fact in the article. No doubt, Times editors have more than one reporter checking into the history of Mr. Cruz, a cunning and calculating operator who is said to be the most disliked man in Washington.\n\nMr. Trump also took a swing at the Paper of Record over something he said about Chinese tariffs. \u201cIt\u2019s The New York Times,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re almost always wrong.\u201d Then he continued on with many words that seemed to confirm everything the Times wrote.\n\nMr. Cruz tried to push his \u201cNew York\u201d innuendo against Mr. Trump by saying he should stop playing \u201cBorn in the U.S.A\u201d by Bruce Springsteen at his rallies and replace it with \u201cNew York, New York\u201d by Frank Sinatra.\n\nBut whenever Mr. Cruz got a punch in, Mr. Trump landed a counter punch.\n\nCRUZ: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Take it from Laurence Tribe.\u201d\n\nMr. Tribe of Harvard is Mr. Cruz\u2019s former law professor and appeared late Thursday on CNN and MSNBC to say that, indeed, Mr. Cruz\u2019s \u201cnatural-born\u201d citizenship and those like it make for a question never heard by or ruled upon by the Supreme Court.\n\nAs for Mr. Rubio, he seemed a bit overwrought when he said the current president believes in neither free enterprise nor the Constitution. All the candidates agreed that more guns and bullets would be good for the nation and that the key to stopping gun massacres is providing more mental health coverage while abolishing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong the also-rans, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie insulted Mr. Rubio (\u201cYou had your chance; you blew it\u201d) while on his way to insulting President Obama.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s a petulant child,\u201d Mr. Christie said of the Chief Executive. \u201cI hope the President is watching tonight. We are going to kick your rear end out of the White House.\u201d\n\nMr. Christie\u2019s violent words force curious thoughts. Could Mr. Christie do this himself? Did he really say he would kick the president\u2019s rear end?\n\nGiven the relative physical fitness levels of the two men, it would be a good bet that Mr. Obama just might open up an extra-large can of whup-ass and slam it repeatedly against the side of Jumbo\u2019s fat head.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s rigged. The whole damn thing. They\u2019re stealing everything from us and they\u2019re getting away with it, too.\u2019\n\nONE FINAL NOTE: In that the debate was sponsored by Fox Business Network, the logo of that channel appeared most of the time in five places on every screen shot, from every angle. The channel is right-wing and conservative and covers the Wall Street big shots with the big money. Tune in. See what wealthy people have to say. They always know what\u2019s best.\n\nBut a most unusual commercial aired early during the debate. It ran 2 minutes and 30 seconds long for a movie about a TV show called \u201cMoney Monster\u201d starring an anchorman called \u201cThe Wizard of Wall Street.\u201d Among the actors are Julia Roberts and George Clooney. From the looks of the film trailer, it appears that a terrorist crashes the set of a financial news channel and takes the anchorman hostage on live TV.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the real criminal, it\u2019s people like these guys,\u201d the terrorist says, once he fastens the explosive belts. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s rigged. The whole damn thing. They\u2019re stealing everything from us and they\u2019re getting away with it, too.\u201d The trailer ended with a lot of punching, shooting, screaming and glass breaking. They ought not to put such things on Republican debates. Viewers might put two and two together and then we\u2019ll all be throwing more than manure.\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Joe Lapointe", "sailthru.author": "Joe Lapointe", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-15-at-9-16-08-am.png?w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-15-at-9-16-08-am.png?w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 elections, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Fox, George Clooney, GOP, Jeb Bush, Julia Roberts, Marco Rubio, money monster, Republican Debate, Ted Cruz, Wall Street, obsPolitics, obsTV", "sailthru.section": "Culture", "keywords": "2016 elections, chris christie, donald trump, fox, george clooney, gop, jeb bush, julia roberts, marco rubio, money monster, republican debate, ted cruz, wall street", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-15-at-9-16-08-am.png?w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Trump-Cruz Debate Brawl Echoed by Graphic \u2018Money Monster\u2019 Trailer", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "joe-lapointe", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-15-at-9-16-08-am.png?w=50", "description": "They shouldn't run such commercials on Fox\u2014viewers might put two and two together and then we\u2019ll all be throwing manure.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/11633024.png?w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-01-15T14:33:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T14:45:15+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/joe-lapointe"}, "sailthru.description": "They shouldn't run such commercials on Fox\u2014viewers might put two and two together and then we\u2019ll all be throwing manure.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "They shouldn\u2019t run such commercials on Fox\u2014viewers might put two and two together and then we\u2019ll all be throwing manure.", "title": "Trump-Cruz Debate Brawl Echoed by Graphic \u2018Money Monster\u2019 Trailer", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/01/trump-cruz-debate-brawl-echoed-by-graphic-money-monster-trailer/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-15-at-9-16-08-am.png", "height": 328}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Joe Lapointe spent 20 years as a sports reporter for The New York Times and worked as a segment producer for Countdown With Keith Olbermann.
