A new political ad released today puts Pope Francis up against the conservative billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.

“[The Koch brothers] have bought the Republican Party and now they are trying to intimidate the Pope,” says a Spanish-speaking voiceover actress in the ad released by Bridge Project, the policy arm of the liberal American Bridge super PAC.
