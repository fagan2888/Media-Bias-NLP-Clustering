Asa Hutchinson's health care plan advancing in Arkansas's House of Representatives.\n\nArkansas\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion, branded as the private option, is headed to the House floor. The governor\u2019s proposal to continue the plan through 2016 and to create a task force to recommend Medicaid reforms afterward passed out of committee Tuesday.\n\nMedicaid expansion is part of the Affordable Care Act and consequently the state\u2019s acceptance of increased eligibility and federal funds can be politically contentious. The private option is the state\u2019s alternative to using the federally-run Medicaid program. It uses federal funds to purchase private insurance for over 200,000 low-income Arkansans. It\u2019s an issue that has divided Arkansas\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nRepresentative Josh Miller of Heber Springs is opposed to the private option and SB 96.\n\n\u201cI think if you go back and look at the last election, look at how folks spoke, I don\u2019t think our Republican leadership is in line with the sentiment of conservative, common sense voters in the state of Arkansas,\u201d said Miller.\n\nWhile Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, as well as legislative leadership, helped push the plan along, some conservatives who were vehemently opposed to the private option when it was created in 2013 are behind the bill. Republican Representative Joe Farrar is among them.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago I fought hard to stop the private option. I failed,\u201d said Farrer.\n\nWhile Hutchinson\u2019s plan calls for the private option to continue until its federal waiver expires in 2016, Farrar views it as a wind-down and consistent with his desire to end the plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not continuing the private option. In my eyes I\u2019m stopping the private option the way it was designed,\u201d said Farrer.\n\nAs for what happens when the private option ends, the task force should have recommendations. Public Health Committee Chair Kelley Linck said he wants the task force to keep Medicaid expansion, in some form.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s three major, overall things that can be done: nothing, a hybrid expansion or just pure expansion. Where would I lean? Personally, most likely, I think there will be some sort of hybrid expansion,\u201d said Linck.\n\nFarrar too says he\u2019s open to continuing to take increased Medicaid money to cover expanded income eligibility, up to around $16,000 a year for an individual, if it leads to larger Medicaid reforms \u2013 preferably receiving funds as a block grant.\n\n\u201cIf it saves the state of Arkansas money I\u2019ll insure everybody in the state of Arkansas, or give everybody in the state of Arkansas health care,\u201d said Farrer.\n\nUltimately the task force\u2019s recommendations, on whether or not to keep taking expanded federal funds to provide insurance to a larger pool of low-income people than in pre-Affordable Care Act times, could come down to who is on the task force. Membership wouldn\u2019t be announced until after final passage. Representative Miller isn\u2019t so sure legislators opposed to expanding Medicaid will have a place.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s hard to have confidence in something when you don\u2019t know who\u2019s on it. I think a lot of folks in Arkansas feel that way. There\u2019s a lack of trust right now,\u201d said Miller.\n\nThe measure headed to the House floor has already passed the Senate. It requires a three-fourths vote, something Representative Linck said is doable.\n\n\u201cI think we have the votes. Ultimately it\u2019s up to the 75 people but I believe the votes will be there as people see that this is the best way forward for Arkansas,\u201d said Linck.\n\nRepresentative Miller on the other hand hopes to make a last stand against any semblance of Medicaid expansion when the bill makes it to the House floor which could be as early as Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "Arkansas\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion, branded as the private option, is headed to the House floor.
