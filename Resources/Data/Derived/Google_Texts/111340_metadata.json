In it, Carson recounts meeting famed U.S. Army Gen. William Westmoreland in 1969 while he was a Junior ROTC student at a Detroit high school. According to the 1996 book, the general was so impressed by Carson\u2019s dedication to self-improvement that he promised the youth a \u201cfull scholarship\u201d to U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Ultimately, Carson would choose instead to pursue medical school.\n\nHowever, Politico\u2019s campaign reporter, Kyle Cheney, calls almost every aspect of this account into question. \u201cWest Point \u2026 has no record of Carson applying, much less being extended admission,\u201d Cheney wrote in a fact-checking investigation published on Friday. Campaign officials contacted by Politico also confirmed that the account is inaccurate.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn order to apply to West Point, Carson would have needed to secure the sponsorship of a member of Congress, then undergo \u201ca rigorous vetting process.\u201d If accepted, all students\u2019 expenses are covered, making Westmoreland\u2019s reported promise of a \u201cfull scholarship\u201d essentially meaningless.\n\nFurther, records of Westmoreland\u2019s travels show he was not in Detroit on Memorial Day in 1969, when the meeting took place according to \u201cGifted Hands.\u201d But, Cheney noted, \u201cThere are, however, several reports of an event in February of that year, similar to the one Carson described.\u201d\n\nAs the leader in a crowded field of Republican presidential hopefuls, the details of Carson\u2019s life are subject to constant media scrutiny. The results are not always flattering. In addition to questioning other details of his biography, journalists have unearthed some unusual statements the neurosurgeon made in the past.\n\nAn article published by MotherJones on Tuesday highlighted a video recorded during a 2014 book signing at the Nixon Presidential Library. The retired neurosurgeon quipped that the media \u201cunderestimated the intelligence of the American people. The people are not as stupid as they think they are. Many of them are stupid.\u201d Comparing American media to a dictatorship, he also said: \u201cWe\u2019d be Cuba if there were no Fox News.\u201d\n\nWatch \u201cBen Carson On Americans: Many Of Them Are Stupid\u201d from Mother Jones:\n\nOn Wednesday, BuzzFeed published a 1998 video in which Carson claims that the Egyptian pyramids were used for grain storage, not as burial chambers for Egyptian pharaohs and their consorts. That same day, Carson confirmed that this is still his belief in an interview published by CBS News. The discredited theory is based on the writings of a 6th century historian and an interpretation of the biblical story of Joseph that most theological scholars find questionable, according to Tierney Sneed, writing for Talking Points Memo.\n\nHis statements and the revelations of the lies contained in his autobiography have given rise to the hashtag \u201c#bencarsonwikipedia,\u201d leading at least one Twitter user on Friday to combine the candidate\u2019s Christian beliefs with his uncertain past:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson Admits He Made Up West Point \u2018Scholarship\u2019 In His Biography", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Kit O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Ben Carson Admits He Made Up West Point \u2018Scholarship\u2019 In His Biography", "title": "Ben Carson Admits He Made Up West Point \u2018Scholarship\u2019 In His Biography", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/ben-carson-admits-he-made-up-west-point-scholarship-in-his-biography/211080/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ben-Carson-AP334578561057.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-10T08:24:25-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Carson Admits He Made Up West Point \u2018Scholarship\u2019 In His Biography", "creator": "@KitOConnell", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ben-Carson-AP334578561057.jpg", "title": "Ben Carson Admits He Made Up West Point \u2018Scholarship\u2019 In His Biography", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "published_time": "2015-11-07T05:00:53-05:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/kitoconnell", "section": "Front Page: National", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T08:24:25-05:00", "tag": "West Point"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ab8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGifted Hands\u201d is Ben Carson\u2019s best-selling autobiography that traces his growth from troubled teen to successful brain surgeon and politician.\nBen Carson Admits He Made Up West Point \u2018Scholarship\u2019 In His BiographyCarson's been caught in a number of unusual or embarrassing statements recently, including calling Americans \u201cstupid\u201d and defying the conventional history of the Egyptian pyramids.\n\u201cWest Point \u2026 has no record of Carson applying, much less being extended admission,\u201d Cheney wrote in a fact-checking investigation published on Friday.\nAccording to the 1996 book, the general was so impressed by Carson\u2019s dedication to self-improvement that he promised the youth a \u201cfull scholarship\u201d to U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s story is meant to be an inspirational one of overcoming adversity to find personal and political success, but his campaign just admitted that he fabricated a key event in his biography."}
