Due to the ongoing investigations the amounts estimated may be subject to revaluation. Earnings targets for the Group for 2015 will be adjusted accordingly. Volkswagen does not tolerate any kind of violation of laws whatsoever. It is and remains the top priority of the Board of Management to win back lost trust and to avert damage to our customers. The Group will inform the public on the further progress of the investigations constantly and transparently.\n\nVolkswagen says some 11 million diesel vehicles were equipped with the software that helped them cheat emissions tests worldwide, just days after the EPA ordered the automaker to recall 500,000 vehicles over the deception.\n\nOn Monday night, Michael Horn, the president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, said the company had \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d over the scandal, which has prompted calls for investigations into the world\u2019s second-largest carmaker.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Michel Sapin called for a \u201cEurope-wide\u201d investigation into diesel cars.\n\n\u201cThis is not a minor subject, it\u2019s not about speed or the quality of leather,\u201d he told French media. \u201cWhat we are dealing with is making sure people avoid being poisoned by pollution.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Environment Ministry said it would test the diesel models of the Volkswagen Golf and Jetta, as well as the Audi A3.\n\nMy colleague Robinson Meyer describes how the \u201cdefeat devices,\u201d as the software is being called, worked.\n\nThese devices, essentially, let the cars pretend to not break the law. The software could sense when the car was undergoing emissions testing and activate its pollution-control systems accordingly. When the car was being driven during normal use, these systems largely did not activate\u2014making the car a much heavier polluter in real-life than it looked on paper. With those systems deactivated, the car\u2019s emissions violated the Clean Air Act and California\u2019s state pollution-control regulation.\n\nAnd as my colleague Bourree Lam reported, Volkswagen denied the allegations to regulators for years. Volkswagen faces fines of up to $18 billion in the U.S. over the deception, as well as class-action lawsuits. Reuters has the background:\n\nVW, which for several years has been airing U.S. TV commercials lauding its \u201cclean diesel: cars, was challenged by authorities as far back as 2014 over tests showing emissions exceeded California state and U.S. federal limits. VW attributed the excess emissions to \u201cvarious technical issues\" and \u201cunexpected\u201d real-world conditions. It wasn\u2019t until the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board threatened to withhold certification for the automaker\u2019s 2016 diesel models that VW in early September revised its explanation.\n\nThe scandal has brought into question the performance of Martin Winterkorn, the automaker\u2019s CEO. Some analysts quoted by Reuters note that he might have to step down over the scandal.\n\nA panel of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board will discuss the scandal on Wednesday. The full board meets Friday to extend Winterkorn\u2019s contract until the end of 2018.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The automaker now says 11 million diesel vehicles were equipped with the software that helped them cheat emissions tests worldwide.", "author": "Krishnadev Calamur", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The automaker says 11 million vehicles worldwide are affected by the scandal, and it's going to cost more than $7 billion to fix it.", "title": "Clean Diesel No More: Volkswagen Scandal Grows", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/09/AP_711210179295/facebook.jpg?1442922348", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/volkswagen-scandal-grows/406639/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Volkswagen says some 11 million diesel vehicles were equipped with the software that helped them cheat emissions tests worldwide, just days after the EPA ordered the automaker to recall 500,000 vehicles over the deception.\nVolkswagen faces fines of up to $18 billion in the U.S. over the deception, as well as class-action lawsuits.\nWith those systems deactivated, the car\u2019s emissions violated the Clean Air Act and California\u2019s state pollution-control regulation.\nSome analysts quoted by Reuters note that he might have to step down over the scandal.\nFrench Finance Minister Michel Sapin called for a \u201cEurope-wide\u201d investigation into diesel cars."}
