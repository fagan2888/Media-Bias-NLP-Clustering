The infusion of cash goes far beyond anything New Hampshire has seen in a Senate race, with more than $10 million spent on television ads alone, according to the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nMr. Brown has tried to nationalize the race, framing everything in relation to Mr. Obama. He casts both the president and Ms. Shaheen as having left the country vulnerable to the Ebola virus and terrorism, both of which he says could easily cross the unsecured Mexican border. In fact, he told Fox News, referring to the militant group in Iraq and Syria that calls itself the Islamic State, \u201cThere\u2019s deep concerns that there are members of ISIS actually coming through the border right now.\u201d\n\nPolls suggest the anti-Obama tack may work. Half of likely voters in New Hampshire say they do not trust the federal government to handle the Ebola crisis properly. And a majority opposes Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, which Ms. Shaheen supports and Mr. Brown wants to repeal.\n\nLaura Gamache, 30, a real estate agent in Bedford, said she was voting for Mr. Brown because he had met with people in her office and she liked his ideas about how to grow a business. \u201cHe spent 45 minutes with us and was easy to talk to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do think we need to do something about border security.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown casts himself as an independent who would work with both parties to break the gridlock in Washington. When Ms. Shaheen accused him in a debate of having voted to outsource jobs, he accused her of having \u201coutsourced her independence\u201d by voting with Mr. Obama 99 percent of the time.\n\nMs. Shaheen\u2019s campaign theme is that she \u201cputs New Hampshire first.\u201d She promotes issues like lowering the costs of student loans and child care, and extending unemployment benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe says Mr. Brown is \u201cfear-mongering\u201d and \u201cgrandstanding,\u201d partly to distract from his record of supporting big oil companies and Wall Street banks, and partly to scare voters.\n\n\u201cThe Republican strategy is to target Democratic women and suggest we\u2019re not tough enough on national security,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nLater, in a debate, making a point about her toughness, she said, \u201cI was asking questions about ISIS before my opponent ever moved to New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nMs. Shaheen frequently refers to Mr. Brown\u2019s move to New Hampshire, calling it opportunistic. She says that he does not really understand the state and that it is \u201cnot a consolation prize.\u201d\n\nAfter noting in her stump speech Mr. Brown\u2019s membership on the board of a company, Kadant, that outsourced jobs, she includes this applause line: \u201cWe don\u2019t need to import a senator who will outsource American jobs.\u201d\n\nThis matters to voters like Rich Derby, 49, a postal worker, who went to a labor rally for Ms. Shaheen in Hooksett.\n\n\u201cJeanne Shaheen is very supportive of New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the out-of-state person coming in. He lost in Massachusetts and is now just trying to find a seat for himself.\u201d\n\nBut if this is a wave election, the campaigns may have little control over the outcome.\n\n\u201cObama could sink Shaheen,\u201d said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cIf we get five Ebola cases, if the stock market drops 500 points, if the Baghdad airport falls to ISIS, that will determine who wins and who loses.\u201d\n\nMs. Shaheen was hit by a wave election in 2002, when, after three successful two-year terms as governor, she lost in her first try for the Senate. President George W. Bush was still popular after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and 2002 was one of the few midterm elections in the last century in which the party in the White House \u2014 then, the Republicans \u2014 gained seats in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked at a recent debate what lessons she had learned from that loss, Ms. Shaheen said: \u201cThat sometimes there are factors beyond your control, and there are things happening in the country that affect a race. I think we\u2019re seeing this now in this race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141025173159, "twitter": {"description": "Scott Brown has gained traction in a potentially pivotal Senate race by lashing the Democratic incumbent, Jeanne Shaheen, to President Obama.", "title": "New Hampshire\u2019s Tight Senate Race Keeps Focus on Baggage", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/politics/new-hampshires-tight-senate-race-keeps-focus-on-baggage-.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003195158"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "kseelye", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/us/HAMPSHIRE4/HAMPSHIRE4-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/politics/new-hampshires-tight-senate-race-keeps-focus-on-baggage-.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003195158", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/politics/new-hampshires-tight-senate-race-keeps-focus-on-baggage-.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "New Hampshire,Shaheen  Jeanne,Brown  Scott P,Polls and Public Opinion,Midterm Elections (2014),Elections  Senate,United States Politics and Government", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Katharine Q.
