In response to President Obama\u2019s recent proposal to make community college free, Paul said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea\u2014let\u2019s let college students deduct the cost of their education over their working career!\u201d He wants to allow all tuition and student loan debt to be fully tax deductible, doing away with the current income restrictions and tax credit program. Though this plan would be beneficial to students and their families, critics have pointed out that the wealthy would benefit the most.\n\nIn the past, Paul has not always voted in student borrowers\u2019 favor. Less than a year ago, he voted against the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act proposed by Senator Warren. In 2013, Paul voted against the Comprehensive Student Loan Protection Act and the Student Loan Affordability Act. He also supported Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s amendment to repeal the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which would have undone significant student loan reforms such as expanding Pell grants and moving federal loans to direct lending. In the same year, he did, however, break this pattern and vote in favor of the bipartisan bill that extended student loan interest rates to prevent them from doubling.\n\nHis views on all issues, including student loans, are perhaps best exemplified in his annual budget proposals, providing a glimpse of what actions he might take if elected in 2016. In his FY 2012, 2013, and 2014 budgets, he plans to abolish the Department of Education. He makes a specific exception to save the Pell grant program. No provision was made for federal student loans or other financial aid, nor is it clear what would become of these programs.\n\nIn addition to his budgets, Paul introduced the Cut Federal Spending Act of 2011. This bill would have defunded the Department of Education programs, again with the exception of Pell grants which would have been capped.\n\nPaul is certainly not the only politician to advocate for the elimination of the Department of Education\u2014this idea goes back to Reagan\u2014but he has been vocal and insistent on the issue. He has not provided precise details of what would happen to all programs of the Department of Education if abolished, though in a 2014 interview he mentioned, \u201cI would have it [the Dept. of Education\u2019s funding] spent on the state and local level. I wouldn\u2019t take it up there at all, I\u2019d leave it at leave it at home.\u201d Ultimately, it is unclear what would happen to federal student loans if Paul implements this plan.\n\nTo learn more about what private sector options are available to help graduates with student debt save, visit Credible.\n\nFollow Stephen Dash on Twitter: www.twitter.com/stephenjdash", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is part of an ongoing series by Credible about how the 2016 presidential candidates...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-04-19 12:57:19 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "This is part of an ongoing series by Credible about how the 2016 presidential candidates...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-dash/what-plan-does-rand-paul_b_7091358.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2811558/images/o-RAND-PAUL-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2811558/images/o-RAND-PAUL-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "stephenjdash", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "This is part of an ongoing series by Credible about how the 2016 presidential candidates..."}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-18 12:57:19 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7091358", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "rand paul,student loans,student loan crisis,student loan interest rates,2016 election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "rand paul,student loans,student loan crisis,student loan interest rates,2016 election", "published_time": "2015-04-18 12:57:19 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-06-17 05:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc13b\"", "article_summary": "In 2013, Paul voted against the Comprehensive Student Loan Protection Act and the Student Loan Affordability Act.\nNo provision was made for federal student loans or other financial aid, nor is it clear what would become of these programs.\nI wouldn\u2019t take it up there at all, I\u2019d leave it at leave it at home.\u201d Ultimately, it is unclear what would happen to federal student loans if Paul implements this plan.\nIn the same year, he did, however, break this pattern and vote in favor of the bipartisan bill that extended student loan interest rates to prevent them from doubling.\nIn the past, Paul has not always voted in student borrowers\u2019 favor."}
