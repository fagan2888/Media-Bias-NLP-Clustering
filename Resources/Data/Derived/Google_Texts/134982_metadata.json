That platform will make pertinent patient information accessible when and where it\u2019s needed for care through a highly secure process.\n\nHealth interoperability \u2013 defined as the ability of different devices, IT systems and software to communicate, exchange and use shared data \u2013 will play an increasingly important role in providing timely, accurate care based on access to real-time patient health data and records.\n\nInteroperability Platform Details\n\nAs part of the initiative, Cisco and UCSF will establish a collaborative center at UCSF\u2019s Mission Bay campus. At the center, staff from both entities, along with global health technology leaders, will be able to collectively test and scale the interoperability platform across different devices, IT systems and software.\n\nThe platform initially will be piloted for patients at UCSF Medical Center and ultimately extend to other affiliated entities within UCSF Health, including UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospitals and joint ventures with John Muir Health and Hospice by the Bay, among others. It is expected to expand rapidly throughout the UC system and with other health care delivery partners nationwide.\n\nCisco\u2019s solutions for digital business connect data, analytics, processes and experiences across multiple industries. Working with front line innovators at UCSF, Cisco will extend its digital business platform with health care-specific capabilities to enable the rapid creation and deployment of applications focused at specific interoperability challenges within health care. Cisco analytics will create new insight, processes and outcomes with the distinct ability to compute from the data center to the edge, turning raw data into strategic business information.\n\n\u201cFragmentation of information is one of the most challenging impediments in health care today,\u201d said Michael Blum, MD in an official statement, UCSF associate vice chancellor for Informatics and director of the UCSF Center for Digital Health Innovation, which houses this initiative for UCSF. \u201cIn human terms, the consequences are enormous: the lack of complete information on our patients leads to poor, costly care, delays in diagnosis or treatment, and dissatisfied patients \u2013 all due to health information systems that cannot communicate with one another. In this age of apps, social media, and mobile communications, this status quo is completely unacceptable to both patients and providers. We plan to change all of that with this partnership.\u201d\n\nA platform of this type is critical to enabling health systems to meet the data-exchange and collaboration requirements of the Affordable Care Act, according to Aenor Sawyer, MD, a UCSF orthopedist and digital health leader who was instrumental in establishing the partnership. This platform also will enable providers to incorporate new and valuable sources of information from outside the clinical system, such as personal health applications, wearable sensors, consumer devices and home monitors, which will be integrated with clinical data to optimize health decisions.\n\n\u201cAll of us experience varying states of wellness and illness in our lives and contact many points of care, where important data is generated. We move freely between those points of care, but our data does not,\u201d said Sawyer, who is also a cancer patient. \u201cWith this interoperability platform in place, the volumes of health data generated from clinical and non-clinical sources can be integrated and analyzed, resulting in accessible and actionable information and, ultimately, better care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "UC San Francisco and Cisco have formed an initiative to jointly develop an interoperability platform for sharing health care information among multiple entities.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "UC San Francisco and Cisco have formed an initiative to jointly develop an interoperability platform for sharing health care information among multiple entities.", "title": "UCSF, Cisco to Develop Interoperability Platform for Sharing Health Data", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/UCSF.jpeg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-10-22T17:45:51-04:00", "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2015/10/22/ucsf-cisco-develop-interoperability-platform-sharing-health-data/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UC San Francisco and Cisco have formed an initiative to jointly develop an interoperability platform for sharing health care information among multiple entities.", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/UCSF.jpeg", "title": "UCSF, Cisco to Develop Interoperability Platform for Sharing Health Data", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "Health IT", "tag": "Health IT Interoperability", "published_time": "2015-10-22T17:45:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T17:45:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Interoperability Platform DetailsAs part of the initiative, Cisco and UCSF will establish a collaborative center at UCSF\u2019s Mission Bay campus.\nIt is expected to expand rapidly throughout the UC system and with other health care delivery partners nationwide.\nWorking with front line innovators at UCSF, Cisco will extend its digital business platform with health care-specific capabilities to enable the rapid creation and deployment of applications focused at specific interoperability challenges within health care.\n\u201cWith this interoperability platform in place, the volumes of health data generated from clinical and non-clinical sources can be integrated and analyzed, resulting in accessible and actionable information and, ultimately, better care.\u201d\nCisco analytics will create new insight, processes and outcomes with the distinct ability to compute from the data center to the edge, turning raw data into strategic business information."}
