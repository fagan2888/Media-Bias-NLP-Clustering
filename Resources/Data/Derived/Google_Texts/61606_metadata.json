Treuer agreed and partnered with Anna Gibbs, a tribal elder from the Red Lake band of Chippewa in Red Lake, Minn., to provide on-air voices for the campaign\u2019s six Ojibwe-language ads.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awareness that there are actually quite a few indigenous people who wouldn\u2019t access the information if it wasn\u2019t presented in an indigenous language,\u201d Treuer said. \u201cThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wanted to make enrollment material available to people in the languages they speak every day.\u201d\n\nEach month during the ongoing year-long campaign, Treuer and Gibbs translate English-language scripts into Ojibwe. After their translations are verified by third-party reviewers, the pair recorded the spots in Bemidji\u2019s KBXE Radio studios.\n\nIn addition to English and Ojibwe, other groups around the country recorded each radio ad in Yupik, Inupiat, Lakota and Navajo. The ads have aired on dozens of tribal radio stations across the country. They can be heard on a variety of nationally syndicated networks and are available online.\n\nTreuer thinks this project can help encourage participation in the Affordable Care Act among a population of people who need health coverage and might otherwise have avoided information about the program.\n\n\u201cIn this part of Ojibwe country, the number of mono-lingual Ojibwe speakers is small,\u201d Treuer said. \u201cBut there are other parts of Ojibwe country where it\u2019s a different story. And a lot of the people in the older generation are bi-lingual, but might tune this information out if it were presented in English.\u201d\n\nFor Treuer, the project not only supports the work he has done at BSU to revitalize the Ojibwe language, but also reinforces the language\u2019s ability to be a part of everyday life.\n\n\u201cThe language should be an everyday language,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just be used for prayer or for academic work. It should be for everything. So I\u2019m glad to see this. It\u2019s helpful to have a healthy, living language.\u201d\n\nListen to the ads on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/bemidjistate/sets/centers-for-medicare-and", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the last six months, Ojibwe-language radio ads providing information on the Affordable Care Act have featured a voice that would be familiar to many in the Bemidji community", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/23/promoting-affordable-care-act-indigenous-peoples-154128", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/ast-ag-radio2.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Promoting the Affordable Care Act to Indigenous Peoples"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-03-23T11:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/23/promoting-affordable-care-act-indigenous-peoples-154128", "dc": {"title": "Promoting the Affordable Care Act to Indigenous Peoples"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Promoting the Affordable Care Act to Indigenous Peoples"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce68a\"", "article_summary": "For the last six months, Ojibwe-language radio ads providing information on the Affordable Care Act have featured a voice that would be familiar to many in the Bemidji community.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awareness that there are actually quite a few indigenous people who wouldn\u2019t access the information if it wasn\u2019t presented in an indigenous language,\u201d Treuer said.\nTreuer thinks this project can help encourage participation in the Affordable Care Act among a population of people who need health coverage and might otherwise have avoided information about the program.\n\u201cBut there are other parts of Ojibwe country where it\u2019s a different story.\n\u201cThis American Indian- and Alaska Native-specific media outreach is intended to increase awareness and understanding of new, free or low-cost options offered through the insurance marketplace,\u201d said Jo Ann Kauffman, Kauffman and Associates president."}
