In the final weeks to secure health insurance for 2016 through the Affordable Care Act's federal marketplace, nearly 300,000 people in the Houston area had enrolled as of last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says.

The number in the Houston slightly trails that of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, which tallied right at a third of a million as of week's end. In San Antonio, there were 101,863 enrolled and Austin had 112,628, according to the HHS figures released this week.

As a whole Texas is well above where it was last year at roughly the same point in the enrollment period. By Jan. 9 the statewide total stood at 1,120,440 compared to 859,377 on the same date in 2015. The enrollment dates are slightly different this year, making precise comparisons difficult.

The number of enrollees includes both those who signed up for coverage and those who were automatically re-enrolled.

The 2016 enrollment period ends Jan. 31 and officials have said there would be no extensions. The next key deadline for enrollment is Friday, for those who want coverage to begin Feb. 1. After that, last-minute enrollees will have coverage that begins March 1.

HHS officials have been especially optimistic with the number of young adults who have signed up nationwide as they are seen as important to the overall success of the Affordable Care Act because they are typically healthier and typically pay more in premiums than they use in health care services.

As of late December, about 4 million people under age 35 had signed up - with about 1 million of those as first-timers.
