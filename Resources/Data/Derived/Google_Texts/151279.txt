Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton brings her campaign for the White House to Oklahoma's Jazz Hall of Fame in Tulsa. The venue was packed at for what was to have been a lunchtime speech. But, when Clinton was two-hours late, the crowd did thin.

Clinton was introduced onto the stage by former Tulsa Mayor Kathy Taylor; and to the podium by State Senator Kay Floyd of Oklahoma City.

Clinton spoke for nearly 40-minutes. She lashed out at Republicans for wanting to turn the clock back on women’s rights. She told the crowd reproductive rights would be protected in her administration. Clinton called for equal pay for equal work.

During her speech, Clinton called out Governor Fallin for failure to accept funding for the Affordable Care Act, saying the Governor was tampering with the health of Oklahomans. That remark drew applause from two former Democratic Governors in the audience, George Nigh and David Walters.

Clinton called for a stand against terrorism at home and abroad. She repeated President Obama’s request that people on the ‘No Fly List’ not be able to buy weapons. She says she does not want to take away guns, but pointed out the need to be better background checks.

After the Hall of Fame event, she then went to the home of George and Cookie Kaiser for a private reception.
