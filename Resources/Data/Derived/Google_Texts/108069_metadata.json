Joel Grover reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25, 2015. (Published Thursday, March 26, 2015)\n\nBrent\u2019s Deli in Westlake Village, a family-owned restaurant dubbed by Zagat as \"the Cadillac of delis,\" was the suspected source of the poisonings, according to records obtained by the I-Team.\n\nSome victims reported eating Brent\u2019s famous corned beef sandwiches, some ate pastrami, and others believe it was salads or soups that sickened them.\n\nState and Ventura County health officials began learning about salmonella cases from Brent\u2019s customers, but both agencies failed to inform the public about the growing outbreak. Nearly two dozen people were sickened with salmonella poisoning over a four-month period.\n\nWhen questioned by the I-Team, Ventura County health officials say in hindsight, they could have made a public statement warning the public about the outbreak. NBC4 spoke by phone with one of the owners of Brent\u2019s Deli, Marc Hernandez, who said his restaurant is now a safe place to eat.\n\nHernandez declined to comment on camera, but says after learning of the outbreak, last August he voluntarily closed for a day, sanitized the entire restaurant, and has hired a third-party company to improve overall food safety.\n\nAccess Denied: Grandfather Says He's Trapped in Care Home\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nNBC4 shared with viewers a confrontation with the state over delays to help a disabled San Bernardino man who said he was trapped in a Garden Grove care facility because his home doesn\u2019t meet his needs.\n\nGrandfather Says He's Trapped in Care Home A grandfather in a wheelchair says he's trapped in a care facility far from home because the state won't obey a court order to pay for home modifications.

He'd been living in the care facility ever since, because his home lacks the modifications to fit his wheelchair.\n\nHis attorneys blamed the California Insurance Guarantee Association, or CIGA, the state agency which took over the case after Mercado's insurance company went bankrupt.\n\nEven though Mercado has won several workers' compensation rulings to have his home modified, CIGA appealed three times.\n\nThe NBC4 I-Team spent a week calling CIGA, and asking about Mercado's case. Finally, after driving to the agency's Glendale headquarters, NBC4 got answers.\n\n\"We've looked into this and we think perhaps we could have taken a different path,\" admitted CIGA Executive Director Wayne Wilson, who personally reviewed Mercado's records at the NBC4 I-Team's request.\n\nWilson pointed out that CIGA is spending tens of thousands of dollars each month on Mercado's care, and has paid to add a ramp and widen some doorways. He went on to tell NBC4 it hasn't been enough.\n\n\"Mr. Mercado\u2019s attorney and our Senior Executive here are going to meet early next week,\" Wilson continued. \"He wants to have the support, love and affection of his family and wants to be with them and we\u2019re going to see what we can do.\"\n\nStolen in Seconds: Beware of New ATM Rip-Off Tricks\n\nFebruary 2015\n\nThe I-Team alerted consumers to the high risks of using a debit card after federal investigators revealed the brand-new, high-tech gadgets thieves use to rip people off at ATMs and gas stations.\n\nBeware of High-Tech ATM Rip-Off Tricks Federal investigators reveal how ID thieves are using high-tech gadgets at ATMs. Randy Mac reports for the NBC4 News at 8 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2015.

The I-Team obtained Secret Service surveillance video, which showed how the camera can be mounted inside the molding of an ATM, at an angle customers would never notice.\n\nNBC4 was also shown a gadget that can steal information at secured, indoor ATM locations that require the swipe of a card to enter.\n\nNightmare Neighbors: Officials Vow Crackdown on Party House Rentals\n\nFebruary/March 2015\n\nLos Angeles city officials vowed to crack down on the party problem keeping neighbors up at night \u2014 an issue the I-Team first uncovered in a February investigation.\n\nOfficials Vow to Crack Down on Party House Rentals Los Angeles city officials are vowing to crack down on the party problem keeping neighbors up at night - a problem the I-Team first uncovered in an investigation last month.

Randy Mac reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2015.

Joel Grover reports for NBC4 News at 5 p.m. Wednesday, April 1, 2015. (Published Wednesday, April 1, 2015)\n\nSome of LA's sidewalks have been in such dangerous condition that pedestrians have suffered broken noses, shattered kneecaps, and bloodied faces. Even though the city is often legally responsible, an I-Team investigation found that it usually shirks accountability and refuses to pay claims.\n\nThe I-Team found in November 2014 that of the 1,509 sidewalk injury claims filed in the past five years, the city paid only 65 claims \u2014 about 4 percent. In addition, the I-Team discovered that the city usually doesn't notify injured residents that their claims have been denied, which means many of them will miss the two-year statute of limitations to sue the city over a sidewalk accident.\n\nIn fact, the I-Team found that often the only way a pedestrian injured on a dangerous sidewalk can get the city to take responsibility is to file a lawsuit against the city.\n\nLA City Attorney Mike Feuer then told NBC4 that \"it is possible\" the city has denied legitimate claims that it should have paid. He also said he ordered an audit of the way his office handles sidewalk injury claims, to see if the process can be made more fair to the public.\n\nThen, in April 2015, the city agreed to spend $1.4 billion over 30 years to fix thousands of cracked, buckled, and dangerous sidewalks.\n\nThe LA City Council approved a settlement to a 2010 lawsuit brought by disabled residents and advocates, who said the city\u2019s sidewalks were impassable and violate the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nCity leaders, including Mayor Eric Garcetti, called the settlement \"historic\" and said it was the biggest agreement of its kind ever.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From restaurant health hazards to the latest ways thieves are preying on ATM users, the NBC4 I-Team has uncovered the truth and held the powerful accountable.", "title": "NBC4 I-Team: The Stories, The Warnings, The Results", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "From restaurant health hazards to the latest ways thieves are preying on ATM users, the NBC4 I-Team has uncovered the truth and held the powerful accountable.", "title": "NBC4 I-Team: Stories, Warnings, Results", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/NBC4-ITeam-Investigation-Special--299131401.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*677/04-08-2015-iteam-special-parallax-1.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From restaurant health hazards to the latest ways thieves are preying on ATM users, the NBC4 I-Team has uncovered the truth and held the powerful accountable.", "title": "NBC4 I-Team: Stories, Warnings, Results", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/NBC4-ITeam-Investigation-Special--299131401.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*677/04-08-2015-iteam-special-parallax-1.JPG?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "iteam, investigation, special, dirty secret, access denied, stolen in seconds, nightmare neighbors, cellphone security system, falling through the cracks, sidewalk", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "iteam, investigation, special, dirty secret, access denied, stolen in seconds, nightmare neighbors, cellphone security system, falling through the cracks, sidewalk"}, "article_summary": "Zisner set up a tablet in the NBC4 I-Team office and a phone in areas around the newsroom.\nFrom restaurant health hazards to the latest ways thieves are preying on ATM users, the NBC4 I-Team has uncovered the truth and held the powerful accountable.\nInvestigations have revealed neglect and wrongdoing that have left locals with little resolution until the NBC4 I-Team stepped in to shine a light on the problem.\nThe NBC4 I-Team spent a week calling CIGA, and asking about Mercado's case.\nAn NBC4 I-Team investigation found that despite dozens of complaints, these so-called \"party houses\" are often operating unchecked by the LAPD and city officials."}
