Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the slated move sends women 1,000 miles from the New York area, violating the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 goal to keep convicts within 500 miles of their homes.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people from the northeast, a lot of women with small children, who are having those connections effectively severed and that is very problematic,\u201d he said.\n\nKerman urged Congress and the Bureau of Prisons to adopt gender-specific policies to address the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s experiences while incarcerated.\n\nShe cited research finding that women\u2019s incarceration is overwhelmingly driven by substance abuse, mental illness or an experience with traumatic violence.\n\nThis last driver, Kerman said, is exacerbated in a criminal justice system, where more than 80 percent of women report emotional, physical or sexual abuse prior to incarceration.\n\n\u201cThe problem with incarceration is that for prisoners who have experienced very significant trauma like rape, sexual abuse and domestic violence, many of the commonplace correctional practices are very reminiscent of some of those abuses,\u201d she said. \u201cThis creates a serious, serious challenge in terms of rehabilitation and re-entry.\u201d\n\nCiting the drug crackdown in the 1980s that resulted in harsh mandatory sentencing, Kerman said those working in the criminal justice system need to reevaluate if many of the women should have been incarcerated in the first place.\n\n\u201cIf any member of this committee had the opportunity to meet the hundreds of women I did time with, you would probably walk away from getting to know those women with a deep feeling that their confinement in a prison cell or a prison facility was just a colossal waste,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Orange Is The New Black\" author Piper Kerman testified before the Senate to illustrate the criminal justice system\u2019s failings in assisting female inmates.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Orange Is The New Black\" author Piper Kerman testified before the Senate to illustrate the criminal justice system\u2019s failings in assisting female inmates.", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Author Calls for Reforms to Help Female Prisoners", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150804_PiperKerman_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-04T20:24:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IWs28X"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Orange Is The New Black\" author Piper Kerman testified before the Senate to illustrate the criminal justice system\u2019s failings in assisting female inmates.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150804_PiperKerman_Johnson.jpg"}, "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Author Calls for Reforms to Help Female Prisoners", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-08-04T19:49:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-04T20:24:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Piper Kerman, Orange Is The New Black, criminal justice reform"}, "article_summary": "During Kerman\u2019s experience behind bars in a Danbury, Conn., federal prison, women were given few resources to better themselves, she says.\nThe re-entry health classes, Kerman continued, were taught by a culinary department officer who had no expertise on reproductive health, mental health or substance abuse.\nShe saw women denied necessary medical care, while others with mental health issues had to wait months before the one psychiatrist available for 1,400 women could advise them.\nFurther, the re-entry programs meant to help women readjust to life after prison were often irrelevant or unhelpful, she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s unimaginable in a system where at least 65 percent of women experience some kind of mental illness,\u201d Kerman said."}
