During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, while discussing the status report on the Obamacare web site released by the White House, columnist George Will warned that “all hell” could break loose in 2014.

Administration officials say in the report that visitors to the government’s health care website will encounter fewer errors and the system now works most of the time, The Associated Press reported.

Obamacare at Thanksgiving, gets laughed at

Pointing to the report’s claim that the team fixing HealthCare.gov “is working with private sector velocity and effectiveness,” Will sarcastically acknowledged that this is progress but stressed full functionality is still months away.

Will said that fixing the web site will not solve all the problems associated with Obamacare, suggesting that structural elements of the law could lead to other problems, such as employers dropping insurance plans, according to National Review Online.

“Watch the employers,” he cautioned, “because if they start dumping people into Medicare and into Medicaid, and the doctors then say, ‘The burdens are too high, and the reimbursement is too low, we’re not seeing Medicaid patients,’ then all hell is going to break loose.”
