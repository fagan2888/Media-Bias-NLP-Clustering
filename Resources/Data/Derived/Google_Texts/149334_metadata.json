The aim is to help speed the growth of companies it invests in.\n\nUnder its model, Frazier acquires the companies, brings in an executive management team and helps them grow until they are bought or go public, about a five-year period. The private-equity firm recently saw one of its portfolio companies, DSI Renal, merge with U.S. Renal Care to create one of the largest dialysis companies in the country.\n\nThe newest fund was raised from institutional investors, including large pension funds and endowments. Frazier plans to use the fund to invest in about eight to 10 companies, managing general partner Nader Naini said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, he said, has opened up new possibilities for investment, because more people have health insurance, spurring the need for more services.\n\n\u201cWe look for groups that can deliver care in a specific area at a much reduced cost relative to the rest,\u201d Naini said.\n\nOver the past 25 years, Frazier\u2019s growth buyout fund has invested in only one Washington state company, an institutional review board called Western IRB. Naini said it is one of his \u201ccareer goals\u201d to find a portfolio company in the region.\n\nFrazier has another fund, \u201cFrazier Life Sciences,\u201d that invests in early-stage health-care companies, often life-science firms or biotechs. That fund, based in Menlo Park, Calif., recently raised $262 million.\n\nThis is the first time the life-sciences and growth-buyout divisions have raised separate funds.\n\n\u201cSpecialization and highly focused fund strategies have proven to be more productive,\u201d Naini said.\n\nFrazier has invested in more than 170 health-care companies and manages about $2.9 billion in capital.\n\nFounder Alan Frazier has moved from being an active investor with the company to become chairman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the investment fund, the private-equity company plans to acquire profitable health-care companies, bring in an executive management team and help the firms grow.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "With the investment fund, the private-equity company plans to acquire profitable health-care companies, bring in an executive management team and help the firms grow.", "title": "Frazier raises $525M for health-care investment fund", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/frazier-raises-525m-for-health-care-investment-fund/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the investment fund, the private-equity company plans to acquire profitable health-care companies, bring in an executive management team and help the firms grow.", "creator": "@rachelerman", "site": "@seattletimes", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Frazier raises $525M for health-care investment fund"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Technology", "published_time": "2016-03-23 08:00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23 16:56:05"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business, Technology, Health, Local Business"}, "article_summary": "Frazier has another fund, \u201cFrazier Life Sciences,\u201d that invests in early-stage health-care companies, often life-science firms or biotechs.\nIn one of the largest funds in its history, Frazier Healthcare Partners has raised $525 million from investors to pour into profitable health-care companies.\nWith the investment fund, the private-equity company plans to acquire profitable health-care companies, bring in an executive management team and help the firms grow.\nFrazier has invested in more than 170 health-care companies and manages about $2.9 billion in capital.\nFrazier plans to use the fund to invest in about eight to 10 companies, managing general partner Nader Naini said."}
