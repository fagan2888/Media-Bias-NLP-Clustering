It\u2019s the state\u2019s largest health insurer offering plans in all 67 Florida counties. In 47 counties, it\u2019s the only health insurance provider.\n\nBut under a single-payer system, in which the government pays for all health-care costs, the private insurance giant essentially would be relegated to a government contractor. Many other private insurers wouldn\u2019t be so lucky.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much space between where we are now (with the Affordable Care Act) and the single-payer option,\u201d Geraghty told Watchdog.org. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of room to innovate between here and there.\n\n\u201cThe answer isn\u2019t going to single payer,\u201d Geraghty said. \u201cThe answer is developing new partnerships.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Florida Blue\u2019s strategy for survival \u2014 expansion \u2014 and dealing with the ever-rising cost of health care.\n\n\u201cThe price of health care isn\u2019t going down. It\u2019s being masked to the consumer,\u201d Geraghty said.\n\nThe $10.5-billion company only has a profit margin of $100 million, according to Geraghty. This year alone, Florida Blue is facing $110 million in new Obamacare taxes. Those taxes, he said, are getting passed on to consumers.\n\nOther costs include covering young adults until age 27, accepting high-cost patients with pre-existing conditions and the elimination of catastrophic plans to meet the new minimum-coverage requirements.\n\nThough insurance companies will receive more taxpayer-funded revenue for taking on high-risk people, the higher costs ultimately will be paid by consumers. Some consumers will receive government subsidies to offset higher prices, but many others won\u2019t.\n\nFlorida Blue is honoring tens of thousands of previously canceled policies due to Obamacare. Given a choice between their old plans and new Obamacare standardized plans, Geraghty said 90 percent of his customers opted to keep their plans.\n\nContact William Patrick at wpatrick@watchdog.org or follow Florida Watchdog on Twitter at @watchdogfla Like Watchdog.org?
