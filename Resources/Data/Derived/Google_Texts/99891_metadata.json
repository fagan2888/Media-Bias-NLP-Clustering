Industry executives also reportedly felt that \u201cthere\u2019s no other must-see TV on the channel.\u201d\n\nLast year, Beck tried and failed to strike a deal with CNN. During that time, he attempted to moderate his image for television executives. He apologized for his inflammatory comments about Obama. As Breitbart News noted, Beck started positioning himself toward the political center, bashing Americans who were against illegal immigration during last summer\u2019s border crisis. Trying to distance himself from politics, he also proclaimed on CNN that he would rather be Walt Disney than Edward R. Murrow or Rush Limbaugh.\n\nIn 2011, the two executives who left were instrumental in helping Beck launch what is \u201cnow credited with being one of the first direct-to-subscriber streaming video businesses.\u201d Their new venture is reportedly in \u201cstealth mode\u201d as they talk to potential investors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: Top Glenn Beck Execs Leave to Start New Venture", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Report: Top Glenn Beck Execs Leave to Start New Venture", "title": "Report: Top Glenn Beck Execs Leave to Start New Venture - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/glenn-beck-glasses-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/03/06/report-top-glenn-beck-execs-leave-to-start-new-venture/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Report: Top Glenn Beck Execs Leave to Start New Venture", "title": "Report: Top Glenn Beck Execs Leave to Start New Venture - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/glenn-beck-glasses-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "published_time": "2015-03-06T07:18:08-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16b7\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTwo of Glenn Beck\u2019s top executives have reportedly left his organization to start a new digital venture.\nAs Breitbart News noted, Beck started positioning himself toward the political center, bashing Americans who were against illegal immigration during last summer\u2019s border crisis.\nIndustry executives also reportedly felt that \u201cthere\u2019s no other must-see TV on the channel.\u201dLast year, Beck tried and failed to strike a deal with CNN.\nTrying to distance himself from politics, he also proclaimed on CNN that he would rather be Walt Disney than Edward R.
