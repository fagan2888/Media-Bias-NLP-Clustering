(Denver Post Photo by Cyrus McCrimmon)\n\nEvery year, about two to four weeks after school start, a big spike in asthma-related hospital visits occurs among children with asthma that experts say is largely avoidable.\n\nThis year, the usual September spike in visits to emergency departments and hospital units by children in respiratory distress was up to 15 percent higher because of an outbreak of viral cases, Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado physicians say.\n\nPhysicians don\u2019t know why for certain, said Dr. Monica Federico, pediatric lung specialist and director of Children\u2019s asthma program. They do think that many emergency or urgent cases could be avoided each year if asthma patients were more consistent in taking asthma-controlling medications.\n\n\u201cPeople who have asthma \u2014 sometimes you feel terrible and sometimes you feel fine. People, in the summer, feel so good they stop taking their meds,\u201d Federico said. \u201cThere is data they don\u2019t fill their medications.\u201d\n\nThe presumption is that children reunited with their classmates in close quarters in classrooms are exposed to more germs and colds, which can trigger asthma attacks. Late-summer allergens, such as ragweed, might trigger asthma attacks, as about 80 percent to 90 percent of pediatric asthma is triggered by allergies, Federico said.\n\nAnd, going back to school means parents aren\u2019t around to keep a watchful eye on children\u2019s use of their puffers \u2013 the dose-metered inhalers used to take asthma medicine, the corticosteroids that reduce the inflammation of airways.\n\nWhatever the September triggers are, Federico said, more consistent use of controller medications could help families avoid many attacks, which are caused by inflammation, bronchospasms and excessive mucous in airways.\n\nIn late August and early September of this year, an outbreak of an uncommon virus, enterovirus 68, has caused hundreds of Denver-area children with asthma to experience an abrupt and severe onset of respiratory illness. Symptom severity has led children to seek hospital treatment, experience stays of several days and, in the most severe cases, use ventilators to help them breathe.\n\n\u201cIf parents are worried, they should call the doctor right away,\u201d Federico said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t wait until their kids are really sick and go to the ER.\u201d\n\nRoughly 25 million Americans have asthma \u2013 including 7 million children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While 8 percent of U.S. adults suffer from the disease, more than 9 percent of children suffer from the chronic illness. Some just \u201coutgrow it,\u201d Federico said. For some, it\u2019s a lifelong condition. In any case, physicians believe it is a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke and allergens.\n\nHigh altitude doesn\u2019t increase prevalence of the disease, Federico said, but when children and adults need help getting oxygen because of an asthma attack, they need more help getting oxygen at higher elevations.\n\nWhen an attack of wheezing and difficulty breathing occurs, sufferers use a puffer or nebulizer (which makes a mist) with so-called rescue medication. Though known by many brand names, the rescue medication for attacks is albuterol, Federico said. Albuterol is a bronchodilator \u2013 meaning it opens airways \u2013 by relaxing these passages when they are in spasm. It provides quick, but short-lived relief, usually about four hours.\n\nFederico said children should visit their primary care physicians in July or August, use their controller medications consistently and, through their parents, have an asthma action plan on file with their school\u2019s nurse.\n\nAsthma is more common among children in inner city areas. Denver Public Schools, which has some schools reporting asthma prevalence as high as 22 percent, has an asthma program called Step Up.\n\nBy schools supporting children\u2019s consistent corticosteroid use, health officials reported, by 2012, the incidence of children\u2019s attacks, visits to ERs or urgent care centers, hospitalization and school absenteeism became roughly half of the 2010 baseline-year statistics.\n\nFamilies shouldn\u2019t worry about regular use of controller medications, Federico said, because the side effects of inhaled steroids for children are not serious. She said studies 20 to 25 years in length have show the long-term side effect of inhaled steroids is a loss in a child\u2019s height 0.6-1 centimeter, or about a quarter of an inch to just under half an inch.\n\n\u201cThe medicine is not addictive,\u201d Federico said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wean off it when you no longer need it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Dose", "description": "Every year, about two to four weeks after school start, a big spike in asthma-related hospital visits occurs among children with asthma that experts say is largely avoidable.", "title": "September's spike in asthma attacks: Colorado kids need back-to-school plan", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/09/16/septembers-spike-asthma-attacks-colorado-children-need-back-school-plan/4473/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/09/rsz_enterovirus.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Every year, about two to four weeks after school start, a big spike in asthma-related hospital visits occurs among children with asthma that experts say is largely avoidable.", "title": "September\u2019s spike in asthma attacks: Colorado kids need back-to-school plan", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/09/16/septembers-spike-asthma-attacks-colorado-children-need-back-school-plan/4473/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/09/rsz_enterovirus.jpg", "creator": "@electadraper", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "asthma,Children's Hospital Colorado,enterovirus 68,respiratory illness"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd84c\"", "article_summary": "Late-summer allergens, such as ragweed, might trigger asthma attacks, as about 80 percent to 90 percent of pediatric asthma is triggered by allergies, Federico said.\nPhysicians don\u2019t know why for certain, said Dr. Monica Federico, pediatric lung specialist and director of Children\u2019s asthma program.\nDenver Public Schools, which has some schools reporting asthma prevalence as high as 22 percent, has an asthma program called Step Up.\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado is seeing high numbers of respiratory illnesses.\n(Denver Post Photo by Cyrus McCrimmon)Every year, about two to four weeks after school start, a big spike in asthma-related hospital visits occurs among children with asthma that experts say is largely avoidable."}
