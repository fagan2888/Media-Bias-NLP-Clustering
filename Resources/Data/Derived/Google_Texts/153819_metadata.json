Matt Bevin says Saturday's caucus is \"democracy in action\" as he cast his ballot in Kentucky's Republican caucus at Seneca High School in Louisville.

(Photo: Matt Stone/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nRepublican voters lined up to vote in the GOP presidential caucus Saturday at more than 100 locations across Kentucky.\n\nAt Seneca High School, one of nine caucus locations in Jefferson County, traffic was backed up Saturday morning as the lines steadily grew longer.\n\nSurrounded by cameras, reporters and supporters, Gov. Matt Bevin visited the Seneca location to cast his ballot around 10:30 a.m. in the race to win Kentucky's delegates. He said that Kentucky's move to hold the early caucus kept the state from being an \"afterthought\" and helped draw candidates such as Donald Trump to campaign.\n\n\"Look at this \u2013 there are lines of people waiting to vote,\" said Bevin, who declined to say which candidate he voted for. \"For everybody who thinks that having a caucus in Kentucky was not a good thing, have you ever seen this kind of enthusiasm for a primary in the state of Kentucky? You never have.\"\n\nBut at Trinity Family Life Center in west Louisville, crowds were noticeably thinner. Caucus chair Dereck Barber said he didn't expect a huge turnout but he did see more than 200 people in the first 90 minutes. At Greenwood Elementary in southwest Louisville, traffic backed up and streams of people turned out to vote.\n\nThe Courier-Journal has reported that turnout is expected to be light because Kentucky voters aren't used to voting in March or on Saturdays. Furthermore, some voters likely aren't even aware of the caucus.\n\nEven though all 11 candidates who signed up for the caucus are on the ballot, only Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich remain in the race and are eligible for Kentucky's 46 delegates.\n\nThis will be the first time a presidential nominee has been selected in Kentucky by caucus since 1984 when the Kentucky General Assembly did away with the presidential primary and Democrats chose former Vice President Walter Mondale by caucus. Republicans, that year, used a convention system to renominate President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"I know there's been some confusion \u2013 anytime you do something for the very first time there are questions,\" said Linda Huber, a caucus chair at Seneca High.\n\nKentucky caucuses will close at 4 p.m.\n\nSome voters said they came out to specifically to vote for or against front-runner Donald Trump, who has created a rift in the Republican party and the voting public at large.\n\n\"We're desperate for a change in the country \u2013 we feel Donald Trump can change the country,\" said Susan Mudd, who wasn't swayed by party leaders such as Mitt Romney in recent days coming out strongly against Trump. \"I think he's a savior for America.\"\n\nHer husband, Ron Mudd, a Marine veteran, said Trump checked off two boxes: He was a \"non-politician\" and would \"make America great again.\"\n\nIn the West End, Abi John, a registered Republican of Indian descent who became a U.S. citizen last month, said he wanted to cast a vote against Trump.\n\n\"The whole idea of the wall, I don't know what's going through his mind \u2013 no reasonable individual can support that,\" he said. \"I don't think the leader of a free nation needs to be like that.\"\n\nCarol Paris, who wore a Ben Carson hat and a sweatshirt that read, \"Love like Jesus Does,\" said he was voting for Ted Cruz and hoped Trump wouldn't be the nominee. \"It takes more to be the president than being rude and putting everybody down,\" she said, adding however that she will support Trump if he becomes the nominee because he could defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nVoter Doris Deskins said she chose John Kasich. While some candidates are \"saying everything everybody wants,\" she said, \"John can do it.\"\n\nHere's what's happening around the state:\n\nRandPaul: At my #kycaucus location!
