The other best bit of the show was MacDonald and Morrison as Palin and daughter Bristol, played against a backdrop of news coverage and police photos of last year's infamous birthday party brawl. They sang fast and furiously funny parodies of Queen's "We Are The Champions" ("We are the Palins, my friend/And we'll keep on fighting to the end …") and the Bee Gees tune "Stayin' Alive" ("Whether you're the father or whether you're the other we'll be startin' a fight, startin' a fight …").
