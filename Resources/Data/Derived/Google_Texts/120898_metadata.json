He never imagined playing football in college. Heck, he never imagined going to college. Watching Williams move seamlessly through the Broncos locker room now, it\u2019s hard to believe football wasn\u2019t always his future.\n\nHe\u2019s big, strong, smart. The pieces existed, but the puzzle didn\u2019t fit. After high school, after experiencing only flashes of football success, Williams took a job to make a living. He put radiators together at Modine Manufacturing in Jefferson City, Mo.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut it was something I had to do.\u201d\n\nFootball intervened, changing his path, if not his life. He shared his story with The Denver Post during a season when last year\u2019s first-round pick continues to take on a bigger role:\n\nQ: How did you end up playing in college after leaving the game?\n\nA: My former high school teacher Andre Solomon took me to see a guy he knew play for Kansas. They were playing Texas Tech. He told me that I should be out on the field, that I was good enough to play at that level. It opened my eyes to a whole new world. I eventually quit my job and enrolled at Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College.\n\nQ: It wasn\u2019t easy, was it? You barely played in high school, right?\n\nA: I had to get in shape and drop weight (at Coffeyville). I was working out all the time so I could get on the field. Coaches started noticing me. I played well and ended up with a lot of offers before choosing North Carolina.\n\nQ: As a rookie, it was a challenge to get playing time. What did you learn from that experience?\n\nA: I learned how to watch film and see how defenses were attacking me. It\u2019s not like high school or even college where you can just use the bully mentality. I was behind two great players in Terrance (Knighton) and (Kevin) Vickerson. I watched them go in and dominate week in and week out. As a player in practice, I started to grow every week, getting better and better. I was happy to get the opportunity to start this year. I know the defense so much better.\n\nQ: How much does it help to have Marvin Austin, a former North Carolina star, on the team?\n\nA: He\u2019s a great player. I could speak on Marvin for days, the things he\u2019s been through and where his career\u2019s been. He\u2019s been cut three times. And look at what he\u2019s doing now. He\u2019s definitely going to be a starter in this league. He has that kind of ability. It\u2019s great having him around.\n\nQ: The defensive line has helped fuel the four-game win streak by stopping the run. How much does depth help?\n\nA: We have so many guys who are equally good stepping in, and we aren\u2019t losing anything. We can all do the same thing, ball and make plays. If we can keep rolling guys in there, staying fresh, it can help us stay dominant.\n\nQ: Family is important to you. Is that traced to your tough upbringing?\n\nA: I want to create a better future. My brother Kyle is out here with me (he works nearby at Groove Ford in Centennial). I don\u2019t want to look back. I want to look forward and make positive things happen for my team and for my family.\n\nSylvester Williams bio file\n\n\u2013Worked night shift at Modine Manufacturing, building radiators for large trucks after high school.\n\n\u2013Walked on at Coffeyville (Kan.)
