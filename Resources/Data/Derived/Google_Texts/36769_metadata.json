The Washington Post ran the cartoon on Wednesday. The caption under the drawing read, \u201cCruz uses his children as political props.\u201d\n\nThe cartoon got a rise out of Cruz, who put out his own cartoon portraying the Washington Post and The New York Times as lapdogs for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd he forcefully declared that his children are off limits.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\n\u201cIt used to be for a long time the rules across the board that kids are off limits\u2026That should be the rules. Don\u2019t mess with our kids,\u201d he told an audience in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with my kids. Don\u2019t mess with Marco\u2019s kids. Don\u2019t mess with Hillary\u2019s kid. Don\u2019t mess with anybody\u2019s kids. Leave kids alone. And if the media wants to attack and ridicule every Republican, well that\u2019s what they\u2019re gonna do. But leave our kids alone.\u201d\n\nDo you support Ted Cruz? Like the page:\n\nFred Hiatt, editor at the Washington Post, accepted responsibility and said he failed to look at the cartoon before it was published. He immediately ordered it taken down from the paper\u2019s website.\n\nFor her part, Telnaes is unapologetic for drawing the cartoon and blames Cruz for causing the controversy in the first place by making his children political pawns in his campaign.\n\nTelnaes tweeted, \u201cTed Cruz has put his children in a political ad \u2013 don\u2019t start screaming when editorial cartoonists draw them as well.\u201d\n\nCruz didn\u2019t scream. He just hit back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Don't mess with my kids ...
