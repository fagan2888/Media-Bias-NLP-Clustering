However, noted Murphy, who led the new study, more serious cases can cause blood poisoning, meningitis and bone infection.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1.2 million Americans are infected with Salmonella every year.\n\nPeople with compromised immune systems, as well as young children and infants are the most susceptible to infection, according to Dr. Christoph Berger of the University Children\u2019s Hospital Zurich in Switzerland, who was not involved in the study.\n\nMurphy and another researcher used data on Salmonella infections in children under five years old in the South West area of the UK from 2010 to 2013.\n\nThey examined the records to determine whether the infected child had been exposed to reptiles like lizards or snakes and whether he or she had been hospitalized for the infection.\n\nOf the 175 cases examined, 48 children had been exposed to reptiles. Among those with reptile exposure, about half were hospitalized \u2014 compared to less than one fifth of the children without reptile exposure.\n\nThe median age of kids with Salmonella cases linked to reptiles was six months old, compared to about one year among kids not exposed to reptiles.\n\nThe researchers write in Archives of Diseases in Childhood that there are multiple strains of Salmonella bacteria and the ones associated with reptiles tend to be different from those seen in food poisoning, which may explain the more severe symptoms seen in reptile-associated cases.\n\nEight of the 48 children with infections linked to reptiles had blood infections, meningitis or colitis. In comparison, only four of 127 cases not associated with reptiles had such serious infections.\n\nSalmonella is transferred from pets to humans when a reptile excretes the bacteria out of its gut, Murphy said. This is especially dangerous for young toddlers, who may be in an \u201coral exploration phase\u201d and are more likely to ingest the bacteria, he said.\n\nBerger recommended hand washing after any contact with turtles and other reptiles, but also noted that for children under one year, \u201cthere is a high risk for indirect transmission and disease caused by Salmonella (even if the baby has no direct contact with the reptile.)\u201d\n\nMurphy and his coauthor caution that as indoor reptiles become more popular as pets, more children are likely to be hospitalized with Salmonella infections and doctors need to be aware of this risk.\n\nMurphy recommends that parents of young children with indoor reptile pets should consider restricting the reptile\u2019s access to the same spaces the child uses.\n\nParents of young children looking to get a reptile \u201cshould consider holding off on that until the child is past the oral exploration stage, stopped crawling and old enough to wash their own hands,\u201d he said.\n\n(Reporting by Madeline Kennedy)\n\nSOURCE: http://bmj.co/1tBKYmd Archives of Diseases in Childhood, online December 22, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "salmonella, pet reptile, pet turtle, bacteria, bacterial infection, salmonella poisoning", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In the UK, one in four children younger than age five who were infected with Salmonella got the disease from a pet reptile.", "title": "Your Pet Reptile Could be Carrying Salmonella", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pet-reptiles-create-high-risk-severe-salmonella-infections-children-316084", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/pet-turtle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the UK, one in four children younger than age five who were infected with Salmonella got the disease from a pet reptile.", "title": "Your Pet Reptile Could be Carrying Salmonella", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pet-reptiles-create-high-risk-severe-salmonella-infections-children-316084", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/pet-turtle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/pet-turtle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2015-01-02T16:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T16:02:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In the UK, one in four children younger than age five who were infected with Salmonella got the disease from a pet reptile."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc94c\"", "article_summary": "The children with reptile-associated infections were significantly younger than other kids with Salmonella infections, more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to have invasive infections that affected the blood or brain.\nEight of the 48 children with infections linked to reptiles had blood infections, meningitis or colitis.\nMurphy recommends that parents of young children with indoor reptile pets should consider restricting the reptile\u2019s access to the same spaces the child uses.\nMurphy and another researcher used data on Salmonella infections in children under five years old in the South West area of the UK from 2010 to 2013.\nThe median age of kids with Salmonella cases linked to reptiles was six months old, compared to about one year among kids not exposed to reptiles."}
