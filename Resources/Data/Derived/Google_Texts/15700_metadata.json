Now, Republican lawmakers want answers on why they are still collecting user fees.\n\nThe agency requires most Qualified Health Plans to pay a 3.5 percent fee on plans sold through the federally-facilitated marketplace, but the flexibility granted to state exchanges to set up and collect the fees has become a concern for the congressmen.\n\nTop members from the House Ways and Means Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee expressed their unease over Oregon and Nevada retaining 100 percent of the fees.\n\n\u201cCMS has apparently allowed at least two of these states (Oregon and Nevada), to retain 100 percent of the fees they collected,\u201d wrote Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight Chairman Peter Roskam, House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton and Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy. \u201cEssentially, this allows Oregon, Nevada, and any other state with this particular arrangement, to use the FFM for free while pocketing user fees charged to QHPs in their state for their own use.\u201d\n\nThe congressmen said taxpayers should not be on the hook for the costs.\n\nThe lawmakers called on the agency to provide information on all agreements between the states and related to the FFMs and how much of the establishment grants.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
