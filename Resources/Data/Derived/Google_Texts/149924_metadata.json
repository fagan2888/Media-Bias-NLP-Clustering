It was just what Nancy Pelosi wanted.\n\nThe House Democratic leader has been pressing the White House to talk more about the issue, according to a person familiar with the discussions. It remains the top concern of voters before congressional elections in which Democratic prospects for a House majority are dim, even with Islamic extremism and Ebola dominating the national conversation.\n\nWhile the U.S. is driving global growth -- payrolls are expanding at the fastest pace in 15 years and unemployment is at a six-year low -- Americans now trust Republicans more to handle the economy, polls show. That reversal of a historical trend doesn\u2019t bode well for Democrats, and Pelosi knows it.\n\n\u201cHe should brag about it,\u201d she said of the economy, in an interview yesterday in her Capitol Hill office. Obama regularly mentions the economy at appearances, stressing how far the country has come since he took office. Pelosi said that while lately his time has been consumed by foreign policy demands, he should \u201csing his own praises and boast of what he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nFor Pelosi, 74, a California Democrat who was the first female House speaker, the issue is both political and personal. Her role in enacting Obama\u2019s policies -- the bailout of General Motors, the passage of Obamacare and a $787 billion stimulus plan -- was integral to the U.S. economic recovery.\n\n\u2018Owns Them\u2019\n\n\u201cShe owns them as much as he does,\u201d said David Mayhew, a political science professor at Yale University. While most Americans consider Pelosi\u2019s role in Obama\u2019s legacy a \u201csubtext,\u201d he said, they \u201ccould well be calling it Pelosicare instead of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPelosi, who lost the speaker\u2019s gavel to Republican John Boehner four years ago, has been hammering on economic data points in speeches, editorial board meetings and forums. She\u2019s touting Obama\u2019s record since 2009, when he inherited an economy mired in the deepest recession in seven decades.\n\nThe U.S. is in its sixth year of expansion following the worst slump since the Great Depression. The Labor Department said today that a surge in hiring pushed the jobless rate to a six-year low of 5.9 percent in September, down from a 26-year high of 10 percent in October 2009. The economy grew 4.6 percent in the second quarter, the fastest rate since the last three months of 2011.\n\nNet worth for households and nonprofits increased by $1.39 trillion from April through June to $81.5 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\u2019s longest streak of quarterly gains since 1998 combined with home-price appreciation helped to bolster Americans\u2019 finances.\n\nStruggling Households\n\nYet 7.28 million Americans work part time because they can\u2019t find full-time jobs, and wage growth barely outpaces inflation. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen cited a report showing the median net worth of the bottom fifth of households by income was just $6,400 last year, and many of those 25 million households \u201chad no wealth or had negative net worth.\u201d\n\nMiddle-class incomes haven\u2019t returned to pre-recession levels. Annual median household income in July was still more than $2,600 lower than at the start of the recession in December 2007, according to Sentier Research, a consulting firm.\n\nObama\u2019s economic policies aren\u2019t \u201ctranslating into the lives of the American people,\u201d Pelosi said during a Sept. 29 Bloomberg News breakfast in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s the right direction, but it\u2019s not there yet for Main Street.\u201d\n\n\u2018Bitter Pill\u2019\n\nMany Americans agree. They prefer by 11 percentage points that Republicans rather than Democrats handle the economy, according to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted Sept. 12-15. That compares with a 15-point advantage Democrats had in a July 2007 Wall Street Journal survey.\n\nPelosi said Democrats have taken a hit for policies they championed -- such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto-industry bailout. Such programs were politically unpopular before they proved critical to reviving the economy, she said.\n\n\u201cWe swallowed the bitter pill on a lot of these things that helped the economy, but you have to explain it to people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot assume that they know. It\u2019s indicative of the fact that we haven\u2019t done a good enough job explaining.\u201d\n\nPelosi asked members of her caucus this week to give more money for the congressional elections even as she acknowledged that Democrats weren\u2019t likely to win control of the House, according to two people who listened to a conference call. She said they need to win as many committee seats as possible.\n\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t win\u201d the House, she said in the interview, \u201cif we win seats, then we have more opportunity.\u201d\n\nLow Approval\n\nBrad Blakeman, a senior staff member in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, said the issue goes beyond messaging.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 approval ratings are underwater because they lack a vision to improve the economy, with their most ambitious proposal being an increase in the minimum wage, said Blakeman, now a policy professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cThe American people know better,\u201d he said. \u201cPelosi is joined at the hip with Obama.\u201d\n\nObama, in his speech yesterday at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said while the economy\u2019s gains haven\u2019t been \u201cbroadly shared,\u201d the U.S. is outperforming other nations.\n\n\u201cOur economy isn\u2019t just primed for steadier, more sustained growth,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is better poised to lead and succeed in the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.\u201d The U.S., he said, \u201chas put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined.\u201d\n\nPelosi spent the first 20 minutes of a Sept. 29 interview with Bloomberg News editors and reporters detailing the effort to forestall a meltdown of U.S. financial markets in 2008 and prevent a government shutdown last year.\n\nObama-Pelosi Record\n\nThe Obama-Pelosi record includes the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, legislation to create lending programs for small businesses, tax cuts to encourage businesses to hire, accelerated write-offs for small businesses and a bill to increase Pell college grants.\n\nIt is the era near the end of Bush\u2019s administration that Pelosi wants the American public to recall as they head to the ballot box next month.\n\nShe noted the six-year anniversary, on Sept. 29, of the House\u2019s initial rejection of the Bush administration\u2019s $700 billion financial-bailout plan.\n\nThe measure, crafted by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, was intended to get lending markets back in working order. It wasn\u2019t offered, Pelosi says, until after she called Paulson on Sept. 18 and he first shared his view that the U.S. was on the verge of economic collapse.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well then, why am I calling you?\u2019\u201d Pelosi recalled, and later met with Paulson and then-Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.\n\n\u2018Totally Irresponsible\u2019\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We were saving it for the next president.\u2019 They were just trying to make it six more weeks\u201d until the 2008 presidential election, she said. \u201cThis was totally irresponsible,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a big deal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Paulson\u2019s office, he spoke with Pelosi frequently, including multiple times on Sept. 16, when he asked her for a meeting, a request she couldn\u2019t accept because of scheduling difficulties.\n\n\u201cThey sought emergency powers from Congress at the earliest time they thought Congress would approve them, recognizing how devastating it would be to the market if Congress voted it down, which the House did the first time,\u201d Claire Buchan Parker, a spokeswoman for Paulson, said in a statement.\n\nD.J. Nordquist, a spokeswoman for Bernanke, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStanding Firm\n\nPelosi calls the health-care law, the Affordable Care Act, \u201cmy proudest achievement.\u201d\n\nIt was her pressure that stopped congressional Democrats from agreeing to weaken the legislation after Scott Brown won Ted Kennedy\u2019s old Massachusetts Senate seat on a promise to thwart Obamacare, according to a March 28, 2010, Washington Post report.\n\nShe persuaded Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to stand firm. She also headed off an attempt by Democratic Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan to attach a ban on public funding for abortions in exchange for his support, the newspaper reported.\n\nPelosi then pushed the legislation through the House with only Democratic votes, a solidarity that was a hallmark of her speakership.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s held her caucus together with remarkable cohesion and unity, in a way that\u2019s really unprecedented on either side of the aisle in the past couple of decades,\u201d said Cindy Simon-Rosenthal, co-author of a 2010 book, \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and the New American Politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heidi Przybyla", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama yesterday devoted his first full speech in two months to the economy\u2019s strength.
