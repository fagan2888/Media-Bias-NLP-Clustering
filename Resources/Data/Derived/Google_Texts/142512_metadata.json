Kobach said even some motor vehicle bureau workers automatically ask customers if they want to register to vote, which some noncitizens in the past have cited as their reason for breaking the law to register.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a guarantee it will happen,\u201d Mr. Kobach said.\n\nDemocrats disputed that it was an issue at all, saying Mr. Obama\u2019s new policy, which could apply to more than 4 million illegal immigrants, doesn\u2019t change anything in state or federal law.\n\nPHOTOS: Top earning dead celebrities\n\nDelegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress, accused Republicans of an effort at voter suppression.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order gives immigrants the right to stay \u2014 immigrants who have been here for years, immigrants who have been working hard and whose labor we have needed,\u201d Ms. Norton said. \u201cThe Republicans may want to go down in history as the party who tried once again 100 years later to nullify the right to vote. Well, I am here to say they shall not succeed.\u201d\n\nRep. Stephen F. Lynch, Massachusetts Democrat, said he doubted illegal immigrants would risk running afoul of the law \u2014 which could get them deported \u2014 just to be an insignificant part of an election.\n\nThe hearing was the latest GOP effort to dent Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action, announced in November, which grants tentative legal status and work permits to as many as 4 million illegal immigrant parents whose children are either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The president also expanded a 2012 policy for so-called Dreamers, or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, granting them tentative legal status and work permits as well.\n\nRepublicans say there are a host of unintended consequences, including the chances of illegal voting, a perverse incentive created by Obamacare that would make newly legalized workers more attractive to some businesses than American workers and complications with the tax code.\n\nThe newly legalized workers can apply for back refunds from the IRS even for years when they didn\u2019t file their taxes, agency Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Koskinen said the White House never spoke with him about potential consequences before Mr. Obama announced his policy changes. The secretaries of state who testified to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Thursday said they too never heard from Mr. Obama ahead of time.\n\nMr. Husted has written the Obama administration asking for help in identifying the name and date of birth of all noncitizens who get Social Security numbers, which he said would allow states to go back and clear illegally registered voters from their rolls.\n\nHe said the administration hasn\u2019t responded.\n\n\u201cWhy I wrote the letter is I want to comply with federal law,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthew Dunlap, Maine\u2019s secretary of state, said he believed the laws already on the books are good enough to stop any voting mischief in his state, and he doubted illegal immigrants had incentive or intent to try to interfere with U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cMy experience is they don\u2019t come here to vote, and they don\u2019t come here to drive. They come here for a better life,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kobach countered with a story about a legal permanent resident who had not yet become a citizen but who registered and voted nonetheless, and who said she wanted to support candidates who would help her earn citizenship faster.\n\nOnly four states require proof of citizenship before someone registers to vote, Mr. Kobach said. And even in those states, the federal government offers voter registration cards that don\u2019t require proof of citizenship, giving determined illegal immigrants a way to circumvent checks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's temporary deportation amnesty will make it easier for illegal immigrants to improperly register and vote in elections, state elections officials testified to Congress on Thursday, saying that the driver's licenses and Social Security numbers they will be granted create a major voting loophole.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s temporary deportation amnesty will make it easier for illegal immigrants to improperly register and vote in elections, state elections officials testified to Congress on Thursday, saying that the driver\u2019s licenses and Social Security numbers they will be granted create a major voting loophole.", "title": "Obama amnesty creates loophole for illegal immigrants to register, vote in elections", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/12/obama-amnesty-creates-loophole-for-illegal-immigra/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/12/vote.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/12/vote.jpg", "description": "President Obama's temporary deportation amnesty will make it easier for illegal immigrants to improperly register and vote in elections, state elections officials testified to Congress on Thursday, sa", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama amnesty creates loophole for illegal immigrants to register, vot"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Kris W Kobach, Jon Husted, Congress"}, "article_summary": "Only four states require proof of citizenship before someone registers to vote, Mr. Kobach said.\nAnd even in those states, the federal government offers voter registration cards that don\u2019t require proof of citizenship, giving determined illegal immigrants a way to circumvent checks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a guarantee it will happen,\u201d Mr. Kobach said.\nPresident Obama\u2019s temporary deportation amnesty will make it easier for illegal immigrants to improperly register and vote in elections, state elections officials testified to Congress on Thursday, saying that the driver\u2019s licenses and Social Security numbers they will be granted create a major voting loophole.\nThe president also expanded a 2012 policy for so-called Dreamers, or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, granting them tentative legal status and work permits as well."}
