Ted Cruz, R-Texas, talked with reporters on one side of his brightly painted tour bus, a growing crescendo of voices chanting, \u201cTed! Ted! Ted! Ted!\u201d nearly drowned out the voice of the junior senator from Texas during a Wednesday morning stop in Little Rock as his presidential campaign made a swing through Arkansas.\n\nJammed into the parking lot of the Republican Party of Arkansas\u2019 Sixth Street headquarters, two blocks east of the State Capitol Building, a large crowd was gathered, waving signs, cheering and waiting for the 44-year-old tea party favorite to step up on the flatbed trailer set up as a stage and grab the microphone to kick off his latest stop on his \u201cRe-Igniting America\u201d tour.\n\n\u201cGod bless the great state of Arkansas!\u201d Cruz began, after his introduction by Rep. Bob Ballinger, R-Hindsville, co-chair of Cruz\u2019s Arkansas campaign.\n\nHe then quickly launched into a riff of politically-themed barbs aimed at Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, which drew laughter and shouts from the crowd, moving on to a series of talking points that had people cheering and pumping campaign signs in the air.\n\nAmong those points, Cruz said, if elected, that he will have the Justice Department open an investigation into the activities of Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women\u2019s health organization, to disband the Department of Education, discontinue Common Core, do away with the Internal Revenue Service, repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the Iran Nuclear Accord.\n\nAdditionally, he thundered, \u201cI will instruct the Department of Justice, the IRS, and every other federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today!\u201d which prompted loud cheers and applause.\n\nFollowing his stop in Little Rock, Cruz continued on to stops in Russellville for a public meet and greet, then on to Van Buren, where he was keynote speaker at the Lincoln Day Dinner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 As Sen.
