Damn it, there\u2019s very little common ground between left and right, but what there is is compromise,\u201d explained Matthews. \u201cYou do something for me on minimum wage, I\u2019ll do something for you in corporate tax reform. You give me something on corporate tax reform and I\u2019ll get rid of some of the loopholes or I\u2019ll do something on trade for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe misses the main point of politics which is to be a politician and to trade,\u201d the MSNBC host continued. \u201cYou want this? Okay, you want to take care of people who have been here illegally for 20, 30 years? Here\u2019s what I want. No more illegal hiring, and that\u2019s all in the Senate bill. But he won\u2019t sell the compromise.\u201d\n\nAs a result, said Matthews, Obama will likely get into quite a tussle with new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kent.) when the new Congress takes over in January.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in this guy that just plays to his constituency and acts like there is no other world out there,\u201d Matthews spat. \u201cAnd that\u2019s going to be a collision at the end of this year like you haven\u2019t seen. I do believe it will be like waving a red flag in front of the bull. I think Mitch McConnell is headed for a fight with the president.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below, via Real Clear Politics:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "After the president's press conference Wednesday afternoon addressing the midterm election results, Matthews complained of Obama's refusal to compromise with members of Congress, accusing him of \"miss[ing] the main point of politics.\"", "title": "Chris Matthews: Obama 'misses the main point of politics,' will...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 543, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/11/matthews-obama-543x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/11/05/chris-matthews-obama-misses-main-point-politics-will-fight-mitch-mcconnell/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-midterm-election-press-conference", "published_time": "2014-11-05T17:59:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T17:59:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But he won\u2019t sell the compromise.\u201dAs a result, said Matthews, Obama will likely get into quite a tussle with new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kent.)\nI think Mitch McConnell is headed for a fight with the president.\u201dWatch the video below, via Real Clear Politics:\n\u201cYou do something for me on minimum wage, I\u2019ll do something for you in corporate tax reform.\nPresident Obama is so unpopular that even MSNBC host Chris Matthews is criticizing him.\nDamn it, there\u2019s very little common ground between left and right, but what there is is compromise,\u201d explained Matthews."}
