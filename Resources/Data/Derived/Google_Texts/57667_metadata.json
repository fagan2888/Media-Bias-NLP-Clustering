In partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), Kim is pushing to dramatically reduce the number of people around the world who are impoverished by medical expenses.\n\nEach year, an estimated 100 million people slip into poverty because they cannot afford their expensive medical care. The World Bank and WHO hope to cut that number down to 50 million by 2020, and all the way down to zero by 2030, by encouraging more countries to implement universal health care programs.\n\n\u201cUniversal health coverage is financially feasible and makes good economic sense,\u201d WHO director general Margaret Chan explained on Friday. \u201cIt is the ultimate expression of fairness. People are not left behind to die.\u201d\n\nAlthough extending health care to additional people can seem like an insurmountable expense for nations to take on, Kim pointed to Japan \u2014 which implemented universal health care in 1961 \u2014 as an example of the value of this type of investment. \u201cThe fact is that Japan committed to universal health coverage when its per capita income was not at the highest levels and many people thought it could not afford it,\u201d Kim noted. Economists believe that move ended up strengthening the country\u2019s middle class. The World Bank is partnering with Japan to help developing nations work toward universal health care for their own populations.\n\nKim, who was nominated by President Obama last year to head the World Bank, has long been a pioneer in the health care sector. He co-founded a nonprofit organization to combat tuberculosis around the world, served as the director of the Department of HIV/AIDS at WHO, and launched a research program at Dartmouth University to study the most effective ways to deliver health care. He\u2019s widely acclaimed for his work in global health and development.\n\nHere in the United States, Obamacare represented a big step toward Kim\u2019s goal of reducing the number of uninsured people struggling to pay their bills. Kim has commended the health reform law for expanding access to coverage, as well as expressed concern that it doesn\u2019t go far enough to make sure that insurance is affordable for every single individual. Indeed, the U.S. has more work to do over the next several years in order to meet the World Bank\u2019s new goal. Because Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t being implemented in every state, for example, five million of the poorest Americans still don\u2019t have any access to affordable insurance.\n\nThe World Bank has been outspoken on the need to tackle other looming public health issues as well, pointing out that the devastating effects of climate change will harm the poorest nations.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Universal health coverage is financially feasible and makes good economic sense.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Universal health coverage is financially feasible and makes good economic sense.\"", "title": "The World Bank Pushes For Universal Health Care In Every Nation By 2030", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/06/3029931/world-bank-universal-health-care/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kim.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Universal health coverage is financially feasible and makes good economic sense.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kim-321x214.jpg", "title": "The World Bank Pushes For Universal Health Care In Every Nation By 2030", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kim.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kim.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-06T09:10:54+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca07\"", "article_summary": "Health The World Bank Pushes For Universal Health Care In Every Nation By 2030 CREDIT: AP Photo/Koji Sasahara World Bank President Jim Yong KimThe president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, made the economic case for health care coverage on Friday, pointing out that making health care more accessible is \u201ccrucial\u201d for combating poverty and spurring economic development.\nThe World Bank is partnering with Japan to help developing nations work toward universal health care for their own populations.\n\u201cUniversal health coverage is financially feasible and makes good economic sense,\u201d WHO director general Margaret Chan explained on Friday.\nThe World Bank and WHO hope to cut that number down to 50 million by 2020, and all the way down to zero by 2030, by encouraging more countries to implement universal health care programs.\nKim, who was nominated by President Obama last year to head the World Bank, has long been a pioneer in the health care sector."}
