John Kasich, who went around his party's Republican-controlled legislature to enact Medicaid expansions in the state last year, says he doesn't see the expansion as \"really connected to Obamacare,\" which he does not support.The difference has led to a tiff between the governor, who is being mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential contender and The Associated Press, reports Politico , after the news provider reported Kasich had said Republicans would not repeal Obamacare if they take over the Senate.Kasich, who is seeking re-election in two weeks, maintains he was talking specifically about Medicaid, not the entire Affordable Care Act, but the AP and its writer, Julie Carr Smyth, insist they quoted the governor correctly.According to a recording of the interview, provided by Kasich's office, the interview between Smyth and Kasich shifted quickly from the governor's efforts to renew Medicaid expansion to a further threat to his measure. And in the recording and a shorter transcript from the AP, reports Politico, the reporter does not mention Obamacare or other aspects of the law more broadly.In the exchange, Smyth asked Kasich: \u201cSo, if the Republicans take the Senate, do you think you\u2019ll have to work to, um, you\u2019ll have to work advocating for it in Washington as well?\u201dKasich then replied, \"They\u2019re not gonna repeal it.\u201dHe then went on to say that \u201cThe opposition to it was really either political or ideological,\" reports The Washington Post . \"I don\u2019t think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\u201dOn Tuesday, Kasich told The Post that he doesn't back Obamacare, he never has, and he wants it repealed.\"If the House and the Senate [are Republican-controlled] and we have a Republican president, Obamacare will be repealed flat out. Flat out. And it will be replaced.\u201dBut he did admit he supports advanced insurance coverage plans, The Post reports.\u201cI support covering a population of people who are drug-addicted and mentally ill. I support eliminating pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Kasich. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my feeling and support to the ACA.\u201dAP Washington bureau chief Sally Buzbee told Politico the wire service is standing behind its reporting, and \"accurately quoted Ohio Gov. John Kasich as predicting that repeal won\u2019t happen and that helping poor people gain health coverage is more powerful than political or ideological opposition.\u201dThe AP did update its story Monday night to clarify that Kasich was referring only to Medicaid expansion after the governor and his staff called to complain. But Buzbee said that the report was updated with new comments while not changing Kasich's original quote \"because it was and remains accurate.\u201cBut Kasich insists he was speaking about Medicaid, not the entire Affordable Care Act, and that he always separates the two.\u201cI do not support Obamacare,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cI have favored expanding Medicaid, but I don\u2019t really see expanding Medicaid as really connected to Obamacare.\u201dBut Medicaid is a key part of Obamacare, as more people have signed up for the program than for insurance through federal exchanges. Further, states like Ohio that expanded Medicaid ended up enrolling more people for healthcare coverage.Many Republicans, though, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, want the entire ACA shut down, which would also mean ending expanded Medicaid coverage.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said that the accuracy of the quote is not being disputed, but the context in which it was used is.\u201cFor them to fail to acknowledge their error and instead claim we \u2018clarified,\u2019 makes it seem like we backpedaled on something when we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that they weren\u2019t big enough to acknowledge an innocent mistake and simply fix it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Kasich, Ohio, Obamacare", "pubdate": "2014-10-22T11:56:20", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Ohio Gov.
