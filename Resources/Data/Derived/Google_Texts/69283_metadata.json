I\u2019m also honored to have served this past year as leader of the Senate\u2019s new Republican majority.\n\nWhen you voted for this new majority last November, the Senate was a mess. Some thought the Senate could never be cured of its dysfunction and its gridlock.\n\nBut the new majority you elected didn\u2019t agree. We believed the Senate could be restored to a place of high purpose again, and we\u2019ve made great strides over the past year proving that it can.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did it.\n\nWe got committees working again, just like we promised.\n\nWe opened up the legislative process, just like we promised.\n\nWe gave Senators of both parties more of a say, and it opened a floodgate of legislative accomplishments and good ideas.\n\nWe passed a balanced budget, for the first time since 2001.\n\nWe reformed No Child Left Behind and its Common Core mandates\u2014replacing a broken law with the most significant K-12 education reform in more than a dozen years.\n\nWe addressed America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges\u2014passing the first long-term transportation bill in a decade.\n\nAt a time of economic uncertainty, we passed permanent tax relief for families and small businesses. We voted to empower job creation by doing things like lift a 40-year ban on energy exports and an act to measure that can help knock down foreign trade barriers.\n\nAt a time of diverse global threats, we voted to enact significant military acquisition reform and to provide more of the funding needed to modernize our armed forces. We voted to help those who\u2019ve suffered from the VA scandal and to give our troops the support they need to better confront threats like ISIL.\n\nWe passed legislation to help protect your personal financial information from cyberattackers.\n\nWe made important reforms to help improve the viability of programs you look to in retirement, like Medicare.\n\nWe worked together to extend a hand of compassion to wounded veterans and to bring a ray of hope to victims of human trafficking and modern slavery.\n\nAnd when it came to some of Washington\u2019s artificial cliffs and manufactured dramas, we were able to pass real, permanent solutions instead of more temporary patches.\n\nThese are just a few of the measures the new Senate has passed this year.\n\nMany issues languished in the old Senate for years.\n\nSome were assumed to be too difficult for any Senate majority to address.\n\nBut the Republican Senate you elected, working with the men and women who stand up for you in the House of Representatives, tackled each of them\u2014and the President signed most into law.\n\nOf course there are other bills he didn\u2019t or won\u2019t sign.\n\nLike the one we passed to repeal a health law that attacks the Middle Class: Obamacare.\n\nOr the ones we passed to protect coal families, or to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a new President will be required to notch wins like those for the Middle Class.\n\nBut the Republican Senate majority is proving that you can still get a lot done with a President from a different party.\n\nWe\u2019re proving you can actually enact significant, long-term reforms\u2014achieve conservative policy goals\u2014and get them signed into law.\n\nThat\u2019s good for the Senate. Most importantly, it\u2019s good for our country.\n\nI\u2019m proud of what the new Republican majority has accomplished in such a short time.\n\nWe\u2019re not only putting the Senate back to work, we\u2019re putting it back to work on your side.\n\nJust like you asked. Just like we promised.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you and your family, and to all of our brave armed services stationed abroad around the world.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "McConnell: 'I'm Proud of What the New Republican Majority Has Accomplished'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "McConnell: 'I'm Proud of What the New Republican Majority Has Accomplished'", "title": "McConnell: 'I'm Proud of What the New Republican Majority Has Accomplished' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/McConnell-1219-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/19/mcconnell-im-proud-of-what-the-new-republican-majority-has-accomplished/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "McConnell: 'I'm Proud of What the New Republican Majority Has Accomplished'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/McConnell-1219-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "McConnell: 'I'm Proud of What the New Republican Majority Has Accomplished' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mitch McConnell,Breitbart TV,McConnell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Mitch McConnell", "published_time": "2015-12-19T10:24:45-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m proud of what the new Republican majority has accomplished in such a short time.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTranscript (via ABC News Radio) as Follows:\u201cHello, I\u2019m Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nI\u2019m also honored to have served this past year as leader of the Senate\u2019s new Republican majority.\nBut the Republican Senate majority is proving that you can still get a lot done with a President from a different party.\nSome were assumed to be too difficult for any Senate majority to address."}
