Palmer indicated he wanted to work in North Las Vegas, and City Manager Qiong Liu said she found him a space.\n\nShe said the human resources department has a budget of about $1.27 million for personnel, though with the two vacancies, the current cost is likely somewhere between $700,000 and $800,000. North Las Vegas already outsources its worker\u2019s compensation.\n\nLiu said no changes have happened yet, but the city is putting out a bid to see what offers come back so it can evaluate whether outsourcing would cut costs.\n\nA North Las Vegas human resources employee contacted by the Review-Journal declined to comment.\n\nLiu said the city was inspired by how other cities had outsourced their human resources departments, such as Reno.\n\nReno\u2019s Human Resources Director Kelly Leerman, who has been with the city for about two weeks and replaced the previous human resources director, said that though the city outsources some tasks, like payroll and worker\u2019s compensation, it has a department with about eight or nine people.\n\n\u201cI exist,\u201d Leerman said. \u201cI have an office and everything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/government/north-las-vegas-looks-outsourcing-human-resources", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "BETHANY BARNES LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "North Las Vegas looks at outsourcing human resources", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_NLV-Library_100814sm_004_11.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "The North Las Vegas city manager told the city\u2019s six human resources employees Wednesday she is considering outsourcing their jobs.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/government/north-las-vegas-looks-outsourcing-human-resources", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_NLV-Library_100814sm_004_11.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_PALMER_6.jpg"}, "title": "North Las Vegas looks at outsourcing human resources", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-12T01:59:15Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2007241"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2960767", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2960767", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "BETHANY BARNES LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Government", "keywords": "Government,News, Politics, Las Vegas,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T18:59:15-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Government,News,Politics,Las Vegas", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "The North Las Vegas city manager told the city\u2019s six human resources employees Wednesday she is considering outsourcing their jobs.", "title": "North Las Vegas looks at outsourcing human resources", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/government/north-las-vegas-looks-outsourcing-human-resources", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_NLV-Library_100814sm_004_11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "The North Las Vegas city manager told the city\u2019s six human resources employees Wednesday she is considering outsourcing their jobs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1120\"", "article_summary": "The North Las Vegas city manager told the city\u2019s six human resources employees Wednesday she is considering outsourcing their jobs.\nA North Las Vegas human resources employee contacted by the Review-Journal declined to comment.\nPalmer indicated he wanted to work in North Las Vegas, and City Manager Qiong Liu said she found him a space.\nNorth Las Vegas already outsources its worker\u2019s compensation.\nLiu said the city was inspired by how other cities had outsourced their human resources departments, such as Reno."}
