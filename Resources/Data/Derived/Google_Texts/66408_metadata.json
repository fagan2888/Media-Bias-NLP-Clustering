Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, Health Republic of New Jersey and AmeriHealth all indicated they would continue to participate in the marketplace through which consumers can get federal subsidies.\n\nThe new rates will be for policies that take effect in 2015. The open enrollment period to purchase them begins Nov. 15.\n\nAll four companies declined to provide any specific prices included in their rate filings.\n\nIn the intervening months, the department\u2019s role will be limited to reviewing a company\u2019s underlying calculations to make sure they aren\u2019t wildly unrealistic, said Ray Castro, senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective.\n\nIf a company sets its rates too low, it could lose money on the policies. If it sets rates too high, it could run afoul of the state rule that a company must use at least 80 percent of its policy revenue to pay claims.\n\nBut the public can\u2019t provide any input to that review, as they can in other states, Castro said.\n\n\u201cThe lack of transparency is a concern,\u201d he said.\n\nIn many other states, health insurance rate filings are made public upon filing.\n\nBased on an analysis of plans in nine of those states, the consulting firm Avalere Health said eight of them showed a jump in rates of anywhere from 2 percent to 18 percent for next year.\n\nIn only one of those states \u2014 Oregon \u2014 will rates go down.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration announced earlier this week that people who purchased health insurance through Healthcare.gov will not have to re-enroll for 2015. Instead, their policies will automatically renew.\n\nThose whose incomes have changed significantly may want to consider re-enrolling so their subsidy is adjusted. That subsidy is actually the monthly advancement of a tax credit, so if they receive too much, it will be taken out of any future tax refund. If their income is expected to drop next year, reporting that change in circumstances to Healthcare.gov could boost their subsidy for next year.\n\nThey can also go onto the website again if they want to switch policies.\n\nThe enrollment period for 2015 will last half as long as it did for the initial rollout of Obamacare.\n\nIt will be just three months, ending Feb. 15.\n\nAnd the penalty for not having health insurance in 2015 increases to 2 percent of income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child, whichever is more.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@health','@river'", "title": "4th insurer to sell Obamacare plans in NJ", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"4th insurer to sell Obamacare plans in NJ\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/06/4th_insurer_to_sell_obamacare_plans_in_nj.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/nj-river/photo/nj-obamacare-262jpg-cbd2a78d9e71e10f.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13294918\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-28T11:51:42Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@health\",\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/nj-river/photo/14600331-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "description": "The new health insurance rates for Obamacare policies won't be known for months.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, June 28, 2014,  7:51 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/nj-river/photo/nj-obamacare-262jpg-cbd2a78d9e71e10f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The new health insurance rates for Obamacare policies won't be known for months.", "title": "4th insurer to sell Obamacare plans in NJ", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/06/4th_insurer_to_sell_obamacare_plans_in_nj.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, June 28, 2014,  7:48 AM", "article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "The new health insurance rates for Obamacare policies won't be known for months."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec72\"", "article_summary": "In many other states, health insurance rate filings are made public upon filing.\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration announced earlier this week that people who purchased health insurance through Healthcare.gov will not have to re-enroll for 2015.\nAnd the penalty for not having health insurance in 2015 increases to 2 percent of income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child, whichever is more.\nThe enrollment period for 2015 will last half as long as it did for the initial rollout of Obamacare.\nUnitedHealthcare, which currently sells policies in a dozen other states through the Healthcare.gov website, has applied to sell plans to New Jersey residents as well, a spokeswoman said."}
