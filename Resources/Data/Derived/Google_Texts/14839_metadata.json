All of the changes became effective July 1.\n\n\u201cSince 1982, AIS has produced outstanding research and publications, conferred over 300 degrees through the AIS Graduate Interdisciplinary Program, and engaged the campus and external communities,\u201d said Jennifer Barton, associate vice president for research. \u201cNow, in this next step in AIS\u2019 growth, it will have the opportunity to more fully engage undergraduate students and strengthen its existing activities.\u201d\n\nJohn Paul Jones III, the dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, says the move makes sense from a curriculum and research perspective.\n\n\u201cHaving AIS in an academic college should generate exciting new possibilities for collaboration within and outside of SBS [Social and Behavioral Sciences],\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt should mean more access to American Indian Studies courses for students at all levels of the curriculum, and since many of the departments in SBS have missions complementary to those of AIS, more research as well.\u201d SBS units that the new department can look forward to directly interacting with include the School of Anthropology, the Department of Gender and Women\u2019s Studies, the School of Geography and Development, the School of Government and Public Policy, the Department of History, the Department of Linguistics, the Department of Mexican American Studies and the Southwest Center.\n\nThe mission of American Indian Studies will not change with the move. It will continue to strive to develop a strong understanding of the languages, history, lands and cultures of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The unit is also focused on leadership and self-determination on tribal lands.\n\n\u201cWe value our relationship with many of the tribal nations throughout the country, particularly in Arizona, given our land-grant status as a university,\u201d said Karen Francis-Begay, assistant vice president for tribal relations. \u201cThere is value and benefit for AIS to have a home within a college where it will have outstanding leadership and support. Becoming a department gives AIS a stronger foundation to advance its interdisciplinary core strengths, which contributes to meaningful tribal community engagement and support.\u201d\n\nNow that it has moved to the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, AIS will begin the process of developing an undergraduate major. In the fall of 1997, the UA became the first educational institution in the United States to offer a doctorate in American Indian Studies.\n\n\u201cAs Arizona\u2019s elite research and teaching university, we have an opportunity to build on our world-class graduate program in American Indian Studies by offering an outstanding Bachelor of Arts in American Indian Studies,\u201d said Zepeda, who was most recently acting head of the Department of Linguistics and is also director of the UA\u2019s American Indian Language Development Institute. \u201cTaking advantage of the UA\u2019s commitment to 100 percent engagement, we expect our undergraduate program will have a strong sense of service to the Indian communities throughout Arizona and the Southwest.\u201d\n\nThe UA\u2019s 100 percent engagement initiative seeks to give all students an opportunity to gain hands-on experience\u2014through internships, research, service and other activities\u2014before they graduate.\n\nRon Trosper, professor of American Indian Studies and former program head, said that the move to a college also allows AIS to benefit from additional resources, such as help with fundraising, advising for undergraduate students, and faculty and graduate student research support.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to an exciting future for AIS as it sets out to become a traditional, degree-granting, academic program,\u201d Trosper said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of Arizona is making American Indian Studies more accessible by offering a bachelor's degree in the program.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/10/university-arizona-makes-american-indian-studies-more-accessible-155716", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/university-of-arizona-american-indian-studies-department.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "University of Arizona Makes American Indian Studies More Accessible"}, "abstract": "The University of Arizona is making American Indian Studies more accessible by offering a bachelor's degree in the program.", "keywords": "University of Arizona, Native American Education, American Indian Studies", "dc": {"title": "University of Arizona Makes American Indian Studies More Accessible"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/10/university-arizona-makes-american-indian-studies-more-accessible-155716", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-10T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "University of Arizona Makes American Indian Studies More Accessible"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca119\"", "article_summary": "The University of Arizona has made its American Indian Studies program a department, a change that allows for the development of a bachelor\u2019s degree in the discipline.\nIn the fall of 1997, the UA became the first educational institution in the United States to offer a doctorate in American Indian Studies.\nThe mission of American Indian Studies will not change with the move.\n\u201cAs Arizona\u2019s elite research and teaching university, we have an opportunity to build on our world-class graduate program in American Indian Studies by offering an outstanding Bachelor of Arts in American Indian Studies,\u201d said Zepeda, who was most recently acting head of the Department of Linguistics and is also director of the UA\u2019s American Indian Language Development Institute.\nIt will continue to strive to develop a strong understanding of the languages, history, lands and cultures of American Indians and Alaska Natives."}
