Later, it voluntarily disclosed that it had spent more than a quarter million dollars on direct corporate political donations in that year, including $100,000 to a so-called \u201cdark money\u201d group that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors. And then, without explanation, the company changed its account \u2013 which was vague to begin with \u2013 of exactly how much it had given and to what kinds of organizations.\n\nSo how much did the company really give that year? To whom? Did any of the contributions affect its billions in government contracts or the defense policy that is so crucial to General Dynamics\u2019 profits? We have no way of knowing. And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington found last year that corporations have not been voluntarily disclosing their political contributions in ways that are complete, accurate, or helpful in determining how they are attempting to build and use influence. General Dynamics decided in April 2014, just as CREW\u2019s report on the problems with voluntary disclosure came out, to stop its contributions to certain types of political organizations (although it had already given more than a half million dollars that year to dark money groups). But it is a very strong bet that many other contractors are still giving generously and secretly in an attempt to influence politics and our government.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous 2010 Citizens United decision \u2013 which allowed corporations to greatly increase their influence on politics and policy by spending as much as they want on so-called independent election expenditures \u2013 relied in part on the assumption that corporations would voluntarily disclose their political contributions and be held accountable by shareholders and the public. Like so much else in that decision, that assumption has been proven wrong.\n\nCongress has shown no inclination to fix the situation, but this is one area where President Obama, acting on his own, can make a real difference. The president can issue an executive order requiring federal contractors like General Dynamics to disclose all of their political giving, including contributions to dark money groups. He is apparently considering this step, but time is running out, and the need is severe.\n\nFederal contractors include huge and influential companies from defense giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing to Chevron, AT&T, Pfizer and, by many accounts, Koch Industries. And without full information about these companies\u2019 political giving, there\u2019s no way to know whether the contracts they receive and the policies they benefit from are also benefitting the public \u2013 or just the companies\u2019 profits \u2013 and whether these companies are playing fair in getting them.\n\nWe have seen examples of federal contractors improperly trying to influence awards of contracts. Recently, top federal contractor Lockheed Martin paid the Justice Department $4.7 million to settle charges that it had illegally used taxpayer money to pay lobbyist and former Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.) to help it get a $2.4 billion no-bid contract.\n\nThe Supreme Court was wrong in arguing in Citizens United that contributions to organizations, rather than candidates \u2013 the kinds of contributions that would be impacted by the possible executive order \u2013 are not corrupting. The recent indictment of Sen. Bob Menendez Robert MenendezDems pressure Obama on vow to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees Lobbying World This week: GOP lawmakers reckon with Trump MORE (D-N.JK.) alleges that favors for a donor were tied to contributions to a political organization; if proven, that would show a corrupting influence from exactly the type of contribution the Supreme Court said we shouldn\u2019t worry about. An executive order by the president can help address these kinds of problems by bringing these contributions into the light.\n\nWe know Americans are concerned about money in politics, and an executive order would only be a start to the solution. It would apply only to companies that receive government contracts, and it would not restrict their political giving \u2013 it would just allow us to know what they are giving. But it would be a good start.\n\nCREW has always believed that government can do better and that our government includes many good people trying to do good work for the American public. The pervasive influence of money makes it much harder for them to do that good work. With a stroke of his pen, the president can help.\n\nBookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Corporations have not been voluntarily disclosing their political contributions in ways that are complete, accurate, or helpful.", "description": "Corporations have not been voluntarily disclosing their political contributions in ways that are complete, accurate, or helpful.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Corporations have not been voluntarily disclosing their political contributions in ways that are complete, accurate, or helpful.", "title": "President should act to curb political abuses by federal contractors", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/258439-president-should-act-to-curb-political-abuses-by-federal", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/258439-president-should-act-to-curb-political-abuses-by-federal", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-29T15:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Noah Bookbinder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bob Menendez,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-29T15:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/258439-president-should-act-to-curb-political-abuses-by-federal", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Corporations have not been voluntarily disclosing their political contributions in ways that are complete, accurate, or helpful.", "card": "summary", "title": "President should act to curb political abuses by federal contractors"}, "dcterms.title": "President should act to curb political abuses by federal contractors"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab08\"", "article_summary": "The president can issue an executive order requiring federal contractors like General Dynamics to disclose all of their political giving, including contributions to dark money groups.\nAn executive order by the president can help address these kinds of problems by bringing these contributions into the light.\nWe know Americans are concerned about money in politics, and an executive order would only be a start to the solution.\nIt would apply only to companies that receive government contracts, and it would not restrict their political giving \u2013 it would just allow us to know what they are giving.\nFederal contractors include huge and influential companies from defense giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing to Chevron, AT&T, Pfizer and, by many accounts, Koch Industries."}
