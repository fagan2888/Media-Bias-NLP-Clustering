Before the Nuggets tipped off against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night, Denver guard Nate Robinson chased teammate Alonzo Gee in a circle around their teammates in a pregame huddle. The game wasn\u2019t ready to start until the goose caught up to the duck.\n\nRobinson is a quick one. And Gee\u2019s too tall to turn the loop. Duck, duck, goose. Tag. Game on.\n\nThe Nuggets, too, have been chasing themselves for three weeks. An ugly 1-6 start sent them reeling. Jobs were suddenly on the line \u2014 foremost for their coach, Brian Shaw, who admitted he might not see the New Year in Denver if the skid continued.\n\nSince then, the Nuggets found a direction. For the most part, they\u2019re no longer running in circles. And against the visiting Bulls, the Nuggets finally caught themselves.\n\nA 114-109 victory over a hobbled Chicago team \u2014 behind Ty Lawson\u2019s 20 points and Arron Afflalo\u2019s 19 \u2014 got the Nuggets (7-7) even for the season, for the first time since they were 1-1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not above water,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe\u2019re right there. It just means that the horrendous start we had, we kind of wiped that clean.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets never trailed the Bulls. Gee\u2019s two-handed dunk over Pau Gasol with 8:25 remaining gave Denver a 14-point lead. They later led by 16.\n\nAfflalo\u2019s long jumper with 40.3 seconds left and Lawson\u2019s jab-step two with 8.3 seconds remaining served as the Nuggets\u2019 game-sealing tag-outs.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to get back in the mix, to be playing for something,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe had a late start. But we\u2019re back to even.\u201d\n\nThe Bulls (9-6) were bitten from the beginning. Chicago was without Joakim Noah (eye bruise, knee injection) and Taj Gibson (left ankle).\n\nAnd star Bulls point guard Derrick Rose, easing back after several injuries, played just 10 minutes \u2014 he was on the court less than rookie Doug McDermott (11 minutes). Rose finished with just two points.\n\nBut the Bulls can\u2019t buy a win in Denver. They\u2019re now 1-14 at a mile high since 1998.\n\n\u201cI always look forward (to playing in Denver). It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said before the game. He might have been lying. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing everywhere else. You just have to play. C\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nShaw said the Nuggets\u2019 key to beating the Bulls was to play like an Eastern Conference team. Double-down on the 47-foot game. Attack quickly before Chicago can set up its defense.\n\n\u201cWe have to be efficient with our half-court offense,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nBy the time the Nuggets took a 16-8 lead early in the first quarter, every Denver starter had scored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do,\u201d Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari said. \u201cGet everybody involved.\u201d\n\nWith 2:55 left in the first, J.J. Hickson hit Kenneth Faried on a give-and-go that Faried dunked leaning in from outside the inner arc.\n\nAnd Lawson\u2019s crossover from the right side in the third quarter put Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich on his rump. It led to an easy lay-in for Timofey Mozgov.\n\nJimmy Butler\u2019s game-high 32 weren\u2019t enough for Chicago, even though the Bulls scored 32 points from the free-throw line to keep the game interesting with a minute left.\n\nWilson Chandler added 14 points and seven rebounds for the Nuggets, who won a fifth consecutive game and a sixth in their past seven.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re feeling good about ourselves,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBut we have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re getting better.\u201d\n\nDENVER AT PHOENIX\n\n7 p.m. Wednesday, ALT; 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Isaiah Thomas: The Suns have found plenty of playing time for the fourth-year pro in his first season in Arizona. Thomas, playing behind point guard Goran Dragic (14.1 points) and Eric Bledsoe (14.2), has still managed to lead the team in scoring at 15.5 points per game. He\u2019s been spot-on from 3-point range, hitting nearly 40 percent, and at the free-throw line, nailing better than 90 percent. The former University of Washington star was the 60th pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings, who traded him to Phoenix in July for Alex Oriakhi.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Behind Ty Lawson, Nuggets reach .500 with win over Chicago Bulls", "title": "Behind Ty Lawson, Nuggets reach .500 with win over Chicago Bulls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/25/behind-ty-lawson-nuggets-reach-500-with-win-over-chicago-bulls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141125__nuggets-lawsonp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141125__nuggets-lawsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T21:34:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:39:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2c1\"", "article_summary": "And Lawson\u2019s crossover from the right side in the third quarter put Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich on his rump.\nBefore the Nuggets tipped off against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night, Denver guard Nate Robinson chased teammate Alonzo Gee in a circle around their teammates in a pregame huddle.\nIt just means that the horrendous start we had, we kind of wiped that clean.\u201dThe Nuggets never trailed the Bulls.\nBy the time the Nuggets took a 16-8 lead early in the first quarter, every Denver starter had scored.\nC\u2019mon.\u201dShaw said the Nuggets\u2019 key to beating the Bulls was to play like an Eastern Conference team."}
