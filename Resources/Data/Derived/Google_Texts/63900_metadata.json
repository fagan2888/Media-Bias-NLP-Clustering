They're trying to totally isolate us from the federal government,\" says Representative Charlie Norr.\n\nTo meet the EPA\u2019s mandate, states can make existing plants more efficient, transition from coal to more gas and use more renewables like solar and wind.\n\nSenator Blunt and the state's major utility companies say costs will go up if the state has to move away from coal.\n\n\u201cAs those are cast aside, not yet paid for, not yet used their life up someone has to continue to pay for them as the people that pay the utility bill also get to pay for the new plant that replaces them,\u201d says Senator Blunt.\n\nCity Utilities last year announced the city would soon get a third of its energy from wind power.\n\nMills says that's proof the state can implement the Clean Power Plan.\n\n\"They did that because it was a cheaper way to provide electricity. We have so much innovation in our state. I know if we really put our minds to it we can come up with ways to make this cost effective.\"\n\nA lower appeals court is expected to hear a challenge to the clean power plan early this summer.\n\nIf that court does not uphold the regulations, its likely environmentalists would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- A group of concerned mothers and politicians met in Springfield today to urge republican lawmakers to back down from their opposition to the EPA's Clean Power Plan.", "author": "Nick Thompson", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- A group of concerned mothers and politicians met in Springfield today to urge republican lawmakers to back down from their opposition to the EPA's Clean Power Plan.", "title": "Group Meets in Springfield to Advocate for EPA's Plan", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/group-meets-in-springfield-to-advocate-for-epas-plan", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ozarksfirst/photo/2016/03/28/IMG_2269_1459217913195_7813316_ver1.0_640_360.jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "keywords": "News,Local News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-03-29T02:19:20+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T02:19:20+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "-- A group of concerned mothers and politicians met in Springfield today to urge republican lawmakers to back down from their opposition to the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\nA lower appeals court is expected to hear a challenge to the clean power plan early this summer.\nIf that court does not uphold the regulations, its likely environmentalists would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMills says that's proof the state can implement the Clean Power Plan.\nSpringfield's Eric Burlison has sponsored a bill to prevent Missouri from working with the feds on the Clean Power Plan until the Supreme Court rules on it."}
