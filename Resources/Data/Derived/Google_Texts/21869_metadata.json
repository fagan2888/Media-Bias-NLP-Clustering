Even in the minority, Senate Democrats still have enough leverage to slow, stall or kill Republican bills, and they are hopeful about retaking control in 2016.\n\nAnd then there are the House Democrats.\n\nWith their ranks severely depleted and with no control over the chamber\u2019s agenda, they are the most tangible symbols of the party\u2019s recent electoral defeats. And the wreckage has made discussions about the future difficult.\n\nBut it is that very future, and how to shape it, that will be the subject of closed-door meetings in Philadelphia on Thursday and Friday as House Democrats try to figure out how to rehabilitate themselves with voters.\n\nSome worry that the party could lose even more seats in 2016 under House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who maintains a firm grip on the caucus and is its top fundraiser.\n\nOn Wednesday night as the meetings began, Pelosi said Democrats are eager to draw contrasts with Republicans in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a presidential year, so we have to put on the table what we see as the big contrast in the House of Representatives,\u201d she said. \u201cThe presidential candidate will go forward with whatever agenda she has. Or he.\u201d\n\nA yawning gap has opened up in the 188-member caucus between an aging cast of urban liberals and their younger colleagues who come from the few districts Democrats control outside major cities.\n\nBeyond those generational and demographic tensions, Democrats continue to debate the best ways to attract a winning coalition in 2016.\n\n\u201cOur message cannot be a bunch of Democrats running around saying we have no message. That\u2019s not a good message,\u201d said Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.), the caucus\u2019s newly anointed message man. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get in a room and do a robust analysis of what message works and just start messaging it.\u201d\n\nOthers, including Rep. Peter Welch (Vt.), disagreed: \u201cPolitical hand-to-hand combat isn\u2019t getting us anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have credibility and nobody\u2019s listening, why do you spend time crafting a message that\u2019s essentially us talking to ourselves?\u201d\n\nMany in the caucus were buoyed by President Obama\u2019s expansive State of the Union address last week and are heartened to hear him \u2014 and several Republicans vying for the White House \u2014 discussing concerns about income inequality, an issue they\u2019ve worried about for several years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the deepest minority hole in a generation. So you would expect us to be down in the mouth and moping. We are not. We\u2019re thoroughly optimistic,\u201d said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who is in his second term.\n\nNone of the anxiety seems to be affecting Pelosi\u2019s hold on the reins. Many of those frustrated Democrats acknowledge that she remains a powerful leader who has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for party colleagues through the years and who this year has elevated several mid-level members into higher committee positions. But several remain unconvinced.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi needs to go to Philadelphia this week and give Democrats a clear path to picking up seats,\u201d one frustrated Democrat said. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything short of that, then she failed for the weekend.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat was more direct: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a couple of elections in a row. If we were a private company and kept losing profits, the first thing they\u2019d do is look at the CEO,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said Pelosi remains \u201cunmatched by anyone that I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime in terms of leading a political caucus.\u201d He said there is widespread agreement that \u201cgetting back in the majority should be number one on our agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to compare Day One of the Obama administration with today,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd when you make that comparison, it\u2019s unquestionable that the country is moving in the right direction. But how do we do that?\u201d\n\nOne idea on the table is for the party to finally embrace Obama\u2019s economic achievements while continuing to attack Republicans for focusing on issues such as immigration and abortion.\n\nRep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), a third-term lawmaker , thinks Democrats missed an easy opportunity to cast the Affordable Care Act as a job creator during the midterm campaign. While many of her party colleagues distanced themselves from the unpopular law, Bass said that with millions of Americans now receiving health care, the law means that \u201cclearly you\u2019re going to have to create new jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t distance ourselves from the president. We\u2019ve learned from that mistake, haven\u2019t we?\u201d she said.\n\nBut as the president tries to cement his legacy, some distance between him and Democratic lawmakers seems inevitable, most immediately on trade.\n\nRepublican leaders are preparing legislation that would grant Obama broad authority to finalize one of the largest free-trade pacts in the nation\u2019s history. But House Democrats and their biggest allies \u2014 organized labor and environmentalists \u2014 oppose such trade pacts and worry that Congress could give the administration too much power to negotiate details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement between the United States and 11 other countries.\n\nObama is likely to face questions on the trade pact when he speaks at the retreat on Thursday night. Vice President Biden will close the meetings Friday, according to copies of the agenda obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThere also will be breakout sessions Thursday focused on key policy concerns for Democrats \u2014 gun violence, seniors, education, government and campaign reform, and the economy. Invited experts include Howard Dean, a former Vermont governor; political strategist Jack Trout; and Simon Rosenberg, head of the New Democratic Network, a liberal think tank. Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam will serve as a lunchtime speaker on Thursday.\n\nRep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a leading voice on budget matters, will lead a strategy session on preparing for the release of a GOP-written budget plan. And Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (N.M.), the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, plans to share his early plans for the 2016 elections.\n\nLuj\u00e1n is well-liked in the caucus but untested on the national political stage. As lead campaign strategist, he\u2019ll have the task of devising a plan to win at least 30 seats to take back the majority \u2014 something many consider impossible.\n\n\u201cGetting the 30 they need will be a very steep climb,\u201d said Nathan L. Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. \u201cIf the president\u2019s numbers continue to climb and people feel good about the economy, that\u2019ll be good for Democrats, but they\u2019ll still have to convince voters to throw out Republicans. A good economy usually benefits all incumbents, no matter their party.\u201d\n\nDemocrats think that increased turnout among Democratic and independent voters in the presidential election will help them win back swing districts that have changed parties in recent years.\n\nTop targets for Democrats include Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who holds a Miami-area seat; Will Hurd (R-Tex.), who represents a sprawling district along the U.S.-Mexico border; Bob Dold (R-Ill.), from suburban Chicago; Frank Guinta (R-N.H.), who won in 2010, lost in 2012 and just reclaimed his seat; first-termers Rod Blum (R-Iowa) and Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.); and open seats in New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublicans dismiss talk of Democrats retaking the majority, believing that at worst, they\u2019ll lose just a few spots from their historic 246-seat majority. The National Republican Congressional Committee already is eyeing Reps. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.) and Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.), two longtime targets, and hopes to take back seats won by freshman Reps. Brad Ashford (D-Neb.) and Gwen Graham (D-Fla.).\n\n\u201cIf Democrats are going to change their messaging in 2016, they should focus on explaining to the American people why they support the disastrous policies that have devastated hard-working middle-class families and small businesses,\u201d said NRCC spokeswoman Katie Martin Prill.\n\nFor now, Democrats say they\u2019re in good shape ahead of 2016.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no conventional wisdom in politics anymore,\u201d said Rep. Linda T. S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.). \u201cWould anyone have predicted that [Republican former House majority leader Eric Cantor] would lose his seat? We\u2019re in an environment where anything can happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Democrats retreat to Philadelphia to talk about their uncertain future.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "House Democrats retreat to Philadelphia to talk about their uncertain future.", "title": "Can Democrats ever retake the House?
