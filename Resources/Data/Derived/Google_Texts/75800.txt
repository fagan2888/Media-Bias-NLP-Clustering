Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina CEO Brad Wilson recently told the News and Observer that the company might have to consider pulling some of its health insurance policies offered under the Affordable Care Act.

Wilson cited financial losses of more than $100 million in the first year of ACA coverage.

Meanwhile, North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin recently wrote a letter to the federal Department of Health and Human Services, saying the health care law is destabilizing the insurance market, driving up premiums and deductibles, and reducing the number of options for consumers.
