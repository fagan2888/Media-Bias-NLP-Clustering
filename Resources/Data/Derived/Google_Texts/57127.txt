If you’ve ever come across someone who's into CrossFit (trust me, they’ll let you know within the first two minutes of talking with them), then you know fitness is their top priority. CrossFit gyms across the United States are filled with some intense people performing some intense workouts, so what would someone with a more subdued attitude look like in the middle of all that flying testosterone? BuzzFeed sent people to their first ever CrossFit class to find out.

Founded in 2000 by Greg and Lauren Glassman, CrossFit is a strength and conditioning platform that draws from various training techniques, including high-intensity interval training, powerlifting, calisthenics, and Olympic weightlifting. Keeping with the low weight/high rep philosophy of fitness, CrossFit athletes perform various popular strength training exercises, such as squats or deadlifts, but at a much faster pace than you’ll find at any “Average Joe” gym.

With all that intensity flying around CrossFit gyms, though, there are bound to be injuries. According to many CrossFit critics, those injuries tend to happen more frequently and are often more serious compared to run of the mill exercise machines. CrossFit critics argue that performing low weight/high reps at such a rapid tempo often means poor form, which ultimately leads to overuse injuries. Maybe CrossFit athletes do deserve all the praise they give themselves just for surviving.
