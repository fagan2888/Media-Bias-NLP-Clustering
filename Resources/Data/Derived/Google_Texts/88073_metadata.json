The impetus was the Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby case being argued before the Supreme Court, and disgust over government forcing people to pay for medical treatments they find immoral. But if people cared about public schooling as much as they do Obamacare, hashtags defending all kinds of freedom would be the daily norm on Twitter.\n\nJust like Obamacare, public schools \u2013 government institutions for which all people must pay \u2013 regularly violate basic rights. They have to: Among many curbs on freedom, to avoid chaos schools have to have rules about what students and teachers can say, and decisions must be made about what is \u2013 and is not \u2013 taught.\n\nConsider the nationally covered Easton Area School District v. B.H. case (colloquially known as \u201cI (Heart) Boobies\u201d), which the Supreme Court refused to hear a few weeks ago. It involved two students in Easton, PA, who were suspended for wearing pink, breast-cancer-awareness bracelets that carried the \u201cboobies\u201d message. The district argued that the bracelets, with their intentionally attention-grabbing message, threatened school \u201cdecorum\u201d and \u201cthe civility of discussion in the classroom.\u201d\n\nAs the appeals court ruled, punishing the students violated their speech rights. But the position of the district is understandable: Schools must draw a line so that student behavior doesn\u2019t kneecap their ability to provide the education for which citizens are paying. Indeed, while the speech rights of the Easton students was upheld, Supreme Court precedent limits student speech, allowing public schools to curb it if they decide it is either promoting illegal activities \u2013 as they ruled in the recent \u201cBong Hits 4 Jesus\u201d case \u2013 or being too disruptive.\n\nTeachers, too, have had their speech rights curbed. A high school teacher in Batavia, IL, for example, was suspended last year for telling students they had a Fifth Amendment right not to fill out surveys with questions on their alcohol and drug use. Several teachers, in recent years, have been punished for things they\u2019ve expressed on social media, or in class. Some has been insulting about students generally, but written on private blogs of Facebook accounts. Some has been class discussion considered too political or one-sided. All has pitted teachers\u2019 speech rights against either school effectiveness, or taxpayers\u2019 rights not to pay for speech with which they disagree.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult problems, like Hobby Lobby, are connected to religion, including the Constitutional guarantee of equal treatment under the law.\n\nIt is logically impossible for public schools to treat the religious and non-religious equally. The schools can either incorporate religion, which many religious people want, or they can be neutral, which is favored by atheists and agnostics. That is why we constantly see battles over prayers at football games or graduation ceremonies, and over the teaching of evolution or creationism. But if public schools incorporated religion, whose would they pick?\n\nThis has been a serious problem, even with religion officially irrelevant to schools, in districts with sizeable Muslim populations. Many have major Christian and Jewish holidays off, but are in session on Muslim holidays. New York City has long been struggling with this, facing the quandary, as former mayor Michael Bloomberg put it, that in \u201ca diverse city \u2026 if you close the schools for every single holiday there won\u2019t be any school.\u201d New mayor Bill de Blasio recently attempted to remedy the situation, announcing that city schools would be closed on two Muslim holy days. But the Hindu holiday of Diwali? Not yet.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe solution is simple: School choice. Instead of pouring everyone\u2019s tax dollars into public schools, attach it to students and let parents choose institutions that share their values. Let them pick schools that have dress codes that suit their desires for either strict order or free expression. Let them choose institutions where teachers agree to curbs \u2013 or they do not \u2013 on their speech. Let them select schools that have Muslim days off, or Christian prayers, or no religion at all.\n\nUltimately, do the opposite of what we\u2019re doing now: Uphold freedom, of all types, in education.\n\nNeal McCluskey is the Associate Director of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom and oversees Cato\u2019s Public Schooling Battle Map", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neal McCluskey", "description": "Eventually districts have to make choices between student constituencies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "It was trending on Twitter all day on Tuesday: #ReligiousFreedomForAll.
