He\u2019s promised that there will be no more government shutdowns\u2014a reference to that perilous two-week period in the fall of 2013 led by his colleagues in the House\u2014and that he will not push for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. As far as what initiatives he will support, McConnell says he hopes to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which indicates that any nascent measures on climate change are pretty much dead.\n\nBut what else is on the former minority leader\u2019s mind? Searching for clues, we turned to Wikipedia. Since McConnell\u2019s victory, there\u2019s been a flurry of activity on his page, with editors debating the finer points of the senator\u2019s history. In the last 24 hours, his page views have more than quintupled from their daily average, which usually hovers around 1,500 unique visitors. Though that\u2019s not exactly Drudge Report numbers, what readers are and are not seeing on his page, and what they\u2019re saying about McConnell, does have meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Mitch McConnell supporter raises a sign at his midterm election night rally in Louisville, Kentucky. REUTERS/John Sommers II\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s a running debate about whether McConnell is a mammal or a reptile. Earlier today, at the top of his page, a jokester added that, in addition to being a U.S. senator, McConnell is \u201calso a turtle.\u201d Hooligans have been vandalizing his page with this jibe for years. One common editorial flourish is the crude nickname \u201cMitchell \u2018Dick Turtle\u2019 McConnell.\u201d There\u2019s also this explanatory note from 2013: \u201cThere is very little sign that this man is a human being and is more turtle-like than anything.\u201d Perhaps, but what does \u201cturtle\u201d signify?\n\nFor starters, the slow and steady chelonian always wins the race. This is certainly true of McConnell, whose ascent to Senate majority leader began in the mid-1980s. It also suggests that he\u2019s a tactician. When President Obama took office, McConnell\u2019s primary goal was to make him a one-term president. Though he didn\u2019t succeed, his ability over the past six years to thwart Obama\u2019s agenda at nearly every turn\u2014through filibusters and other mundane procedural measures\u2014ultimately led to the Republican takeover of the Senate. McConnell knows how to play the long game.\n\nThe turtle also knows when to show his face and when to retreat into his shell. During the government shutdown of 2013, McConnell positioned himself as the GOP\u2019s chief negotiator and managed to come out of the fiasco looking reasonable. (Especially compared to Ted Cruz.) But once the government was up and running again, McConnell went back to leading a blockade against the president\u2019s judicial appointments, preventing Democrats from gaining an edge in the federal court system.\n\nSo expect McConnell\u2019s reign, for however long it lasts, to be slow and methodical, rather than rash and extreme. He\u2019ll look to please his party\u2019s patrons\u2014the NRA, energy companies, Big Pharma\u2014while avoiding legislation that might galvanize the Democratic base. Or maybe this makes way too much of the metaphor. Perhaps Mitch McConnell simply resembles a turtle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcConnell, with his wife, former United States Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, after his midterm election victory. REUTERS/John Sommers II\n\nAnother potentially revealing edit, made a year ago, implied that McConnell was bullied as a child. This was unsourced material, and thus was quickly excised. So why suggest it? Some of his opponents have remarked that, whether in his dealings with Obama or fellow conservatives, McConnell often relies on intimidation. So will McConnell use his newfound power to ram through a bunch of controversial bills, from anti-abortion measures\u2014he\u2019s ardently pro-life\u2014to anti-gun-control legislation? It\u2019s doubtful, at least in the near-term, even if a Wikipedia user once referred to McConnell as a \u201cpuppet of the NRA.\u201d (The post was removed.) He\u2019s an outspoken supporter of the organization, which donates to his campaign whenever he\u2019s up for reelection, but that just means that gun control initiatives, always a hard sell, will remain nonstarters until at least 2016.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "mitch mcconnell, mconnell, alison grimes, senate majority leader, wikipedia, wiki, kentucky, dick turtle, turtle", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "outbrain": {"image": "http://media.vocativ.com/photos/2015/04/Turtle-Mitch-002-ban34028338559.jpg", "title": "New Senate Majority Leader is Animal...
