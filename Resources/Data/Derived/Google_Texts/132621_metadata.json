Health leaders participated in a kick-off celebration. Before the end of the first hour, hundreds of callers were on hold waiting to talk to agents about enrollment.\n\nThe Rancho Cordova Covered California Call Center. (Pauline Bartolone/Capital Public Radio)\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s doing a great job, but this is national, this is the entire nation saying health care is a right, not a privilege. It\u2019s happening in every state in the country, it\u2019s a new era for the nation, which is truly historic.\u201d - Peter Lee, Covered California executive director\n\nThe day also marked a new era for 41-year-old Melissa Martinez of Davis, California. \u201cI was diagnosed with lupus 19 years ago. I was 22, and I have seen it all. I\u2019ve had good times and bad times,\" she says.\n\nMartinez works at home as a branding and marketing consultant. And she\u2019s uninsured.\n\n\u201cThis last bout of insuring myself it was about $600 a month, and my meds, cuz I have lupus, were about $600 a month. So I had to pick one or the other. So I had to let my insurance go.\u201d - Melissa Martinez\n\nFor the past three years, Martinez says she\u2019s been paying out-of-pocket to see her doctors, and buying her prescriptions from Canada.\n\nShe says the scariest part of being uninsured isn\u2019t having an autoimmune disease \u2013 it's the fear of health problems she can\u2019t anticipate \u2013 like accidents, and another serious illness. \u201cIt\u2019s been very scary to think about you know, \u2018what if?\u2019, and \u2018then what?\u2019\u201d\n\nMelissa Martinez navigates the CoveredCa.com website Tuesday morning. (Pauline Bartolone/Capital Public Radio)\n\nSo just after the Covered California\u2019s website was made available for open enrollment, we asked Martinez to log-on. At one point, the screen went blank, but it came back, and she was able to use the site's \u201cshop and compare\u201d tool.\n\n\u201cSo as I said, there\u2019s three of us, and I\u2019ve definitely been working about a quarter time\u2026\u201d\n\nMartinez is single and has two kids. Because of her illness, her income was limited to $30,000 in 2012. When she finished entering her information on the computer, a handful of plans popped up. She says the silver plan looks right to her. It has a premium of about a $100 a month, and a $500 deductible.\n\n\u201c$100 a month, versus 600 is amazing. It really is,\u201d - Melissa Martinez\n\nPeople with different medical and financial needs may have different opinions about the affordability of the available plans. Even Martinez says there are a lot of unknowns about the health law.\n\nBut she says she thinks the federal law is a step in the right direction, and her chronic health problem isn\u2019t the primary reason she\u2019s planning on buying coverage soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that person that ends up going to the ER every time there\u2019s a common cold, or there\u2019s a situation because that is just perpetuating the issue. I think if everybody gets educated about how the system works, and if everybody goes into it, we\u2019ll have a solid base.\u201d - Melissa Martinez\n\nBy mid afternoon, Covered California says, its site had 5 million Web hits. But there were still some problems. The site wasn\u2019t ready to enroll employers in the exchange set up for small businesses.\n\nClick to visit CoveredCa.com\n\nBut implementers of the law in California are looking at long term success.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. It is a marathon and not a sprint, we are at the starting line. This is going to take weeks and months and years to experience the full benefit of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d - Diana Dooley, California Health and Human Services Secretary\n\nThere is one other thing that California health policymakers don\u2019t know yet \u2013 enrollment numbers will be not be released until November 15.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California opened for business Tuesday.
