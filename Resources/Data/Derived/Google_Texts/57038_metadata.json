His family were \u201cgentry\u201d and rumored to be related to Robert E. Lee, naming one son of every generation after the beloved Civil War general. His parents, political liberals (his father worked on George McGovern\u2019s 1972 presidential campaign), had raised him to deplore racial prejudice, but through a complex dance of rationalization and denial practiced by most of the Texans around them, it also seemed possible to cling to the old ideals, \u201cthe cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt proud of my family\u2019s slaveholding and Confederate past,\u201d Tomlinson writes of his youthful self, \u201cnot because I believed in slavery or racism, but because white Texans honored and celebrated that heritage.\u201d In school, he was taught that \u201cslavery was wrong,\u201d but somehow his teachers found a way to walk \u201ca careful line in teaching about race, holding no one responsible for the sins of the past.\u201d When Tomlinson \u2014 a child of the era of desegregation and busing who had several black friends \u2014 thought about the likely descendants of his ancestors\u2019 slaves, he felt not shame but simple curiosity: Had he ever met them? Little did he suspect that one of those descendants, LaDanian Tomlinson, would grow up to become a running back for the San Diego Chargers and receive the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award in 2006. (LaDanian contributes a foreward to \u201cTomlinson Hill.\u201d)\n\nIt was only after a couple of decades, spent first in the Army and then working as an Associated Press reporter covering wars in Africa, Iraq and Afghanistan, that Tomlinson decided to consider his family heritage in depth. He\u2019d witnessed, first hand, the toll of genocide in Rwanda, met child soldiers in the Congo and interviewed al Qaida members in Somalia. \u201cEvery conflict I covered included an element of bigotry,\u201d he writes, and he came to view all of it as a mask for bids to \u201choard power and privilege.\u201d He\u2019d also been on hand to see the fall of apartheid in South Africa. He believed in the concept behind the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, that is, \u201cthe one thing all forms of justice share is the need to establish the truth about what happened and why.\u201d Furthermore, \u201conly once the truth is known can there be true reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomlinson Hill\u201d (a film and interactive website as well as a book) is the result of that belief, a dual history of the white and black Tomlinsons and the rural town they settled and in a few cases still inhabit today. Tomlinson scrutinized over a century\u2019s worth of newspaper and civic records, interviewed elderly members of the black Tomlinson family about life under segregation and Jim Crow and delved into the invaluable oral histories collected from emancipated slaves by the Works Progress Administration during the Depression, among the few reliable first-hand accounts of slavery we have. The unfolding lives of the two families are set against the backdrop of Texas and American history: the settlement of the area by Southern slaveholders and small farmers seeking to make their fortunes further west; the advent of the Civil War and the brief, if troubled, promise of Reconstruction; the emergence of sharecropping as a covert reinstitution of slavery; the KKK and lynchings; the Depression; the Great Migration that brought many African-Americans from the country to the city; the Civil Rights Movement and, finally, the economic decay that currently afflicts so much of small-town America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The story of two families, one black, one white -- with a painful shared history", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The story of two families, one black, one white -- with a painful shared history", "title": "\u201cTomlinson Hill\u201d: A white man from Texas unearths his family\u2019s shockingly racist past", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/tomlinson_hill_a_white_man_from_texas_unearths_his_familys_shockingly_racist_past/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/tomlinson_hill.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The story of two families, one black, one white -- with a painful shared history", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/tomlinson_hill.jpg", "title": "\u201cTomlinson Hill\u201d: A white man from Texas unearths his family\u2019s shockingly racist past", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cTomlinson Hill\u201d: A white man from Texas unearths his family\u2019s shockingly racist past", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American History, Books, Editor's Picks, Must-Do, Race, slavery, Texas, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfb6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: American History, Books, Editor's Picks, Must-Do, Race, slavery, Texas, What to Read, Entertainment NewsAs a boy growing up in Dallas, Chris Tomlinson heard few stories of his family\u2019s one-time cotton plantation in the eastern part of the state, near a town called Marlin, on the Brazos River.\nHe\u2019d witnessed, first hand, the toll of genocide in Rwanda, met child soldiers in the Congo and interviewed al Qaida members in Somalia.\n\u201cThat may not be the reason they kept the name,\u201d he told his son drily.\nHis family were \u201cgentry\u201d and rumored to be related to Robert E.
