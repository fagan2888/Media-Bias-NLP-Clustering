With 60 percent of investigators furloughed, inspections will be limited to facilities believe to \"present an immediate threat to public health.\"\n\nAs Congress\u2019 budget stalemate approaches its third week, more alarming consequences of the lapse in federal funding are beginning to emerge. The FDA, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are among the many agencies deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d during the government shutdown. As a result, 976 of the agency\u2019s 1,602 investigators have been placed on enforced leave.\n\nSteven Immergut, assistant commissioner for public affairs of the FDA, told reporters that the longer Congress delays the restoration of funding, the greater the effect may be on consumers. Right now, the 626 active safety inspectors are forced to work across the agency portfolio, and will not be dispatched for routine visits.\n\n\u201cDuring the lapse in appropriations, FDA will not be conducting routine domestic or international inspections of food facilities,\u201d Immergut told NBC News. \u201cExcepted FDA inspectors are prioritizing their work based on public health need and are being deployed to respond to recalls, outbreaks or other situations requiring immediate attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, they will not be conducting important routine work to support inspections,\u201d he added.\n\nPotential nationwide health risks aside, the furloughed investigators will likely suffer more as they will be forced to work around the clock once funding is restored. For every day they sit at home, delayed inspections are stacking up, generating a backlog that may tax the agency for months. Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that this is a hard blow to an agency whose protocols are already sluggish.\n\n\u201cFor every day the government is shut down, it\u2019s going to take them many weeks to make up the work that\u2019s not being done,\u201d Smith DeWaal explained. \u201cWhen they come back to work there\u2019ll be a backlog of plants that should have been visited during this period that aren't being visited. Our inspection system is already pretty anemic, and now it\u2019s not even moving, now it\u2019s totally dysfunctional.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda government shutdown, fda furloughs, shutdown food safety, fda safety inspections, center for science in the public interest", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed on Friday that all routine food safety inspections have been suspended until federal funding is restored.", "title": "FDA Food Safety Inspections Suspended; Government Shutdown Furloughs 60% Of Agency Inspectors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-food-safety-inspections-suspended-government-shutdown-furloughs-60-agency-inspectors-259768", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/food.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed on Friday that all routine food safety inspections have been suspended until federal funding is restored.", "title": "FDA Food Safety Inspections Suspended; Government Shutdown Furloughs 60% Of Agency Inspectors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-food-safety-inspections-suspended-government-shutdown-furloughs-60-agency-inspectors-259768", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/food.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/13/food.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-10-13T18:42:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-13T18:42:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed on Friday that all routine food safety inspections have been suspended until federal funding is restored."}, "article_summary": "FDA's inspectors are currently working across the agency portfolio, and will not be available for routine safety inspections.\nbigpresh, CC BY 2.0On Friday, a spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that the government shutdown has forced the agency to suspend all routine food safety inspections until funding is restored.\nRight now, the 626 active safety inspectors are forced to work across the agency portfolio, and will not be dispatched for routine visits.\n\u201cDuring the lapse in appropriations, FDA will not be conducting routine domestic or international inspections of food facilities,\u201d Immergut told NBC News.\nWith 60 percent of investigators furloughed, inspections will be limited to facilities believe to \"present an immediate threat to public health.\""}
