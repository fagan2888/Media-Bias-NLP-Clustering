When it\u2019s connected to Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug coverage gap.\n\nDubbed the \u201cDonut Hole,\u201d the gap in prescription drug coverage, which occurs after a Medicare recipient has hit a certain payment threshold but before catastrophic coverage kicks in, has been plaguing seniors for nearly a decade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it before last year,\u201d says longtime Battle Ground resident Lorri Bisconer. \u201cI don\u2019t know if other people realize that this is happening.\u201d\n\nLike many others who have fallen into this expensive abyss, Bisconer says she was shocked when her prescription drug bills quadrupled overnight. Instead of paying $45 to $100 a month for the pills that keep her diabetes and blood pressure in check, the 75-year-old was suddenly expected to pay more than $400 a month.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Bisconer says. \u201cLast year I had to stop taking my medication for two months.\u201d\n\nThis year, Bisconer has struggled to pay for the insulin that her doctors prescribed to manage her adult-onset diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s half of my Social Security check,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve used my savings to pay it this year, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do next year. Maybe I can cut back \u2026 only take it every other day.\u201d\n\nMost Medicare recipients never have to worry about the Donut Hole, which stops paying for a member\u2019s prescription drugs once a member has reached a maximum for drug coverage \u2014 $2,850 in 2014 \u2014 and doesn\u2019t go away until that member has paid enough in out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 $4,550 in 2014 \u2014 and entered Medicare\u2019s catastrophic coverage category.\n\nHowever, a 2010 University of California, Los Angeles, study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that women and patients with diabetes and dementia were most likely to fall into the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap.\n\nBisconer has seen the truth behind this report. Sitting at her dining room table, surrounded by medical bills and prescription drug benefits reports, Bisconer points out that her diabetes medications, which have no generic, less expensive alternatives, cost way more than her husband Bob\u2019s prescriptions, despite the fact that Bob is recovering from a stroke and several heart attacks.\n\n\u201cBob doesn\u2019t fall into the Donut Hole,\u201d Bisconer says. \u201cBut I reach it in July!\u201d\n\nA little less than halfway through the year, Medicare stops paying for Lorri\u2019s prescription medications, leaving her at risk of stroke and heart attack if she can\u2019t afford the long-acting insulin injections and daily diabetes and blood pressure pills her physicians have recommended.\n\nInstead of her reasonable co-pays, Bisconer faces more than $400 in monthly medication bills each month until she reaches the maximum out-of-pocket payment of $4,550, which bumps her into Medicare\u2019s catastrophic coverage category. According to her most recent Medicare statement, Bisconer won\u2019t climb out of the Donut Hole until mid-December.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010 and is sometimes referred to as Obamacare, is gradually closing the Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage gap. Prior to 2010, Medicare members who fell into the Donut Hole had to pay all of their prescription drug costs. Under the Affordable Care Act, prescription drug makers are now footing more than half the bill for Medicare recipients in the Donut Hole. The percentage of what the drug companies pay will increase each year until the coverage gap is essentially closed in 2020. Before 2010, Bisconer would have had to pay more than $800 a month for her prescription drugs during her Donut Hole period.\n\nIn a sad twist of fate, the Bisconers combined income, which includes Social Security, Lorri\u2019s part-time job and Bob\u2019s pension, is barely enough to make ends meet, but too much to qualify for the Medicare Extra Help program, which would pay for Bisconer\u2019s prescriptions and help her avoid the donut hole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d Bisconer says, shaking her head at the mounting pile of medical bills and looking at a picture of her husband taken before he suffered a stroke in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard \u2026 I\u2019ve been working since I was a girl.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the retired school bus driver \u2014 Bisconer transported special education students in the Battle Ground Public Schools district for 27 years \u2014 is still working. To make ends meet, Bisconer works part-time as a cashier at the local ACE Hardware store.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great place. I\u2019m lucky to have such a good boss for what is probably my last job,\u201d Bisconer says. \u201cDuring the summer and the holidays, I work three or four days a week.\u201d\n\nLife for this couple, who have been married for 32 years, wasn\u2019t always just about prescription drug costs and medical bills. In fact, before Bob had his stroke in 2010, the Bisconers were enjoying their retirement years on a one-acre property in eastern Washington, where they had horses and friends and two homes. Flash-forward four years and a few life-saving surgeries for Bob and the Bisconers are back in Battle Ground. They\u2019re closer to family now \u2014 together the couple has four grown children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild \u2014 but they can\u2019t afford to live on a big piece of land anymore. Instead, they reside in a small trailer with their two aging cats and two big dogs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Bisconer says. \u201cWe have some nice neighbors here \u2026 but I miss having horses. And the dogs definitely miss having all of that land.\u201d\n\nLife might be a little easier if she didn\u2019t fall into the Donut Hole for half the year, Bisconer says. There would be more money and she wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard during her retirement years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is anything I can do, except ration my medication,\u201d Bisconer says. \u201cBut I wanted other people to be aware that this Donut Hole exists. Like I said, I\u2019d never even heard of it until I was in it.\u201d\n\nPlans offering gap coverage are available, but according to recent studies, premiums for those plans are roughly double those of defined standard plans.\n\nFor Clark County seniors who are worried about the Medicare Donut Hole, or who have other health insurance questions, there is some good news.
