actress who spent the first years of her life in Kodiak and now plays a lead role on the hit ABC TV show \u201cScandal\u201d appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live Thursday night to talk about coming to Kodiak this summer and receiving a key to the city.\n\nDarby Stanchfield, who plays Abby on \u201cScandal,\u201d told Kimmel that she was born in Kodiak, lived there until she was 7 years old and then moved to Unalaska/Dutch Harbor.\n\n\u201cReally, I think the only thing I know about Kodiak is that the chewing tobacco is from there, right?\u201d Kimmel said.\n\n\u201cAnd the Kodiak bear,\u201d Stanchfield replied.\n\nLast summer, Stanchfield arrived in Kodiak to film a documentary and while here, was presented with a key to the City of Kodiak by Mayor Pat Branson.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t been back (in Kodiak) in 30 years,\u201d Stanchfield told Kimmel.\n\nShe toured Alaska as part of a Discover America documentary series that features celebrities touring their home state.\n\n\u201cIt was basically between me and Sarah Palin,\u201d Stanchfield said. \u201cYou have to be from the state, and \u2018Scandal\u2019 right now is a little, you know, maybe hotter than Sarah Palin, so I got to go.\u201d\n\nDuring the filming, Stanchfield said she went fishing, bear watching, drank water from a glacier and took helicopter flights, most of which, except for the fishing, she hadn\u2019t done before.\n\nWhen she arrived in Kodiak, Stanchfield received a Facebook message from a local woman, Fru Finn, who wanted to set up a time for Stanchfield to receive the key to the city.\n\nFinn told the Daily Mirror that she\u2019s a huge \u201cScandal\u201d fan and got to pose with Stanchfield as \u201cgladiators,\u201d a term for the heroes in the series.\n\nStanchfield ignored the message at first, she told Kimmel, but Finn showed up at the airport during filming and set it up.\n\n\u201cShe really \u2018gladiated\u2019 the entire situation,\u201d Stanchfield said.\n\nIt happened atop Pillar Mountain, Stanchfield told Kimmel, after shooting a dinner scene for the documentary during a rainstorm.\n\nOn Jimmy Kimmel, Stanchfield showed off the key, including the city logo prominently displayed in the handle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad looking, by the way,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWhat does this entitle you to then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Stanchfield responded. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it opens.\u201d\n\nKimmel asked how many other people have the key to the city, and Stanchfield pointed out a key to the city website and 1-800 number on the back of the key.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to order one, you probably could just call them up and get your own made,\u201d Stanchfield said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to use this to open a door and there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of other people in there,\u201d Kimmel joked. \u201cThis is probably real gold, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope so, it\u2019s Alaska!\u201d Stanchfield responded.\n\nThe two also joked about being able to fish with the key using it as a lure to catch salmon, Kimmel said.\n\n\u201cA very big salmon,\u201d Stanchfield replied.\n\nThe online clip of Stanchfield on Jimmy Kimmel Live can be viewed on YouTube.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "An actress
