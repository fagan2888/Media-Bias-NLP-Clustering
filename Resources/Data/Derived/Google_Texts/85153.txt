Residents in Centennial and Arapahoe County have been warned: there is yet another bear afoot in populated areas of the Denver metro area.

“Deputies and wildlife officials have seen the bear multiple times,” said Julie Brooks, spokeswoman for the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office. “They get close, and he runs away. They get close, and he runs away. The game is afoot.”

The first sighting was at 3:07 a.m. on the 1100 block of East Jamison Place, and several sightings were called in as the sun began to rise, Brooks said. The last time people saw the bear was at 6:15 a.m. near University Boulevard and Mineral Avenue, she said.

“The bear has hunkered down somewhere,” Brooks said.

A reverse 911 call was made to 10,000 homes.

“There are a lot of people walking to school or going to work. We just wanted to let them know about the bear,” Brooks said.

Deputies and Colorado Parks and Wildlife rangers are trying to reach the bear for its own safety and for the public’s safety.

So far, there have been no physical contacts reported between the bear and humans.

Wildlife officials say there have been an unusual number of black bear sightings in recent weeks because of a shortage of food for the animals in the mountains.

Bear sightings and chases have been a daily ongoing saga in the late summer of 2015.
