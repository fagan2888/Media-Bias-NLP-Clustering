The Wilmot Cancer Institute plans to team with Nicholas H. Noyes Memorial Hospital in Livingston County and Jones Memorial Hospital in Allegany County on a cancer center. Radiation oncology would be located at Noyes, and expanded services would be at Noyes and Jones.

Noyes Memorial Hospital and why they recently donated $2 million to help create a regional cancer center at the Dansville hospital.\n\n\"We see this as hopefully enriching the lives of everyone in the area,\" Myers said of the Ann and Carl Myers Cancer Center that will serve people in the Southern Tier and southern Finger Lakes regions.\n\nThe center is a collaboration among UR Medicine's Wilmot Cancer Institute, Jones Memorial Hospital in Allegany County and Noyes and was announced Wednesday.\n\nThe $10.4 million project has to be approved by the state Department of Health. It will provide new and enhanced clinical, patient support services at both rural hospitals, including the addition of radiation oncology at Noyes. It also will provide the opportunity for more patients to enroll in clinical trials.\n\nThe project also involves UR Medicine's Radiation Oncology practice in Hornell, Steuben County.\n\nServices would be phased in, with medical oncology starting at Jones and expanded at Noyes by the fall. The construction to house the linear accelerator for radiation therapy is expected to completed by the end of next year.\n\nCarl Myers of Springwater, Livingston County, and his wife, Ann, donated $2 million to a cancer center to be housed at Nicholas H. Noyes Memorial Hospital. Noyes Health, Jones Memorial Hospital and UR Medicine are collaborating on the venture.

Approximately 4,000 people a year travel from Livingston, Allegany and Steuben counties to Wilmot Cancer Institute for outpatient care, according to UR Medicine.\n\nSome people will continue to go to Rochester, but \"as much as can be done locally, that's the goal,\" she said.\n\nDr. Thomas Mahoney is chief medical officer of the Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency, the regional planner. It has an advisory role on projects that meet a certain dollar threshold.\n\n\"I think this is pretty clear. I think they have enough patients who are already in care at URMC cancer center who could then get service in the local community.\"\n\nMahoney said there is no competitor to UR Medicine in that area, and \"this would solidify their position.\"\n\nWilmot has been growing for the past several years, in scope of services and geographic range. In late 2012, Wilmot acquired the Pluta Cancer Center in Henrietta. In 2013, Wilmot bought Interlakes Oncology, which had offices in Greece, Brockport, Canandaigua and Geneva. Last year, Wilmot bought a radiation oncology practice in Batavia and added chemotherapy services.\n\n\"We've been working very closely,\" said Dr. Jonathan Friedberg, director of the Wilmot Cancer Institute. \"I think for us what was most appealing was the collaborative aspect. This wasn't us coming in and saying 'We're building this' or Noyes saying 'We're building this.'\"\n\nNoyes and Jones had been talking with UR Medicine about the cancer center for more than a year. Each hospital already receives some services from UR Medicine, and each is seeking to strengthen its connection to the medical center through a formal affiliation. Talk about the cancer center started before discussion about affiliations and its future is not dependent on the outcome. Each system is contributing $1 million and further fundraising will be a collaborative effort.\n\nMoving care from centralized hospital settings to where people live and work is one of the trends driven in part by the Affordable Care Act. But it requires collaboration between large systems or several smaller organizations that couldn't afford the service on their own or have the expertise to set up the programs. Being able to offer more services also helps the financial situation of small hospitals.\n\n\"We look around and see hospitals that are struggling,\" Pollard said. \"We feel very blessed here that we've done better than the average rural hospital. But I have to say a lot of that was building faith in the community and the community responding to that. The hospital is here because the community supports it in many ways. With their business and their donations.\"\n\nMyers, who said he lives about 25 minutes from Noyes and has a farm even closer, said the cancer center could help promote the area as well as improve health care. \"I think it will be a major contributor,\" he said. \"My wife and I feel good about this donation. If I have to use it, it will be in an area I don't mind driving to.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1FU4xZ6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Wilmot Cancer Center provides expertise for a cancer center to serve Southern Tier", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "Wilmot Cancer Center provides expertise for a cancer center to serve Southern Tier", "title": "Couple hopes to enrich lives with new cancer center", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2015/04/15/nicholas-noyes-memorial-hospital-carl-ann-myers/25822833/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wilmot Cancer Center provides expertise for a cancer center to serve Southern Tier", "creator": "@DandC", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8824b05aab180625ee9dc3ef03121a1164afd1a1/c=150-0-750-600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg", "title": "Couple hopes to enrich lives with new cancer center", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Radiation therapy", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Radiation therapy", "title": "Couple hopes to enrich lives with new cancer center", "author": "Patti Singer", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd4c95c2fbd5ebc433cfab70367b8353349010a1/c=225-0-675-600/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98954cafc2405f2f672216295815dfe65b72465b/c=150-0-750-600/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6bf3735baf9659e26f63214cbcfb2467d755c107/c=50-0-850-600/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d10d529300fe0b933a7ef582deb84f817883715/c=0-47-900-553&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-15T19:21:45.927000-04:00", "shorthed": "Couple hopes to enrich lives with cancer center", "articleid": 25822833, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2095ab875513882e6a859bada876092155aaa0f/c=0-47-900-553/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3ad8ff58d631012be5567ca88378a78c443b9f9a/c=281-0-619-600/local/-/media/Rochester/2015/04/15/B9316981039Z.1_20150415133404_000_G1NAGV36M.1-0.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "pages/Patti-Singer/311434482351141"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf51\"", "article_summary": "The Wilmot Cancer Institute plans to team with Nicholas H.
