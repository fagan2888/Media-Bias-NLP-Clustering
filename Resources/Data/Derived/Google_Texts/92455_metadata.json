They might be familiar with their local trade organizations, such as the New Hampshire Retail Association or the Home Builders and Remodelers Association of New Hampshire. Or they may know of the NFIB, National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nBut New Hampshire is also dotted with a number of lesser-known groups \u2013 many of them formed recently \u2013 that claim to speak for, or serve, small business, each with its own twist and spin.\n\nIn addition to the three groups mentioned above, they include: the Small Business and Small Industry Association of New Hampshire; the New Hampshire Small Business Institute; the New Hampshire Christian Business Network; the Jewish Professional Network; and Business Network International.\n\nEach offers an alternative to mainstream business groups, and they seem to be proliferating in the state a bit more than usual, perhaps as the term \u201csmall business\u201d gets bandied about by political groups of all ideologies.\n\nYet each claims to be nonpolitical and interested in serving only the interests of members.\n\nThe BIA and NFIB both lobby at the State House and cover much of the same political spectrum. They agree on most issues, but NFIB tends to be more conservative. For instance, NFIB opposes hiking the gas tax and expanding Medicaid, positions that the BIA has endorsed.\n\nThe BIA is the larger of the two. It\u2019s now 101 years old, with 400 direct dues-paying members and 3,000 affiliate members from local chambers, with nine staffers, including five registered lobbyists. Its influence is well known \u2013 the go-to organization when most legislators seek out the viewpoint of business.\n\nWhile the organization has grown some 26 percent since 2005, President Jim Roche thinks it could do a better job, especially in reaching out to small businesses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve done a good enough job in explaining the depth and the reach of our work,\u201d he said.\n\nRoche wouldn\u2019t comment on the work of any other business group, but he does wish to counter the impression that the BIA mainly represents large businesses.\n\nOver half of the BIA\u2019s dues-paying members employ 50 people or fewer, and over a third employ less than 10 \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t count the smaller affiliate members that participate through some 17 local chambers, he said.\n\nNFIB \u2013 which has 1,700 dues-paying members in New Hampshire \u2013 has been around since World War II, but it only employs Bruce Berke, a lobbyist who represents other clients as well.\n\nNFIB is the group \u201cthat truly represents the mom and pop,\u201d said Berke, but \u201cwe welcome anyone who wants to come to New Hampshire to help small business be in a better position to operate and compete in a constructive manner,\u201d he said.\n\nJob Creators Network\n\nAmong those newcomers is the Job Creators Network, which said it doesn\u2019t try to influence lawmakers and leaders. It tries to influence employees. One of its first five state chapters opened last year in New Hampshire.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus and executives from other national companies, such as Best Buy, Staples, Whole Food Markets and Food Lion \u2013 the Job Creators Network presents itself as a champion of small business. It calls itself a nonpartisan organization that believes \u201cgovernment policies are breaking the backs of business owners and killing job creation,\u201d according to its website.\n\nAmong those policies is the Affordable Care Act: \u201cFew have been hurt by the new health care law worse than the entrepreneur,\u201d writes former Best Buy CEO Brad Anderson.\n\nThe group calls for cutting the federal corporate tax rate by 25 percent, cutting state spending and opposing a minimum wage hike.\n\n\u201cHiking the minimum wage hurts the lower-wage workers it is supposed to help by causing fewer of them to have jobs,\u201d the organization says in the \u201cKitchen Table Economics\u201d section of its website.\n\nAmong its services to members, the network provides materials to be included along with the paychecks of employees to let them know how such policies might hurt the businesses that provide their livelihoods.\n\nA nonprofit based in Texas, the Job Creators Network had a nearly $3 million budget in 2011, according to the latest available tax filing with the Internal Revenue Service. It recently became a 501(c)(4) organization, which gives it the right to advocate and advertise on issues, if not for candidates.\n\nBut Tille, a former aide to former New Hampshire senator Bob Smith and ex-congressmen Jeb Bradley and Guinta, said his chapter focuses on working with existing business organizations, as well as with individual business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to connect the dots on public policies that are well-intentioned but may have a negative impact on job creation and on business,\u201d Tille said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not heavy-handed,\u201d Tille said of the employee outreach, noting that the organization tends to call the health care law the ACA, not Obamacare. \u201cIt\u2019s information. It is voluntary. Employers can use what materials they want to use.\u201d\n\nTille has heard no complaints from workers, but AFL-CIO President Mark McKenzie denounced such efforts as \u201cintrusive\u201d and \u201cpoliticization of the workplace.\u201d\n\nWhile the Job Creators Network doesn\u2019t lobby at the State House, it does distribute \u201cpro-free enterprise educational tools\u201d to businesses and holds some informational and networking events, mainly at the New England College satellite office in downtown Concord.\n\nIt has been working with the Homebuilders and Remodelers Association of New Hampshire and might work with the BIA in the future, said both organizations. Concord architect Harold Turner, a former BIA board member who now sits on the Job Creators Network of New Hampshire advisory board, said that the group has more of a \u201cgrassroots approach \u2013 more bottom-up rather than top-down.\u201d\n\nBusinesses for Social Responsibility\n\nAn organization that\u2019s not new on the scene is New Hampshire Businesses for Social Responsibility. The nonprofit has been around since 1989 in various forms, but it has been raising its profile and varying programs it offers.\n\nNo longer affiliated with a national organization, NHBSR has a relatively small budget \u2013 $123,000 in revenue, according to the latest filing with the IRS (for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012), and some $70,000 through a government grant via the University of New Hampshire.\n\nThe rest comes from the dues of about 170 members, including about 20 nonprofits. Members range from large employers \u2013 like Bedford-based Coca Cola of Northern New England, Hypertherm in Lebanon and Monadnock Paper Mills in Bennington \u2013 to sole proprietorships. The group hired its first CEO in 2005. It\u2019s a job now held by Michelle Veasey, who is currently the only staff member, though \u201cwe are hoping to hire another person,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough most of its members tend to be on the more liberal end of the spectrum, the group, as a 501(c)(3), cannot and does not take position on issues, though it does pass around the positions of some of its members, such as Stonyfield Farm\u2019s stand in favor of a genetically modified food labeling bill.\n\n\u201cWe just encourage people to get involved in what they believe in,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, said Veasey, the organization does favor a bill that would institute benefit corporations in the state. These are entities whose fiduciary duty includes other goals besides making a profit, such as environmental stewardship. Such legislation \u201cwas a natural fit for us,\u201d she said.\n\nNHSBR has been running a large three-day conference for years, but has also been expanding its offering of smaller roundtable discussions and forums throughout the state. It also is a place to network with other companies about ways for their businesses to be more sustainable.\n\nGrappone gets to host some of the meetings at its Bow facilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to show our story, to reach out to like-minded people,\u201d said Osmer. \u201cIt\u2019s people who are trying to do the right thing and be a successful business, instead of it strictly being about profitability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous resource in our journey toward sustainability to share ideas and best practices,\u201d said Lisa Hardin Berghaus, a spokesperson for Monadnock Paper, whether it be ethical policies or greenhouse gas accounting.\n\nIndependent Business Council\n\nThe Independent Business Council of New Hampshire doesn\u2019t lobby, yet, because the organization, founded by former congressman Frank Guinta, hasn\u2019t completely figured out what it specifically stands for.\n\n\u201cWe are only a year old,\u201d said Guinta, who is running in the 1st District Republican primary in an attempt to recapture his old seat, which is held by Democrat Carol Shea-Porter. \u201cWe are still in startup mode.\u201d\n\nGuinta said he helped found the entity \u2013 which is a limited liability company, not a nonprofit organization \u2013 with Roger Wilkins, a political consultant who used to work out of Guinta\u2019s Manchester office \u201cto advocate for small business on behalf of small business so that the state will be more competitive.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the state is in the \u201cmiddle of the pack\u201d when it comes to policies that foster small business, he said, and \u201cwe really need to be in the top 10.\u201d\n\nThe group made a big splash in February 2012 when it listed some 25 businesses on its website, including Dick Anagnost, a Manchester-based developer, and Danais Realty, which is headed by Dick Danais, a former state senator. It currently has some 70 members, Guinta said, from about 18 different economic sectors.\n\nBut since its founding, the group has kept a relatively low profile. Its latest forum, featuring state Rep. Adam Schroadter, R-Newmarket, was by invitation only at the site of Agility Manufacturing, a contract manufacturer in Dover.\n\n\u201cConcord is trending against pro-growth business policies,\u201d said Schroadter, according to the invitation.\n\nThe IBC has hired a lobbyist and executive director, Anne Smith, who formerly served on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and heads her own political consulting group, The Policy Agency.\n\nBut the group won\u2019t be taking any positions until it releases a study conducted by an economist that is due out in the next few months, said Guinta.\n\nGuinta said he would keep the economist\u2019s name \u201cconfidential\u201d until the group releases the \u201cfact-based\u201d document. And until that is done, he couldn\u2019t say how his organization would differ from the BIA, NFIB or other business groups.\n\nTom Ferrin, co-owner of Agility \u2013 which employs 43 people \u2013 has nothing but admiration for the BIA, but said it \u201cadvocates for larger business and some of that stuff doesn\u2019t really apply to us. We are interested in things like health care and energy and taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Guinta, as a congressman, \u201crepresented values that align with us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IBC, Guinta said, won\u2019t be endorsing candidates, even himself.\n\n\u201cI already have a political organization. I don\u2019t need that to run. My political life is different and separate,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "The state is  dotted with a number of lesser-known groups that claim to speak for, or serve, small business", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b6a\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the three groups mentioned above, they include: the Small Business and Small Industry Association of New Hampshire; the New Hampshire Small Business Institute; the New Hampshire Christian Business Network; the Jewish Professional Network; and Business Network International.\nThe Independent Business Council of New Hampshire, founded by former congressman Frank Guinta, plans to lobby on behalf of small business, though it is still determining exactly what positions it will advocate for.\nRoche wouldn\u2019t comment on the work of any other business group, but he does wish to counter the impression that the BIA mainly represents large businesses.\nEach offers an alternative to mainstream business groups, and they seem to be proliferating in the state a bit more than usual, perhaps as the term \u201csmall business\u201d gets bandied about by political groups of all ideologies.\nMost businesses know about their local chamber of commerce, and the statewide chamber, the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire."}
