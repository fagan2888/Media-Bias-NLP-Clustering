Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) finds itself flush with \u201cdark money,\u201d according to a new campaign finance filing with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe sole donor to Prosperity for Pennsylvania is listed as nonprofit Green Orchard Inc., which gave $100,000 on Oct. 6 and has previously helped bankroll several conservative political causes.\n\nThe Prosperity for Pennsylvania super PAC itself has not yet reported spending any money this election cycle.\n\nGreen Orchard itself is a Harrisburg-based \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit, as groups formed under Section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code are known.\n\nSuch nonprofit groups are not required by law to reveal their donors, even when contributing to super PACs, which must disclose their funders.\n\nGreen Orchard formed in December 2012, according to state records, and describes its mission in tax filings as supporting \u201ceconomic freedoms,\u201d \u201cfree market reforms\u201d and \u201calternative educational options\u201d by giving out money to \u201clike-minded\u201d organizations.\n\nPhiladelphia attorney Brian Sullivan is listed as Green Orchard\u2019s sole director and treasurer on its 2013 tax return with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nWhen asked by the Center for Public Integrity about Green Orchard\u2019s recent six-figure contribution to the Prosperity for Pennsylvania super PAC, Sullivan responded: \u201cThat\u2019s what the people wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe continued, before hanging up: \u201cThat\u2019s all I can really say. Thanks. Bye.\u201d\n\nDuring its first year of existence in 2013, Green Orchard raised nearly $3 million, nearly all of which was doled out to other groups, IRS records indicate.\n\nThe largest beneficiary of Green Orchard\u2019s financial largesse last year was the YG Network, a Virginia-based nonprofit closely aligned with former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It received $1 million.\n\nIts second-largest contribution: $900,000 to the Virginia-based Legislative Education Action Drive, which \"seeks to enhance the debate on choice in education\u201d and whose president is libertarian-leaning real estate developer Howard Rich of New York.\n\nThe $900,000 contribution from Green Orchard amounted to nearly 80 percent of the $1.14 million raised by Legislative Education Action Drive in 2013, according to tax records.\n\nAmong other beneficiaries of Green Orchard money in 2013:\n\nNew York-based Education Reform Now Advocacy, which advocates for charter schools and other education reforms, received $100,000\n\nWashington, D.C.-based FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group with ties to the tea party movement, received $100,000\n\nthe National Right to Work Committee, a group that \u201ccombats compulsory unionism,\u201d received $25,000\n\nWhen it formed in July, the Prosperity for Pennsylvania super PAC told the FEC that it intended to \u201craise funds in unlimited amounts\u201d to advocate for or against federal candidates.\n\nGOP consultant Mark Dion, who served as Toomey\u2019s chief of staff from 1999 to 2004, is listed as the treasurer of the Prosperity for Pennsylvania super PAC.\n\nDion, now a partner at the Virginia-based firm Revolution Agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDion\u2019s firm touts work on behalf of clients such as the Florida chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business, tax preparer H&R Block, and the Miami Heat basketball team.\n\nFor the National Federation of Independent Business in Florida, Revolution Agency said it executed a campaign that \u201csucceeded in turning public opinion against Medicaid expansion,\u201d a policy endorsed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott following the passage of the Democrat-backed Affordable Care Act.\n\nPoliticians are currently running for office in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18 congressional districts, the most competitive of which is the state\u2019s 6th Congressional District, where Republican Rep. Jim Gerlach is retiring.\n\nThe governor\u2019s race is also among the hottest in the country, with incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett facing a stiff challenge from Democrat Tom Wolf.\n\nThe gubernatorial contest has drawn more than $43 million for television advertisements, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of estimates from Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking service.\n\nOnly the governor\u2019s races in Illinois and Florida have seen more spending on TV ads.\n\nNeither Toomey nor Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is up for reelection in Pennsylvania this November.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity is a non-profit, independent investigative news outlet. A list of its funders can be found here.
