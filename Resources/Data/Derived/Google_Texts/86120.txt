Health care treatment center operator Acadia Healthcare Co. (Nasdaq: ACHC) has purchased MMO Behavioral Health Systems, to expand its presence in Louisiana.

The target, with headquarters in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, operates two behavioral treatment health care facilities in Louisiana. MMO provides services that treat depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia among others. In addition, MMO offers physical rehabilitation. MMO generated $16 million in revenue for the 12 months ended Sept. 30.

“This transaction is representative of our ongoing opportunities to drive long-term growth through our acquisition strategy,” says Acadia CEO Joey Jacobs. Earlier in 2015, Acadia completed the purchase of Belmont Behavioral Health and six behavioral treatment centers in the United Kingdom.
