According to conventional thinking, these particles should be somewhat less abundant during the winter and should peak around June 1. But a new study suggests this calculation is way off; the real peak is at the beginning of March.\n\nDark matter is thought to constitute almost 27 percent of the universe\u2019s total mass and energy, but its nature is a mystery. One of physicists\u2019 best guesses is that theorized particles called WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) make up this matter, but WIMPs have so far eluded detection. Whatever dark matter is, it appears to clump into large clouds called haloes that engulf galaxies, including our own Milky Way. As the solar system makes its regular progression around the galaxy, it flies through this halo, causing dark matter to bombard the sun and planets with a steady \u201cwind,\u201d just as flies will hit the windshield of a fast-moving car. Earth, however, is also revolving around the sun. Astrophysicists have assumed that when it is moving against the direction of the dark matter wind (which happens to be during summer), we should see an uptick in dark matter particles of a few percent, and a corresponding decrease when Earth is traveling with the tide during winter.\n\nBut this accepted wisdom might be wrong. The new study suggests the pattern would be strongly affected by the gravitational effects of the sun, which have so far been dismissed as insubstantial. \u201cAs WIMPs stream through the solar system, the gravitational pull from the sun alters their individual trajectories, changing their direction and speed,\u201d says Samuel Lee of Princeton University, a co-author of the new paper, which was published January 3 in Physical Review Letters. \u201cTo our surprise, we found that the effects could be quite drastic.\u201d This gravitational pull could also cause the density of dark matter particles to vary by a few percent, and should shift the seasonal peak earlier by three months or so. \u201cIt\u2019s important to consider both effects,\u201d Lee says.\n\nThe sun\u2019s pull on dark matter is called gravitational focusing, because the sun acts like a lens to focus the paths of WIMPs toward it. The phenomenon depends on the energy and speed of WIMP particles: Fast-moving WIMPs would be less affected because they would race through the solar system too quickly for the sun\u2019s tug to make much difference. The sun could, however, divert to a greater degree lower energy, slower moving WIMPs from their paths. \u201cThe overall result is that the date of the maximum of the signal rate is shifted away from the canonical June 1 date, and moves towards March 1,\u201d Lee says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sun's gravitational pull on dark matter particles may cause seasonal patterns not previously expected", "title": "Study: Dark matter near Earth peaks every March", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The sun's gravitational pull on dark matter particles may cause seasonal patterns not previously expected", "title": "Study: Dark matter near Earth peaks every March", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/08/study_dark_matter_near_earth_peaks_every_march_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_129351122.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The sun's gravitational pull on dark matter particles may cause seasonal patterns not previously expected", "title": "Study: Dark matter near Earth peaks every March", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_129351122.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Clara Moskowitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, dark matter, Earth, Scientific American, Solar System", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Astrophysicists have assumed that when it is moving against the direction of the dark matter wind (which happens to be during summer), we should see an uptick in dark matter particles of a few percent, and a corresponding decrease when Earth is traveling with the tide during winter.\nDark matter is thought to constitute almost 27 percent of the universe\u2019s total mass and energy, but its nature is a mystery.\nWhatever dark matter is, it appears to clump into large clouds called haloes that engulf galaxies, including our own Milky Way.\nTopics: dark matter, Earth, Scientific American, Solar System, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanBillions of particles of invisible \u201cdark matter\u201d are probably flying through your body right now, passing through the spaces between your atoms without a trace.\nThe sun\u2019s pull on dark matter is called gravitational focusing, because the sun acts like a lens to focus the paths of WIMPs toward it."}
