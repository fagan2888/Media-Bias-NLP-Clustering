FORTALEZA, Brazil (AP) — Full of tears and inconsolable, the World Cup’s leading scorer is going home.

James Rodriguez put Colombia back into the match against Brazil by scoring a late penalty Friday, but it wasn’t enough. The playmaker then broke down after his team lost 2-1 in the quarterfinals.

Brazil defender David Luiz, whose superb free kick turned out to be the deciding goal, tried to comfort Rodriguez, putting his arm around him. The players exchanged shirts and Rodriguez walked slowly toward the tunnel.

At 22, Rodriguez had become the most feared man among Brazil fans. His six goals are two more than Brazil forward Neymar has managed and his 80th-minute penalty ignited a late surge in Fortaleza that made the home fans tense.
