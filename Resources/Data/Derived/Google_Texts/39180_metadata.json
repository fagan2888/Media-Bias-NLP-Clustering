Washington around 2 p.m.\n\nGuthrie Police Department officers reportedly arrived within seconds of the 911 call from a passerby. Neighbors told authorities that there may potentially be a resident inside the home. They attempted to gain entry but the intense heat and flames prevented them from getting near the home.\n\nFire crews said they were also unable to make access into the most of the home due to the size of the fire and the instability of the roof. The fire was brought under control in approximately 45 minutes. The fierce north wind accelerated the fire's growth and made extinguishment somewhat difficult, according to firefighters.\n\nThe identity of the victim is not known at this time and their cause of death has also not been determined. The State Fire Marshal has been called in to assist with the investigation because it involved a fatality.\n\nThe home is considered a total loss.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The body of one individual was found after a house fire in Guthrie, Tuesday afternoon.", "author": "Matthew Nuttle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/27357806/one-dead-in-guthrie-house-fire", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5729373_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The body of one individual was found after a house fire in Guthrie, Tuesday afternoon.", "title": "One Dead In Guthrie House Fire"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/5729373_G.jpg", "description": "The body of one individual was found after a house fire in Guthrie, Tuesday afternoon.", "card": "summary", "title": "One Dead In Guthrie House Fire"}, "wnreadableurl": "one-dead-in-guthrie-house-fire", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/11/11", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,guthrie,house fire,body found,investigation,matthew nuttle,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,guthrie,house fire,body found,investigation,matthew nuttle,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae71\"", "article_summary": "The body of an adult male was found after a house fire in Guthrie, Tuesday afternoon.\nThe State Fire Marshal has been called in to assist with the investigation because it involved a fatality.\nThe identity of the victim is not known at this time and their cause of death has also not been determined.\nThey attempted to gain entry but the intense heat and flames prevented them from getting near the home.\nThe fierce north wind accelerated the fire's growth and made extinguishment somewhat difficult, according to firefighters."}
