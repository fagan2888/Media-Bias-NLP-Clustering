(AP) \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s attorney general said Tuesday he won\u2019t defend in court a new state law preventing Charlotte and other local governments from approving protections for LGBT people, calling it discriminatory and a \u201cnational embarrassment.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Roy Cooper made the announcement during a news conference a day after gay rights advocates sued to overturn the law approved last week and signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory.\n\nThe federal lawsuit lists Cooper among the defendants because of his official position as the state\u2019s top lawyer. But he has said he wants it repealed.\n\n\u201cWe know that businesses here and all over the country have taken a strong stance in opposition to this law,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nMcCrory is also a defendant in the lawsuit and has doubled down on justifying his decision to sign the law, even as many corporations have criticized it publicly.\n\nCooper\u2019s announcement raises the stakes for the November governor\u2019s race, in which Cooper is challenging McCrory. National Democrats consider it their best opportunity to pick up a governor\u2019s mansion where a Republican currently resides. The campaigns of McCrory and Cooper already have raised more than $13 million combined and the Republican Governors Association has reserved $4 million in ad time for the fall.\n\nThe Republican-led legislature and McCrory approved the law because they say Charlotte went too far with a local ordinance allowing transgender people to use the restroom aligned with their gender identity. They have focused on the threat \u2014 used by opponents of Houston\u2019s LGBT ordinance last year while defeating it in a referendum \u2014 that sexual predators could use these kinds of rules as a pretense to enter women\u2019s bathrooms and locker rooms. Gay rights groups have called these and other arguments bogus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina AG won\u2019t defend transgender law in court", "title": "North Carolina AG won\u2019t defend transgender law in court", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/29/north_carolina_ag_wont_defend_transgender_law_in_court/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "North Carolina AG won\u2019t defend transgender law in court", "title": "North Carolina AG won\u2019t defend transgender law in court"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Carolina AG won\u2019t defend transgender law in court", "title": "North Carolina AG won\u2019t defend transgender law in court", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Gary Robertson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe know that businesses here and all over the country have taken a strong stance in opposition to this law,\u201d Cooper said.\nThe Republican-led legislature and McCrory approved the law because they say Charlotte went too far with a local ordinance allowing transgender people to use the restroom aligned with their gender identity.\nNational Democrats consider it their best opportunity to pick up a governor\u2019s mansion where a Republican currently resides.\nThe campaigns of McCrory and Cooper already have raised more than $13 million combined and the Republican Governors Association has reserved $4 million in ad time for the fall.\nCooper\u2019s announcement raises the stakes for the November governor\u2019s race, in which Cooper is challenging McCrory."}
