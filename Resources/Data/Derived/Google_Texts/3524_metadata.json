Example: Des Moines commands $6,242 on a $300,000 home compared with the national average of $4,130. (Cite the Minnesota Taxpayers Association 50-state property study 2010.) Taking in account all the counties in the nation, Iowa can boast 10 of the largest counties (Linn, Johnson, Blackhawk and Polk included). These are in the top 10 percent nationwide for the highest tax or millage rate. (See www.limitedgovernment.org/brief20-7html).\n\nWhy is Iowa taxing so much compared with the other states?\n\nCan the people directly responsible \u2014 the county supervisors, city council members, school board members and lawmakers \u2014 justify this without a dress rehearsal in front of a mirror and posturing for the public?\n\nEveryone is receiving new tax assessments in the mail. The majority of people think property taxes are way too high.\n\nSo what's the answer? Extreme, unrelenting pressure to all entities responsible would be a start.\n\n\u2014 Bart Frisk, Swisher\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1bG0BkF", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Research shows tax rates in Iowa are high compared to other states", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Research shows tax rates in Iowa are high compared to other states", "title": "How do Iowa's property taxes compare?", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/28/property-tax-rates/70620480/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research shows tax rates in Iowa are high compared to other states", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg", "title": "How do Iowa's property taxes compare?", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-28T22:58:54.770000-05:00", "shorthed": "How do Iowa's property taxes compare?", "articleid": 70620480, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/03/28/B9316781608Z.1_20150328235436_000_GBJABR209.1-0.jpg"}, "author": "Bart Frisk, Swisher", "title": "How do Iowa's property taxes compare?", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The majority of people think property taxes are way too high.\nWhat is jaw-dropping is that Iowa ranks eighth (for a $300,000 home) and ninth (for a $150,000 home) among the highest property taxes in the nation.\nThese are in the top 10 percent nationwide for the highest tax or millage rate.\nTaking in account all the counties in the nation, Iowa can boast 10 of the largest counties (Linn, Johnson, Blackhawk and Polk included).\nExample: Des Moines commands $6,242 on a $300,000 home compared with the national average of $4,130."}
