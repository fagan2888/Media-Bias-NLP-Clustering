The audit said health inspectors didn't always follow their own protocols, and in 160 cases, no field inspection was conducted.\n\n\n\n\"Without a vigilant and timely response by the city to citizen complaints, this problem will come back to bite us again and again,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe health department issued a statement saying the agency \"strongly disagrees\" with the audit and is taking a proactive response to exterminating pests in the city.\n\n\n\n\"We believe the auditors reached incorrect conclusions because they focused only on complaints while ignoring the fact that complaint response is a small part of the department's overall approach to discovering where rats are present, notifying owners about how to respond, and carrying out targeted efforts to exterminate and prevent rats from re-emerging,\" the department said.\n\n\n\nAuditors found that in 24 percent of the cases examined, the agency did not check out complaints within its own 10-day target, Mr. Stringer said. In addition, action was stopped prematurely on some complaints before the required number of inspection attempts, according to the audit. And in fiscal year 2013, there was no indication that assessments were conducted in 44 percent of 386 instances where inspectors requested cleanup services.\n\n\n\nThe comptroller also reported that the department failed to notify some property owners about city orders to eliminate rodent conditions, increasing the risk that rat infestations could spread through a neighborhood.\n\n\n\nThe comptroller's office recommends that the health department identify complaints that have been pending a long time, ensure complaints are not closed after only one failed attempt to gain access to a site, and make sure problems in the field have been dealt with efficiently and completely.\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
