(AP) - Two teenagers were seriously injured in two separate shark attacks in the same North Carolina town on Sunday, terrifying beach goers and prompting one shocked witness to compare the scene to the movie \u201cJaws.\u201d\n\nOak Island Mayor Betty Wallace told WECT-6 (http://bit.ly/1IdIpaN) that the first victim, a girl, lost part of her arm and could lose her left leg. Just over an hour later, a 16-year-old boy also was attacked by a shark and was airlifted to a hospital, Wallace said. He lost an arm.\n\n\u201cI saw someone carry this girl (out of the water) and people were swarming around and trying to help,\u201d Steve Bouser, who was just beginning his week-long beach vacation, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was quite terrible.\u201d\n\nThe girl was bleeding heavily, and people applied makeshift tourniquets while asking her questions to try to keep her conscious.\n\nIt was \u201cquite nightmarish,\u201d Bouser said.\n\n\u201cIt was so much like a scene from Jaws,\u201d his wife Brenda Bouser added, referring to the 1975 thriller about a giant man-eating white shark.\n\nLocal officials sent an all-terrain-vehicle to get everyone out of the water, and the Brunswick County Sheriff\u2019s office was planning to have a helicopter patrol the coastline, the mayor said.\n\nWallace said Sunday evening that she had no further information on the girl\u2019s condition. The girl is not from Oak Island but was visiting family, the mayor said.\n\nBrunswick County Dispatchers said that they received the first call at 4:12 p.m., and agencies including Oak Island Police and the Air Link Helicopter went to the scene. The second shark attack was reported at 5:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two teenagers were seriously injured in two separate shark attacks in the same North Carolina town on Sunday, terrifying beach goers and prompting one shocked witness to compare the scene to the movie \"Jaws.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two teenagers were seriously injured in two separate shark attacks in the same North Carolina town on Sunday, terrifying beach goers and prompting one shocked witness to compare the scene to the movie \u201cJaws.\u201d", "title": "2 teens are severely injured in shark attacks in N.
