Childish Gambino kicked off his Governors Ball 2014 set Saturday (June 7), with an acoustic snippet of “Centipede.” But he quickly switched gears and livened the crowd at the Honda stage with his “because the internet” single, “Crawl.”

Gambino ran through song from his two albums, “Because the Internet” and “Camp,” while dancing from one side of the stage to the other in the beautiful New York evening of the second day of the fest on Randall's Island.



He performed his latest collaboration with Chance the Rapper, “The Worst Guys,” once himself and another time with a shirtless Chance. Childish didn’t know if Chance would make it, but he did. He took advantage that both were on stage and also performed their other collaboration, “Favorite Song,” which Chance the Rapper performed earlier, solo, during his set.



But Chance wasn't the only other famous face in attendance. Andre 3000, of Friday headliners Outkast, took in Gambino's set from a prime spot: the photo pit right in front of the stage.

With sparks coming down from the ceiling of the stage, Childish Gambino closed his set strong, with the fiery combination of “One Up” and “Bonfire.”
