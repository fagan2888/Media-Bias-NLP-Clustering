We don\u2019t have lobbyists who raise money for increased sunscreen research, and Congress isn\u2019t asking Obamacare to cover freckle removal surgery. All of that is fine. But gingers do get St. Patrick\u2019s day.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, gingers aren\u2019t a very marginalized group \u2014 at least, compared to the truly disenfranchised of society. The worst thing you can say about a ginger? We don\u2019t have souls.\n\nThat\u2019s not to imply there aren\u2019t legitimate concerns within the red-hair community. Jacky Collins Harvey, author of Red: A History Of The Redhead, says gingerism is the last acceptable form of discrimination. Even if that statement seems remarkably silly \u2014 given the state of racism in the United States, not to mention the hate tornadoes that are Donald Trump rallies \u2014 a study conducted by the University College Cork in Ireland found that nine of ten red-haired men worldwide have been bullied.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the bullying of children with red hair is still common and people with red hair are often seen as acceptable targets because they\u2019re not one group and not a race,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the last great social prejudices.\u201d\n\nBut the bullying rate among gingers is relatively consistent with national statistics for men. Nearly 85 percent of 19-year-old males have admitted they were victims of online bullying, and failed to report it.\n\nI felt bullied in high school for a brief time, but I think it had to do more with being the new kid than any prejudice about my hair. No, the worst I got were \u201cdaywalker\u201d South Park jokes, which I also find hilarious, and constant comparisons to literally every other male ginger \u2014 celebrity or not. Ron Weasley, Louis C.K., and Conan O\u2019Brien were frequent comparisons, even if I really don\u2019t look much like any of them (except for maybe a bearded Conan when my hair gets particularly long and swoopy).", "article_metadata": {"description": "A celebration of all things Irish holiday means more for us redheads than you might think", "og": {"site_name": "Inverse", "description": "Once a year, gingers come out of the woodwork to mingle over good food and drink.", "title": "Happy Ginger Day, You Beautiful Mutants!", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/article/12958-st-patrick-s-day-is-the-perfect-small-concession-to-gingers", "image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/14/7e/4e/9c/8ae3/4fe2/acc8/07740660e8a8/a-child-dressed-in-an-irish-themed-costume-watches-the-annual-st-patricks-day-festival-pass-from-pi.jpeg?rect=0,120,3625,1812&w=1200&fm=png&q=75", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@inversedotcom", "image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/14/7e/4e/9c/8ae3/4fe2/acc8/07740660e8a8/a-child-dressed-in-an-irish-themed-costume-watches-the-annual-st-patricks-day-festival-pass-from-pi.jpeg?rect=0,120,3625,1812&w=1200&fm=png&q=75", "description": "Once a year, gingers come out of the woodwork to mingle over good food and drink.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Happy Ginger Day, You Beautiful Mutants!"}, "fb": {"pages": 820406651341117, "app_id": 1452605975051281}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inverse"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no,width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Let\u2019s face it, gingers aren\u2019t a very marginalized group \u2014 at least, compared to the truly disenfranchised of society.\nBut gingers do get St. Patrick\u2019s day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the last great social prejudices.\u201dBut the bullying rate among gingers is relatively consistent with national statistics for men.\nJacky Collins Harvey, author of Red: A History Of The Redhead, says gingerism is the last acceptable form of discrimination.\nWe don\u2019t have lobbyists who raise money for increased sunscreen research, and Congress isn\u2019t asking Obamacare to cover freckle removal surgery."}
