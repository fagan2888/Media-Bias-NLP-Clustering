When I came to his room, I found out his favorite song is 'You Are My Sunshine,\u2019 so we sang it,\u201d Davis says. \u201cIt sounded so nice, we decided to record the song. I recorded it on my phone and he posted it to Facebook. It\u2019s getting hundreds of likes and hundreds of shares. It was just a great, great blessing to be able to do this with him.\n\nThe choir came into being when department staff met to discuss how to kick their presence up a notch at the hospital\u2019s annual multicultural fair. Latino members of environmental services already had performed a conga dance, but there was more diversity to show among the staff, Reyes says.\n\n\u201cThe idea for a gospel choir was given and Shawn stepped up to volunteer to lead the choir,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout 25 employees met three times a week to rehearse, and the department bought $800 [worth] of Carolina Blue choir robes. We thought it was worth the investment, and it has been even better than we imagined.\u201d\n\nThe choir has closed out the fair to wild applause for two years. \u201cWithout exaggeration, there was jumping and shouting and dancing and testifying in the hospital lobby, from the audience as well as the choir,\u201d Davis says. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re called on often to go to hospital rooms, to do holiday Christmas carols. We sang the Star Spangled Banner at a University of North Carolina women\u2019s basketball game, and more.\u201d\n\nDavis says the choir has raised morale for the entire staff. It comprises employees from both the first and second shifts \u2014 those who don\u2019t get a chance to know each other or ever really talk at work. The choir bridges that gap.\n\nReyes is proud to say that the choir, originally mostly African American, and 100 percent environmental services employees, \u201cis growing and bringing in people of different cultures and from different departments.\u201d\n\n\u201cShawn is a natural. He\u2019s a people person and great at team-building,\u201d Reyes says, adding that he could tell that when he first met Davis.\n\nDavis relocated to North Carolina in 2014 from New York City, where he worked for the city\u2019s transit system. Once he relocated, he took the job at UNC and enrolled in undergraduate classes at South University. His ultimate ambition is to attend UNC and to become a psychiatrist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had an affinity for mental health care,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the choir work is helping me to prepare for that.\u201d\n\nGOT A GOOD STORY?\n\nDo you know of a hospital team or staff member who goes above and beyond what would be expected of them? We'd love to hear about it. Email Bill Santamour at bsantamour@healthforum.com to get the ball rolling, and your story might appear in H&HN.\n\nDavis and the choir members already are tackling psychologically tough jobs. \u201cI work in the bone marrow transplant area; it\u2019s sort of the patient\u2019s last chance,\u201d Davis says. \u201cSo, if they aren\u2019t having the best of days, I try to brighten things up with my music when I\u2019m cleaning their rooms, or when I\u2019m called on to visit,\u201d Davis says.\n\nSmall groups of other choir members do the same thing, he adds. \u201cMusic is universal, it brings you out of where you are, and to where you want to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Music is in the air at University of North Carolina Hospitals, thanks to a housekeeping staff that loves to sing.
