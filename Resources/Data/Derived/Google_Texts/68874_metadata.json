(CBSNewYork) \u2014 Living with the loss of an arm or a leg is hard enough, and now amputees have begun a fight for insurance coverage in New York state.\n\nAs CBS2\u2019s Carolyn Gusoff reported exclusively Tuesday, the standard health plans for the state limit how many artificial limbs a person can have \u2013 to exactly one.\n\nAfter battling cancer and losing a leg, Bob Reffi\u2019s first artificial limb wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\n\u201cI was in terrific pain,\u201d Reffi said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d\n\nBut a second prosthetic device made all the difference.\n\n\u201cIt gave me back my life,\u201d Reffi said. \u201cI walk. I go on the beach. I fish.\u201d\n\nBut under his new Affordable Care Act insurance, bought on the New York State Exchange Marketplace, there is no second chance. The state\u2019s health insurers cover only one prosthetic device per limb per lifetime \u2014 no repairs, no replacements.\n\nOnly children are exempt.\n\nBoth patients and artificial limb manufacturers believe the rule is ridiculous.\n\n\u201cNo person can live with just one prosthetic limb,\u201d said Dan Bastian, an artificial limb maker.\n\nBastian said the artificial limbs don\u2019t last forever. Bodies change, and technology improves.\n\nBut when it comes to state health insurers, that does not matter.\n\n\u201cThey will not cover repairs or replacements,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cSo it your prosthesis breaks, well, you\u2019re out of luck.\u201d\n\nFor Bastian, the fight against one limb for life is personal. He himself lost his leg 25 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf I was limited to the first one that I received, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do all the things I do,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Kemp, a leading advocate for disabled people, was born without arms and leg. He wears four artificial limbs.\n\n\u201cMore than occasionally do I need a repair or replacement. I just got new elbows,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout having the insurance coverage, it is like a disability tax, and that\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nA petition has been set up calling for change to the New York state restriction. National advocates said it violates civil rights.\n\n\u201cThis is a really unprecedented and egregious restriction in coverage, and it really impacts people who are trying to go to work; go to school,\u201d said Peter Thomas of the National Association for Orthotics and Prosthetics.\n\nNew York state officials said the restriction is not actually a lifetime limit, but a benchmark. Insurers can offer more.\n\nBut Bastian says they do not.\n\n\u201cThere are no other plans that offer any other coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicaid and Medicare cover repairs and replacements. So does the Veterans Administration.\n\nBut for the 3,000 new amputees in New York state each year, their first prosthetic device could be the last one insurance covers.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 why would you punish people?\u201d Reffi said. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting insurance for free, You\u2019re paying for it.\u201d\n\nThe New York Health Plan Association said the state sets the benefits, and only the state can change coverage. The organization added that it is required to keep premiums low, and cannot financially offer more.\n\nAn artificial limb can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Living with the loss of an arm or a leg is hard enough, and now amputees have begun a fight for insurance coverage in New York state.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/03/17/cbs2-exclusive-nys-amputees-say-insurance-limits-them-to-one-prosthetic-for-life/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/prosthetic_limb_coverage_0317.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/prosthetic_limb_coverage_0317.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Living with the loss of an arm or a leg is hard enough, and now amputees have begun a fight for insurance coverage in New York state.", "title": "CBS2 Exclusive: NYS Amputees Say Insurance Limits Them To One Prosthetic Per Limb For Life"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/prosthetic_limb_coverage_0317.jpg?w=625", "description": "Living with the loss of an arm or a leg is hard enough, and now amputees have begun a fight for insurance coverage in New York state.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CBS2 Exclusive: NYS Amputees Say Insurance Limits Them To One Prosthetic Per Limb For Life"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "li news, local, news, ny news, radio.com - news, seen on cbs2, syndicated local, syndication, watch + listen, affordable care act, amputees, bob reffi, carolyn gusoff, dan bastian, john kemp, new york state, prosthetic limbs", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, amputees, bob reffi, carolyn gusoff, dan bastian, john kemp, new york state, prosthetic limbs"}, "article_summary": "New York state officials said the restriction is not actually a lifetime limit, but a benchmark.\nI fish.\u201dBut under his new Affordable Care Act insurance, bought on the New York State Exchange Marketplace, there is no second chance.\n\u201cNo person can live with just one prosthetic limb,\u201d said Dan Bastian, an artificial limb maker.\nBut for the 3,000 new amputees in New York state each year, their first prosthetic device could be the last one insurance covers.\n\u201cWithout having the insurance coverage, it is like a disability tax, and that\u2019s not fair.\u201dA petition has been set up calling for change to the New York state restriction."}
