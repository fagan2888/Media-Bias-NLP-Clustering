The nuclear deal he signed over the summer is apparently working splendidly.\n\n\"After nearly two years of intensive negotiations and strong sanctions, the countries represented in this room achieved what decades of animosity and rhetoric did not: a long-term deal that closes off every possible path for Iran to build a nuclear weapon and subjects Iran to the most comprehensive nuclear inspections ever negotiated,\" Obama said.\n\nObama left out the part where Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said just this week that his nation is not going to abandon its ballistic missile program. It was one of several indications Iran is not ready to play nice with the United States and Israel. Remember when they captured 10 of our U.S. sailors and held a parade to celebrate?\n\nThe president noted that the agreement does not solve all problems in the region, but insists it has placed a major obstacle in Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb, calling it a \u201csuccess of diplomacy.\u201d\n\n\"This is a success of diplomacy,\" says Pres Obama of Iran nuke deal. Says it has \"achieved a substantial success.\" pic.twitter.com/Ip3gs90QZv \u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) April 1, 2016\n\nIf he truly believes that, he might want to work on his argument. Remarks like this aren\u2019t likely to comfort critics.\n\nPres Obama hails Iran Nuclear Agreement as \"historic.\" Even if Iran cheats, he says it would now take a year for Iran to make a nuke weapon. \u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) April 1, 2016\n\nArms control activists see through the president\u2019s all talk, no action policies that do nothing to halt an international arms race.\n\n\"I have a hard time calling this a nuclear security summit,\" said Bruce Blair, a former Air Force nuclear launch officer who co-founded Global Zero, an international movement seeking the elimination of nuclear weapons that was fueled by Obama's Prague speech. \"The Prague vision has been just empty calories.\"\n\nOther critics point to the fact that Obama has not helped to decrease any of the world\u2019s 200,000 nuclear weapons in the form of highly enriched uranium.\n\nWhile the president pats himself on the back, our enemies are giving themselves high fives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not buying it..05/26/2016 19:59:29PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not buying it.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Critics Skewer Obama's 'Empty Calories' Nuclear Weapons Plan As He Touts Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/01/critics-skewer-obamas-empty-calories-nuclear-weapons-plan-as-he-totes-iran-deal-n2141975", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/92/ee9cd2d5-97f0-4b31-96d7-536c2ab5e79d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not buying it.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Critics Skewer Obama's 'Empty Calories' Nuclear Weapons Plan As He Touts Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/01/critics-skewer-obamas-empty-calories-nuclear-weapons-plan-as-he-totes-iran-deal-n2141975", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/92/ee9cd2d5-97f0-4b31-96d7-536c2ab5e79d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Critics Skewer Obama's 'Empty Calories' Nuclear Weapons Plan As He Touts Iran Deal, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The nuclear deal he signed over the summer is apparently working splendidly.\nIt\u2019s President Obama\u2019s last Nuclear Security Summit in Washington and, judging by his rhetoric on Friday, he seems pretty pleased with his efforts to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear aims.\n\"I have a hard time calling this a nuclear security summit,\" said Bruce Blair, a former Air Force nuclear launch officer who co-founded Global Zero, an international movement seeking the elimination of nuclear weapons that was fueled by Obama's Prague speech.\nOther critics point to the fact that Obama has not helped to decrease any of the world\u2019s 200,000 nuclear weapons in the form of highly enriched uranium.\nPres Obama hails Iran Nuclear Agreement as \"historic.\""}
