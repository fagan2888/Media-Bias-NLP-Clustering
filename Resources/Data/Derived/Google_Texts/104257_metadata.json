The members said the board had pushed repeatedly for a resolution of those problems without success over the years.\n\n\u201cThis led to our conclusion that the only practical way to deal with this \u2026 was to make a change in the institutional head,\u201d said Alan Perry, the board\u2019s incoming president. In the 2011 story in the MBJ, Nash made clear \u2014 In the email, which was included in the court file of James Hahn\u2019s lawsuit against the Delta Health Alliance \u2014 ways to bring some combination of public and social embarrassment to former Ole Miss Chancellor Robert Khayat in a May 2009 e-mail to Delta Council executive vice president Chip Morgan, who a recent nominee to the IHL board by Gov. Phil Bryant. \u00bb READ THE ENTIRE STORY AND MORE: Email from Nash to Delta Council\u2019s Morgan included in DHA court file \u201cEach can be an effective motivator,\u201d Nash writes. \u201cAs for the public kind, it seems there are three venues: (1) the press; (2) the Legislature; and (3) the College Board. The typical free media is pretty weak in Mississippi (as you know), but that doesn\u2019t mean that a juicy story about UMC losing millions of federal dollars because of bureaucratic bumbling wouldn\u2019t entice even the laziest reporter.\u201d\n\nNash continues in his email: \u201cBut in today\u2019s world, there are also blogs, radio talk shows, email blasts, university chat rooms, anonymous mailings, etc. All of which can be put to good use to make a point. And most of these venues feed on themselves; calling one editor to quash a story, like RK could have done in the old days, can\u2019t happen today. Once the story gets on the web, it is like a growing organism. I know this from other work \u2013 UMC has a less-than-stellar in-house PR/communications operation. They are very weak, and would have no clue about how to counter this kind of frontal assault. They know virtually nothing about message development and message delivery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "In 2011, the\u00a0Mississippi Business Journal\u00a0published a story about Democratic strategist Jere Nash ...", "title": "The Dan Jones-IHL saga: Is this the story that started it all?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/msbusiness.com/files/2011/12/JNash-email-graphic.jpg?resize=336%2C336", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/03/the-dan-jones-ihl-saga-is-this-the-story-that-started-it-all/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Education", "tag": "University of Mississippi Medical Center", "published_time": "2015-03-27T09:23:21-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 2011, the\u00a0Mississippi Business Journal\u00a0published a story about Democratic strategist Jere Nash sending an email to\u00a0Delta Council executive vice president Chip Morgan.
