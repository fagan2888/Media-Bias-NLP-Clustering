BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) — Brad Keselowski spun into teammate Joey Logano minutes into Sunday’s race at Bristol Motor Speedway, where rain was wreaking havoc on the event.

Persistent rain delayed the start more than an hour, and NASCAR rushed to get the event underway during a brief window. Several drivers rushed to their cars moments before Jeff Gordon’s two children, Ella and Leo, gave the command to start the engines.

Although it was damp and cold when the race began, there weren’t any issues until the 20th lap, when Keselowski spun trying to get around a lapped car. He spun directly into Team Penske teammate Joey Logano, and both cars were heavily damaged.

The incident happened just as it began to rain again, and NASCAR stopped the race to wait out the shower.
