What should we worry about?\" said one economist at a Beijing-based think-tank. \"We have net claims on foreign assets of $1.5 trillion, and we still have a trade surplus of about $600 billion.\"\n\nIf it falls to $2 trillion by 2025, he said, \"we will still be safe and sound\".\n\nAnother economist at a government think-tank put the bottom line at $1.62 trillion.\n\n\"They are a bit worried about the fall in reserves, but it's too early to panic,\" he said, though he acknowledged an unresolved conflict between overseas investors expecting the yuan to fall and the government's belief that China's fundamentals did not support continued depreciation.\n\nUltimately, the safe level is less about ratios than sentiment, said Thin at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\n\"There\u2019s no magic number ... I do think that confidence is a big part of this whole thing, and China\u2019s policymakers are really trying to restore confidence.\"\n\nCertainly bearish bets against the yuan have fallen since spiking in January, according to a Reuters Asia FX positioning poll, as the dollar has come off its peaks.\n\nBut Chris Morrison, portfolio manager at Hedge fund Omni, which has been vocally betting against the currency, thinks the tipping point is closer than most.\n\n\"This game is all to do with expectations and confidence... Once the market sees the bottom of the pit, they lose all credibility. And I think going through $3 trillion is that point.\"\n\n(Reporting by Kevin Yao; Additional reporting by Patrick Graham and Dion Rabouin; Editing by Will Waterman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China still owns the world's largest currency reserves, but it has", "title": "How long before the cracks show in China's great currency wall?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/23/How-long-cracks-show-Chinas-great-currency-wall", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-economy-reserves_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/23/How-long-cracks-show-Chinas-great-currency-wall", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-economy-reserves_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China still owns the world's largest currency reserves, but it has", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Though the composition of China's reserves is a state secret, officials also say the falling dollar value of other currencies it holds accounts for some of the fall.\nI do think that confidence is a big part of this whole thing, and China\u2019s policymakers are really trying to restore confidence.\"\nBut Chris Morrison, portfolio manager at Hedge fund Omni, which has been vocally betting against the currency, thinks the tipping point is closer than most.\n\"We have net claims on foreign assets of $1.5 trillion, and we still have a trade surplus of about $600 billion.\"\n\"I would say by any metric that we use for EM, Chinese reserves are more than sufficient,\" he said."}
