At past Mission of Mercy clinics, people start lining up for care hours in advance, Schwartz said, because of the \u201ctremendous\u201d need.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sad part,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a great event but it certainly isn\u2019t the solution.\u201d\n\n\n\nVolunteers plan to take state legislators on tours of the activities, said Lee Ann Beane, spokeswoman for the Illinois State Dental Society Foundation, which sponsors the dental missions.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the state dental society foundation began sponsoring the missions every two years, in part to highlight the need for accessible dental care. Several hundred Peoria-area residents attended the first dental mission in Bloomington. The 2012 Mission of Mercy was in the Grayslake area.\n\n\n\nA lack of affordable, accessible dental care, particularly for adults, ranked as one of the Tri-County Area\u2019s top health issues in a community health needs assessment conducted by the area\u2019s major hospitals in 2013.\n\n\n\nPeople with dental problems often end up in hospital emergency rooms, which can triple the cost of care, according to Schwartz. Left untreated, oral health problems can lead to more severe health issues, including heart disease, strokes, and in rare cases, death.\n\n\n\nIllinois lawmakers exacerbated the problem in 2012 when they eliminated Medicaid payments for adult dental care except in emergencies, Schwartz said. Though the benefits were restored in the current state budget, finding affordable dental care still can be difficult.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded access to Medicaid for many adults but it did not address one of the key barriers to access in Illinois. Most dentists \u2014 including many who volunteer for Mission of Mercy \u2014 don\u2019t accept Medicaid patients.\n\n\n\nIllinois\u2019 reimbursement rates are so low, dentists can\u2019t afford to accept Medicaid, Schwartz said. \u201cOur goal is to get the state to at least raise it to the break-even point. Then more providers would come on board.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mission of Mercy organizers don\u2019t have a problem finding providers and others willing to donate time and money.\n\n\n\nBesides hundreds of dental care professionals, local plumbers and electricians are setting up about 100 dental chairs. Banks and the Peoria Area Convention and Visitors Bureau have given money. The Civic Center reduced its rental price and the Marriott Pere Marquette reduced rates for upwards of 1,000 volunteers, according to Schwartz. Pere Marquette employees also have adopted the event as a community service project.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur budget is about $175,000,\u201d Schwartz said, \u201cand everything comes from donations.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nIllinois Mission of Mercy\n\n\n\nWhat: Free dental clinic, sponsored by the Illinois State Dental Society Foundation, hosted by the Peoria Dental Society.\n\n\n\nWhen: June 20-21\n\n\n\nWhere: Peoria Civic Center\n\n\n\nTime: Doors open at 6 a.m., people are treated on a first-come, first-served.\n\n\n\nWhy: To provide basic dental care, such as fillings, extractions and cleanings, and to spotlight the need for affordable, accessible dental care.\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s eligible for treatment: All ages.

People could be turned away if organizers reach the 1,000-a-day limit early. People with serious health problems may not be treated, for example people with a fever or with extremely high blood pressure or blood sugar levels.
