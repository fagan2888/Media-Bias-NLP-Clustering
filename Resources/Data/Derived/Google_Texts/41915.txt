Six years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act remains a hot-button issue. Congress has voted more than 60 times to undo, defund or revamp it. On the campaign trail, presidential candidatesâ€™ positions on the law range from vowing to repeal and replace it to promising to build on and improve it.

Meanwhile, most employers have come to terms with it. Since 2010, they have made many plan changes and implemented processes needed to comply with the law, and have factored it into their long-term health plan strategies.
