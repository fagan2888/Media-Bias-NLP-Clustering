Under Massachusetts\u2019 2007 health care reform law, the state allows insurance companies to use 11 considerations, or \u201crating factors,\u201d when determining the cost of a health plan for an individual or small group. These include things like age, industry, participation in a wellness plan, the size of the group insured by the plan and the use of a group purchasing cooperative to buy insurance. The national health care reform law requires insurers to use just four factors when determining the cost of a plan: age, geography, tobacco use and family composition.\n\nBusiness groups have been warning for months that this could lead insurance rates to spike for some small businesses \u2013 even though some businesses and individuals could also see their premiums decrease. Gov. Deval Patrick asked the Obama administration for a waiver from the provision, and was granted a three-year transition period. The Massachusetts Legislature then passed a bill requiring Patrick to return to the federal government and ask for a full waiver. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius denied the request.\n\nThe business groups are now turning to the Massachusetts congressional delegation for relief. Signatories to the letter include the Affiliated Chambers of Commerce of Greater Springfield, Berkshire Chamber of Commerce, Greater Chicopee Chamber of Commerce and several other local chambers of commerce and statewide business organizations.\n\nThe groups are asking the administration to grant Massachusetts a waiver from the ratings factor change. They also want to waive a requirement that insurers set their rates annually. Currently, Massachusetts insurers set rates every quarter.\n\nThe groups argue that the Obama administration has already granted 1,200 waivers of provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Most recently, Obama said insurers will be able to offer existing customers insurance plans for one more year that do not meet the minimum coverage standards required by the law. Obama also delayed by a year the requirement that employers provide health insurance for their employees.\n\n\u201cGiven the number of administrative actions and waivers granted, we are left to wonder why our reasonable request for a limited waiver from two small provisions of federal reform has been denied for the one state in the nation that has already accomplished what the federal law is setting out to do,\u201d the business groups wrote.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','@mobile','affiliated-chambers-of-commerce-of-greater-springfield','affordable-care-act','associated-industries-of-massachusetts','barack-obama','health-care','health-care-law','obamacare'", "title": "Business groups ask Massachusetts congressmen for help obtaining Obamacare waiver", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Business groups ask Massachusetts congressmen for help obtaining Obamacare waiver\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/business_groups_ask_massachuse.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2013/10/13678932-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11690712\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-21T23:05:51Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"affiliated-chambers-of-commerce-of-greater-springfield\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"associated-industries-of-massachusetts\",\"barack-obama\",\"health-care\",\"health-care-law\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2013/10/13678932-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary", "description": "25 business groups, including several in Western Massachusetts, have asked the state's congressional delegation for a waiver from a provision of the Affordable Care Act that affects how health insurers calculate premiums."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, November 21, 2013,  6:05 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2013/10/-ddc765591d0ec139.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sschoenberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"10164552\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "25 business groups, including several in Western Massachusetts, have asked the state's congressional delegation for a waiver from a provision of the Affordable Care Act that affects how health insurers calculate premiums.", "title": "Business groups ask Massachusetts congressmen for help obtaining Obamacare waiver", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/business_groups_ask_massachuse.html", "image": "http://www.masslive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, November 21, 2013,  6:05 PM", "article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "Description": "25 business groups, including several in Western Massachusetts, have asked the state's congressional delegation for a waiver from a provision of the Affordable Care Act that affects how health insurers calculate premiums."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37eb\"", "article_summary": "Currently, Massachusetts insurers set rates every quarter.\nThe groups are asking the administration to grant Massachusetts a waiver from the ratings factor change.\nObama also delayed by a year the requirement that employers provide health insurance for their employees.\nTwenty-five business groups, including several in Western Massachusetts, have asked the state\u2019s congressional delegation for a waiver from a provision of the Affordable Care Act that affects how health insurers calculate premiums.\nThe Massachusetts Legislature then passed a bill requiring Patrick to return to the federal government and ask for a full waiver."}
