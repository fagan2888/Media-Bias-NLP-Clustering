Now, one of those communities is in a stage of recovery.\n\nLuverne, Minnesota was one of the hardest hit with rain last week, which led to water in fields, basements, and even driveways.\n\nAlthough Dara Smook has only lived in her Luverne home since December, she's already experienced what it's like to have water surrounding her property.\n\n\"The water was gushing down the driveway so hard and so high, it was knee high, and it was just roaring like a river down my driveway,\" Luverne Resident Dara Smook said.\n\nThe rushing water was so forceful that it picked up Smook's heavy red lawn chairs, and moved them out of her back yard. The water also flooded her basement, floated her camper, and even moved the gravel from her driveway into the street.\n\n\"Some friends and I, we bring all the gravel back up on the driveway, and put it all back into place, and then Monday it hit again, and washed it all back out again,\" Smook said.\n\nIt's been one week since major flooding hit the small town of Luverne, but homeowners are saying the community is in recovery.\n\n\"I think we're doing really well. Yeah, it's recovering, we're fine, I'm just cleaning, and it's a lot of work,\" Smook said.\n\nEven though the work is hard, Smook says she feels lucky, and hopes to avoid another 100 year flood in the future.\n\nAnd in South Dakota, the department of public safety is reminding drivers not to go around barricades or sections of highway closed by flooding. The pavement may look drivable, but the flooding likely has weakened the roadbed making it unsafe.\n\nFor the latest road conditions, click on the link below, or call 5-1-1.\n\nhttp://www.safetravelusa.com/\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "This time last week, many areas in KELOLAND were experiencing rushing floodwater.
