No alternative health care plan besides repealing #ACA or government shut down? Hack the ACA website. Conservative governance at its finest.

Morrison offered no direct proof for his claim. He previously linked to an ABC story saying the ObamaCare site had been hit by cyber attacks, but the story never mentions any conservative perpetrator. The report does say the number of attacks on the site is very low compared to other government targets.

It’s also come to light in recent days that the Obama administration had plenty of warning that the site in question had serious issues but went ahead with the Oct. 1 rollout all the same.
