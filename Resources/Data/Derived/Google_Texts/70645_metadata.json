Visit college campuses. Sit in on classes. Talk to professors, graduates and students. In the end, picking a college \u201cis a very individual decision.\u201d\n\nThe first lady could just as well have been talking to her older daughter, Malia, who is expected to head off to college next fall with the Class of 2020.\n\nThe 17-year-old is among U.S. high school seniors who are nervously taking standardized tests, completing college admissions applications, filling out financial aid forms and writing personal essays \u2013 all on deadline. Then they get to spend a few months waiting to find out if they got into their dream school.\n\nMalia has some advantages, though. What school would turn away a president\u2019s daughter?\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t have to worry about how to pay for her college education, unlike many of the students President Barack Obama and his wife regularly encourage to pursue post-high school education.\n\nSome of what\u2019s known about Malia\u2019s college search:\n\nSchools on her list\n\nMalia has visited at least a dozen public and private schools, mostly on the East Coast. Among them are six of the eight Ivies and a few with Obama family ties.\n\nDad is a 1983 graduate of Columbia. Mom graduated from Princeton in 1985. Malia\u2019s cousin, Leslie Robinson, is a sophomore forward on Princeton\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team. The president and first lady earned their law degrees at Harvard.\n\nThe other stops on her college tour: the University of California, Berkeley; Stanford; New York University; the University of Pennsylvania; Barnard; Tufts; Brown; Yale and Wesleyan.\n\nHow much her parents will pay\n\nThe bill for tuition (and fees, in some cases) alone at these universities costs between $40,000 and $50,000 for the current academic year. Tack on room and board, books, other fees and expenses, and the total tab for Malia\u2019s undergraduate degree could top one-quarter of a million dollars for the four years.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise her parents, though. They\u2019ve paid hefty tuition bills for the past seven years to send Malia, and her younger sister, Sasha, 14, to the exclusive Sidwell Friends School. Tuition at the private school in Washington is $37,750 per student this year.\n\nThe Obamas planned ahead for their daughters\u2019 college educations. Like millions of families, the Obamas have been investing money in 529 college savings plans (which are named after a section in federal tax law). The couple has four of the tax-free savings accounts, each valued at between $50,000 and $100,000, according to the president\u2019s financial disclosure forms.\n\nHow is Malia preparing?\n\nMrs. Obama has said Malia wants to be a filmmaker, and NYU has the respected Tisch School of the Arts, which counts directors Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee among its alumni.\n\nMalia spent last summer in New York City interning on the set of HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls,\u201d the raunchy comedy-drama starring Lena Dunham. She decamped to California in the summer of 2014 to work as a production assistant on \u201cExtant,\u201d a CBS sci-fi drama featuring Halle Berry.\n\nMrs. Obama recently disclosed that Malia has also done several internships at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington.\n\nMalia\u2019s travels across the U.S. and around the world with her parents could inform her personal essays. Malia (and Sasha) have visited Europe, Africa and Asia. They\u2019ve met two popes, Queen Elizabeth and American civil rights leaders during this year\u2019s 50th anniversary commemoration in Selma, Alabama.\n\nDad is freaking out\n\nMr. Obama was in Malia\u2019s room the day she started her senior year of high school and says she told him it was probably the last time he\u2019ll ever send her off for a first day of school.\n\n\u201cI had to look away. I didn\u2019t want to just be such a crybaby,\u201d he said in September in Michigan while pushing for free community college. \u201cIt makes no sense. Michelle and I are way too young to have daughters who are both almost in college now. So as a parent, I was a little freaked out.\u201d\n\nWhat is mom doing?\n\nThrough her \u201cReach Higher\u201d initiative, Mrs. Obama encourages students to attend college or technical school after high school. During a panel discussion in September at Howard County Community College near Baltimore, students sought her advice on everything from how to figure out which school is best for them to what tips she\u2019s giving her daughters.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about this in my household every night, every night. And there\u2019s really no magic formula,\u201d the first lady said. \u201cIt is a very individual decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michelle Obama's message for high school seniors fretting about their college prospects is simple.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Michelle Obama\u2019s message for high school seniors fretting about their college prospects is simple.", "title": "Malia Obama, Michelle and Barack\u2019s oldest daughter, scoping out colleges", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/27/malia-obama-michelle-and-baracks-oldest-daughter-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/25/Obama_Thanksgiving.JPEG-00b37.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/25/Obama_Thanksgiving.JPEG-00b37.jpg", "description": "Michelle Obama's message for high school seniors fretting about their college prospects is simple.", "card": "summary", "title": "Malia Obama, Michelle and Barack\u2019s oldest daughter, scoping out"}, "Author": "Darlene Superville", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Michelle Obama"}, "article_summary": "Through her \u201cReach Higher\u201d initiative, Mrs. Obama encourages students to attend college or technical school after high school.\nASSOCIATED PRESS - Michelle Obama\u2019s message for high school seniors fretting about their college prospects is simple.\nSome of what\u2019s known about Malia\u2019s college search:Schools on her listMalia has visited at least a dozen public and private schools, mostly on the East Coast.\nMrs. Obama recently disclosed that Malia has also done several internships at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington.\nThe 17-year-old is among U.S. high school seniors who are nervously taking standardized tests, completing college admissions applications, filling out financial aid forms and writing personal essays \u2013 all on deadline."}
