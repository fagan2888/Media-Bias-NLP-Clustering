WILMINGTON — Gov. Pat McCrory will be here Wednesday to hear about coastal issues from the N.C. Coastal Resources Commission at the commission’s regular meeting.

The CRC will meet from that day through Thursday, at the Hilton Wilmington Riverside hotel at 301 North Water St. During the Wednesday meeting, at 4 p.m., Gov. McCrory will make comments to the CRC, after which he will hear presentations on seven issues facing the North Carolina coast.

Greg “Rudi” Rudolph, Carteret County Shore Protection Manager, said he’s excited that the governor will be at the meeting, which Mr. Rudolph said he’ll also be attending. Mr. Rudolph also serves on the CRC science panel, and said this is the first time since he began that the governor will be present at a CRC meeting.

“We’ve been working on getting these issues to him,” Mr. Rudolph said.

“I’m glad this hasn’t just been a Wilmington thing; there’s been some concern about this only being about their issues,” he added.

A seven-member panel will give their presentation.

Among the panelists is Todd Rosessler, an attorney with the law firm of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton whom the Carteret County Beach Commission has retained for several years.

Mr. Rosessler is scheduled to give a presentation on increasing federal regulations. Mr. Rudolph said his presentation will focus on regulations pertaining to the Endangered Species Act.

Several species found in Carteret County – such as sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon – are listed as endangered under the ESA.

Another, the rufa red knot, is being considered for listing; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, one of the agencies which enforces the ESA, expects to issue its final decision by Friday, Nov. 28.

As a result, areas in Carteret County and elsewhere on the North Carolina coast have been declared critical habitat for sea turtles and may be declared critical habitat for other species, as well.

This is a designation for habitat that means activities or projects in the habitat that are federally funded, managed or permitted – including federally managed fishing, federally funded dredging, offshore energy exploration and beach nourishment projects – have to undergo additional scrutiny before being permitted.

If threats to the habitat or the species using it were found, special management consideration would be required to get any federal permits the activity or project needs.

Mr. Rudolph has been an opponent to sea turtle critical habitat designation. He’s said during public meetings that the final rules for the designations list “every possible thing a resident or tourist does on the beach” as a threat and that what special management consideration would be required is “wide open.”

The other panelists and their topics are:

•Dr. Chris Dumas, UNC Wilmington professor of economics – The economic value of the coast.

•Caswell Beach Mayor Harry Simmons – The reduced funding of coastal projects.

•CB&I Client Program Manager Ken Wilson – Dredging policies.

•New Hanover County Shore Protection Coordinator Layton Bedsole – Dredging policies.

•BlueGreen Outer Banks Director Willo Kelly – Flood and wind insurance.

•CRC Chairman Frank Gorham – Concerns with offshore drilling.

Several other items on the CRC’s agenda for its October meeting are:

•Exemption for single-family residences in the estuarine shoreline area of environmental concern to get signed statements of no objection from adjacent property owners.

•Occasional flooding criteria for coastal wetlands.

•Proposed amendments to Coastal Area Management Act land-use planning guidelines and land-use planning grants.

•The draft final report for inlet management study priorities.

•Draft rule language for state ports inlet management areas of environmental concern.

•A request for a variance from oceanfront setbacks in Salter Path.

•A petition for rulemaking to amend state regulations on piers and docking facilities.

•A report on static vegetation line alternatives.
