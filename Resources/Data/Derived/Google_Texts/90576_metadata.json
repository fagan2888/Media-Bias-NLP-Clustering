In his sprawling new encyclical, Laudato Si\u2019, he criticises environmental policies, modern consumerism, rising inequality and even the social media. While this has left those who doubt climate change in a state of shock, the oil and industrial lobbies in confusion, and filled environmentalists with a new found hope, Pope\u2019s stand on environment might also redefine conservatism and liberal politics of the world for the times to come.\n\nIn a sweeping environmental manifesto aimed at spurring concrete action, Pope Francis recently called for a bold cultural revolution to correct what he described as a \u201cstructurally perverse\u201d economic system where the rich exploit the poor, turning Earth into an \u201cimmense pile of filth.\u201d\n\nFrancis framed climate change as an urgent moral issue in his eagerly anticipated encyclical, blaming global warming on an unfair, fossil fuel-based industrial model that harms the poor most. Citing Scripture, his predecessors and bishops from around the world, the pope urged people of every faith and even no faith to undergo an awakening to save God\u2019s creation for future generations.\n\nThe document released Thursday was a stinging indictment of big business and climate doubters alike, meant to encourage courageous changes at U.N. climate negotiations later this year, in domestic politics and in everyday life.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to balance, in the medium term, the protection of nature with financial gain, or the preservation of the environment with progress,\u201d he writes. \u201cHalfway measures simply delay the inevitable disaster. Put simply, it is a matter of redefining our notion of progress.\u201d\n\nWith a poet\u2019s lyricism\n\nWith a poet\u2019s lyricism, a former chemist\u2019s precision and a pontiff\u2019s moral thunder, Pope Francis recast humanity\u2019s relationship with nature in stark ethical terms, hoping to spur a warming, filthy world to clean up its act \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nIn issuing \u201cLaudato Si,\u201d his much-anticipated encyclical on climate change, the pope recently took an extraordinary approach to an environmental issue often framed in the dry language of science.\n\nFrancis\u2019 teaching document is a melodic yet radical indictment, depicting a materialistic and wasteful society that is hurting the planet and its poorest people. He challenges the world to stop pollution, to recycle and carpool and to do without air conditioning and makes it a moral imperative.\n\n\u201cThe exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty,\u201d he writes. The pope\u2019s \u201cmarching orders for advocacy,\u201d as the head of the US conference of bishops calls it, comes as the world nears make-or-break time for international climate change negotiations that start late this year in Paris.\n\nA seminal moment, according to environmentalists\n\n\u201cThis is a seminal moment in world history because the pope now is the leading global voice on climate change,\u201d said prominent Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written both on the church and environmentalism. \u201cThe pope brings extraordinary clout connecting Christianity and humanism to the protection of natural resources.\u201d\n\nFrancis said he hoped his paper would lead both ordinary people in their daily lives and decision-makers at the Paris UN. climate meetings to a wholesale change of mind and heart, urging all to listen to \u201cboth the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor.\u201d\n\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has made the issue of climate change his top priority since taking the reins of the world body 8and a half years ago, thanked the pope \u201cfor taking such a strong stand on the need for urgent global action.\u201d In some ways, the pope\u2019s encyclical and its prayers serve as an invocation to the climate talks.\n\nEnvironmental scientists said the first-ever encyclical, or teaching document, on the environment could have a dramatic effect on the climate debate, lending the moral authority of the immensely popular Francis to an issue that has long been cast in purely political, economic or scientific terms.\n\n\u201cThis clarion call should guide the world toward a strong and durable universal climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, the U.N.\u2019s top climate official. \u201cCoupled with the economic imperative, the moral imperative leaves no doubt that we must act on climate change now.\u201d\n\nVeerabhadran Ramanathan, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist, said the encyclical is a \u201cgame-changer in making people think about this. It\u2019s not politics anymore,\u201d he said, adding that science is often difficult to understand but that people respond to arguments framed by morality and ethics.\n\nPope Francis\u2019s encyclical on the environment provides a massive mobilising boost for efforts to reach a UN deal on climate change this year, green campaigners said, as they hailed the 184-page document, \u201cLaudato Si\u201d as a milestone. For many Catholics, they predicted, it could transform climate from a remote environmental problem into a pressing moral issue demanding action. Its impact could be far-reaching in the effort to conclude a UN accord on curbing greenhouse-gases, due less than six months from now.\n\n\u201cThe Pope\u2019s message can only help strengthen the momentum toward an agreement in Paris,\u201d said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), a US thinktank. \u201c(He) is injecting a powerful moral voice into a debate usually mired in science, politics and economics. He speaks to our collective conscience, and while he\u2019s unlikely to win over many skeptics, he\u2019s educating countless others about the stakes and the urgency.\u201d\n\nAndrew Steer, head of another US thinktank, the World Resources Institute (WRI), pointed to the spiritual authority and mobilising clout of the Catholic church. \u201cIt will speak not only to the 5,000 Catholic bishops nor only to the 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide, but to all people of goodwill who are open to the moral context of climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nEnergy lobby was quick to criticize\n\nThe energy lobby was quick to criticize the encyclical\u2019s anti-fossil fuel message. \u201cThe simple reality is that energy is the essential building block of the modern world,\u201d said Thomas Pyle of the Institute of Energy Research, a conservative free-market group. \u201cThe application of affordable energy makes everything we do food production, manufacturing, health care, transportation, heating and air conditioning better.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited encyclical named climate change as \u201cone of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.\u201d \u201cIf present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us,\u201d it warned.\n\nIt pounded out the message of inequality, saying poor countries that have least to blame for rising seas, worsening drought and flood will feel its impacts worst, and needed the help of rich economies. Apportioning responsibility for tackling climate change is one of the thorniest and most complex issues in the troubled UN talks, according to PTI.\n\nRich countries admit they bear historical blame for emitting most of the greenhouse gases behind today\u2019s warming. But they argue tomorrow\u2019s warming will come from emerging giants like China and India, which are voraciously burning oil, gas and coal. These countries retort they are still fighting to rise out of poverty and, for now, still need cheap fossil fuels.\n\nScientific data released Thursday backed up Francis\u2019 concerns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released figures showing that last month was the hottest May around the globe in 136 years of global records. NOAA calculated that the first five months of 2015 made up by far the hottest year on record, with very real effects: some 2,200 people have died in India\u2019s heat wave.\n\nWith the Pope taking a humanist stand, climate change will not remain an environmental issue alone. It will now become a moral issue for many faithful Catholics across the globe too. It is one of those rare historic moments when religion and science united to fight for a common cause.\n\nImage Credit : Shutterstock\n\nRelated Stories :\n\nClimate change affects small businesses more than it does big corporates\n\nIndia urges for greater cooperation between BRICS nations on climate change\n\nIndia and China appeal developed nations to lead efforts in climate change combat", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the Pope taking a humanist stand, climate change will not remain an environmental issue alone, but become a moral issue for many faithful Catholics.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "SocialStory", "description": "With the Pope taking a humanist stand, climate change will not remain an environmental issue alone, but become a moral issue for many faithful Catholics.", "title": "What does Pope Francis jumping into the climate change debate mean? - SocialStory", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn2.yourstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/yourstory_pope_francis_climate_change_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-21T15:46:16+00:00", "url": "http://social.yourstory.com/2015/06/pope-francis-climate-change/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"iphone": "ysApp://openarticle?site=SOCIALSTORY&article_id=13739&title=", "googleplay": "ysApp://openarticle?site=SOCIALSTORY&article_id=13739&title="}, "id": {"iphone": 918399830, "googleplay": "com.yslabs.yourstory"}, "name": {"iphone": "YourStory", "googleplay": "YourStory"}}}, "blitz": "mu-f6a64b82-81143d4b-f2e87d35-dc8bc8ab", "al": {"android": {"url": "ysApp://openarticle?site=SOCIALSTORY&article_id=13739&title=", "app_name": "YourStory", "package": "com.yslabs.yourstory"}, "ios": {"url": "ysApp://openarticle?site=SOCIALSTORY&article_id=13739&title=", "app_store_id": 918399830, "app_name": "YourStory"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 252967394737645, "pages": 467687645161}, "article": {"section": "civic responsibility", "tag": "catholic,climate change,environment,pope francis,vatican", "published_time": "2015-06-21T15:11:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-21T15:46:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sourav894"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Image Credit : ShutterstockRelated Stories :Climate change affects small businesses more than it does big corporatesIndia urges for greater cooperation between BRICS nations on climate changeIndia and China appeal developed nations to lead efforts in climate change combat\nWith the Pope taking a humanist stand, climate change will not remain an environmental issue alone.\nApportioning responsibility for tackling climate change is one of the thorniest and most complex issues in the troubled UN talks, according to PTI.\nIt will now become a moral issue for many faithful Catholics across the globe too.\nFor many Catholics, they predicted, it could transform climate from a remote environmental problem into a pressing moral issue demanding action."}
