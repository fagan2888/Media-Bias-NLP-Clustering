Moffett was sworn in as the newest chancellor in the First District on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe investiture at the Lee County Justice Center was ceremonial. Moffett has been presiding over chancery court cases since Jan. 4. Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Moffett on Dec. 19 to fill out the term of the late Talmadge Littlejohn, who died Oct. 26.\n\nSince more than half of Littlejohn\u2019s term was remaining, a special election will be held in November to fill the seat.\n\nDespite practicing law for 36 years, becoming a judge was not Moffett\u2019s career path when he left Becker Bottoms in Monroe County in 1967 heading to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.\n\n\u201cI never planned on being a lawyer,\u201d Moffett said. \u201cGod just opened some doors and has blessed my life.\n\n\u201cAs I enter this new office, my prayer is that God will grant me the wisdom to know how to enter the correct judgment and the courage to act accordingly.\u201d\n\nMississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice William Waller Jr., who served under Moffett in the Mississippi National Guard, administered the oath of office.\n\n\u201cThe goal of a judge is to be fair, efficient and impartial,\u201d Waller said. \u201cT.K. will meet those criteria.\u201d\n\nChancery courts deal with domestic matters, including adoptions, custody disputes, divorces, sanity hearings and wills. Land records are filed in chancery court and chancellors rule on annexation cases.\n\n\u201cChancellors deal with life as we live it, so you need a chancellor who understands so orders can be signed so families can move on with life,\u201d said Circuit Court Judge James Roberts. \u201cHe knows the rules. He knows the law. There will be no learning curve. I think he will fit in extremely well.\u201d\n\nMoffett graduated from West Point in 1971 and earned his law degree from the University of Mississippi in 1979. After his active duty in the military, he served in the Mississippi National Guard. He mobilized for both Gulf Wars as well as Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n\nwilliam.moore@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By William Moore Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Terrill K.
