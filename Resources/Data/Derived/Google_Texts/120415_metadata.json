Developer Hello Games and its founder, Sean Murray, rarely lead with that, because it\u2019s dangerous to give the impression that it\u2019s all ambience and no gameplay.\n\nNo Man\u2019s Sky has space combat, mining, trading, an economy by way of space stations, multiplayer, and progression fueled by the lure of suit upgrades and new ships\u2014and you can engage with all of these things, or none of them. That\u2019s what has made the game so difficult to explain, as Murray told Digital Trends at 2014\u2019s PlayStation Experience.\n\n\u201cIf you were just a space combat game, you could just show that and everyone would be happy. That would be enough, because that\u2019s enough for a whole game,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that for ours, it doesn\u2019t define what it is. What you\u2019re seeing in that snapshot isn\u2019t going to continue to be exactly the same for everyone for 11 hours and then, finish.\u201d\n\nThe question should be \u201cWhat will I do?\u201d and not \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d\n\nWhen it opens, No Man\u2019s Sky spawns you on a random planet toward the edge of the universe. There are so many planets in the game\u2019s galaxy that it would take hundreds of billions of years to explore them all\u2014that\u2019s a claim that Hello has thrown around a lot\u2014and when you start the game, you can end up on basically any of them. No one knows what that planet will look like, or what you might find there, not even Hello.\n\nThere are no tutorials. You walk around, try the controls, and find your ship nearby. Then, once you\u2019re done wandering, you fly out into space. Each planet is a new opportunity to whip out your resource scanner and check what\u2019s in the terrain, then mine for goodies with lasers and grenades.\n\nMake no mistake: No Man\u2019s Sky is a video game. You have a sprint button and a jetpack, and if you die you lose whatever you\u2019re carrying\u2014or even your ship, if it\u2019s destroyed in battle. If that happens, you\u2019d better hope you have enough credits to buy a new one. Cause and effect mean something in No Man\u2019s Sky, and consequences are everywhere.\n\nIf you\u2019re the first player to discover a body of water or a system of caves, you can decide what to name it and upload your findings for other players to see. Or you can keep that info to yourself, a private oasis or treasure trove that no one else is likely to find thanks to the game\u2019s sheer enormity.\n\nThe result? Every player\u2019s story will be different. That\u2019s a claim that a lot of game developers have made throughout the history of this medium, but for the first time in a long time it seems like it might actually be true with No Man\u2019s Sky. That\u2019s what Hello Games has been trying to communicate: The question should be \u201cWhat will I do?\u201d and not \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe save the crazy interesting creatures for not one in a million, but one in a hundred million.\u201d\n\nAn example from Murray: Say you touch down an a brand new planet and spy some resources at the bottom of the ocean. You\u2019d like to grab them so you can upgrade your ship\u2019s hyper drive and explore yet more planets, but the ocean\u2019s liquid is toxic and will kill you if you just dive in. So you note the coordinates and continue on your way, returning later\u2014sometimes much later\u2014when you\u2019ve upgraded your suit with the right protections. All of this represents a story that you\u2019ve authored all by yourself; and no one else can know precisely what it felt like to finally return and claim that specific prize.\n\nIt was apparent enough in Murray\u2019s live demo, in which he touched down on one of the game\u2019s quintillions of planets at random. That\u2019s something Hello has never done publicly, despite having had several opportunities during E3 and other big events. Murray doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll find, and that\u2019s a risky way to debut a game in front of such big crowds.\n\nEven in private, Murray admitted he was nervous as his ship breached the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Its surface was suffused with endless green, rolling hills, interrupted by towering black alien monoliths that dotted the landscape. Huge chunks of earth floated in the sky overhead, like clouds. Murray had never seen one like this before.\n\n\u201cThe weirdness of that never escapes me,\u201d he confessed.\n\nThere\u2019s some simple math at the heart of No Man\u2019s Sky\u2019s exploration, and what it means may turn some players off. It goes like this, as Murray describes it:\n\n\u201cNinety percent of the planets that you visit should be barren, because that\u2019s how it would be in our universe and anything else would feel fake. And then 10-percent of them should have some life, but that life 90-percent of the time should just be some grass and some shrubbery or whatever, you know, some insignificant life. But 10-percent of the time \u2014 10-percent of the 10-percent \u2014 it should be real life. But maybe just birds, fish, and things like that, smaller creatures, 90-percent of the time. And 10-percent of the time it should be something a bit more interesting, like four-legged creatures. But that four-legged creature 90-percent of the time should be super boring.\u201d\n\nDeath to the skybox One of the most revolutionary things about No Man\u2019s Sky is something that most people won\u2019t even pick up on. \u201cIt sounds ridiculous, but we\u2019ll probably be one of the first games without a skybox,\u201d Murray explained, referring to the 2D images of clouds and stars that hover over the majority of video game worlds. \u201cOnly a gamer knows what that means, you know? But it\u2019s significant because those stars, when I was flying through space, you can see those stars and they\u2019re real places [you can visit]. \u201dGamers have been asking for bigger environments, more options, better writing, prettier graphics, and a million other things for as long as there have been games. But based on what we\u2019ve seen of No Man\u2019s Sky it seems \u201cdeath to the skybox!\u201d is what we should have been chanting all along.\n\nThose are not great odds for players hoping to discover something incredible and not just another barren planet waiting to be strip-mined for resources. One can easily imagine databases, forums, and Reddit communities cataloguing this universe, planet by planet. Players collaborating online as pioneers, crowdsourcing the act of discovery, sticking a virtual bookmark anywhere there\u2019s something interesting to see. But that won\u2019t necessarily happen either, Murray explained, thanks again to the game\u2019s absurd size.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got quite a journey to go to a specific point,\u201d he said, meaning even if you know the coordinates of the space dinosaurs or some strange monument, you probably couldn\u2019t get there quickly. And by the time you do, another player may well have lasered those awesome beasts into extinction, or leveled those incredible ruins, because yes, that\u2019s possible too.\n\nIt sounds like a harsh environment, and it may be that some players come away from No Man\u2019s Sky having never discovered anything of note and wishing they hadn\u2019t wasted their time and money. But like the vast star field he\u2019s worked to create, Murray doesn\u2019t care. \u201cAs much as we can possibly manage, this needs to feel real, and true to what it is, which is a galaxy,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderstand all that and you can start to grasp just how unlikely it is you\u2019ll meet any other actual players. \u201cPeople always ask that, and like\u2026I\u2019m really hesitant because I just think if that\u2019s the experience that you\u2019re after, play a different game,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an MMO. Yes, other people are there, playing, but no. You could, and I think if that happens\u2014when it happens\u2014for people it will be a little bit like Journey, or like Dark Souls\u2014just a nice, full moment when you know that you\u2019re playing with other people. But I don\u2019t think we will even highlight it.\u201d\n\nNo Man\u2019s Sky may or may not have a story. That\u2019s for players to figure out. Murray questioned whether anyone really wants to know at this point, anyway.\n\n\u201cI think people think they want all the info about a game before it comes out but I don\u2019t think they actually know what\u2019s good for them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people go \u2018Yeah, but come on. Just give me\u2014\u2018 it\u2019s like, they want achievements, they want to unlock concept art, they want us to have headshots. Like, everyone would feel a lot better if we would just show that, and we\u2019re not going to show that because you don\u2019t do those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are key moments in the game. It\u2019s not necessarily a narrative, but I guess we have a kind of structure that a typical player might hit some key beats as they\u2019re going about,\u201d Murray admitted. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a final screen or anything like that, but there is the concept of getting toward the center of the galaxy. That\u2019s an aim that a lot of people will have, and that will be a significant moment for people. And we\u2019re not going to talk about what happens, but it\u2019s not the end of the game. There\u2019s definitely reasons why you\u2019d want to keep playing, but it will be a moment for a lot of people where they\u2019ll feel like \u2018I\u2019ve done it.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.ratio_4_3": "http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/diplo-480x360-c.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://icdn9.digitaltrends.com/image/diplo-50x50.png", "sailthru.author": "Michael Rougeau", "description": "The vast galaxy at play in No Man\u2019s Sky is a fertile landscape for players to explore, discover, and author their own stories, one new planet at a time.", "tags": "no man's sky", "og": {"site_name": "Digital Trends", "description": "The vast galaxy at play in No Man\u2019s Sky is a fertile landscape for players to explore, discover, and author their own stories, one new planet at a time.", "title": "Not even the guys who coded No Man\u2019s Sky know what will happen when they play", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/diplo-1200x630-c.png", "updated_time": "2015-03-19T09:33:15+00:00", "url": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/no-mans-sky-gives-players-small-chance-discover-something-incredible/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Digital Trends", "description": "The vast galaxy at play in No Man\u2019s Sky is a fertile landscape for players to explore, discover, and author their own stories, one new planet at a time.", "title": "Not even the guys who coded No Man\u2019s Sky know what will happen when they play", "creator": "@digitaltrends", "site": "@digitaltrends", "image3": "http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/diplo-720x720.png", "image2": "http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/glattrecsystem-720x720.png", "image1": "http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/alpinefly-720x720.png", "image0": "http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/becron5-720x720.png", "card": "gallery"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-10 00:01:12", "sailthru.title": "Not even the guys who coded No Man\u2019s Sky know what will happen when they play", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"app_id": 61377565444, "pages": 8522591132}, "sailthru.image.ratio_3_2": "http://icdn1.digitaltrends.com/image/diplo-600x400-c.png", "sailthru.tags": "Michael Rougeau, Gaming", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrendsftw", "section": "Gaming", "tag": "no man's sky", "published_time": "2015-01-10T00:01:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-19T09:33:15+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "The vast galaxy at play in No Man\u2019s Sky is a fertile landscape for players to explore, discover, and author their own stories, one new planet at a time.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://icdn8.digitaltrends.com/image/diplo-1920x1080.png", "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "no man's sky, space, game, video game,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a67\"", "article_summary": "But I don\u2019t think we will even highlight it.\u201dNo Man\u2019s Sky may or may not have a story.\nCause and effect mean something in No Man\u2019s Sky, and consequences are everywhere.\nBut based on what we\u2019ve seen of No Man\u2019s Sky it seems \u201cdeath to the skybox!\u201d is what we should have been chanting all along.\nNo Man\u2019s Sky is, first and foremost, a game of deep space exploration.\nMake no mistake: No Man\u2019s Sky is a video game."}
