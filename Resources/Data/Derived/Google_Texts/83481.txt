"I really think the nation-state's not relevant anymore in a digital age," says Jeffrey Tucker, publisher of Laissez Faire Books and the creator and CEO of Liberty.me, a "social network and online publishing platform for the liberty minded."

For nine dollars a month, participants of the website can access a library of libertarian classics, privately message members without interference from the National Security Agency, learn from professors teaching classes on everything from Bitcoin to firearm safety, and more.

"We are so fortunate in this generation to have access to tools our forebearers didn't have. We have the digital cloud. That's a place where we can migrate... a zone of freedom that unleashes creativity."

Tucker recently sat down with Reason TV's Nick Gillespie to discuss Liberty.me, how the site embraces "spontaneous order," and the benefits to providing both public and private spaces on the platform.
