Research papers will not be made public until the program, but a list of topics is available on the organization's website.\n\nResearcher Harold Pollack of the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration, will discuss trace data analysis of recovered crime guns in Chicago. Pollack also will present findings from a survey of Cook County gun offenders.\n\nMultiple shootings and deaths haunt Chicago, including two straight weekends in September when more than 50 people were shot. In August, more than 40 people were shot on four consecutive weekends.\n\nAccording to a Chicago Tribune tally, 2,399 people in Chicago were shot through Oct. 13.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel has said he is fed up with the gun violence. \"Enough is enough,\" he said last month after six people were killed and at least eight were wounded, including two toddlers.\n\nBlack aldermen, frustrated by violence in their wards, called for Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy to be fired. But last week Emanuel gave McCarthy a vote of confidence and defended the leadership of his police force.\n\nOther topics to be discussed at the conference include e-cigarettes, TV binge-watching, grocery store accessibility, climate change, breast-feeding, cancer research, immigration policies and the Affordable Care Act.
