A $10,000 top prize. Just a single winner.\n\nAnd $10,000 was tops five other times since April.\n\nThe winners even paid an extra buck for the Megaplier, the prize multiplier option.\n\nWithout the Megaplier, the top prize for any of these dates would have been $5,000.\n\nNot close to enough for a new car.\n\nIt's less than the lowest 50/50 prize at any Eagles game this season.\n\nAnd Mega Millions is played by millions of people in 44 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn New Jersey -- a fairly lottery-happy state -- no Mega Millions player won more than $1,000.\n\nSomething is screwy about Mega Millions' prize structure.\n\nNaturally, the enormous jackpots are extremely tough to win. Totally understandable. Winning a fortune, after all, is the dream of most Mega Millions players.\n\nThe next prize level, though, is also often missed, because the odds, frankly, are horrible.\n\nIn Mega Millions, the chances of winning $1 million are 1 in about 18 million.\n\nCompare that to Powerball: about 1 in a 5 million per $2 ticket, 1 in 10 million per dollar.\n\nThat helps explain why Powerball regularly produces millionaires -- and Mega Millions doesn't.\n\nIn the last six Mega Millions drawings -- since the last jackpot winner -- only one person has won more than $25,000.\n\nPowerball's last six drawings produced 16 winners of $1 million or $2 million. Not once was the top winner from the third tier.\n\nNot that Powerball's generous with third-tier prizes, either. The base prize is $10,000, which the Power Play can multiply as high as $50,000.\n\nYou might suspect the third prizes are lousy because every extra penny is funneled into big jackpots. After all, the bigger they get, the more lottery fever whips into a frenzy.\n\nNot entirely,\n\nA lot of money is funneled to the bottom of the prize chart, too.\n\nMore than one-third of the $2.5 million won Tuesday went into $1 prizes without the Megaplier, or $2 prizes with it.\n\nBut are those prizes -- or refunds?\n\nMany players probably give it right back by buying more tickets.\n\nOne in every 14.7 tickets wins a prize, Mega Millions pitches.\n\nTechnically true.\n\nBut only about 1 in 10,000 $1 tickets will win more than $5.\n\nIf the most you ever won in Mega Millions was $5, now you know why.\n\nContact staff writer Peter Mucha at 215-854-4342 or pmucha@phillynews.com.
