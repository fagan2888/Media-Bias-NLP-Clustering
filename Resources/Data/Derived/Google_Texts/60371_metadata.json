More than 20 other messages were already labeled \u201ctop secret\u201d and withheld entirely, bringing the overall classification level for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account to 6.8 percent, or about one out of every 14 messages she handled.\n\n\u201cOn more than 2,000 occasions, Hillary Clinton recklessly jeopardized our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts by using a secret, unsecure email server to send and receive classified material,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement accusing Mrs. Clinton of \u201ca clear attempt to skirt government transparency laws.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton declined to use an email tied to her department\u2019s official State.gov system and instead created an account on a server she maintained at her home in New York, under the domain name clintonemail.com.\n\nThat arrangement, which the department has since said was against its policy, meant many of her messages were not archived and searched as required by law in response to requests from Congress, subpoenas from courts or Freedom of Information Act requests from the public.\n\nAfter prodding by the congressional probe investigating the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, Mrs. Clinton in December 2014 turned back to the State Department about 32,000 messages she said she sent or received during her time in office and that she deemed to be public business. She declined to turn over another 30,000 or so messages she said were purely personal.\n\nOf the 32,000 messages she did produce, the National Archives says more than 1,000 of them are not related to government business, and they have been withheld.\n\nReleasing the others has been a major headache for the Obama administration, which missed court deadlines and refereed internal fights over whether, and how, to withhold information that the government now deems classified.\n\nThe State Department and the intelligence community reached an agreement Monday on one message, upgrading it from \u201ctop secret\u201d to merely \u201csecret\u201d after deciding the original assessment was not correct.\n\n\u201cThe information available to diplomats and the judgments they form do not necessarily need to be classified just because there are parallel intelligence sources,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\nThat\u2019s a small victory for Mrs. Clinton, who has argued that the Obama administration has gone overboard on classification. She has called for all of her messages to be released to the public.\n\nShe also says none of the messages she sent or received contained information marked classified at the time she handled the email.\n\nMany of the secret-level emails released Monday contain readouts of conversations other people had with foreign leaders. Several of the messages involved current Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who at the time was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and sent information from meetings he had with top foreign officials.\n\nMr. Kerry faced questions about the messages while testifying on Capitol Hill last week, saying he was unaware that he was emailing an account not tied to the official State.gov server.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it. I didn\u2019t know if she had an account, or what the department gave her at that point in time, or what she was operating with,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no knowledge.\u201d\n\nAlso among the \u201csecret\u201d emails released Monday is a document from Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Mrs. Clinton has tried to distance herself from during her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. The April 24, 2010, series of messages includes a long memo from a friend that Mr. Blumenthal forwarded detailing thoughts about Kyrgyzstan.\n\nAnother 2011 memo from Mr. Blumenthal to Mrs. Clinton concerning the strife in Libya may have even made its way to the White House \u2014 though without Mr. Blumenthal\u2019s fingerprints.\n\nMrs. Clinton, in forwarding the memo to top aide Jacob Sullivan, said: \u201cThis is informative. Should we pass on (unidentified) to WH +/or other agencies?\u201d\n\nMr. Blumenthal was so detested by the White House for his role in attacking Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential primary season that Mrs. Clinton was forbidden from hiring him at the State Department. He instead appears to have been an active secret informant for her.\n\nAnother secret message details the State Department\u2019s public relations strategy in handling a New York Times report on an Afghanistan reconstruction project in which U.S. money may have been sent to a Taliban ally to pay for security for the road project. According to the emails, The Times agreed to delay the story out of concern for harming national security. The part of the message deemed classified dealt with the FBI, which was alerted to suspected problems after The Times\u2019 inquiry.\n\nThe release of the last batch of emails Monday does not close the controversy over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account.\n\nJudicial Watch, a conservative public interest law firm, has asked a federal judge to order Mrs. Clinton to turn over her entire email account, including the 30,000 or so messages that she deemed private business.\n\nJudge Emmet G. Sullivan last week said he is \u201cinclined\u201d to agree with that request and in the meantime has granted Judicial Watch discovery in the case, meaning the group will be able to prod Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aides about who approved her account, how it was maintained and how she decided which messages to turn over to the government.\n\nIn addition to the nearly two dozen top-secret documents withheld in their entirety, the State Department declined to release 19 messages Mrs. Clinton exchanged with President Obama via her secret account.\n\nThe department also said it is withholding one other one-page message that, while not classified, contains information that a law enforcement agency does not want made public.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, I can\u2019t speak to the contents of it, as the decision has been made to deny in full, but as you guys well know, that is not uncommon when dealing with Freedom of Information Act requests,\u201d Mr. Kirby told reporters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The State Department on Monday deemed 23 more of former Secretary Hillary Clinton's emails \"secret,\" more than doubling the number of messages she sent or received on her special account that have now been given that high level of classification.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The State Department on Monday deemed 23 more of former Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u201csecret,\u201d more than doubling the number of messages she sent or received on her special account that have now been given that high level of classification.", "title": "Hillary Clinton \u2018secret\u2019 email count doubles as latest batch is released", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/29/hillary-clinton-secret-email-count-doubles-latest-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/29/HillaryClinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/29/HillaryClinton.jpg", "description": "The State Department on Monday deemed 23 more of former Secretary Hillary Clinton's emails \"secret,\" more than doubling the number of messages she sent or received on her special account that have now", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton \u2018secret\u2019 email count doubles as latest bat"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Clinton, Department Of State, United States Department Of State"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s a small victory for Mrs. Clinton, who has argued that the Obama administration has gone overboard on classification.\nMrs. Clinton, in forwarding the memo to top aide Jacob Sullivan, said: \u201cThis is informative.\n\u201cI had no knowledge.\u201dAlso among the \u201csecret\u201d emails released Monday is a document from Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Mrs. Clinton has tried to distance herself from during her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nIn addition to the nearly two dozen top-secret documents withheld in their entirety, the State Department declined to release 19 messages Mrs. Clinton exchanged with President Obama via her secret account.\nOf those messages, a total of 45 have been deemed to contain \u201csecret\u201d information and more than 2,000 have \u201cconfidential\u201d information \u2014 the lowest level of classification."}
