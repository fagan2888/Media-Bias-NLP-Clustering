Within this sample, 35 percent of providers are primary care providers, 7 percent pediatric providers, and 58 percent specialists.\n\nRelative to the U.S. as a whole, our clients consist of somewhat fewer solo practitioners and see slightly fewer Medicaid and uninsured patients. In other respects, our client base is reasonably representative of U.S. physicians. The physicians and other providers in the sample receive approximately 2.5 million visits per month.\n\nOver the course of the year, ACAView will introduce a total of 35 metrics to capture the impact of coverage expansion on various aspects of physician practice. Eight metrics focusing on new patient visits and prevalence of certain chronic conditions by payer class have been introduced to date. (New patients are defined as patients who have not visited a practice in the preceding two calendar years. A new patient is considered new for successive visits over the course of the year. For example, a patient who did not visit a practice between 2011 and 2012 is defined as new for the entirety of 2013.)\n\nNew Patient Volumes and Composition Largely Unchanged\n\nACAView will be a multiyear effort, but even since January 2014, we already have some interesting findings to report. First, although some commentators believed that the ACA would result in a flood of new patients to physician offices, we have not yet seen significant change in new patient volumes.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, physicians across specialties are receiving slightly fewer new patient visits (as a percent of total practice volume). The one exception is pediatric providers, who have seen a slight increase in the proportion of new patients.\n\nWe have analyzed new patient volumes based on whether a state has high or low participation in health insurance exchanges or whether a state did or did not expand Medicaid eligibility. None of these approaches identified an increase in new patient visits. We have not analyzed the reasons for the lack of new patient visits, but we offer several conjectures.\n\nFirst, some newly insured patients (for example those who were formerly uninsured and are now receiving Medicaid) may continue to receive care in emergency departments, even for non-emergent care needs, rather than in physicians\u2019 offices.\n\nSecond, it may yet take some time for newly insured individuals (such as the large number insured in March) to shop for physicians, schedule appointments, and be seen. Getting from coverage to an appointment may be particularly challenging for patients covered by plans offered through the health insurance exchanges that provide narrow networks; available providers may not have many available appointments.\n\nThird, practices in particular communities may simply lack capacity to see new patients. Finally, the lack of a change in new patient volumes in early 2014 may be partly attributable to severe weather in January and February in some parts of the country; transportation difficulties may have discouraged new patients especially with milder illnesses from seeking care.\n\nACA Accentuating the Medicaid Gap\n\nAlthough we have not seen an increase in the proportion of new patients that providers are seeing (or in the health status of new patients relative to last year), we have seen a shift in the proportion of Medicaid patients providers are seeing.\n\nAs originally envisioned, the ACA would have extended Medicaid coverage to everyone below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, regardless of previous Medicaid eligibility. The Supreme Court, however, ruled in June of 2012 that the provisions proposed in the ACA to enforce state compliance with Medicaid expansion were too coercive, and that states could choose not to implement Medicaid expansion.\n\nSince the Court\u2019s decision, 26 states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage. The split of states on this question has largely followed political party lines, with most blue states choosing expansion and most red states rejecting expansion.\n\nSince Medicaid expansion has gone into effect, the number of individuals receiving Medicaid has increased by 6 million, roughly a 10 percent increase in Medicaid enrollment overall. The increase in Medicaid expansion states is 15.3 percent, compared to 3.3 percent for non-Medicaid expansion states.\n\nThese enrollment figures are widening the gap (as measured by the proportion of Medicaid patients seen by physicians) between expansion states and non-expansion states. Figure 2 below shows the percentages of all visits for adults aged 18-64 to primary care practitioners (PCPs) and various specialty categories. The proportion of visits made by patients with Medicaid to PCPs, surgeons, and other specialists increased substantially in expansion states.\n\nIn these states, PCPs saw the proportion of Medicaid visits increase from 12.3 percent in December 2013 to 15.6 percent in May 2014. In non-expansion states, the same figures were 5.9 percent and 6.3 percent. The one exception is OB-GYN, where the gap was much narrower and has widened less.\n\nIn short, providers in Medicaid expansion states had been seeing substantially more Medicaid patients than physicians in non-expansion states even before implementation of the ACA. Since implementation, this gap has widened substantially as more Medicaid patients in expansion states are receiving care in medical practice settings while the proportion of Medicaid patients being seen in non-expansion states is relatively flat.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where the increase in Medicaid volumes in expansion states levels off, and then identify what types of new Medicaid patients physicians are seeing.\n\nWe will continue to monitor Medicaid utilization on a monthly basis and will report when we see changes.
