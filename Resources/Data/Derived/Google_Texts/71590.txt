The ability to change and the reliance on longstanding principles are just two of the reasons our country is the greatest country on Earth.

Neither one of these is even possible without freedom.

The millennials are correct; the ability to change is a skill necessary for the modern world. However, they will be deeply disappointed if they find out the freedoms that allow them to do that are being eroded.

We see longstanding principles come down daily. For example, rather than Congress making laws, we are relying on elite judges appointed merely for their ideology and how they are expected to rule.

A case in point: When Democrats were in charge of redistricting, there were some complaints by Republicans, but the districts were set up the way they wanted.

This time around though, liberal judges ruled that Republicans can’t be trusted to be fair. So we need an independent board.

What they really mean is, we need an independent board that can be manipulated to set up things the way we want them.

The Affordable Care Act is another case in point. Words are supposed to mean what they say. The law specifically stated that all the exchanges were to be set up by the states.

On a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the words didn’t mean what they said.

Why have a Congress if the real power brokers are four liberal justices and a moderate?

So what makes the United States the best country on Earth? It’s freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, freedom to believe or not believe something, freedom to go as far as your God-given talents will take you.

That these freedoms are under assault on a daily basis is proof positive that the country is great.

Many in the military have given the ultimate sacrifice for freedom we have in the United States. That is what makes the country great.
