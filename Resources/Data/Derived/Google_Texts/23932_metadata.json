The residents plan to appeal the decision in circuit court, their last chance to stop the business from opening.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim Willoughby, a wedding photographer who owns and lives on the property at 2387 Sol Legare Road, said that if he can\u2019t use the 3.25-acre tract for special events, he\u2019ll be forced to sell. Willoughby bought the scenic, waterfront property on King Flats Creek in July 2014 for $700,000 with the intention of also using it for a business. But he hadn\u2019t yet received the required special exception from the appeals board.\n\nHe applied for that in December, a move that prompted Charleston County Council to amend its zoning laws, said Daniel Pennick, the county\u2019s planning director. Special-events businesses no longer are allowed in residential communities like those along Sol Legare Road, so if Willoughby applied for a permit today, he wouldn\u2019t get one. But because Willoughby had filed his application before the change was made, his application was allowed to move through the process.\n\n\u2018Everybody knows everybody\u2019\n\nSome residents are worried about the problems a venue with amplified music that serves alcohol will bring to their historic community, where the all-black Massachusetts 54th regiment fought a Civil War battle and where the squat brick building that opened in the 1940s as a segregated school for black children now serves as a community center.\n\nIn addition to bringing traffic from cars and delivery trucks, the venue will bring a lot of noise, residents said. That will harm their quality of life and possibly drive down the value of their property, they said.\n\n\u201cThis has always been a residential neighborhood,\u201d said Jacqueline Singleton-Brown. \u201cEverybody knows everybody. We\u2019re all related to each other.\u201d\n\nBill \u201cCubby\u201d Wilder, who grew up in the community, said children and elderly people walk along Sol Legare Road because there are no sidewalks, and the additional traffic will be dangerous for them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of issues with this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe residents said they don\u2019t think appeals board members listened to their concerns when the body approved the permit by a 4-3 vote.\n\nThe board is a quasi-judicial group and its decisions stand on their own without County Council approval. But council members appoint people to the board.\n\nThe Sol Legare community is represented by County Council member Anna Johnson, who appointed Cheryl Cromwell to the board.\n\nCromwell didn\u2019t attend the April 13 meeting where the board approved the special exception.\n\nCromwell didn\u2019t respond to voice mail messages Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t respond to voice mail messages on her cellphone and county phone or emails Tuesday through Friday.\n\nBoard chairman Samuel McConnell, who voted in favor of the exception, said he did so because a report by county staff members indicated the application met the criteria that was in place at the time.\n\nA wedding business\n\nIn Willoughby\u2019s application for a permit, he said he wanted to hold up to 20 events per year, with about 100 to 150 people at a typical event. All events would be held on weekends between noon and 11 p.m. They would be outdoors, although he plans to convert an existing barn on the property into a pavilion.\n\nEvents must be catered because there are no kitchens on the property. And users are responsible for bringing in portable bathroom facilities, and taking away trash.\n\nAlthough there would be 65 parking spaces available, he expects most users to hire buses to transport their guests to and from events.\n\nWilloughby said he thinks neighborhood opposition to his business is \u201cled by a few very wealthy neighbors who seem to be intent on bullying us out of this property.\u201d\n\nHe plans to be considerate of his neighbors, he said. \u201cI have no doubt all of their concerns will be dissuaded with one event,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, he said, there are only 13 residences within a half-mile of his property.\n\nThe county planning director, however, said in a report that several residences fall within 300 feet of the property.\n\nAnd he thinks his business is consistent with the character of the area. He said there\u2019s a public boat landing at the end of Sol Legare Road, Backman Seafood about two miles away and three clubs or gathering places on Mosquito Beach, about a mile from his property.\n\nAnd if his business turns a profit, he plans to donate 10 percent to the Concerned Citizens of Sol Legare.\n\nDespite landing the board\u2019s approval last month, Willoughby said, he\u2019s still unsure his business actually will happen. \u201cI feel a bit like it\u2019s still up in the air.\u201d\n\nReach Diane Knich at 937-5491 or on Twitter at @dianeknich", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sol Legare community weighs legal action against wedding destination, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Bill", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Some residents say the Sol Legare community is so quiet they can hear the cows moo across the water on Johns Island, and they want it to stay that way.", "title": "Sol Legare community weighs legal action against wedding destination", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150510/150519980/sol-legare-community-weighs-legal-action-against-wedding-destination", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150510/PC16/150519980/AR/0/AR-150519980.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150510/PC16/150519980/AR/0/AR-150519980.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some residents say the Sol Legare community is so quiet they can hear the cows moo across the water on Johns Island, and they want it to stay that way.", "title": "Sol Legare community weighs legal action against wedding destination", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150510/PC16/150519980/AR/0/AR-150519980.jpg?201505102210", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150519980}}, "keywords": "Sol Legare community weighs legal action against wedding destination , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Bill", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-10T22:10:00Z", "author": "Diane Knich"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Some residents say the Sol Legare community is so quiet they can hear the cows moo across the water on Johns Island, and they want it to stay that way."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce63b\"", "article_summary": "The Sol Legare community is represented by County Council member Anna Johnson, who appointed Cheryl Cromwell to the board.\nAnd if his business turns a profit, he plans to donate 10 percent to the Concerned Citizens of Sol Legare.\nSome residents say the Sol Legare community is so quiet they can hear the cows moo across the water on Johns Island, and they want it to stay that way.\nSpecial-events businesses no longer are allowed in residential communities like those along Sol Legare Road, so if Willoughby applied for a permit today, he wouldn\u2019t get one.\nResidents living along Sol Legare Road on James Island are fighting a zoning exception that will allow a wedding and special events business to operate near here."}
