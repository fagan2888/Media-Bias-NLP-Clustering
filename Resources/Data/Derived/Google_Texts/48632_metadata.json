Others have refused to say how they would wield the federal bureaucracy against marijuana.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is one of the few potential candidates to take a firm stance, saying he would insist on following federal statutes that outlaw the drug.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can ignore federal law,\u201d Mr. Jindal told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, who asked whether the governor would \u201cbring the hammer\u201d down on pot stores in states with legalization laws. \u201cFederal law is still the law of the land. It still needs to be enforced.\u201d\n\nThe confusion stems from the conflict between federal law, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug on par with heroin and LSD, and states where pot has been legalized for medicinal use or, in a growing number of states, where it has been approved for recreational use.\n\nTwenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. Alaska, Oregon and the District also have followed in the footsteps of Colorado and Washington by allowing recreational use of the drug. Several other states, such as California, Maine, Arizona and Nevada, which hosts an early presidential nomination contest, are heading in a similar direction.\n\nMr. Obama and Congress have tried to grapple with the issue. Capitol Hill took a first step toward leniency last year by passing a spending bill prohibiting federal agents from targeting medical marijuana dispensaries for raids, though the criminal laws remain on the books.\n\nThe Obama administration has issued several memos laying out drug enforcement priorities that order agents to generally ignore states that are trying to legalize marijuana, saying federal law enforcement should focus on eight specific areas such as stopping the distribution of the drug to minors and fighting gangs and cartels that try to traffic in pot.\n\nThe president has said his actions on marijuana enforcement are similar to those he took on Obamacare and immigration, in which he claimed use of prosecutorial discretion to grant temporary amnesty to lawbreakers.\n\nThe administration\u2019s moves have drawn fire from Republicans who want to succeed Mr. Obama.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who announced his candidacy last month, has said it is the prerogative and right of states such as Colorado and Washington to legalize marijuana.\n\nBut the conservative firebrand also has accused Mr. Obama of setting a dangerous precedent by curtailing enforcement of federal laws in those states.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is concerned about liberty should be concerned about the notion that this president, over and over again, has asserted the right to pick and choose what laws to follow. That is fundamentally dangerous to the liberty of the people,\u201d Mr. Cruz said last year in an interview with Reason, a libertarian magazine. \u201cWhat rule of law means is that we are a nation of laws, not of men, that no man is above the law \u2014 especially not the president.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Cruz did not respond to a request seeking clarification on his stance, nor did representatives for former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nA representative for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie declined to comment.\n\nPaul Armentano, deputy director of the pro-legalization group NORML, said he suspects the Republican candidates are trapped between their own beliefs and those of primary voters.\n\n\u201cThese candidates no doubt understand that the majority of Americans support regulatory alternatives to prohibition and are trying to appeal to them while, at that same time, trying to avoid agitating their more socially conservative base,\u201d Mr. Armentano said. \u201cKnowing that marijuana legalization outpolled both presidential candidates in 2012, these GOP hopefuls arguably ought to be more concerned with positioning themselves to be on the right side of history rather than on trying to appease a vocal minority that is woefully out of touch with both changing public and scientific opinion.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush acknowledged in an interview last year that he is torn on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think that states ought to have a right to decide these things. I think the federal government\u2019s role in our lives is way too overreaching,\u201d Mr. Bush told the Miami Herald. \u201cBut having said that, if you\u2019re in Colorado and you can purchase marijuana openly, should people in Wyoming not be concerned about that? And I think there, maybe, the federal law needs to be looked at \u2014 interstate commerce.\u201d\n\nLucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, said her boss \u201cbelieves this is a decision for the states.\u201d Asked to clarify how Mr. Perry would use federal powers if he becomes president, Ms. Nashed gave the same answer.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida suggested he would use discretion in enforcing the law.\n\n\u201cSen. Rubio believes legalization of marijuana for recreational use is a bad idea,\u201d said Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon. \u201cOf course, states can make decisions about what laws they wish to apply within their own borders, but the federal government has its own interests to vigorously prosecute trafficking in illegal drugs, including marijuana.\u201d\n\nAshLee Strong, press secretary for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s Our American Revival political action committee, said: \u201cThere are currently federal laws on the books that must be enforced, but ultimately he believes the best place to handle this issue is in the states.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul has been the most outspoken supporter of legalization among the potential presidential field, calling for reduced penalties for marijuana offenses and taking a lead role in a bipartisan push to lift federal restrictions on medical marijuana.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican has cast Mr. Bush as a hypocrite for admitting marijuana use while a student but opposing a medical marijuana ballot initiative last year in Florida, which failed to pass.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential hopefuls are united in blasting President Obama for his chaotic enforcement of marijuana laws, but the unity quickly breaks down when they are asked how they would handle things if they were in the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republican presidential hopefuls are united in blasting President Obama for his chaotic enforcement of marijuana laws, but the unity quickly breaks down when they are asked how they would handle things if they were in the White House.", "title": "GOP hopefuls criticize Obama marijuana policy but hedge on their own", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/1/gop-hopefuls-criticize-obama-marijuana-policy-but-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/01/4_1_2015_ap6925835543268201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/01/4_1_2015_ap6925835543268201.jpg", "description": "Republican presidential hopefuls are united in blasting President Obama for his chaotic enforcement of marijuana laws, but the unity quickly breaks down when they are asked how they would handle thing", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP hopefuls criticize Obama marijuana policy but hedge on their own"}, "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "Some have sent mixed signals, saying state decisions should be respected while questioning how Mr. Obama has respected those decisions.\nThe administration\u2019s moves have drawn fire from Republicans who want to succeed Mr. Obama.\n\u201cFederal law is still the law of the land.\nMr. Obama and Congress have tried to grapple with the issue.\nBut the conservative firebrand also has accused Mr. Obama of setting a dangerous precedent by curtailing enforcement of federal laws in those states."}
