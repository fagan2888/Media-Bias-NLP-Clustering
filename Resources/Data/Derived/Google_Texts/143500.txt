Move over, Tesla bulls. Investors in China’s Hanergy Thin Film Power Group have outdone Tesla fans in their exuberance—and for more dubious reasons.

The Chinese solar-panel equipment maker’s Hong Kong shares have jumped 61% since Monday. With that, Hanergy has overtaken Tesla’s market capitalization, closing Thursday at $39 billion. That makes Hanergy the world’s most valuable clean energy-related company, not to mention bigger than 32 of the 50 companies in Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index.

The company said it didn’t know why the stock got supercharged this week, though it noted a couple of minor factors. Perhaps short sellers are exiting; they’d already been squeezed with the stock up 65% in 2015 before this week.

Whoever is buying the stock perhaps isn’t concerned that the company’s biggest customer is its unlisted parent, which hasn’t always paid Hanergy and whose own business is opaque. Or that in the first half of 2014 Hanergy delivered net-profit margins six times its closest peer’s, despite an overall glut rendering solar panels a commodity.

These questions cut to the core of Hanergy’s business. At least with Tesla, investors can plainly see the Model S cars on the streets.
