And remember that Newt Gingrich tried to undermine the constitutional separation of powers with a government shutdown more than 20 years ago.\n\nDespite writing that \u201cit is easy to sketch out a scenario in which [Obama] could be a great president,\u201d ahead of the 2008 election, Krugman had to remind his colleague that \u201cby David\u2019s definition Barack Obama is pretty conservative,\u201d citing Obamacare as an example of incremental rather than radical change:\n\nMy point is that if what you want is traditional conservatism, the only people with real influence with anything like that mindset are Democrats.
