Apparently a new book is coming out by Paul Martin, about American villains, includes a chapter on the odious man. Good.\n\nBut\u2013there may be other agendas afoot in Martin\u2019s writing about Davenport if the excerpt in Salon is a reliable indication. Indeed, a reader of the article would never guess that eugenics was primarily supported by political progressives who rejected human exceptionalism. From, \u201cHitler\u2019s Favorite American:\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s indisputable about the eugenics movement in this country is that it was driven by racial and class prejudice. At the dawn of the twentieth century, white Protestant Americans feared being overrun by immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, people who traditionally had large families. Groups such as the Race Betterment Foundation and the American Eugenics Society stoked those fears by suggesting that the superior traits of industrious Anglo-Saxons were being undermined by the lazy, degenerate masses showing up on their shores.\n\nMeaning Catholics. And there\u2019s no question that the era featured pronounced anti-Catholic bigotry, now, I\u2019m afraid, in resurgence around other social issues.\n\nThere\u2019s some truth to what Martin writes, but he is more than implying that there is a nexus between supporters of eugenics 100 years ago and the liberal stereotype today that religious and other conservatives are prejudiced and racist. Thus the excerpt concludes:\n\nAnd while we can celebrate the fact that the bigoted, immoral pseudoscience of eugenics has been consigned to history\u2019s junk heap, regrettably the white supremacist attitude that shaped much of Charles Davenport\u2019s career lives on in the beliefs of diehard social Darwinists\u2014an outlook as persistent as a noxious weed, a kudzu of the mind.\n\nWho are these \u201cwhite supremicists?\u201d Other than the rare crackpot and occasional KKK holdout, they mostly exist in the fervid imaginations of MSNBC commentators and such ilk who ubiquitously accuse Tea Party types, Paul Ryan fiscal conservatives, and opponents of Obamacare of secret racist motives.\n\nLet\u2019s get real: The Eugenics Movement was mostly a top/down phenomenon, driven into bigoted public policy tyranny by minions of the high academy, funded by liberal foundations like the Carnegie Institution for Science.\n\nMoreover it was primarily a politically progressive movement\u2013technocratic at heart and claiming the mantle of \u201cscience\u201d\u2013that presumed it possessed the wisdom to improve the human herd. All of this was based, in part\u2013as my Discovery Institute colleagues have pointed out repeatedly\u2013on a misapplication of Darwinian principles.\n\nIndeed, Martin could just as easily have said that Davenport was Margaret Sanger\u2019s favorite American. That he was Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s, and George Bernard Shaw\u2019s favorite American. That he was H.G. Wells\u2019 favorite American, and Emma Goldman\u2019s. Also, John Maynard Keynes and Oliver Wendell Holmes, of Buck v Bell infamy enthusiastically supported eugenics! The list of progressive eugenicists goes on and on.\n\nWith regard to \u201cwhite Protestants:\u201d Those who most supported eugenics were not primarily believers in orthodox concepts of Salvation and the sanctity of human life. Rather, the most enthusiastic Protestant eugenicists were liberal \u201dSocial Gospel\u201d types\u200b\u2013a historical fact documented splendidly in Preaching Eugenics by Christine Rosen. From my review in the Weekly Standard:\n\nThe Social Gospel movement, led mostly by Congregationalist and Unitarian ministers, grew rapidly in these years among mainline Protestant churches. The Social Gospel reconceived Christianity as being less about faith and salvation, and more about, as Rosen writes, \u201cushering in the Kingdom of God on earth through [social] reform and service.\u201d Many Social Gospel adherents viewed eugenics as God\u2019s plan to reconcile the truths of science with the Bible. Toward this end, Bible verses were reinterpreted and found to contain what had theretofore been secret eugenics messages. Thus, in one minister\u2019s sermon, Noah\u2019s flood was God\u2019s own eugenics policy for eliminating a human race that had degraded and become inferior. Others insisted that Christ\u2019s Parable of the Talents was actually about improving the population: In eugenics exegeses, \u201cWhoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him,\u201d took on a whole new meaning.\n\nToday\u2019s eugenicists are also primarily politically progressive academics\u2013such as Princeton\u2019s Peter Singer and Oxford\u2019s Julian Savulescu\u2013who reject human exceptionalism and the equal moral importance of all human life. Religious types who support the new eugenics, as the original version, tend to come from the most liberal Protestant denominations.\n\nToday\u2019s eugenics is not racist. But it is elitist. Progressives today tend to support \u201cnew eugenics\u201d policies and policy approaches; eugenic abortion, genetic enhancement/engineering, eugenic infanticide, euthanasia, and/or transhumanist \u201cpost human\u201d recreationism.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t conservatives who buy into pernicious neo eugenics agenda items. But not sanctity of life conservatives. And certainly not those who most liberal Salon readers consider to be on the wrong side of history in the pro-life/pro-choice culture wars.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Eugenics  Mostly Progressive, Not Conservative", "sailthru.author": "Wesley J.
