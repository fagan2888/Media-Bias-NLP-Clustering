The possible slaughter of its abbot and inhabitants? The desecration of the tomb and the remains of St. Elian?\n\nIf you are a newspaper reader in America, there is no chance that you heard about this event. On the other side of the Atlantic? Your odds were much, much better. Here are some details from The Express:\n\nISLAMIC STATE (ISIS) fighters have bulldozed a 1,600-year-old Christian monastery after abducting and reportedly slaughtering its inhabitants.\n\nThe twisted terror group today released a video showing its barbaric militants razing the ancient Mar Elian monastery to the ground, even digging up and desecrating the bones of a Christian saint. There were reports that fighters had also kidnapped the monastery's abbot, Father Jacques Mouraud and a church volunteer, Botros Hanna, who are both now feared dead.\n\nEarlier this month ISIS abducted up to 250 Christians from the monastery and its surrounding villages, many of whom were women and children.\n\nAnd more:\n\nIn the sick video the terrorists can be seen gleefully removing the remains of Saint Elian, after whom the monastery was named, from their ancient stone sarcophagus. The church is said to have been built on the spot where Saint Elian died after he was killed by his father, a Roman officer, for refusing to denounce his faith.\n\nIt was a popular pilgrim site with Christians throughout the Middle East and housed Roman frescos which were amongst the oldest paintings in the region.\n\nBBC covered the story as well, which is about as mainstream as coverage gets in Europe and around the world.\n\nAre American journalists, at this point, beginning to suffer from ISIS fatigue? Or are some ancient treasures simply more newsworthy than others?\n\nJust asking.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What is there to say about the never ending Islamic State horrors being \r\nreported out of Syria?
