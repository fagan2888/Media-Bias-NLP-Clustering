But here\u2019s an interesting new complaint \u2014 ObamaCare is fueling the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nEven more eye-opening is the source: Time Magazine, the same magazine that heralded ObamaCare when Democrats managed to get it through Congress without a single Republican vote as \u201cthe most sweeping piece of social legislation since the 1960s Great Society initiatives.\u201d\n\nTime senior writer Sean Gregory says that ObamaCare\u2019s patient satisfaction surveys are contributing to the growing problem of opioid abuse in the U.S. More than 60% of drug overdoses in 2014 were from a prescription opioid, and ERS treat more than 1,000 patients a day for misusing the drugs.\n\nWhat\u2019s the connection? The satisfaction survey asks questions about things like hospital cleanliness, noise levels and staff communication. But it also asks questions about pain management, including whether the hospital did \u201ceverything they could to help you with your pain.\u201d\n\nUnder ObamaCare, these patient satisfaction surveys, along with other quality measures, are tied to $1.5 billion in Medicare payments to hospitals, giving the hospitals a huge incentive to make sure they score well.\n\nThe problem, Gregory notes, comes from \u201ctying a patient\u2019s feelings about pain management to a hospital\u2019s bottom line,\u201d which \u201cto many physicians and lawmakers struggling to contain the nation\u2019s opioid crisis \u2026 is deeply \u00admisguided, if not downright dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to point out, \u201cIn a 2014 survey published in Patient Preference and Adherence, over 48% of doctors reported prescribing inappropriate narcotic pain medication because of patient-\u00adsatisfaction questions. One doctor wrote that drug seekers \u2018are well aware of the patient satisfaction scores and how they can use these threats and complaints to obtain narcotics.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnother study found that patients who gave higher ratings on satisfaction surveys tended to spend more on prescription drugs and have a higher mortality rate.\n\nThe problem has become big enough that Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has called on the Health and Human Services Department to investigate any connection between the ObamaCare survey and overprescribing narcotics. And four senators have sponsored a bill to de-link that Medicare money from the pain management questions.\n\nIn the meantime, add this to the growing pile of problems that ObamaCare has caused to a health care system that it was meant to improve.\n\nRELATED:\n\nPersonal Data At Risk In ObamaCare Exchanges, Audit Finds\n\nObamaCare Premiums Rose A Lot More Than HHS Wants You To Believe\n\nObamaCare\u2019s \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 Will Hit Chevy-Class Families Hardest, Study Finds", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of ObamaCare have lodged many complaints against the law.
