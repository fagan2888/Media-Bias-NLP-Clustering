In an interview with Face the Nation host John Dickerson on CBS, Clinton dismissed the allegation, saying political opponents unfamiliar with \u201ccommon practice\u201d in the State Department were using the email to create a false impression.\n\nRelated: Latest Clinton Email \u2018Smoking Gun\u2019 May Be All Smoke\n\nIn her role as secretary of state, she said, \u201c[L]ook, I need information. I had some points I had to make. And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture. But, oftentimes, there's a lot of information that isn't at all classified. So, whatever information can be appropriately transmitted unclassified often was. That's true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government.\u201d\n\nClinton noted that the email exchange was between her and aide Jake Sullivan, a State Department veteran and former National Security Adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, who has worked with her, on and off, since her 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cBut the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years. He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with. And he knew exactly what was and wasn't appropriate.\n\n\u201cAnd, in fact, as the State Department has said, there was no transmission of any classified information. So, it's another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall, as you said in the beginning of the program, to see what sticks. But there's no there there.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why the Benghazi Investigation Has Become a Political Sideshow\n\nIn fact, the Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual defines non-paper as, \u201cA written summary of a demarche or other verbal presentation to a foreign government. The non-paper should be drafted in the third person, and must not be directly attributable to the U.S. Government. It is prepared on plain paper (no letterhead or watermark). The heading or title, if any, is simply a statement of the issue or subject.
