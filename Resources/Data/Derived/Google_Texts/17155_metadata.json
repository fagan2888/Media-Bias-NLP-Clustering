Thanks for having me in your club,\u201d Thomas said, getting emotional as he remembered his late father. \u201cFrank Sr., I know you\u2019re watching. Without you, I know 100 percent I wouldn\u2019t be here in Cooperstown today. You always preached to me, \u2018You can be someone special if you really work at it.\u2019 I took that to heart, Pop.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I thank you for all the motherly love and support. I know it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d\n\nThe 46-year old Thomas, the first player elected to the Hall who spent more than half of his time as a designated hitter, batted .301 with 521 home runs and 1,704 RBIs in a 19-year career mostly with the Chicago White Sox. He\u2019s the only player in major league history to log seven straight seasons with a .300 average, 20 homers, 100 RBIs and 100 walks.\n\nEver the diplomat as a manager, Torre somehow managed to assuage the most demanding of owners in George Steinbrenner, maintaining his coolness amid all the Bronx craziness while keeping all those egos in check after taking over in 1996. The result: 10 division titles, six AL pennants and four World Series triumphs in 12 years as he helped restore the luster to baseball\u2019s most successful franchise and resurrected his own career after three firings.\n\nTorre, the only man to amass more than 2,000 hits (2,342) and win more than 2,000 games as a manager, was last to speak, and in closing delivered a familiar message.\n\n\u201cBaseball is a game of life. It\u2019s not perfect, but it feels like it is,\u201d said the 74-year-old Torre, who apologized afterward for forgetting to include the Steinbrenner family in his speech. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic of it. We are responsible for giving it the respect it deserves. Our sport is part of the American soul, and it\u2019s ours to borrow \u2014 just for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf all of us who love baseball and are doing our jobs, then those who get the game from us will be as proud to be a part of it as we were. And we are. This game is a gift, and I am humbled, very humbled, to accept its greatest honor.\u201d\n\nThe day was a reunion of sorts for the city of Atlanta. Glavine, Maddux and Cox were part of a remarkable run of success by the Braves. They won an unprecedented 14 straight division titles and made 15 playoff appearances, winning the city\u2019s lone major professional sports title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly humbled to stand here before you,\u201d Cox said. \u201cTo Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, and I have to mention the third member of the big three \u2014 John Smoltz \u2014 I can honestly say I would not be standing here if it weren\u2019t for you guys.\u201d\n\nSmoltz, part of the MLB Network telecast of the event and eligible for induction next year, flashed a smile in return for the compliment.\n\nGlavine was on the mound when the Braves won Game 6 to clinch the 1995 World Series, pitching one-hit ball over eight innings in a 1-0 victory over Cleveland. And the slender lefty was one of those rare athletes, drafted by the Braves and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.\n\n\u201cI had a difficult choice to make, and as a left-handed pitcher I thought that was the thing that would set me apart and make baseball the smartest decision,\u201d Glavine said. \u201cOf course, I always wondered what would have happened had I taken up hockey.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my mind, since I was drafted ahead of two Hall of Famers in Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull, that obviously means I would have been a Hall of Famer in hockey, too,\u201d Glavine chuckled as the crowd cheered. \u201cBut I\u2019m positive I made the right choice.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old Maddux went 355-227 with a career ERA of 3.16 in 23 seasons with the Braves, Cubs, Padres and Dodgers and ranks eighth on the career wins list. He won four straight Cy Young Awards in the 1990s and won 15 or more games for 17 straight seasons with his pinpoint control.\n\n\u201cI spent 12 years in Chicago, 11 in Atlanta, and both places are very special,\u201d Maddux said. \u201cWithout the experiences in both cities, I would not be standing here today.\u201d\n\nLa Russa, who ranks third in career victories as a manager with 2,728, behind only Connie Mack and John McGraw, was chosen manager of the year four times and won 12 division titles, six pennants and three World Series titles in stints with the White Sox, Oakland A\u2019s and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa spoke from the heart. There was no written speech.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable because I didn\u2019t make it as a player. Not even close,\u201d said La Russa, who made his big league debut as a teenage infielder with the 1963 Kansas City Athletics and appeared in just 132 games over six seasons, hitting .199 with no home runs. \u201cSince December, I have not been comfortable with it. There\u2019s no way to mention everybody, and that bothers me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom managing parts of two years in the minor leagues, after thinking about all the other young managers who paid a lot of dues in the minor leagues and I get a chance and then I go into the big leagues with three organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that equates to me is I\u2019m very, very fortunate. I\u2019ve never put my arms around the fact that being really lucky is a Hall of Fame credential.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frank Thomas, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux headline Hall of Fame class", "title": "Frank Thomas, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux headline Hall of Fame class", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/27/frank-thomas-tom-glavine-and-greg-maddux-headline-hall-of-fame-class/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727__hof-class20114p1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727__hof-class20114p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T20:33:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:00:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d51\"", "article_summary": "Glavine, Maddux and Cox were part of a remarkable run of success by the Braves.\nHe\u2019s the only player in major league history to log seven straight seasons with a .300 average, 20 homers, 100 RBIs and 100 walks.\nHe won four straight Cy Young Awards in the 1990s and won 15 or more games for 17 straight seasons with his pinpoint control.\nI\u2019ve never put my arms around the fact that being really lucky is a Hall of Fame credential.\u201d\nThey won an unprecedented 14 straight division titles and made 15 playoff appearances, winning the city\u2019s lone major professional sports title."}
