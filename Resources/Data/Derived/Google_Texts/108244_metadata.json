The reported assault against Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields reached new heights Friday when she filed battery charges against Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nLewandowski has been cited as the person who grabbed Fields\u2019 arm and tried to force her to the ground while she was trying to ask the billionaire magnate a question about affirmative action. Trump held a press conference in Jupiter, Florida last Tuesday following his wins in the Michigan and Mississippi primaries; he would later win the Hawaii caucuses.\n\nThe force with which Lewandowski reportedly grabbed Fields left her bruised. Washington Post reporter Ben Terris witnessed the event and added it to his piece about Trump\u2019s inner circle; Lewandowski refused to be interviewed after the incident.\n\nThere\u2019s been a bit of back and forth between the Trump and Breitbart camps. The Daily Beast reported that Lewandowski had told Breitbart\u2019s Washington political editor Matt Boyle that he did \u201cmanhandle\u201d Fields, not knowing she was with the publication. He thought she was just another \u201cadversarial member of the mainstream media.\u201d Yet, the Trump campaign later denied the incident ever occurred, even suggesting that Fields might be making this whole thing up. That certainly was the position the Donald took when asked about the incident by Katie at the end of CNN\u2019s debate on Thursday. The Trump campaign also released this email exchange between Lewandowski and Boyle showing that they never spoke to one another as alleged in the Daily Beast article.\n\nAs more twists and turns emerge, Breitbart News\u2019 CEO and President Larry Solov issued this statement yesterday:\n\nBreitbart News stands behind Michelle Fields. Even Donald Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson said Thursday that \"someone probably did grab her,\" i.e. Fields, though she claimed it could not have been Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Trump's suggestion that Fields made up the incident Tuesday evening contradicts the evidence, including her own injuries, an account from Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, and audio recorded at the scene\n\nAt the same time, on that very same day, a post from the publication seem to be questioning Fields and Terris\u2019 account of the incident. As for the Washington Post\u2019s Terris and The Daily Beast, they\u2019re standing by their report (via WaPo):\n\nFor his part, Terris isn\u2019t budging. \u201cI saw what I saw,\u201d said Terris in a brief chat with this blog. During the whole incident, says Terris, he had his \u201ceyes trained on Corey Lewandowski,\u201d because Terris was there to profile the campaign team with a focus on Lewandowski. Terris took strong issue with [Breitbart\u2019s Joel] Pollak\u2019s assertion that mistaken identity is the \u201clikeliest explanation\u201d based in part on Lewandowski\u2019s denials. \u201cBecause he denied it?\u201d asked Terris. \u201cThis is Breitbart.\u201d [\u2026] Daily Beast Editor in Chief John Avlon tells the Erik Wemple Blog, \u201cWe stand by our reporters and our reporting, unlike Breitbart.\u201d\n\nThe feud is becoming increasingly ugly. With the official statement from the Trump campaign questioning Fields, there\u2019s Lewandowski who took to Twitter to call her delusional as well. Yesterday afternoon Katie posted new C-SPAN video that shows Lewandowski apparently grabbing Fields; the Daily Beast\u2019s Andrew Kirell corroborated this as well.\n\nFields is now calling for the Lewandowski to apologize to her. On The Kelly File, she said that she was promised one in private conversations after the incident, though the campaign\u2019s actions post-arm grab suggest otherwise:\n\nI didn\u2019t want to do it. After this had happened, I called my editor, [Matthew Boyle]. I told him what had happened. I didn\u2019t want to file a police report. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it because, you know, I didn\u2019t want to be all over the press, and I certainly was worried about my job. What would happen if I went to the police? I told my editor, and he called Corey and he spoke to him, and Corey said that he did it. He did not deny it. He said that he didn\u2019t realize that I was a Breitbart reporter. Hope Hicks, who is Donald Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, asked for my cell phone number, and I was told that I was going to get an apology. So I waited on that. I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal \u2014 this wasn\u2019t going to be a big deal. They were going to apologize; we were going to move on. I never got that apology. Instead, yesterday, they released a statement calling me a liar. They have basically done a character assassination on me. They are linking to blogs with conspiracies about me. They\u2019re not telling the truth. There\u2019s videos, there\u2019s pictures, there\u2019s an eyewitness of a Washington Post reporter who is very credible. They seem to not understand that. Their statements continue to say there\u2019s no eyewitnesses, there\u2019s no pictures, there\u2019s no videos. They continue to lie.\n\nFull @kurtbardella statement on his decision to resign from Breitbart: pic.twitter.com/1HGFUpoXlS \u2014 Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) March 11, 2016\n\nTo make things more intriguing, Breitbart\u2019s spokesperson Kurt Bardella resigned yesterday afternoon (via HuffPo):\n\nIn Bardella's view, the violence on the campaign trail is getting out of hand and needs to be called out. \"There is this escalating pattern of behavior that's only happening at Donald Trump events. It's incredibly dangerous. His rhetoric is unmistakable and it is calculated and it is intentional,\" Bardella said. [\u2026] Asked why Breitbart seems to be siding with the Trump campaign over its reporter Michelle Fields, Bardella said he wasn't sure. \"I think there certainly appears to be conflicting agendas at play here. Your guess is as good as mine,\" he said. He added that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had not, as was previously reported, admitted to the assault. In a text message exchange with Breitbart's Matt Boyle, Lewandowski only said that he didn't know Fields was a Breitbart reporter and that he would look into the situation, according to Bardella.\n\nI asked Kurt Bardella if Breitbart will now call for Lewandowski's firing, response \"I'm the wrong person to ask about breitbart.\" He's out. \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 11, 2016\n\nBardella later said to CNN\u2019s Don Lemon that the way Breitbart has acted regarding this fiasco prompted him to head for the exit:\n\nCNN host @donlemon: \"Are you saying they are lying?\"\n\n\n\nEx-Breitbart spox @kurtbardella: \"Yes, I am.\" https://t.co/zS97oAkKUU \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) March 12, 2016\n\nFrankly, this is just a mess; it\u2019s a PR nightmare for any other organization or campaign. Sadly, as with many things Trump, it probably won\u2019t impact his poll numbers. In fact, he received a whole bunch of free press (yet again) over this event, which came at the expense of someone\u2019s rights being violated. Nevertheless, let\u2019s see which story gets more press; this ugly confrontation in Florida, or the billionaire\u2019s planned rally in Chicago that was shut down due to security concerns.\n\nNot believing the victim, witness, or audio, they demanded video evidence & a police complaint.\n\n\n\nThey now have both.\n\n\n\nThey don't care. \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) March 11, 2016\n\nREHASH: The audio and transcript of the incident.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things are getting ugly....05/26/2016 10:42:45AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Things are getting ugly...", "title": "Oh My: Breitbart Spokesperson Resigns, Michelle Fields Demands Apology From Trump Campaign Manager", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/12/oh-my-breitbart-spokesperson-resigns-michelle-fields-demands-apology-from-trump-campaign-n2132628", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/12/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Things are getting ugly...", "title": "Oh My: Breitbart Spokesperson Resigns, Michelle Fields Demands Apology From Trump Campaign Manager", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/12/oh-my-breitbart-spokesperson-resigns-michelle-fields-demands-apology-from-trump-campaign-n2132628", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/12/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oh My: Breitbart Spokesperson Resigns, Michelle Fields Demands Apology From Trump Campaign Manager , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ee7\"", "article_summary": "Even Donald Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson said Thursday that \"someone probably did grab her,\" i.e.\nWith the official statement from the Trump campaign questioning Fields, there\u2019s Lewandowski who took to Twitter to call her delusional as well.\n[\u2026] Asked why Breitbart seems to be siding with the Trump campaign over its reporter Michelle Fields, Bardella said he wasn't sure.\nThe reported assault against Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields reached new heights Friday when she filed battery charges against Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\nHe added that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had not, as was previously reported, admitted to the assault."}
