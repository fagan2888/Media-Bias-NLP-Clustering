A simple premise from Pro Publica: Let\u2019s take an ObamaCare \u201csob story\u201d from someone whose plan just got canceled and give it a thorough fact-checking to see if it\u2019s as bad as they say. Sure, their new coverage is expensive, but maybe they qualify for subsidies and don\u2019t even realize it. Sure, their new plan isn\u2019t that great, but maybe their old plan really was one of those \u201ccut-rate\u201d garbage plans that fly-by-night insurers have been peddling to people for years. They only think they\u2019re getting hosed.\n\nNope. After the fact check, it\u2019s clear: They got hosed.\n\nI asked Hammack to send me details of his current plan. It carried a $4,000 deductible per person, a $40 copay for doctor visits, a $150 emergency room visit fee and 30 percent coinsurance for hospital stays after the deductible. The out-of-pocket maximum was $5,600. This plan was ending, Kaiser\u2019s letters told them, because it did not meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cEverything is taken care of,\u201d the letters said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you need to do.\u201d The letters said the couple would be enrolled in new Kaiser plans that would cost nearly $1,300 for the two of them (more than $15,000 a year). And for that higher amount, what would they get? A higher deductible ($4,500), a higher out-of-pocket maximum ($6,350), higher hospital costs (40 percent of the cost) and possibly higher costs for doctor visits and drugs.\n\nAs I say, read to the end for the ominous conclusion, in which Hammack contemplates how he might qualify for subsidies. Not only was their old plan not cut-rate, it was \u201ccomprehensive\u201d just like all the new ObamaCare exchange plans are required to be. Turns out Hammack and his wife lead a healthy lifestyle and had qualified for a solid plan with low premiums for years because of it. That makes them the perfect target for O-Care: One of the key ways that coverage for people with preexisting conditions will be subsidized is by gouging healthy people with expensive new \u201ccomprehensive\u201d plans that they won\u2019t much use. Their premiums are almost pure net gain for insurers and that gain can be applied to offset the losses they\u2019re taking from the sick. In any redistributive scheme, there are winners and losers; these people, to their great surprise, ended up as losers for having committed the sin of taking good care of themselves for a long time. The spokesman for Kaiser Permanente, Hammack\u2019s former insurer, made no bones about that either in speaking to Pro Publica: \u201c[I]n sort of pure economic terms, they are people who benefited from the current system \u2026 Now that the market rules are changing, there will be different people who benefit and different people who don\u2019t.\u201d And like I said Monday, I don\u2019t think rate shock is even the biggest political landmine in all this. The big landmine will go off when people realize they\u2019re not only paying more, they\u2019re getting a smaller provider network in their new \u201ccomprehensive\u201d plan despite the added expense. Pro Publica doesn\u2019t get into that in its story about Hammack; I look forward to the sequel.\n\nI feel no schadenfreude about this, for what it\u2019s worth. A friend of mine who got caught up in Hopenchange fee-vah five years ago and who has since soured on O told me recently that she didn\u2019t know what to believe about health-care reform in 2008 because the subject is so fantastically complex. Even now, three years removed from ObamaCare\u2019s passage, I doubt you\u2019d find one voter in a hundred on the street who could give you a solid, fairly comprehensive five-minute explanation of how the law works. To a non-ideological voter, Obama seemed sincere and he had a plan endorsed by lots of lefty eggheads; only recently has the full extent of his willingness to lie to people\u2019s faces in the name of getting the bill passed in 2010 been revealed. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cthey should have known better\u201d but that\u2019s not how politics works for most people, I think. Most people find a pol whom they like and trust, who seems competent, and then support his/her schemes without getting too deep into the eye-crossingly complicated details. There are surely some righties who support Paul Ryan\u2019s entitlement reforms for the same reason. Doesn\u2019t excuse their poor judgment in supporting O, but back-breaking premiums is a steep price to pay for trusting a guy who assured them 8,000 times they\u2019d be able to keep their plan. No president would lie that brazenly. Right?\n\nUpdate: Speaking of Obama fans being \u201cmy-zeld,\u201d as Debbie Wasserman-Schultz would say:\n\nI just learned that I have to buy my insurance on the Maryland exchange (even tho i live in DC).
