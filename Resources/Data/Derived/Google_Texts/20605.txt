“She never came on the sets but she used to be in vanity van or car. I have met Aaradhya couple of times… She is a wonderful kid. She is very adorable,” Irrfan Khan said about Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s daughter.

Actor Irrfan Khan, who will be seen opposite Aishawarya Rai Bachchan in upcoming film “Jazbaa”, says his co-star’s daughter Aaradhya is an adorable child.

“She never came on the sets but she used to be in vanity van or car. I have met Aaradhya couple of times… She is a wonderful kid. She is very adorable,” Irrfan told PTI.

The National Award winning actor heaped praise on Aishwarya for striking a fine balance between her work commitments and motherhood.

“I admire how she (Aishwarya) was doing two jobs together it was beautiful to see that. It was a wonderful experience to see a mother giving shots, being into her character and then taking care of the baby.”

Aishwarya took a sabbatical from work after Aaradhya was born in 2011.

In “Jazbaa”, Irrfan also shares a romantic angle with the “Devdas” actress.

“When you are part of a story as an actor you react to the other person according to the demand of the character. She (Aishwarya) has a beauty that is mesmerising. She has an individuality and you admire that,” Irrfan said.

“She is a talented actress and I had great time working with her,” he said.

The 48-year-old actor said one of the reasons for him to do “Jazbaa” was Aishwarya.

“There were lot of reasons for me to do this film like the story, director (Sanjay Gupta), the one liners, it is an exciting thriller and my chemistry with Aishwarya which is unusual,” he added.

The “Paan Singh Tomar” actor will be seen delivering catchy one-liners in his trademark witty style.

The film also stars Shabana Azmi and is set to release on October 9.
