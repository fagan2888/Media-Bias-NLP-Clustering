So how do America\u2019s Bravest stay in shape with such little time? Answer: the firefighter\u2019s workout. A video uploaded by The New York Times shows exactly how members of the New Brunswick, N.J., fire department stay fit, improve their cardiovascular health, and ensure they are ready for whatever the job throws at them.\n\n\u201cPeople have this image of the firefighter running out of a burning building holding a baby in this super athletic state,\u201d Lieutenant Robert Piparo told The New York Times. \u201cBut we\u2019re just your everyday Americans who have chosen to do a very dangerous job. And we fall into the same pitfalls as everyone else. We work crazy schedules and our sleep cycles are very interrupted.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Piparo, 40 to 50 percent of firefighters who are killed in the line of duty die as the result of a heart attack. The firefighter\u2019s workout consists of functional fitness training, so don\u2019t expect any bicep curls or any other isolation exercises. Instead, they work on compound exercises using various items strewn around the firehouse. For example, Piparo and his team use two 1 \u00be inch fire hoses for battles ropes, the back bumper of a fire engine for box jumps, and 32 gallon foam pales for farmer\u2019s walks.\n\nThe New Brunswick fire department is just one of many firehouses participating in 555 Fitness, a charity run by firefighters from all over the country. The charity provides other firehouses with daily workout plans and free exercise equipment.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "firefighters, workout, how, they, stay, fit, while, saving, lives", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Members of the New Brunswick fire department are using the firefighter's workout to stay in shape, improve their cardiovascular health, and make sure they're ready to do their job.", "title": "Could You Complete A Firefighter's Workout?
