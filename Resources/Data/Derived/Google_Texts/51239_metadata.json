She hugs her doctor Courtney O'Rourke, DO, a hospitalist at UC San Diego Health and a member of one of the fastest growing specialties in medicine.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is one of the nation\u2019s estimated 44,000 practicing hospitalists, representing a new breed of primary care physician who spends his or her workdays taking care of hospitalized patients.\n\nBesides their dedication to the particular intricacies of inpatient care, hospitalists are hybrid physician-administrators, taking lead roles in enhancing the performance of hospitals and health care systems in the electronic, post-Affordable Care Act era.\n\nO'Rourke sits at a computer and begins preparing a discharge report for Calkins, summarizing the most salient aspects of the care she has received at Thornton Hospital and her condition. She will also prepare a \u201cmedication reconciliation\u201d that translates Calkins\u2019 medication regimen in the hospital into something doable and appropriate in an outpatient setting. These reports are included in the patient\u2019s electronic medical record or faxed to a primary care physician.\n\n\u201cCommunicating with doctors outside these walls is so important for establishing a continuum of care,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly important for individuals who may go back to a primary care physician with another health care system.\u201d\n\nA notice flashes on the computer screen: Calkins is flagged for being at high-risk for 30-day re-admission. The impossible-to-miss, brightly colored alert both explains and demonstrates the value of hospitalists to patient care.\n\nIn the 1990s, when there were fewer than 1,000 hospitalists in America, family doctors, internists and pediatricians bounced from clinic to hospital to see their patients. Today, more than 70 percent of U.S. hospitals have hospitalists on staff, according to a 2012 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe advent of hospitalists corrects two weaknesses of the old model. One is that \u201cthere is a shortage of primary care physician's throughout the American health care system,\u201d explained Deepak Asudani, MD, a hospitalist at UC San Diego Health. \u201cThe other is that it is impossible for a doctor to be two places at once. Hospitalists address the urgency of inpatient care and coordinate in-patient care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the quarterbacks for hospitalized patients from admission to discharge,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nAmong the most compelling reasons for embracing and expanding the hospitalists' role are studies that at least partially attribute declines in length of hospital stays, reductions in complications and improved patient outcomes to the rising prevalence of hospitalists.\n\nMany of the benefits of dedicated, in-patient primary care physicians are commonsensical and process-oriented and the result of a more coordinated, team-based approach to patient care. Case in point: the at-risk-for-readmission flag on Calkins\u2019 medical record. It is a cue for hospitalists to take a second look at things that can be done to reduce the patient\u2019s chances of needing an emergency readmission.\n\n\u201cIn Elizabeth\u2019s case, we need to ensure that she receives appropriate outpatient follow-up care and we should look at whether she has needs for home health care,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nAt UC San Diego Health, many of its 42 hospitalists also take leadership roles on committees that relate to topics as diverse as ethics, patient flow, medical education and informatics.\n\n\u201cWe are so involved in the day-to-day, minute-to-minute basics of hospital care that we see the deficiencies, inefficiencies and strengths and are able to help develop plans to fix, build on and improve quality-of-care,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nUC San Diego Health hospitalists are, for example, at the fore of developing strategies for reducing hospital infections with protocols as simple as mandatory hand-washing for health care professionals with every patient visit. \u201cThis is simple stuff, but it can make a huge difference in patient outcomes,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking to the success of the hospitalist model, medical specialties such as obstetrics, cardiology, pulmonology and neurology are adopting hospitalist sub-specialties.\n\n\u201cHospitalists are an important member of the care team and have become a vital part of the health care system,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe expect their role to continue to grow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "geo.placename": "San Diego", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/images/HealthSystem_310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "UC San Diego Health is the one place ranked number one in San Diego by U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals metro area rankings.", "creator": "@UCSDHealth", "image": "https://health.ucsd.edu/images/og-Default.png", "title": "UC Health - UC San Diego", "site": "@UCSDHealth", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#4A9FBC", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/images/HealthSystem_70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "UC San Diego Health is the one place ranked number one in San Diego by U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals metro area rankings.", "google-translate-customization": "34c18153a3840a19-c0e9473abf338896-g0db1ca1eacdf4878-f", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/images/HealthSystem_310.png", "p": {"domain_verify": "98c6903030b37cc99eeaf2ccbf44b85a"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/HealthSystem_144.png", "google-site-verification": "dVGoKlLW5yWr2UaQU9nwXH1WGOGU0bsCI3N7QjY2TFQ", "ORGANIZATION": "University of California, San Diego", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/images/HealthSystem_150.png", "og": {"site_name": "UC Health - UC San Diego", "image": "https://health.ucsd.edu/images/HealthSystem_310.png", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=1, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4"}, "article_summary": "Besides their dedication to the particular intricacies of inpatient care, hospitalists are hybrid physician-administrators, taking lead roles in enhancing the performance of hospitals and health care systems in the electronic, post-Affordable Care Act era.\n\u201cHospitalists are an important member of the care team and have become a vital part of the health care system,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\nMany of the benefits of dedicated, in-patient primary care physicians are commonsensical and process-oriented and the result of a more coordinated, team-based approach to patient care.\n\u201cIn Elizabeth\u2019s case, we need to ensure that she receives appropriate outpatient follow-up care and we should look at whether she has needs for home health care,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\nThe impossible-to-miss, brightly colored alert both explains and demonstrates the value of hospitalists to patient care."}
