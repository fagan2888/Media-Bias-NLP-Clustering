Every available Wichita police officer was called to a shooting early Saturday morning in a parking lot on the city's southeast side.

It happened around 2:30 a.m. during a private party at Club Casino Royals at 7007 East Harry, which is just east of Woodlawn.

Lt. Jason Stephens said at least 100 people, as many as 200, were at the scene when officers arrived. Officers found a 22-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the leg. He was taken by private vehicle to St. Joseph Hospital and was later taken to St. Francis. He is currently listed in serious but stable condition.

Police determined that partygoers had become upset when the festivities ended. As they were leaving, one man pulled a gun and began firing, Sgt. Ron Hunt said. A second man then fired back at the suspect. The man who was shot in the leg was a bystander, Hunt said.

"Another victim was in the same vehicle," Stephens said, "and fell out of the back of the pickup truck as they were leaving."

The 20-year-old woman was taken to a nearby hospital with minor head injuries. She is currently in stable condition.

Police say a 21-year-old man reported that his car had been damaged by the gunfire but he was not injured.

Police believe there could be other victims who haven't yet come forward. No arrests have been made.
