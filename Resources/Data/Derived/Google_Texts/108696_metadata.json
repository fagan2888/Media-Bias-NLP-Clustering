In one area, they ate all the leaves from blackberry stems but left the prickly bramble.\n\nIt is not the first time goats have been used as gasoline-free lawn-mowers. They have been used at Alphabet Inc's headquarters in Mountain View, California, and at the Historic Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.\n\nKeever did say that Salem is not ruling out using goats in the future for certain landscaping projects, such as maintaining steep hills.\n\n(Reporting by Eric M.
