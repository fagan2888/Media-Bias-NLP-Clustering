How about unlicensed strippers?\n\nEarlier this month, San Diego Police Department officers raided a Cheetahs strip club to bust any dancers who weren\u2019t properly permitted.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was a bank robbery or serial killer on the loose the way they had come in like that,\" said manager Rich Buonantony. \"The show of force, show of power was incredible.\"\n\nThe officers were so committed to the operation that they spent hours meticulously documenting all 30 dancers\u2019 paperwork and bodies (with cameras, of course!).\n\n\"They made me feel like I was a gang member pretty much and they wanted to document every single one of my tattoos,\" said stripper Katelynn Delorie.\n\nYes, this is the same San Diego where the mayor and police chief have recently resigned amid a variety of sex scandals. Mayor Bob \u201cFeel \u2018Em Up\u201d Filner\u2019s scandals were of his own making, while Chief William Lansdowne oversaw a department beset by scandals involving officers, such as Christopher Hays, who faces felony charges for groping and illegally detaining women and Anthony Arevalos who is serving time for his habit of demanding sexual favors from women he pulled over on suspicion of drunk driving.\n\nSo, while they\u2019re on the clock, maybe San Diego\u2019s finest could ignore the neighborhood strippers and keep their eyes on each other instead.\n\n1 minute, 45 seconds.\n\nFollow the show on Twitter (@DontCops) and submit your nominees for next month.\n\n\"Don't Cops Have Better Things to Do?\" is written and directed by Ted Balaker (@tedbalaker).
