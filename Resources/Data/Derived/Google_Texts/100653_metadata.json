Well, there should be a remake of that film entitled Clueless in Washington. But it wouldn\u2019t be romantic and it wouldn\u2019t be a comedy.\n\nThough there would be a laughable aspect to this film, because it would be about an editorial writer at the Washington Post trying to convince people to feel sorry for the IRS. Here\u2019s some of what Stephen Stromberg wrote on Wednesday.\n\nCongress has done some dumb things. One of the dumbest is the GOP\u2019s penny-wise-pound-foolish campaign to defund the Internal Revenue Service. \u2026its mindless tantrum against the IRS has produced for taxpayers: a tax season that was \u201cby far the worst in memory,\u201d according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an agency watchdog.\n\nBefore I share any more of the article, I should point out that the \u201cTaxpayer Advocate Service\u201d isn\u2019t a watchdog. It should be renamed the \u201cGovernment Advocate Service\u201d since its main goal is to increase the IRS\u2019s budget.\n\nBut I\u2019m digressing. Let\u2019s continue with Mr. Stromberg\u2019s love letter to tax collectors.\n\nThe underlying problem is that Congress has asked the IRS to do a lot more, such as administering a critical piece of Obamacare, but the GOP Congress won\u2019t give the agency the funding it needs to do its work. \u2026But good luck convincing Republicans to fix the IRS\u2019s entirely predictable and avoidable problems. Not when that would mean restraining the impulse to act on anti-tax orthodoxy, blind populist anger and scandal-mongering about the IRS mistreating conservatives. In fact, Republicans want to double down on their nonsense budgeting, proposing deep cuts to the IRS last month.\n\n\n\nOops, time for another correction.\n\nStromberg is cherry picking data to imply that the IRS budget has been savaged.\n\nIf you look at the long-run data, however, you\u2019ll see that the IRS now has almost twice as much money to run its operations as it did a few decades ago.\n\nAnd that\u2019s based on inflation-adjusted dollars, so we have a very fair apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nStromberg also wants us to sympathize with the bureaucrats because the tax code has been made more complex.\n\nThe underlying irrationality is the same: The IRS doesn\u2019t write the tax code or health-care law, but the agency must apply these policies and engage with people affected by them, so it is an easy scapegoat.\n\n\n\nPart of this passage is correct, and I\u2019ve specifically pointed out that the tax code is mind-numbingly complex and that politicians deserve an overwhelming share of the blame for this sorry state of affairs.\n\nThat being said, the IRS goes beyond the law to make the system worse, as we saw when it imposed a regulation that put foreign tax law above American tax law. And when it arbitrarily rewrote the Obamacare legislation to enable additional subsidies.\n\nIn other words, it deserves to be scapegoated.\n\nBut there\u2019s a bigger issue, one that Stromberg never even addresses. Why should we give more money to a bureaucracy that manages to find plenty of resources to do bad things?\n\nNever forget, after all, that this is the bureaucracy that \u2013 in an odious display of bias \u2013 interfered with the electoral process by targeting the President\u2019s opponents.\n\nAnd then awarded bonuses to itself for this corrupt behavior!\n\nEven more outrageous, the Washington Examiner reports today that the IRS still hasn\u2019t cleaned up its act.\n\nA series of new revelations Wednesday and Thursday put the Internal Revenue Service back under fire for its alleged efforts to curtail\u2026conservative nonprofits. \u2026the Government Accountability Office uncovered evidence that holes in the tax agency\u2019s procedure for selecting nonprofit groups to be audited could allow bias to seep into the process. \u2026lawmakers exposed the lack of safeguards that could prevent IRS officials from going after groups with which they disagreed. Meanwhile, the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch released documents Wednesday that suggested the IRS targeted the donors of certain tax-exempt organizations.\n\nDoes this sound like a bureaucracy that deserves more of our money?\n\nIf you\u2019re still not sure how to answer, consider the fact that the IRS also somehow has enough money in its budget to engage in the disgusting \u201casset forfeiture\u201d racket.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently opined on this scandal.\n\n\u2026a pair of new horror stories show why Americans dread any interaction with the vindictive tax man. Khalid Quran owns a small business in Greenville, North Carolina. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1997, opened a convenience store near a local airport, and worked long hours to give his four children more opportunity. After nearly two decades, Mr. Quran had saved $150,000 for retirement. Then in 2014 the IRS seized his bank account because he had made withdrawals that raised red flags under \u201cstructuring\u201d laws that require banks to report transactions of more than $10,000. Mr. Quran had made transactions below that limit.\n\nSo even though Mr. Quran did nothing illegal and even though it\u2019s legal to make deposits of less than $10,000, the IRS stole his money.\n\nJust like money was stolen from the Dehko family.\n\nHere\u2019s the other example from the WSJ.\n\nMaryland dairy farmer Randy Sowers\u2026had $62,936.04 seized from his bank account because of the pattern of his deposits, though the money was all legally earned. \u2026Mr. Sowers told his story to a local newspaper\u2026a lawyer for Mr. Sowers asked\u2026\u201cwhy he is being treated differently.\u201d Mr. Cassella replied that the other forfeiture target \u201cdid not give an interview to the press.\u201d So much for equal treatment under the law.\n\n\n\nYes, you read correctly. If you have the temerity to expose the IRS\u2019s reprehensible actions, the government will try to punish you more severely.\n\nEven though the only wrongdoing that ever happened was the IRS\u2019s confiscation of money in the first place!\n\nSo let\u2019s celebrate the fact that the IRS is being subjected to some modest but long-overdue belt-tightening.\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Stromberg\u2019s column, the IRS is not a praiseworthy organization. And many of the bureaucrats at the agency deserve our disdain.\n\nThe bottom line is that IRS budget cuts show that Republicans sometimes do the right thing.\n\nAnd maybe if there are continued cuts and the current tax system actually does become unenforceable at some point, maybe politicians could be convinced to replace the corrupt internal revenue code with a simple and fair flat tax.\n\nP.S. Clueless in Washington won\u2019t be the only remake out of DC if President Obama decides to go Hollywood after 2016. Indeed, I suspect his acting career would be more successful than mine.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Daniel Mitchell articles, Daniel J.
