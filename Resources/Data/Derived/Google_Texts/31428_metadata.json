AFP didn\u2019t feature that woman\u2019s story in any of its ads.\n\nIn a floor speech on Feb. 26, Reid lambasted brothers David and Charles Koch, owners of the oil and manufacturing company Koch Industries and major funders of the conservative Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) group founded by David Koch. AFP has been responsible for heavy advertising against the Affordable Care Act, and Reid made the hyperbolic claim that \u201call\u201d of the \u201chorror stories\u201d being told about the ACA \u201care untrue.\u201d He then cited two stories that he said were being promoted by Americans for Prosperity ads.\n\nReid, Feb. 26: Despite all that good news, there\u2019s plenty of horror stories being told. All of them are untrue, but they\u2019re being told all over America. The leukemia patient whose insurance policy was canceled, who would die without her medication. Mr. President, that\u2019s an ad being paid for by two billionaire brothers. It\u2019s absolutely false. Or the woman whose insurance policy went up $700 a month. Ads paid for around America by the multibillionaire Koch brothers. And the ad is false.\n\nReid went on to say that tales \u201cmade up from whole cloth\u201d were being told in AFP ads and Republican stump speeches. But the two stories he cited are about real people, though the anecdotes may be misleading or not the full story.\n\nThe first example, about a leukemia patient whose individual insurance policy was canceled, was in an AFP ad. The second, however, about \u201cthe woman whose insurance policy went up $700 a month,\u201d a story Reid said was in \u201cads paid for around America by the multibillionaire Koch brothers\u201d was not, in fact, in an AFP ad. Instead, it was in the Republican response, given by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nReid\u2019s spokesman told us that the senator decided to give his floor speech after reading a column by Paul Krugman of the New York Times that mentioned the story McMorris Rodgers had told of \u201cBette in Spokane.\u201d A local newspaper found that the congresswoman exaggerated Bette\u2019s plight.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers said Bette had sent her office a letter, saying \u201cher premiums were going up nearly $700 a month.\u201d The Spokesman-Review found the Bette in question, Bette Grenier, who said the $700 increase was one option given to her by her insurer, which was canceling the catastrophic plan she and her husband had purchased on the individual market. The increase would have been $648 per month, while another option would have been $500 more per month. Grenier also acknowledged that she could probably save more money on the state insurance exchange, but she told the newspaper, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go on that Obama website at all.\u201d\n\nThe Spokesman-Review reported that her catastrophic plan carried a $10,000 deductible but included four doctor visits without copays per year. Grenier told the paper the new options from her insurer had lower deductibles and broader coverage, but not the four free doctor visits. She and her husband had decided to go without insurance.\n\nSo, the brief anecdote in McMorris Rodger\u2019s speech didn\u2019t stand up to the facts. But the story wasn\u2019t in an ad paid for by the Koch brothers, as Reid claimed.\n\nNot from \u2018Whole Cloth\u2019 or \u2018Lies\u2019\n\n\n\nReid went on to say that Republicans were making up stories out of \u201cwhole cloth\u201d about individuals hurt by the Affordable Care Act. But neither of the anecdotes he cited were fabricated. In fact, we\u2019re not aware of a story about the impact of the ACA that was completely made up. As with many political claims, the stories that are false or misleading have some basis in fact. (See our piece on an Arizona man with leukemia who initially told a local TV news reporter he\u2019d have to pay $26,000 more to keep his doctor, but ended up keeping his doctor with a less expensive policy than he had before. His story was cited in an AFP ad.)\n\nAFP did run an ad in Louisiana that used paid actors opening mail to find their insurance policies had been canceled. But even then, while the people weren\u2019t real, the story of individual policies being canceled and replaced has been well documented.\n\nOn Feb. 26, Reid later backed down, a bit, from the \u201cwhole cloth\u201d claim, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t say that every one of the Koch brothers\u2019 ads are a lie, but I\u2019ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.\u201d\n\nStill, the other example Reid had given \u2014 about a leukemia patient whose insurance policy was canceled \u2014 wasn\u2019t \u201cabsolutely false,\u201d as he had claimed. And certainly not \u201ca lie.\u201d\n\nGlenn Kessler, our fact-checking colleague at the Washington Post, looked at the AFP ad featuring \u201cJulie\u2019s Story,\u201d about the leukemia patient and gave it two out of a possible four Pinocchios.\n\nIn the ad, Julie Boonstra from Michigan says: \u201cMy insurance was canceled because of Obamacare. Now, the out-of-pocket costs are so high, it\u2019s unaffordable. If I do not receive my medication, I will die.\u201d Kessler wrote: \u201cIn order to properly compare the old [insurance] plan and the new plan, there needs to be fuller disclosure of the costs and out-of-pocket maximums before claims that the new plan is \u2018unaffordable\u2019 can be accepted at face value.\u201d\n\nBoonstra bought her insurance on the individual market and received a letter saying the policy would be canceled because it didn\u2019t meet ACA requirements. But while Boonstra says her out-of-pocket costs are higher on a new plan offered by her insurer, her premiums were cut in half. She told the Detroit News that her new premium was $571 a month, down from $1,100.\n\nAs Kessler points out, that\u2019s a $529 a month savings, or $6,348 a year, nearly as much as the out-of-pocket maximum under the ACA for individuals, which is $6,350 a year. Boonstra\u2019s significant savings on her monthly premium may well make up for the higher out-of-pocket costs, which she says are \u201cunaffordable\u201d in the AFP ad.\n\nSo, \u201cwhole cloth,\u201d \u201clie\u201d and \u201cabsolutely false\u201d? No, the AFP ad doesn\u2019t reach that level of mendacity. \u201cNot the full story\u201d and \u201chighly questionable\u201d would be accurate descriptions. And Reid\u2019s second example he attributed to the Koch brothers had nothing to do with them.\n\nWe have found fault with other AFP ads on the Affordable Care Act. This year, we said one ad about the ACA lacked context and offered a slanted view of the law\u2019s impact. Another recycled an old, inaccurate claim about the law\u2019s effect on premiums. But Reid went way too far in his criticism of the group.\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson\n\nUpdate, March 11: The Detroit News reported on March 10 that Boonstra said her new policy was the Blue Cross Premier Gold health plan, which would save her at least $1,200 a year, even if her out-of-pocket expenses reached the plan\u2019s maximum of $5,100. In light of that information, the Washington Post\u2019s Kessler downgraded his rating to three out of four Pinocchios.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9fe\"", "article_summary": "The first example, about a leukemia patient whose individual insurance policy was canceled, was in an AFP ad.\nBoonstra\u2019s significant savings on her monthly premium may well make up for the higher out-of-pocket costs, which she says are \u201cunaffordable\u201d in the AFP ad.\nReid went on to say that tales \u201cmade up from whole cloth\u201d were being told in AFP ads and Republican stump speeches.\nNo, the AFP ad doesn\u2019t reach that level of mendacity.\nHis story was cited in an AFP ad.)"}
