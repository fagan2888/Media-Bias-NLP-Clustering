It\u2019s now known as the South Dakota Innovation Lab, a statewide STEM professional development program that has so far provided 8,300 students with access to quality education that meets them where they are and prepares them for the modern economy.\u201d\n\nThe SD Innovation Lab is a collaborative effort of the MidCentral Educational Cooperative and Sanford Research. Jill Weimer, associate scientist at Sanford Children\u2019s Health Research Center and assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Sanford School of Medicine of the University of South Dakota, said the program began about three years ago in response to the insight that rural education in South Dakota did not fit into the standard education model coming out of urban settings.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that we needed to do something new and unique to make sure our kids met the workforce demands of our state,\u201d she said, noting that Sanford Research is the largest employer in South Dakota. \u201cWe realized we needed to be recruiting our talent pool locally for our research labs, and to do that we needed to be making more effort to get students trained in science and get them going down career paths in science.\u201d\n\nWeimer and her colleagues also recognized that trying to interest kids in the sciences when they reached high school was not sufficient, so the SD Innovation Lab also focuses its efforts on elementary and middle schools and is currently working in three schools on South Dakota reservations, with four or five more expected to get involved this year.\n\nKathy Rindels, a language arts teacher at the tribal Crow Creek Middle School, is participating in the program for the second year. This summer she went out to Rapid City, where she worked with Gear-Up, a U.S. Department of Education pre-college enrichment program for American Indian students. Teachers participated with high school students in hands-on science projects and then met as a group to talk about how to implement similar teaching approaches in their classrooms.\n\nRindels explains how that works: \u201cWhen I was in Rapid City in June I did a problem-based lesson on water quality. So this year, we\u2019ll go to the [Big Bend] dam in Fort Thompson. We\u2019ll test the water there and we\u2019ll test the water here at the school and we\u2019ll see what the differences are in the nitrogen levels and the pH. And then we\u2019ll write about it. That\u2019s how I can pull in my science. Then I\u2019ll pull in my social studies and language arts by having the students write a research paper.\u201d\n\nWeimer stresses that in addition to promoting hand-on learning experiences, the SDIL focuses on learning that addresses community needs and concerns.\n\nKristen Tucker, a middle school reading, geography and American history teacher at the Yankton Sioux Tribe\u2019s Marty Indian School, said, \u201cProblem-based learning is a great strategy for Native American students, in fact, for all students. They enjoy doing the research and having a product to display at the end. They have a sense of accomplishment in seeing where their learning has taken them.\u201d\n\nOne project she did last year focused on the organization, structure and purpose of the Oceti-shakowin, the confederation of the seven nations Bdew\u00e1ka\u014bthu\u014bwa\u014b (Mdewakanton), Wa\u021fp\u00e9thu\u014bwa\u014b (Wahpeton), Wa\u021fp\u00e9khute (Wahpekute), Sis\u00edthu\u014bwa\u014b (Sisseton), the Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014b (Yankton), Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014bna (Yanktonai), and the Th\u00edt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b (Teton or Lakota). Her students came \u201cto understand they were part of the confederation and what that means. We\u2019ve done mapping and counting of acres in terms of historical and today\u2019s reservations and connected South Dakota reservations with tribes of the Oceti-shakowin.\u201d The goal is to integrate cultural activities with problem-based learning.\n\nTucker is a strong advocate for problem-based learning and the SDIL. Last year her seventh graders went to the lab and participated in a project involving DNA. \u201cThe experience had a huge impact on their learning,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cThe lab is a great resource for any classroom to go and visit. The SDIL helps pay for travel to Sioux Falls and covers substitute teachers for the day and lunches, as well as all the expenses for the projects and activities in the lab.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of great education experiences out there, said Tucker, but limited resources can be a problem. \u201cThe lab takes funding out of the equation for smaller schools,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When your science education program figures in remarks made by a former U.S. president, folks pay attention\u2014he recognized the PAST Foundation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/22/bill-clinton-gives-nod-american-indian-stem-program-156484", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lower-brule-middle-school-orchard.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Bill Clinton Gives Nod to American Indian STEM Program"}, "abstract": "When your science education program figures in remarks made by a former U.S. president, folks pay attention\u2014he recognized the PAST Foundation.", "dc": {"title": "Bill Clinton Gives Nod to American Indian STEM Program"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/22/bill-clinton-gives-nod-american-indian-stem-program-156484", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "President Bill Clinton, Native American Education, Native American students, STEM, South Dakota Innovation Lab, PAST Foundation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-22T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Bill Clinton Gives Nod to American Indian STEM Program"}, "article_summary": "When your science education program figures in remarks made by a former U.S. president, folks pay attention.\nThis summer she went out to Rapid City, where she worked with Gear-Up, a U.S. Department of Education pre-college enrichment program for American Indian students.\nTeachers participated with high school students in hands-on science projects and then met as a group to talk about how to implement similar teaching approaches in their classrooms.\nKathy Rindels, a language arts teacher at the tribal Crow Creek Middle School, is participating in the program for the second year.\nKristen Tucker, a middle school reading, geography and American history teacher at the Yankton Sioux Tribe\u2019s Marty Indian School, said, \u201cProblem-based learning is a great strategy for Native American students, in fact, for all students."}
