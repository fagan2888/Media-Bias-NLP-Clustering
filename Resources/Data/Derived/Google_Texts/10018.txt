Jenny Lewis, indie-darling of Rilo Kiley and Postal Service fame, is set to release her first solo album in six years: “The Voyager,” out on July 29. And today she shared a video for the new song, “Just One of the Guys.”

The video stars Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway, along with actresses Kristen Stewart and Brie Larson dressed in drag: complete with track suits, trucker hats and sleazy mustaches.

Jenny Lewis’ musical career has wound through the starkly honest lyrics of Rilo Kiley, the dreamlike tunes of Postal Service, the folk-song feel of her first solo album with the Watson Twins, and of course the band Jenny and Johnny, a collaboration with her longtime boyfriend, Johnathan Rice. She spoke to Salon about the latest album and her past work. Watch the video below:
