We are concerned, however, about troubling reports detailing potential security gaps in TSA's PreCheck screening,\u201d Sens.

Passengers who were moved over to the expedited security are allowed to keep their shoes and belts on, but TSA officials said they are still checked for explosive devices.\n\nThe agency has said it has cut back on the free trials as the PreCheck program has become more popular, but the senators said they still had questions about previous recipients of the expedited screening.\n\n\u201cAlthough all passengers are now vetted through the Secure Flight program upon making a flight reservation, our understanding is that expedited airport screening available through PreCheck lanes is intended for low-risk passengers,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cWhen TSA piloted PreCheck in October 2011, 1.5 million frequent flyers were invited to participate, but the DHS OIG has pointed out that background screenings were not performed at that time.\u201d\n\nTSA officials have defended the expedited screening programs, which are part of a broad series of \u201crisk-based initiatives\u201d that have been touted as a sea change in U.S. airport security because they direct all airport security officials to focus on passengers who are most likely to pose threats to flights.\n\n\u201cTSA continues to enhance its layered security approach through state-of-the-art technologies, improved passenger identification techniques and trusted traveler programs, and best practices to strengthen transportation security across all modes of transportation,\u201d the agency said in a statement that was provided to The Hill after the watchdog report was released.\n\n\u201cAll passengers, including those with TSA PreCheck on boarding passes, are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement continued. \u201cTogether, these layers provide enhanced security and a stronger, more protected transportation system for the traveling public.\u201d\n\nThune and Nelson sent TSA\u2019s Carraway a list of six questions about the expedited screenings they said must be answered by April 15 because \u201cthe safety of the traveling public and security of our aviation system are critical.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A convicted felon was granted expedited screening in 2014.", "description": "A convicted felon was granted expedited screening in 2014.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A convicted felon was granted expedited screening in 2014.", "title": "Senators: TSA clearing felon 'unacceptable'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/237091-senators-tsa-clearing-felon-unacceptable", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/tsa_032709getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-26T13:57:57-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-26T13:57-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/237091-senators-tsa-clearing-felon-unacceptable", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-26T13:50-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Transportation Security Administration, TSA PreCheck, Managed Inclusion, Airport security,John Thune, Bill Nelson,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-26T13:50:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T13:57:57-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/237091-senators-tsa-clearing-felon-unacceptable", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A convicted felon was granted expedited screening in 2014.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senators: TSA clearing felon 'unacceptable'"}, "dcterms.title": "Senators: TSA clearing felon 'unacceptable'"}, "article_summary": "A bipartisan pair of senators said Thursday it is \"unacceptable\" that Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials approved a convicted felon for expedited airport screening last year.\n\u201cTSA PreCheck was designed to employ risk-based security (RBS) screening to make more efficient use of TSA's resources and improve passenger security.\nThe Department of Homeland Security's inspector general reported last week that a former member of a domestic terrorist organization was approved by the TSA for expedited airport security in June 2014.\nWe are concerned, however, about troubling reports detailing potential security gaps in TSA's PreCheck screening,\u201d Sens.\nJohn Thune John ThuneSelf-driving cars: The next great leap in automotive safety Overnight Tech: Senate panel poised to advance email privacy bill Senators to House: FAA reauthorization would enhance airport security MORE (R-S.D.)"}
