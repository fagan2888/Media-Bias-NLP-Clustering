Few will get anything like the average $172,860 Wall Street bankers can expect in their stockings. But a holiday bonus is still an opportunity to reduce debt, pad savings and otherwise do the right financial thing.\n\nAlternatively, you could do the wrong thing.\n\nMaking a mistake with a year-end bonus is just as easy as making a smart move, warns Joe Roseman, a financial planner in Charlotte, N.C. The first thing you should not do with your bonuses is spend it all. \u201cDon\u2019t blow it on Christmas,\u201d Roseman says.\n\nThe second thing you should not do is use it for a down payment on a new car. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to have the payments next year,\u201d Roseman points out.\n\nRelated: Americans Now Owe $1 Trillion in Car Loans\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay extra on your mortgage,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou are taking away your tax deduction.\u201d While paying down a mortgage will save future interest, at today\u2019s low mortgage interest rates that savings is modest, and the benefit is further reduced by the tax deduction.\n\nFinally, Roseman adds, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t count on a bonus every year.\u201d By that, he means don\u2019t spend next year\u2019s year-end bonus on next year\u2019s summer vacation. Many employers pay bonuses when times are good and then cut back or eliminate them if business contracts. If you charge a vacation to a credit card thinking you\u2019ll pay it off with your bonus, you could find yourself in a high-interest hole next New Year\u2019s.\n\nSo what should you do with it? A really smart move is to sink at least some of it into a retirement savings account, suggests Scott A. Stratton, a financial planner in Dallas. \u201cIf someone 25 years old took $5,000 of their bonus and invested it until they were 65 and earned 8%, they\u2019d end up with $108,622,\u201d Stratton notes.\n\nThe younger you are, the smarter it is. For instance, if a 35-year-old socked away the same $5,000 bonus until age 65, also earning 8%, the ending balance would total just $50,313, according to the Security Exchange Commission's calculator at Investor.gov. \u201cYou\u2019d end up with half as much just by waiting ten years,\u201d Stratton says.\n\nRelated: The Good and Bad of Obama\u2019s New myRA Retirement Savings Plan\n\nWhile getting started on retirement saving is important, it is not only important financial use for a year-end bonus. Because the compounding effect of interest you are paying is just as powerful as interest you are earning, consider paying off all or part of any debts that charge steep interest rates.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re carrying a balance on any credit cards, that\u2019s got to be a high priority,\u201d Stratton says. \u201cAnd a lot of people want to look at paying down their student loans, especially those that are higher interest.\u201d\n\nNext after that is an emergency fund. \u201cYou need six to nine months of living expenses set aside,\u201d Stratton specifies. If you have trouble getting traction on an emergency fund, a year-end bonus can help get you started.\n\nThe final thing you should consider doing with your year-end bonus is spending part -- not all -- of it on something that isn\u2019t necessarily financially whip-smart. Say, a nice vacation, or a piece of jewelry. How much? Roseman suggests 25%, but it depends on the size of the bonus.\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Book the Best All-Inclusive Vacation\n\nBut whatever you do or don\u2019t do with your year-end bonus, remember to treat yourself to a little extravagance. \u201cEverybody, when they get a pile of money, deserves to spend it on something they\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Roseman says.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in MainStreet.
