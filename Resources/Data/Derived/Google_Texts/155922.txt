The body of a 17-year-old boy was recovered from Green Mountain Reservoir late Saturday night.

Lake Dillon Fire Rescue says the boy reportedly chased a ball into the water from near the Willow Springs campground at the northern end of the reservoir. Shortly after, he began struggling in the water and went under about 2 p.m.

Lake Dillon firefighters, Summit County Sheriff’s officers, the Summit County Water Rescue Team, Summit County Ambulance, Grand County Sheriff’s officers and Grand County EMS helped in the search.

His body was recovered, but his name has not been released.
