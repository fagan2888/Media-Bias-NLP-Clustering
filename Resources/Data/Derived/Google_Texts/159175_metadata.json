It was packing maximum sustained winds of 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour and gusts of 170 kph (106 mph), considerably weaker from its peak power but still a potentially deadly storm, according to forecasters.\n\nThe typhoon was moving slowly, which means more rainfall and a risk of landslides and flash floods.\n\nTraumatized by Typhoon Haiyan\u2019s massive death and destruction last year in the central region that\u2019s being partly whipped by Hagupit (pronounced HA\u2019-goo-pit), more than 650,000 people readily fled to about 1,000 emergency shelters and safer grounds. The government, backed by the 120,000-strong military, launched massive preparations to attain a zero-casualty target.\n\nRhea Estuna, a 29-year-old mother of one, fled to central Tacloban city\u2019s evacuation center as early as Thursday and waited in fear as Hagupit\u2019s wind and rains lashed the school, where she and her family sought refuge. When she peered outside Sunday, she said she saw a starkly different aftermath compared to the horror of Haiyan\u2019s aftermath.\n\n\u201cThere were no bodies scattered on the road, no big mounds of debris,\u201d Estuna told The Associated Press by cellphone. \u201cThanks to God this typhoon wasn\u2019t as violent.\u201d\n\nHaiyan\u2019s tsunami-like storm surges and killer winds left thousands of people dead and leveled entire villages, most of them in and around Tacloban.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No major damage as Philippine storm weakens", "title": "No major damage as Philippine storm weakens", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "No major damage as Philippine storm weakens", "title": "No major damage as Philippine storm weakens", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/no_major_damage_as_philippine_storm_weakens/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/aptopix-philippines-typhoon.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No major damage as Philippine storm weakens", "title": "No major damage as Philippine storm weakens", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/aptopix-philippines-typhoon.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Teresa Cerojano", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThanks to God this typhoon wasn\u2019t as violent.\u201dHaiyan\u2019s tsunami-like storm surges and killer winds left thousands of people dead and leveled entire villages, most of them in and around Tacloban.\nRhea Estuna, a 29-year-old mother of one, fled to central Tacloban city\u2019s evacuation center as early as Thursday and waited in fear as Hagupit\u2019s wind and rains lashed the school, where she and her family sought refuge.\n\u201cThere were no bodies scattered on the road, no big mounds of debris,\u201d Estuna told The Associated Press by cellphone.\nWhen she peered outside Sunday, she said she saw a starkly different aftermath compared to the horror of Haiyan\u2019s aftermath.\nThe typhoon was moving slowly, which means more rainfall and a risk of landslides and flash floods."}
