Editor, Gazette-Journal:

The Centers for Disease Control states that that, after heart failure and cancer, medical mistakes represent the third leading cause of death in America. A sobering statistic for a society as technologically advanced as ours. That’s over 200,000 people a year.

The World Health Organization ranks our health care system as #1 in costliness; but only 31st in quality; 40th in life expectancy and 169th in infant mortality. We pay more for drugs, made here in the United States, than they do in most other countries because of protectionist policies to protect drug company profits.

With the current political cry of “Make America Great Again” ringing in our ears, health care is a good place to start. Hillary made a valiant try in the Clinton era, and President Obama went way further and enacted the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, as happens with so many good plans, implementation suffered inattention, resulting in a system with a lot of faults.

Every Republican presidential contender has echoed the cry “Repeal Obamacare”—none has proposed an alternative beyond returning to the status quo, which has proven to be inadequate. Our founding fathers recognized the rights of the people to include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and recognized the role of government to ensure these rights. Certainly none is possible without good health.

The idea that a “journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” certainly applies here. Obamacare is a first step, and provides a basis for iterative improvement to achieve a system that is #1. The fact that there are 30 systems out there that are judged superior to ours should provide ample practical experience on which to draw; and the Fed provides the example of an extra-political control agency on which to model a health care agency.

May all the (remaining) presidential candidates pledge to make our health care system great again.
