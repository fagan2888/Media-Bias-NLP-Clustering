This is an excellent idea.\n\nBill Maher\u2019s liberal fan base has a new reason to cheer (and tune in): this season, he\u2019s using his show\u2019s considerable leverage to flip a congressional district. \u201cThere are 435 districts,\u201d Real Time executive producer Scott Carter explains. \u201cMost have incumbents running for re-election. We think our fans can help us narrow down the field of villains, hucksters, and boobs. But, in the end, the choice will be Bill\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSpoiler alert: The crosshairs probably aren\u2019t going to land on a Democrat. That\u2019s got conservatives predictably up in arms. Sure, the mockery-fest to come might be painful. It might also be unfair. It could even be occasionally stupid. But in at least three ways, Maher\u2019s initiative marks a great leap forward in liberal-leaning entertainment activism. It\u2019 s not just good for the left\u2014or for ratings. It\u2019s good for Republicans, conservatives, and, yes, the United States of America.\n\nPlease, don\u2019t be suspicious that, as a former guest on the show, I\u2019m just looking to curry favor. Life\u2019s tough in that designated Not Liberal chair. In the hot seat, gibberish sometimes escapes your lips. And even when you get something right, you have to pat yourself on the back. The studio audience didn\u2019t much care to cheer when I warned them of the coming Obamacare boondoggle and the rise of a new era of total information awareness.\n\nNo, I actually mean it: with Maher\u2019s district flip, everybody wins, except the one person who gets voted out\u2014if, that is, the stunt even musters the votes.\n\nFirst, consider what a departure this is for Maher himself. Gone are the days of cutting a million dollar check to President Obama. Let it be a lesson to us all: instead of pouring more money down the insatiable gullets of would-be saviors riding high on the mechanized fundraising hog, why not spend your precious time and energy helping to whip the officeholder you like least?\n\nOne might object that a district\u2019s voters ought to be the ones deciding their own representative\u2019s fate. In theory, that\u2019s true. In practice, the two parties have long since abandoned any residual shame in nationalizing the living hell out of any election that gives them a hope of victory. At a time when many Americans are so jaded and tuned out that local or regional issues often don\u2019t decide elections, both parties have even more of a reason to nationalize congressional campaigns. After all, the most powerful local issue is still \u201cHow much money can you get us?\u201d Focusing cross-country distaste on a single candidate doesn\u2019t really break new ground, even if the method and the venue are different.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s little to fear from Real Time\u2019s animus for Citizens United. Maher, a longtime critic of the decision, wants to counter the influence of big corporate money in politics. But as we found out, big business bucks aren\u2019t anywhere near enough to guarantee election outcomes. A 2012 analysis by The Washington Post revealed just how little changed. \u201cNever before,\u201d the Post\u2019s reporters began their write-up, \u201chas so much political money been spent to achieve so little.\u201d If Maher\u2019s attempted flip is successful, it\u2019ll help inspire copycats in both parties to spend their money more wisely\u2014and perhaps even realize that Citizens United was rightly decided, but hardly the end of the world.\n\nNow let\u2019s revisit the little matter of the contemptuous snarking that\u2019s sure to loom large in this venture. Yes, political discourse in America has always been pretty ugly. No, that doesn\u2019t mean we ought to revel in it. But, again\u2014think about how Maher\u2019s shifting gears. What\u2019s worse: channeling anger and disgust into the practical effort of unseating the Republican least deserving of office, or taking a moment out of every show to ridicule a guy in a bubble pretending to be a dumb conservative? As Maher himself has observed, you can live in a bubble regardless of your party. But the bigger point is that laughing at fools is more an act of masturbation than it is an act of politics. In going after truly dire officeholders\u2014whatever their party\u2014we can all remember just how unfunny corruption and incompetence can be.\n\nFinally, ponder exactly how Maher will make his final choice of congresscritter. Think he\u2019s going to nail the most religious, the most pro-life, or the most pro-gun? Think again. Those kinds of Republicans might make the biggest hate figures for Real Time\u2019s biggest fans. But how can Maher pass up the opportunity to drop the boom on a representative so unambiguously bad that even the most hardened conservatives smile grimly and nod along?\n\nThere\u2019s so much dissention in the Republican ranks about policy reform, it\u2019s not as clear as it used to be what it really means to be the most right-wing. There\u2019s no guarantee Maher will even go after one of the \u201cmost conservative\u201d guys in Congress. Despite top rankings from movement groups on everything from abortion to guns to taxes, Justin Amash won\u2019t be biting his nails on Friday nights to see if he\u2019s on Maher\u2019s shortlist.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201402161208, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "TV\u2019s \u2018Real Time\u2019 host has promised to target one awful incumbent in the next congressional election and drive that person out of office.
