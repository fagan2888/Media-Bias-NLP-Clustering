The pro-life movement warned over and over again during the debate leading up to Obamacare that it would eventually lead to rationing health care.

As the implementation of the health care law has unfolded, Americans have seen rationing in numerous forms — from losing their health insurance outright, to paying more, doctors closing their practices, and hospitals and physicians being removed from their insurance networks.
