He said Rios was serving a few months in the county jail annex for probation violations relating to trafficking and stolen property.\n\nPCSD and Tucson Police searched the immediate area before turning over the case to the department's Fugitive Investigative Strike Team.\n\nDavid Wagner, who pulled up to PACC in his pickup truck, said the situation concerned him as a parent.\n\n\"We bring our kids here,\" he said. \"I thought that they would be a little more supervised.\"\n\nNick Teufel, who tagged along with his 18-year-old daughter for an afternoon visit, said he was glad to be around her when they learned what had happened.\n\n\"I would hate to think that an inmate, as the size that I saw in there, could potentially accost her to get herself away from the facility,\" he said.\n\nHis daughter Alex said she didn't know about the inmate work program that the Sheriff's Department started at PACC in November. She and her father agreed that they would like to see the situation remedied without it affecting the adoption process.\n\n\"Hopefully they'll deal with it now to prevent that in the future,\" Teufel said. \"We're animal lovers and we're here to adopt some of the dogs and I felt really bad for them and I hope that they don't suffer for it.\"\n\nSuitt said an inmate on a work crew, like Rios, is a low-level threat to the public. Each one is assessed before being allowed to join. It is the first time a 'walk off' has happened with the three-month-old program, which has been a success so far.\n\n\"This program has been working very well for the inmates,\" Suitt said. \"They've been coming here, helping out and cleaning up the pens and everything else.\"\n\nAnyone with information about Rios is asked to contact the Pima County Sheriff's Department or send an anonymous tip to 88-CRIME.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
