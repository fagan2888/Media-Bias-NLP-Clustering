Jennifer Brown/Associated Press\n\nThe giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s chief Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has received just two endorsements from national labor unions, reflecting the challenge ahead for the Vermont senator who\u2019s also trailing Mrs. Clinton in polls.\n\nWith SEIU\u2019s backing, Mrs. Clinton has secured support from many of the nation\u2019s largest labor unions, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The unions that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton collectively represent well over half of the nation\u2019s 14.6 million union members in 2014.\n\nSEIU, which has nearly two million members, said it chose to support Mrs. Clinton because she\u2019s a leader who\u2019ll fight to raise wages and stand up for working people. The union also said she values the kind of care work that many SEIU members do daily, including the work of home-care aides who\u2019ve been fighting for higher minimum pay.\n\n\u201cSEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them,\u201d the union\u2019s President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nSEIU said it spent months gauging its members\u2019 support of the candidates, including through polls and tele-town hall meetings. Mrs. Clinton consistently received more than 72% of members\u2019 support, an SEIU spokesman said.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough to stop a backlash on social media Tuesday from disgruntled SEIU members who back Mr. Sanders. Members of a group called SEIU for Bernie had been voicing concern for weeks that an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton could undermine the Fight for $15 campaign. The SEIU-funded wage campaign began with New York fast-food workers and has evolved into a nationwide push for a $15 federal minimum wage. The campaign is also trying to use the wage issue to build a bloc of like-minded voters for the 2016 elections.\n\nMr. Sanders backs a $15 federal minimum wage while Mrs. Clinton has said she supports a federal minimum of $12. When asked last week whether that would affect SEIU\u2019s endorsement process, the union\u2019s president Ms. Henry suggested there\u2019s room for improvement. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s about driving the movement alongside of the candidates,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nFor its part, the Sanders campaign sought to downplay the union endorsements for Mrs. Clinton, focusing instead on the support it has received from rank-and-file union members.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified that hundreds of thousands of workers are part of the growing grassroots movement supporting Bernie\u2019s campaign to help working families by raising the minimum wage, providing health care for all and making college affordable,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.", "title": "SEIU\u2019s Clinton Nod Signals Campaign\u2019s Momentum Growing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/seius-clinton-nod-signals-campaigns-momentum-growing/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LI074_SEIU_P_20151117194720.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "SEIU\u2019s Clinton Nod Signals Campaign\u2019s Momentum Growing", "description": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Melanie Trottman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-11-18T01:03:47-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/seius-clinton-nod-signals-campaigns-momentum-growing/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-59315", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.", "title": "SEIU\u2019s Clinton Nod Signals Campaign\u2019s Momentum Growing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/seius-clinton-nod-signals-campaigns-momentum-growing/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LI074_SEIU_P_20151117194720.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-59315", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-18T01:03:47-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Sanders backs a $15 federal minimum wage while Mrs. Clinton has said she supports a federal minimum of $12.\nThe SEIU-funded wage campaign began with New York fast-food workers and has evolved into a nationwide push for a $15 federal minimum wage.\nThe unions that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton collectively represent well over half of the nation\u2019s 14.6 million union members in 2014.\nThat wasn\u2019t enough to stop a backlash on social media Tuesday from disgruntled SEIU members who back Mr. Sanders.\nMrs. Clinton consistently received more than 72% of members\u2019 support, an SEIU spokesman said."}
