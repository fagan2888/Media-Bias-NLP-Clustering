If that happens, your company will share some of the savings\u2014in the form of a bonus payment\u2014with St. Vincent.\n\n\n\nSuch contracts represent a big change from traditional ones, which gave doctors and hospitals incentives to perform as many procedures as possible to as many patients as they could attract, driving up spending year after year.\n\nFogel Fogel\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on keeping their employees healthy, and that is helpful financially to the company as well,\u201d said Dr. Richard Fogel, St. Vincent\u2019s chief clinical officer. \u201cNow the financial models have caught up to supporting those types of arrangements.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe move comes about a year after the end of a similar effort in which St. Vincent partnered with Community Health Network to form an \u201caccountable care consortium\u201d aimed at employers and health insurers. The consortium also included nearly all of the central Indiana county-owned hospitals that are part of the Suburban Health Organization.\n\n\n\nThat consortium signed up nine employers in its first year, but then the partner hospitals decided they would be better off working separately. They dissolved the consortium in early 2014.\n\n\n\nBut while the consortium died, the concept of hospital systems being rewarded for the financial savings they achieve by keeping patients healthier is gaining traction quickly.\n\n\n\nFor example, both St. Vincent and Community have signed \u201cshared savings\u201d contracts with the state\u2019s largest health insurer, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. And Franciscan Alliance, which operates three hospitals in the Indianapolis area, formed an accountable care organization with Anthem covering more than 60,000 Hoosiers.\n\n\n\nAround the state, 454,000 Anthem customers are now covered by these kinds of contracts.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a fad, if you will,\u201d said Amy Cheslock, Anthem\u2019s vice president of payment innovation, in a May interview. \u201cI firmly believe that value-based payment models are absolutely going to be the new norm, if not already.\u201d\n\n\n\nSt. Vincent and MissionPoint hope to partner with a health insurance plan to offer the program to smaller employers and to individuals on the Obamacare exchange, likely for coverage that starts in 2017, said Dr. Jordan Asher, the chief medical officer for MissionPoint.\n\n\n\nIn Tennessee, for example, MissionPoint has an exclusive partnership with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan there.\n\n\n\nSt. Vincent is no stranger to the world of insurance. In 2000, it joined with Franciscan and other Catholic hospital systems to found Indianapolis-based Advantage Health Solutions, which offers HMO-style health plans to employers.\n\n\n\nBut with only about 50,000 members in its health plans, Advantage never has grown to be a significant source of patients or revenue for St. Vincent.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Walker, who is director of strategy at Quorum Health Resources, a Tennessee-based consulting firm focused on hospitals, said all hospitals need to start or partner with health plans to serve employers directly. But she said that, to be viable, St. Vincent\u2019s effort will need to reach a much larger scale\u2014involving at least 100,000 patients\u2014than its past efforts.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is just dabbling,\u201d she said of St. Vincent\u2019s MissionPoint effort so far.\n\n\n\nMissionPoint hopes to save money by focusing on the roughly 5 percent of patients with the greatest needs. These are patients already undergoing significant treatment in the hospital or the emergency room. Or they could be patients whose health records show a high risk for a major medical procedure.\n\n\n\nMissionPoint assigns nurses to patients coming out of the hospital or the ER to make sure they understand their discharge instructions (Asher noted that most patients can recall only 20 percent of discharge instructions) and to make sure patients get the prescription drugs or follow-up doctor\u2019s visits they need.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, MissionPoint has a team\u2014social workers, mental health counselors, human services professionals and even handymen\u2014to help patients at high risk of hospitalization. These patients are often frail, elderly or poor or suffer from mental health problems\u2014or a combination of those factors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe really spend a lot of time working with those patients in need,\u201d Asher said. \u201cThe majority of those issues are life issues. You can\u2019t begin to work on your diabetes or heart disease if you\u2019re worried about who\u2019s going to pick you up and take you to the doctor or who\u2019s going to feed your dog while you\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo help with those efforts, St. Vincent is converting 20 percent of its physician practices\u2014covering about 180 primary care physicians\u2014to a team-based model by next year.\n\n\n\nThe idea is to have St. Vincent physician practices that don\u2019t just prescribe medications, but instead help patients navigate the other parts of the health care system and solve challenges at home.\n\n\n\nSt. Vincent envisions six of these team-based \u201cmedical homes\u201d in or near Indianapolis, Anderson, Frankfort, Bedford and North Vernon, Fogel said. There will also be one in Evansville.\n\n\n\nSt. Vincent\u2019s MissionPoint program somewhat resembles what Indiana University Health\u2019s insurance arm has been working on since 2013.\n\n\n\nIt partnered with Virginia-based Evolent Health to help it identify high-risk patients as well as to develop ways its doctors, nurses, social workers and other staff could better coordinate their work with patients.\n\n\n\nLocal brokers say IU Health Plans has started to gain some traction, although it has kept delaying a big marketing push. It now aims for pitching employers next year.\n\n\n\nThe biggest chunk of IU Health Plans\u2019 business is providing benefits to IU Health\u2019s 28,000 full-time equivalent employees.\n\n\n\nIU Health Plans did sign up roughly 1,200 customers on the Obamacare exchanges this year, when it was available in just the Bloomington, Lafayette and Muncie areas. For 2016, it plans to expand to 45 additional counties.\n\n\n\nJim Parker, the CEO of IU Health Plans, said its approach is already achieving success. He noted that IU Health\u2019s spending on health benefits actually declined in 2014 from 2013.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a message that resonates with employers, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is some degree of significant fatigue that the traditional approaches just aren\u2019t creating fundamental improvements,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo as we describe our approach and the results that we\u2019ve had, there\u2019s definitely interest.\u201d \u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "For decades, hospitals have tried to cut out the health insurance middleman by contracting directly with employers\u2014with only limited success.
