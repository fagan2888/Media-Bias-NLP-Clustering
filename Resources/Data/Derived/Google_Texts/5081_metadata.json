She later knew it was her responsibility to pass it down to the tribe\u2019s next generations.\n\nDecades later, she is upholding that tradition as the first elder/scholar-in-residence at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, California. Sisquoc was formally introduced to the campus community during a ceremony on September 30, 2015. She\u2019ll spend her time in the Native American Student Center and also assist with the Natives Aiming to Inspire Values in Education (NATIVE) Pipeline program.\n\n\u201cMy role is to encourage Native American students to go forward in their education but don\u2019t forget your traditions and your ways.\u201d Sisquoc says. \u201cYou can live in both worlds. You can get your education but you can also embrace your culture, traditions and your language.\u201d\n\nSisquoc\u2019s grandmother, Ida Gooday, was born in 1903 as a prisoner of war of the U.S. government at Fort Sill Apache in Oklahoma. She later moved to Arizona. Sisquoc\u2019s grandmother spent her life in a boarding school in Arizona and graduated from Phoenix Indian School. After earning a teaching credential in 1927, she moved with Sisquoc\u2019s mother, Tonita Largo Glover, from Arizona to Sherman Indian School in Riverside in 1951. Lorene Sisquoc\u2019s life began in 1960 on the campus of Sherman Indian School.She is a member of the Fort Sill Apache Tribe and a descendant of the Mountain Cahuilla of Southern California. Sisquoc can trace her ancestry to Mangas Coloradas, the last chief of the Mimbreno Apaches; Chief Loco of the Warm Springs Apaches and Manuel Largo, a leader of the Mountain Cahuilla.\n\n\u201cI was raised and influenced by many elders. The first one was my grandmother and her sisters. They shared memories of our ancestors and told stories of them, our chief and leaders in our family,\u201d Sisquoc says. \u201cWe pay attention to the elders and pass things on. That\u2019s how our language and our songs are kept alive.\u201d\n\nIn 1982, Sisquoc began work at Sherman Indian High School as a dormitory staff member. Three years later, she began volunteer training under the tutelage of Ramona K. Bradley, co-founder and curator of the Sherman Indian Museum.\n\nSisquoc co-founded the Mother Earth Clan Cultural Programs in 1986. She became volunteer curator/manager of the Sherman Indian Museum in 1991, and has taught classes in Native American traditions and basketry at Sherman Indian High School since 1995.\n\nThere are an estimated 100 tribes in California, but studies show that only 1 percent of those members will pursue higher education. The lack of outreach to Native American students and the scarcity of role models are part of the problem. However, with efforts such as the NATIVE Pipeline program, Sisquoc has seen the number of Native American students entering college rise.\n\n\u201cIn our native community, so many are the first generation to graduate high school in the last 20 years. Now it\u2019s changing. Now they\u2019re the first to go to college,\u201d Sisquoc says. \u201cThe first question we ask our seniors in high school now is, \u2018Where are you planning on going to college?\u2019 That might not have been a question that was asked 10 to 20 years ago. Now it\u2019s a standard question and the kids have an answer.\u201d\n\nThis evolution also extends to her family. Sisquoc says her first grandchild graduated from high school last June and is studying at UC Riverside.\n\nChanging the mindset of high school students about achieving a higher education is one of the goals of Cal Poly Pomona\u2019s NATIVE Pipeline program, which was initiated by Ethnic and Women\u2019s Studies Professor Sandy Kewanhaptewa-Dixon (Hopi) and has been supported by the Kellogg Legacy grant for four years. The pipeline also received a $150,000 gift from alumnus Don Huntley. The program is the only one of its kind in the California State University system, and the elder/scholar-in-residence is an outcrop of the pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really humbled and proud that she\u2019s here with us. She\u2019s from the local area and can speak truly to the local tribes for us. She\u2019s been raised in the area and that is significant to us,\u201d says Irvin Harrison, coordinator of the Native American Student Center. \u201cWe hope that our Native American students will gravitate to her and her energy.\u201d\n\nSisquoc is a basket weaver and has extensive knowledge of native plants and their uses. She is dedicated to the preservation and continuance of Native American culture, and strives to ensure that Native American history is accurately depicted in the media.\n\nDuring the fall quarter, Sisquoc has led workshops and presentations for Native American students on campus.\n\n\u201cI want to teach students to be proud of who they are and urge them to learn their tribal traditions and maybe inspire each of them to learn more about their tribal traditions,\u201d Sisquoc says. \u201cI\u2019ll share with them what I know of my tribe and encourage them to find their traditions and their tribal backgrounds. Honor it and respect it. It will keep you strong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lorene Sisquoc is passing down oral history and helping Native students succeed by serving as the first elder/scholar-in-residence at Cal Poly Pomona.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/24/first-elder-residence-serves-native-american-link-past-162836", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lorene-sisquoc-cal-poly-pomona.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "First Elder-in-Residence Serves as Native American Link to the Past"}, "abstract": "Lorene Sisquoc is passing down oral history and helping Native students succeed by serving as the first elder/scholar-in-residence at Cal Poly Pomona.", "dc": {"title": "First Elder-in-Residence Serves as Native American Link to the Past"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/24/first-elder-residence-serves-native-american-link-past-162836", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cal Poly Pomona, Native American students, Native American Education, Elder, Educators, Higher Education", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-12-24T14:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "First Elder-in-Residence Serves as Native American Link to the Past"}, "article_summary": "She is dedicated to the preservation and continuance of Native American culture, and strives to ensure that Native American history is accurately depicted in the media.\nShe\u2019ll spend her time in the Native American Student Center and also assist with the Natives Aiming to Inspire Values in Education (NATIVE) Pipeline program.\nHowever, with efforts such as the NATIVE Pipeline program, Sisquoc has seen the number of Native American students entering college rise.\nThe lack of outreach to Native American students and the scarcity of role models are part of the problem.\n\u201cWe hope that our Native American students will gravitate to her and her energy.\u201dSisquoc is a basket weaver and has extensive knowledge of native plants and their uses."}
