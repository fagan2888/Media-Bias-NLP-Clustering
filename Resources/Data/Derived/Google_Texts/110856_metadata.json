Drug costs have also increased, Joyner said. Almost 331,000 people in Alabama are covered under the PEEHIP plan, and 66,000 of them are Medicare eligible, she added.\n\n\u201cThe changes we've had to implement have been pretty significant,\u201d Joyner said. \u201cThe good news is, most of these changes have been adding additional benefits to our coverage.\u201d\n\nTo compensate for the increased costs of expanded care, PEEHIP offers a wellness plan and health counseling. PEEHIP also conducts regular audits to make sure that its members are eligible for coverage \u2014 meaning there hasn't been a divorce or a dependent is still younger than 26.\n\nAnother change that is affecting senior citizens is not so much related to the ACA, but a change that has been occurring since the 1980s: Fewer companies are offering health insurance coverage as part of their retirement package, said Ashley Adcox of the Area Agency on Aging for West Alabama.\n\n\u201cOne day, 30 years from now, you may mention retiree health coverage and people may not know what it is because it won't be around,\u201d Adcox said.\n\nThe \u201cFuture of Health Care for Seniors\u201d forum was sponsored by the Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Retirees Association, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and the Tuscaloosa Alabama Education Retirees Association.\n\nTuscaloosa retiree Bill Rose said he came to the event Tuesday because he's worried about the changes in health care recently.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I'm worried,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt may be affordable now, but it won't be affordable for long.\u201d\n\nCiville Brown said she heard about the event through OLLI and came because she wanted to educate herself.\n\n\u201cI'm single and always had to support myself, and I wanted try to educate myself about these things,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMy drug costs continually go up.\u201d\n\nRetiree Lynn Zeanah said she also attended to learn more.\n\n\u201cI'm worried about the increase in costs,\u201d Zeanah said. \u201cIt seems like co-pays gradually go up.\u201d\n\nReach Lydia Seabol Avant at 205-722-0222 or lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 100 retirees gathered Tuesday at the Bryant Conference Center to learn more about how recent health-care law changes might affect seniors.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-26770A70-5DA1-4043-9FB0-F4FA80FCBD09-pubTL"}, "og": {"site_name": "TuscaloosaNews.com", "description": "More than 100 retirees gathered Tuesday at the Bryant Conference Center to learn more about how recent health-care law changes might affect seniors.", "title": "Bracing for changes: Forum offers answers to retirees' health care questions", "url": "http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20150310/NEWS/150319940", "image": "http://G52-TLweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=TL&Date=20150310&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=150319940&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150310, "fb": {"app_id": 126505827419704}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150319940-pubTL"}}, "keywords": "Local News - TL"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cFuture of Health Care for Seniors\u201d forum was sponsored by the Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Retirees Association, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and the Tuscaloosa Alabama Education Retirees Association.\nTuscaloosa retiree Bill Rose said he came to the event Tuesday because he's worried about the changes in health care recently.\n\u201cBecause of the changes in health care and change of delivery systems, there have been a lot of questions,\u201d said Carol Wright, vice president for programs for the Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Retirees Association, which helped sponsor the forum.\n\u201cThe good news is, most of these changes have been adding additional benefits to our coverage.\u201dTo compensate for the increased costs of expanded care, PEEHIP offers a wellness plan and health counseling.\nMore than 100 retirees gathered Tuesday at the Bryant Conference Center to learn more about how recent health-care law changes might affect seniors."}
