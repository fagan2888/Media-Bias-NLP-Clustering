An Oxnard man pleaded guilty this week to setting fire to a Newbury Park Planned Parenthood office where his former girlfriend worked.

Alvaro Perez, 24, was arrested in early January in connection with the September 2015 fire.

Perez faces 6.8 years in prison, said Richard Simon, a senior deputy district attorney with the Ventura County District Attorney's Office.

In addition to arson, Perez pleaded guilty to stalking.

Investigators at first suspected the fire might have been set by someone connected to an anti-abortion group. But they later discovered the fire was part of a domestic dispute, John Reilly, a captain with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, said in January.

Perez was arrested while in custody in Ventura County jail on earlier charges of battery, vandalism, violation of a domestic restraining order, domestic-spousal battery and illegal possession of a firearm, Reilly said.

Investigators said a large piece of masonry was thrown through a window on the south side of the building that houses the Planned Parenthood office. An accelerant was later thrown in and a fire was lit. The fire did not spread beyond a small area of an office, but sprinkler water damaged much of the floor, authorities said.

No one was injured in the fire.

At the time of the fire, Planned Parenthood was at the center of a heated political controversy after surreptitiously recorded videos were released, allegedly showing anti-abortionists' claims that the group illegally sold fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood officials said the videos were doctored and the allegations were false.

Perez is scheduled to be sentenced May 5.
