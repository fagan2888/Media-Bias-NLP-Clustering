This means that any attempt to restrict access to stop-loss coverage is seen as bad news.\n\nStop-loss experts say the ACA\u2019s unlimited lifetime maximum payments for underlying medical plans will lead to higher-severity claims, and ACA employer health insurance mandates will lead to the expansion of covered lives.\n\nSelf-insured businesses buy stop-loss coverage to protect themselves against catastrophic claims, claims so large that they threaten the financial solvency of a company. But in Maryland, a lawmaker has proposed raising the deductible for self-insured employers to $40,000 before medical stop-loss coverage kicks in.\n\nUnder Maryland law, self-insured businesses with an average of 50 employees must reach a minimum threshold of $10,000 before triggering stop-loss coverage.\n\nBusiness groups are against the bill backed by CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the state\u2019s largest health insurer.\n\nPreventing more businesses from leaving the fully-insured small group market avoids what the industry calls \u201cadverse selection.\u201d This is a situation in which there are not enough young, healthy lives to offset less healthy, often older and typically more costly lives in the risk pool.\n\n\u201cI think at the end of the day, as policy makers, we have to decide how valuable is the small group and I would say to you it\u2019s very, very important,\u201d the bill\u2019s sponsor, State Sen. Thomas M. Middleton, said in an article published in the Washington Business Journal earlier in March.\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Businesses has come out against the bill. In addition, Mike McMullin, president of the Carroll County Chamber of Commerce, said the bill would \u201cessentially eliminate small group self-funding\u201d as an employer option for health benefits.\n\n\u201cLimiting options is not in the best interest of businesses in the state of Maryland,\u201d McMullin said in written comments opposing the bill.\n\nInsurance brokers and financial advisors also say the bill will limit the insurance choices available for small businesses even if the bill has little impact on national stop-loss carriers.\n\nBrad Nieland, vice president of stop-loss for Sun Life Financial, said that raising the deductible will make it more difficult for business owners who choose to self-insure to provide coverage for workers. Medical coverage helps small businesses attract qualified employees.\n\n\u201cWe view the increase to $40,000 as essentially limiting choice to small employers,\u201d Nieland told InsuranceNewsNet. Sun Life Financial, a top carrier of stop-loss benefits in the U.S., has more than $1 billion in in-force stop-loss premium.\n\n\u201cPutting limits on deductible is a form of regulating stop-loss,\u201d Nieland added. \u201cIt limits the ability of employers to buy stop-loss, and I do think it\u2019s an attempt at regulation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many estimated businesses would elect to drop coverage if the bill were passed and signed into law.\n\nAn analysis by the Department of Legislative Services of the Maryland General Assembly shows that for groups of 50 or fewer covered employees, the median stop-loss deductible was $30,000. For groups of 51 to 100 employees, the median deductible was $45,000.\n\nRaising the deductible means small businesses take on more risk in electing to cover their employees, but businesses that decide to offer coverage also could end up paying lower stop-loss premiums, the legislative analysts found.\n\nBryson Popham, a lobbyist representing the Maryland Association of Health Underwriters and the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors-Maryland, told Washington Business Journal that to \u201cadopt a bill this far reaching without examining the consequences, both intended and unintended, is something the general assembly rarely does.\u201d\n\nFor many businesses, self-insurance is often cheaper than pursuing coverage in the fully-insured market and many large companies resort to self-insurance because they have the financial resources to pay the claims.\n\nBut for cash-strapped small businesses, where cash flow is considered the lifeblood, higher deductibles entail a financial sacrifice, just as a driver might take on more risk by raising the collision deductible from $500 to $1,500 per accident, even if it means lower premiums.\n\nSelf-funding has traditionally been limited to 8 percent to 16 percent of companies with between one and 100 full-time employees, according to Robert C. Pozen, a senior fellow in economic studies with The Brookings Institution.\n\nPozen says in a blog post that in the future, \u201cthese statistics may change dramatically\u201d as the ACA creates new incentives for small companies to self-fund their health care plans.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
