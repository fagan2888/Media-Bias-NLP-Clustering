The deal is being financed entirely by BioMarin's cash on hand.\n\nAs BioMarin's CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime commented, \"We will leverage our experience at developing rare disease therapies to achieve regulatory approvals and bring drisapersen to market as quickly as possible.\" The transaction is expected to close sometime in the first quarter.\n\nNow what: BioMarin is a smart cookie when it comes to rare disease drugs, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say I was scratching my head on this one. It'd be one thing if drisapersen's future as a DMD therapy looked bright, but it actually failed miserably in a phase 3 clinical study last year after it showed no benefit over the placebo, although a deeper analysis demonstrated it could be effective in early stages of the disease. Furthermore, previous drisapersen partner GlaxoSmithKline walked away from its portion of the deal, leaving Prosensa with all remaining study and development costs moving forward. If Glaxo didn't want drisapersen, what does BioMarin see that it didn't?\n\nIn addition, this is shaping up to be a somewhat competitive space in spite of DMD being a rare disease. Sarepta Therapeutics has delivered 144-week data for its experimental drug eteplirsen on its relatively small dozen-patient midstage cohort which continued to show a statistically significant benefit in the six-minute walk test compared to the progression typically observed in non-eteplirsen-dosed patients. Though Sarepta has had its issues getting on the same page with the Food and Drug Administration, it would appear that a new drug application filing could happen in early 2015.\n\nAs things stand now I'd be jumping for joy and buying drinks for everyone at the local bar if I were a Prosensa shareholder and possibly banging my head against the wall if I owned BioMarin shares. I could certainly be wrong and drisapersen could prove effective in treating early stage DMD, but the phase 3 results compounded by GlaxoSmithKline walking tells me everything I need to know about Prosensa.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "15:21", "date": "2014-11-24T20:21:00Z", "description": "Prosensa stock shoots to the moon after the company agrees to be purchased.
