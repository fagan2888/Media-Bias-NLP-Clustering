Newly elected House member Mia Love said Sunday she is behind Senator Ted Cruz’s plan to “do everything humanly possible to stop Obamacare.”

The Utah Republican said getting rid of the unpopular 2010 Affordable Care Act is part of her election mandate.

“Look, I was elected by my district to make sure we get the decision-making back in their hands,” Love, the former mayor of Saratoga Springs, told Martha Raddatz on ABC’s This Week. “And I’ve said I was going to do everything I can to repeal and replace it with broad health-care reforms, free-market health-care reforms. And that’s exactly what I’m going to do.”
