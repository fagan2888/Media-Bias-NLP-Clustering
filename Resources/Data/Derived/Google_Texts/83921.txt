Work continued overnight to repair 52 power poles damaged by Saturdayâ€™s powerful storms that flooded areas, like Wickenburg, with 4 inches of rain.

Arizona Public Service crews have spent hours cleaning up the electrical mess in Morristown, Wittmann and Wickenburg.

To illustrate the damage and what crews are up against, APS tweeted a photo of a steel pole bent in half.

At the height of the outage, at least 1,773 customers were without power. As of 9 a.m. Sunday, 97 people were still without electricity.

APS said it will reimburse affected customers who buy up to 40 pounds of ice or 20 pounds of dry ice to help preserve food.

The utility advised residents waiting for power to come back on to keep their refrigerator and freezer doors closed. Refrigerators will keep food cold for four hours. A full freezer will preserve food for up to 48 hours, it said.

In Buckeye, APS reported about 3,000 customers without power as of early Saturday evening.

The rain in the Wickenburg area eventually let up overnight. But for many, the cleanup is just beginning and it could take weeks.

One of the hardest hit businesses in Wickenburg was the Horseshoe Cafe, where employees used homemade sandbags to keep the water out.

"We had water in the bathrooms, kitchen, mud, dirt, yuck, sludge, everything," said owner Debra Thompson. "It was just a mess. And everybody just baled in and started working really hard."

Anyone needing shelter is being told to come to the Wickenburg Community Center at 160 Valentine St.
