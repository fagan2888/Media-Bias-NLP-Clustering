The Wolf of Wall Street star Jonah Hill hosted Saturday Night Live this week — but unfortunately for him, everyone wanted to talk about his costar Leonardo DiCaprio.

During his opening monologue, Hill kept getting interrupted by audience members who wanted to know what DiCaprio is really like. Finally, Hill got so upset that he began ragging on his fellow actor, only to have DiCaprio walk onto the stage with him.

“You were backstage?” Hill asked nervously. “Oh, that’s weird, man. Maybe the acoustics are messed up or something, because I was totally hyping you up.”

After some prodding, Hill eventually admitted that he was trying to act like a big shot because he was excited and nervous. He then asked DiCaprio if they could do the thing they used to do together on set to help the younger actor calm down. DiCaprio agreed, and the result was amazing.

Hill held out his arms, recreating the famous scene between Jack and Rose in Titanic. DiCaprio then stood behind him, wrapping his arms around Hill and nuzzling his cheek against the SNL host.

“Am I flying, Jack?” Hill asked above the uproariously laughter and cheers of the audience.
