Really?,\u201d the narrator asks incredulously. \u201cFighting for notorious D.C. law firms? Check. Corporate special interests that receive millions in taxpayer money? Check. Fighting for herself? Check.\u201d\n\n\u201cKatie McGinty, not for us,\u201d the narrator concludes.\n\nThe ad appears to piggyback on a recent Fetterman video that painted McGinty as too close to oil and gas companies.\n\nMcGinty is running against Braddock Mayor John Fetterman and former Congressman Joe Sestak in the Democratic primary.\n\nThe McGinty campaign issued a press release providing counters for Toomey\u2019s claims as well as the following statement.\n\n\u201cToomey\u2019s attack is the height of hypocrisy. Katie McGinty has consistently fought for protecting the environment and creating jobs for hard-working Pennsylvania families,\u201d Communications Director Sabrina Singh stated. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 Senator Toomey has been a roadblock for Pennsylvania by consistently voting to protect tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas, opposing efforts to make college more affordable and supporting the privatization of Medicare and Social Security and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Clearly he sees Katie as the strongest threat to his career as a Washington politician.\u201d\n\nFebruary 18th, 2016 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Senate, Top Stories, Video | 12 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senator asserts McGinty is looking out for her own interests instead of the commonwealth\u2019s.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-sen-toomey-attacks-mcgintys-business-career-video/72838/", "image": "http://www.politicspa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Toomey-McGinty-Ad-300x176.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Senator asserts McGinty is looking out for her own interests instead of the commonwealth\u2019s.", "title": "PA-Sen: Toomey Attacks McGinty\u2019s Business Career (VIDEO)"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "pa-sen,senate,pat toomey,katie mcginty,web ad,2016 election,video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PA-Sen: Toomey Attacks McGinty\u2019s Business Career (VIDEO)Written by Nick Field, Managing EditorSenator Pat Toomey is making it clear that he will make sure Katie McGinty\u2019s business career is at the center of the campaign debate if she wins the Democratic nomination.\nKatie McGinty has consistently fought for protecting the environment and creating jobs for hard-working Pennsylvania families,\u201d Communications Director Sabrina Singh stated.\nTheir video takes McGinty\u2019s claim that she\u2019s \u201cfighting for us\u201d and attempts to convince viewers that she is actually \u201cfighting for herself\u201d (which is the title of the spot).\nThe ad appears to piggyback on a recent Fetterman video that painted McGinty as too close to oil and gas companies.\nToday the Toomey team released a web ad hitting McGinty for taking jobs in the private sector that were not in the state\u2019s best interest."}
