So the North Carolina dad decided to check out the HealthCare.gov site to evaluate his options.\n\nBut to his surprise, Hadley got a gander at other people\u2019s health care options.\n\n\u201cI was in complete shock,\u201d Hadley told the Heritage Foundation after he said the Obamacare website delivered him insurance eligibility letters addressed to individuals from another state.\n\nHadley told Heritage the letters were addressed to a pair of South Carolina residents and that each of the letters acknowledge receipt of an application to the Health Insurance Marketplace and the eligibility of family members to purchase health coverage.\n\nHadley told Heritage he contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and N.C. elected officials about the apparent security breach but hasn\u2019t yet heard back from the HHS \u2014 and afterward HealthCare.gov was still displaying the South Carolina residents\u2019 personal information on Hadley\u2019s account.\n\nOne of the eligibility letters (seen in above screen shot, which Hadley created) was addressed to Thomas Dougall, a lawyer from Elgin, S.C.\n\nHadley contacted Dougall on Friday, after which Dougall spoke to Heritage and made his preferences quite clear: \u201cI want my personal information off of that website,\u201d Dougall said.\n\nWhile Dougall said he registered on HealthCare.gov, he decided not to sign up for insurance.\n\n\u201cThe plans they offered were grossly expensive and didn\u2019t provide the level of care I have now,\u201d he told Heritage, adding that he never saw the eligibility letter addressed to him until Hadley sent it to him Friday.\n\nDougall also told Heritage he spent Friday evening trying to contact HealthCare.gov about the apparent breach to no avail, waiting on the phone for an hour and finding an online chat session unhelpful.\n\nDougall also told Heritage he wrote to South Carolina GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, along with GOP Rep. Joe Wilson.\n\n(H/T: Drudge Report)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Like millions of Americans, Justin Hadley's private insurance was canceled because of Obamacare eligibility rules.
