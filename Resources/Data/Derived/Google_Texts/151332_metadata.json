Hazle Jr., 46, of Shasta County, sued the California Department of Corrections and WestCare California Inc., after he lost his parole for complaining about having to attend a drug treatment program that required participants to \u201cacknowledge a higher power,\u201d the Sacramento Bee reported. About half of Alcoholics Anonymous\u2019 12 steps contain some reference to God in their original formulation, and such wordings have found their way into similar drug-related 12-step programs.\n\nMr. Hazle was sent back to prison for several months because he did not cooperate.\n\nShortly after his lawsuit was filed, the corrections department announced that parolees could not be forced to participate in \u201creligious-themed programs,\u201d and instead be sent to a nonreligious program, the Bee reported,\n\nIn an interview with the Bee this week, Mr. Hazle\u2019s attorney John Heller said the settlement sets an important precedent.\n\n\u201cIt made clear that a loss of liberty entitles a person to compensatory damages as a matter of right,\u201d Mr. Heller said. \u201cIt tells others that they have this right, and it informs authorities what they can expect if that right is violated. That might keep things like this from happening in the future.\u201d\n\nBad rabbi\n\nA rabbi at a well-known D.C. synagogue was arrested this week on charges of voyeurism.\n\nRabbi Barry Freundel, 62, has pleaded not guilty to the charges that he used what looked like a digital clock to film a private ritual bathing area at Kesher Israel in Georgetown.\n\nPolice say they found footage of six women in a state of undress on two dates this year, and investigators said there could be many more victims, including children, on the tape.\n\nIn a statement posted to the Kesher Israel website, leaders called the news \u201ca painful moment\u201d and that Mr. Freundel had been suspended without pay.\n\n\u201cAt this challenging time, we draw strength from our faith, our tradition, and our fellow congregant,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMr. Freundel was released on bail. He\u2019s set to appear in court against next month.\n\n\u2022 Meredith Somers covers religion and faith issues for The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of Catholic sisters in America has dropped by more than 70 percent over the last half-century, according to a recent study.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The number of Catholic sisters in America has dropped by more than 70 percent over the last half-century, according to a recent study.", "title": "Higher Ground: Number of U.S. nuns drops by more than 70 percent since \u201865", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/16/higher-ground-number-of-nuns-in-america-has-droppe/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/04/5ad95d9f04fc9027610f6a7067000e43.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/04/5ad95d9f04fc9027610f6a7067000e43.jpg", "description": "The number of Catholic sisters in America has dropped by more than 70 percent over the last half-century, according to a recent study.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Higher Ground: Number of U.S. nuns drops by more than 70 percent since"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Religion News Service"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6e40\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere are about as many women religious in the United States now as there were a hundred years ago,\u201d the study found.\n\u201cIt made clear that a loss of liberty entitles a person to compensatory damages as a matter of right,\u201d Mr. Heller said.\nIn a statement posted to the Kesher Israel website, leaders called the news \u201ca painful moment\u201d and that Mr. Freundel had been suspended without pay.\nMr. Freundel was released on bail.\nThe number of Catholic sisters in America has dropped by more than 70 percent over the last half-century, according to a recent study."}
