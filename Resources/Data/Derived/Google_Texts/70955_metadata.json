In the United States, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) kills more than 19,000 annually \u2014 more than emphysema, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and homicide combined.\n\nThis policy brief offers an overview of antibiotic resistance, the debate around regulating antibiotic use in agriculture, and new developments in related research and policy initiatives.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Background?\n\nThe more antibiotics are used, the more opportunities bacteria have to evolve to defeat them. The brief examines the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which produced many of the \u201csuperbugs\u201d in the United States. The problem is not limited to humans: 80 percent of this country\u2019s antibiotic sales are given to farm animals and poultry, to promote growth as well as treat illness. Nonetheless, the United States has been slow to pass any legislation limiting the agricultural use of antibiotics.\n\nWhat\u2019s The Policy And The Debate?\n\nThe brief outlines efforts taken by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal entities to prevent the spread of drug-resistant bacteria and promote the development of new antibiotics. As the brief also points out, powerful meat industry stakeholders have opposed attempts to regulate the use of antibiotics in animal feed \u2014 although change may be in the wind.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nTo provide incentives for drug companies, the Obama administration\u2019s Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act of 2011 added a five-year extension to the exclusivity period of new antibiotics. The White House\u2019s recently released National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria was accompanied by a proposed funding increase for the next fiscal year. At the same time, new antibiotics are being developed in the research lab \u2014 although, as the brief notes, the failure rate for antibiotics moving all the way from early discovery to actual drug approval is 97 percent.\n\nAbout Health Policy Briefs\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policy makers, congressional staffers, and others needing short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics. The briefs, which are reviewed by experts in the field, include competing arguments on policy proposals and the relevant research supporting each perspective.\n\nSign Up For Health Policy Briefs\n\nSign up for an e-mail alert about upcoming briefs.
