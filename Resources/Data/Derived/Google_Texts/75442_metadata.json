He later drew another roar while waving to fans from the bench.\n\nHe added No. 501 midway through third, beating a defender with a sweeping deke at the top of the zone before smacking a shot past goalie Andrew Hammond for a 7-1 lead.\n\nAt 801 games, the Russian winger is the fifth-fastest player to 500 goals, trailing only Hall of Famers Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Mike Bossy and Brett Hull.\n\n\u201cHe is one of a kind,\u201d Hull said last week. \u201cI admire what he does because he\u2019s a pure goal scorer.\u201d\n\nOvechkin has filled the net more often than anyone since he entered the league in 2005, scoring 149 more goals than the next closest player, Jarome Iginla.\n\nOvechkin was the first overall pick in the 2004 draft by Washington. He\u2019s been named an all-star in each of his 11 seasons and was voted a captain for this year\u2019s All-Star Game. He\u2019s won three consecutive Maurice \u201cRocket\u201d Richard Trophies as the league\u2019s leading goal scorer and five overall. He\u2019s also won three Hart Trophies as league MVP.\n\nThe 30-year-old Ovechkin is the NHL leader in career goals by a Russian-born player.\n\nOvechkin has 26 goals this season, including five over his past three games.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ovechkin became the 43rd player to score his 500th career goal and the fifth-fastest to reach the mark when he knocked the puck in from the left hash marks in the Capitals' game against the Senators on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ovechkin became the 43rd player to score his 500th career goal and the fifth-fastest to reach the mark when he knocked the puck in from the left hash marks in the Capitals\u2019 game against the Senators on Sunday.", "title": "Alex Ovechkin scores 500th goal in second period against Senators", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/10/alex-ovechkin-scores-500th-goal-capitals/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/10/AP_482905353418.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/10/AP_482905353418.jpg", "description": "Ovechkin became the 43rd player to score his 500th career goal and the fifth-fastest to reach the mark when he knocked the puck in from the left hash marks in the Capitals' game against the Senators o", "card": "summary", "title": "Alex Ovechkin scores 500th goal in second period against Senators"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Nhl, Alexander Ovechkin"}, "article_summary": "Alex Ovechkin scored his 500th goal Sunday night, becoming the 43rd player in NHL history to reach the milestone in the Washington Capitals\u2019 7-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators.\nHe\u2019s won three consecutive Maurice \u201cRocket\u201d Richard Trophies as the league\u2019s leading goal scorer and five overall.\nOvechkin got an extended standing ovation and took a skate around the rink, acknowledging the cheering crowd that included his parents.\nThe 30-year-old Ovechkin is the NHL leader in career goals by a Russian-born player.\nOvechkin has 26 goals this season, including five over his past three games."}
