The United States has historically protected minorities facing similar circumstances. We should do so again now.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has persecuted religious minorities, brutally killing them. The United States has launched airstrikes against the terrorist group.\n\nIn the letter, the lawmakers asked specifically for the creation of a Priority 2 group under the United States Refugee Admissions Program for religious minorities from Iraq and Syria. This categorization has been used in the past to protect religious minorities in the former Soviet Union, Cuba and Iran. It would allow the minority groups to come to the United States and seek asylum.\n\nSens.
