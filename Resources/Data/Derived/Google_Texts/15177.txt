A woman is accused of ringing up, then deleting hundreds of dollars worth of sales.

Tela Thompson, 20, was arrested and charged with felony theft on Wednesday.

Colerain Township police said Thompson admitted that she deleted 10 transactions over a seven-day period in November at the Walmart where she worked.

In total, more than $2,100 in merchandise left the store without being paid for, police said.

Police said Walmart discovered the thefts while reviewing security video.

Thompson was released on her own recognizance pending a court hearing on Jan. 15.
