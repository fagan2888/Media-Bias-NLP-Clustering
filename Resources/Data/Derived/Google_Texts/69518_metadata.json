It was broken into four main areas: prioritizing core competencies, talent development and retention, impact of technology in data and medical performance management.\n\nThere were 258 responses to the survey \u2013 half of the responses came from insurance carriers and self insured employers with the remaining responses coming from TPA\u2019s, governmental entities and risk pools.\n\nThree main themes were derived through the survey, she said.\n\nOne of the primary findings was that there is a limited investment by insurers in current and future talent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an aging industry and we\u2019re having trouble bringing in new talent,\u201d said Algire. \u201cWhat we found is that there is a significant opportunity that organizations are not investing in talent.\u201d\n\nAnother major finding was that there was limited systems integration and technology to drive best practices.\n\n\u201cWe looked at how organizations are integrating the current systems that they work with, and how are they using technology to either monitor internal best practices or monitoring and managing best practices with their vendor partners,\u201d Algire explained.\n\nThe results revealed that there were very few organizations using data to manage their external partners as well as their internal best practices, she said.\n\nOutsourcing medical management was the third notable theme arising from the survey.\n\n\u201cMedical is really the driving cost behind workers\u2019 comp. Many organizations outsource a lot of those services,\u201d Algire said.\n\nThe workers\u2019 comp industry veteran said there was limited use of risk and reward strategies or SLA agreements with vendor partners to manage performance.\n\nAccording to Algire, the survey responses resulted in five takeaways for those organizations involved in handling workers\u2019 comp claims.\n\nFirst, organizations need to invest in talent development and alternative recruitment strategies to drive claims effectiveness. They need to use different venues to impact both recruitment and retention of claims professionals.\n\nSecond, insurers need to understand and leverage data warehousing capabilities.\n\n\u201cBig data is probably one of the buzziest words out there. But there is an opportunity. In workers\u2019 comp, we tend to be the late adopters when it comes to data. But I think there is a significant opportunity for organizations to leverage the capabilities of big data and data warehousing to manage their systems, because one of the biggest problems with claims organizations is that we have many legacy systems generally. There are multiple legacy systems, as well as whatever your current systems that you\u2019re working with,\u201d Algire said.\n\nShe noted that combining data and managing performance from a variety of systems can be challenging.\n\nThird, companies need to consider using predictive analytics and workflow automation.\n\n\u201cI think this is probably one of the most aha moments that we\u2019ve heard from others that have talked about the report, other industry leaders that maybe weren\u2019t even involved in the advisory council, but they were surprised at how many organizations reported that they were not using workflow automation, which has been around for a while and even fewer organizations are using predictive analytics,\u201d said Algire.\n\nAn additional takeway is that organizations should use performance strategies with their vendor partners.\n\n\u201cIf we think about it, most claims organizations are held accountable by their clients for their performance. But if you\u2019re outsourcing a lot of that to vendor partners, how are you then holding those vendor partners accountable to the same performance measures that you as a claims organization are being held accountable to,\u201d asked Algire.\n\nShe said there is an opportunity for organizations to harness those strategies to better partner and manage vendor relationships.\n\nThe final takeway is that more organizations need to use qualitative or outcome based performance measures for medical performance management.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised at how many organizations really are not using either with their provider partners, medical providers and/or their vendor partners,\u201d Algire said.\n\nRising\u2019s 2014 follow up survey which closed recently included additional focus on the impact of the Affordable Care Act and on talent development and retention. Results of the survey are anticipated to be released in the latter part of 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Workers\u2019 comp insurers need to invest in new talent and improve the use of technology in managing vendor relationships and best practices, according to Ris", "og": {"site_name": "Claims Journal", "description": "Workers\u2019 comp insurers need to invest in new talent and improve the use of technology in managing vendor relationships and best practices, according to Ris", "title": "Benchmarking Study Reveals Ways Workers\u2019 Comp Organizations Can Improve Claims Outcomes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/img/claimsjournal-square.png", "url": "http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2014/08/08/253067.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Workers\u2019 comp insurers need to invest in new talent and improve the use of technology in managing vendor relationships and best practices, according to Ris", "title": "Benchmarking Study Reveals Ways Workers\u2019 Comp Organizations Can Improve Claims Outcomes", "image": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/img/claimsjournal-square.png", "creator": "@cjournal", "site": "@cjournal", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 76828913880}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/app/uploads/2015/12/cropped-claimsjournal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "workers' compensation", "published_time": "2014-08-08T12:08:14-04:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd87e\"", "article_summary": "Workers\u2019 comp insurers need to invest in new talent and improve the use of technology in managing vendor relationships and best practices, according to Rising Medical\u2019s 2013 workers\u2019 comp benchmarking study.\nAccording to Algire, the survey responses resulted in five takeaways for those organizations involved in handling workers\u2019 comp claims.\nDenise Algire, principal researcher and author, said the survey was sent via direct invitation to workers\u2019 comp claims executives and also highlighted in social media.\n\u201cMedical is really the driving cost behind workers\u2019 comp.\nThe results revealed that there were very few organizations using data to manage their external partners as well as their internal best practices, she said."}
