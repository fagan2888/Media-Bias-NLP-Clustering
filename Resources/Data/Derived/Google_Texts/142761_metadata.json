In September Zeng spent nearly 3.95 million yuan ($610,000) on a 46-square-meter (495 square-foot) apartment in the school district of Zhongguancun No.3 Primary School, a well-known school in Beijing.\n\nZeng, who calls himself white-collar middle class, told CNBC that his family lived in another three-bedroom apartment in the city and had no plan to move; purchasing the new apartment was solely to ensure his daughter would be admitted to the well-known school.\n\n\"We are not going to live there because the one-bedroom is too small,\" Zeng said. \"I'm planning to rent it out, and then, apply [for] home mortgage loans for further investments.\"\n\nIncreasing your capital in China's capital\n\nZang's investment strategy on Beijing's properties has been profitable so far.\n\nThe average home price in China tripled between 2003 and mid-2008, but cooled in the second half of 2008 due to economic uncertainties brought by the global financial crisis. Then on November 9, 2008, China announced a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package, which stirred another housing boom and accompanying surge in debt that peaked in 2013, before the government initiated a series of measures to cool the property market.\n\nIn 2009, expecting Beijing's home prices to keep climbing, Zeng bought a two-bedroom apartment in Beijing's Shuangjing neighborhood for 1.8 million yuan ($280,000). He sold the two-bedder for 4.05 million yuan ($620,000) last year and was able to buy the school-district apartment in cash.\n\n\"With this property, I can now borrow 3 million yuan [$460,000] from the bank with an interest rate as low as 4.9 percent,\" he said. \"It's like free money!\"\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of 2009?\n\nZeng said the current housing boom reminded him of 2009.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Home prices in China's tier 1 cities are rocketing, while lower-tier cities are stagnating, leaving policymakers fighting fires on two fronts.", "author": "Qian Chen | Special to CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Home prices in China's tier 1 cities are rocketing, while lower-tier cities are stagnating, leaving policymakers fighting fires on two fronts.", "title": "Investor: 'Beijing's market is like free money!'", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/13/chinas-property-market-overheats-in-tier-1-cities-stagnates-in-lower-tiers.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/04/19/101596024-481202819_[1].1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Home prices in China's tier 1 cities are rocketing, while lower-tier cities are stagnating, leaving policymakers fighting fires on two fronts.", "title": "China's property market overheats in tier 1 cities, stagnates in lower tiers", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/13/chinas-property-market-overheats-in-tier-1-cities-stagnates-in-lower-tiers.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/04/19/101596024-481202819_[1].1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Real Estate, Asia: News, China, People's Bank of China, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-13T22:43:33-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Real Estate", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T20:49:05-0400", "tag": "People's Bank of China"}, "pageNodeId": 103461349, "news_keywords": "Chinese property markets overheating, Beijing prices rocket, Shenzhen biggest riser, stagnate, stimulus, inventory"}, "article_summary": "Increasing your capital in China's capitalZang's investment strategy on Beijing's properties has been profitable so far.\nCBRE's Frank Chen says high inventory in lower-tier cities, overheating in tier-one cities and an overreliance on the property market are key risks.\nHe sold the two-bedder for 4.05 million yuan ($620,000) last year and was able to buy the school-district apartment in cash.\n\"With this property, I can now borrow 3 million yuan [$460,000] from the bank with an interest rate as low as 4.9 percent,\" he said.\nIn 2009, expecting Beijing's home prices to keep climbing, Zeng bought a two-bedroom apartment in Beijing's Shuangjing neighborhood for 1.8 million yuan ($280,000)."}
