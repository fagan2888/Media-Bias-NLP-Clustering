Rick Perry\u2019s administration calling for more training and background checks.\n\n\u201cOur navigators will comply with any regulation and rules that are enacted,\u201d United Way of Tarrant County chief executive Tim McKinney said Wednesday.\n\nHe was referring to the federally paid workers who advise consumers about their options in new online state health insurance exchanges.\n\nMcKinney clearly wasn\u2019t thrilled about one part of the Texas Department of Insurance\u2019s proposed rule, issued Tuesday. It would require navigators to take 40 hours of additional course work \u2013 on top of the 20 hours to 30 hours they\u2019ve already had, under federal guidelines.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 40 hours that they could be spending doing what they have been trained to do \u2014 educate and inform eligible consumers about the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, though, that existing navigators could defer some of the additional course work until next spring. That could help them stay focused on an upcoming deadline for people who want to obtain federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Under the law, people have until March 31 to enroll in private plans offered in the exchanges, also known as marketplaces.\n\nOn Tuesday, Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber gave the public until Jan. 6 to comment on her proposed rule. If it\u2019s adopted early next month, navigators would have to register with the state, starting March 1, department spokesman John Greeley said Wednesday in an email. They would have until May 1 to complete the educational requirements, he said.\n\nPerry and other Texas Republicans have said Texans could fall prey to identity theft if there isn\u2019t more thorough vetting of navigators. As we reported in this story in Wednesday\u2019s newspaper, though, a leading Democratic lawmaker and a consumer advocate complained the state rule potentially could cripple efforts to educate uninsured Texans.\n\nConsumer advocate Stacey Pogue of the center-left think tank the Center for Public Policy Priorities says the rule would add $330 to $990 of cost per navigator who would have to register with Rathgeber\u2019s department.\n\nIn an organization that hired 30 navigators, she said, that would add up to about $30,000 \u2014 or enough to wipe out the job of \u201ca full-time navigator who could be assisting the uninsured.\u201d\n\nMcKinney said he and his group, the Consumer Health Insurance Marketplace Enrollment Services or CHIMES consortium, haven\u2019t been able to calculate how much the rule would cost.\n\n\u201cOrganizational costs will obviously come from the grant,\u201d he said.\n\nIn August, CHIMES received a $5.9 million federal grant \u2013 or 54 percent of the $10.9 million awarded in Texas.\n\nIt has hired 140 navigators, McKinney said. It voluntarily ran them through a $15-per-person, Texas Department of Public Safety background check. Under the state rule, it would have to spend as much as $60 more to have the FBI run a fingerprint check on each, Pogue said.\n\nMcKinney\u2019s group also voluntarily gave its navigators an additional 90 minutes of training about privacy, beyond the federally prescribed curriculum, he said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMi9mb3J0LXdvcnRoLXVuaXRlZC13YXktZXhlYy1zYXlzLWdyb3VwLXdpbGwtb2JleS1hbnktdGV4YXMtZWRpY3QtZm9yLW9iYW1hY2FyZS1uYXZpZ2F0b3JzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
