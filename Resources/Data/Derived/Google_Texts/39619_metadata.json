Or not, whatever. It was easier to get iOS7 than it is to sign up for Obamacare today. (Screenshot: Jake Harris.)\n\n3910958\n\nDespite $21 million spent on marketing the Affordable Care Act in Colorado, only 226 people have enrolled in the health coverage program in the first week, according to The Associated Press.\n\nColorado hopes to enroll 136,000 people in health insurance programs through its state-run health care exchange, Connect for Health Colorado, by the end of 2014. That the goal will never be met at the current pace of enrollments doesn\u2019t seem to faze Obamacare managers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going really well,\u201d Ben Davis, the director of the Colorado-run health care exchange, told AP.\n\nCritics would beg to differ.\n\n\u201cLook, if you spent $21 million on a bake sale and sold 10 dozen muffins, that would be a complete disaster,\u201d Republican Rep. Cory Gardner said.\n\nSo far, Colorado has signed up less than half the number of people in seven days as tiny Rhode Island did in three. Kentucky, which is also running its own health-care exchange, enrolled 18,000 people in Obamacare by Oct. 9.\n\nColorado has about 350,000 uninsured residents who aren\u2019t eligible for Medicare.\n\nStill, Obamacare managers in Colorado are proving that they can find the silver lining in even the most dismal statistics.\n\n\u201cThis is a much more complicated purchase than buying a T-shirt at gap.com,\u201d Davis told the AP. \u201cWe expect people to take their time and really weigh their options, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAs has been the case in other states, Colorado\u2019s health exchange website experienced technical glitches and error messages, but officials said they were being addressed. And it seemed to be performing better than the federal website being used in 36 states \u2014 those portals have been beset with problems that don\u2019t appear to be abating.\n\nDavis said 18,000 people have set up online profiles in Colorado to allow them to start shopping for health care and Obamacare \u201cnavigators\u201d have assisted 10,000 people who needed help with the system.\n\nMost of the $21 million spent to advertise Obamacare in Colorado \u2014 which included TV and radio ads in both English and Spanish, billboards at Denver Broncos football games and other pricey buys \u2014 came from federal grants.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
