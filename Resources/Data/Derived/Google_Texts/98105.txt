The Tolkien buff writing under the name of Rolf Luchs isn’t the first to point out that the master’s world-building, while justly praised for its depth and breadth, is nevertheless lacking in some of life’s more mundane practicalities. He’s also not the first to decide to write his own fiction depicting what he imagines happening in the gaps in Tolkien’s narratives. Luchs may not even be the first to describe the events of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” from the perspective of a hospitality industry professional. But, surely, no one else has done it better than “The Last Homely Housekeeper,” a story narrated by the guy responsible for putting clean sheets on the beds of the elven king Elrond’s fancy compound at Rivendell.

Luchs, who refers to himself with tactical vagueness as an “investor” living in “Western Europe” (he’s wary of “the Black Riders of the Tolkien Estate”), frames his tale as excerpts from the diary of Tiron, head of housekeeping at Rivendell, an establishment that’s so short-staffed Tiron’s more or less the entire housekeeping crew as well. The most diverting parts of the piece concern the wrangling of demanding guests — Gandalf, with his stinky pipeweed and the snippy notes he leaves in the guestbook (“Service could be better. Also, towels musty, room draughty”), is no favorite.
