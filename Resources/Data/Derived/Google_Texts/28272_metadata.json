As Apatow writes in the introduction, \u201cI have been completely obsessed with comedy for about as long as I can remember,\u201d explaining that \u201cby my fifteenth birthday, my obsession was full-blown. I needed to become one of them. The question was, how to do that? And the answer seemed clear: Meet them. Talk to them. Get to know them. Learn their secrets.\u201d As a teenager, Apatow interviewed a number of his idols as part of a high school radio show he hosted, and \u201cthese interviews would inform the rest of my life. They contained the advice that would help me attain my dreams.\u201d\n\nThe resulting book, which features interviews spanning four decades with comic luminaries from Michael O\u2019 Donoghue and Garry Shandling to Amy Schumer and \u201cKey & Peele\u2019s\u201d Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, contains personal tributes to each of Apatow\u2019s subjects, from praising Louis C.K. (\u201cone of those people who are so brilliant and funny and uncompromising that sometimes I need to avoid their work\u201d) to gushing over Lena Dunham (\u201cevery moment with her has been a joy\u201d).\n\nBut Apatow isn\u2019t the only one who showed up for the love fest. Indeed, the book isn\u2019t just comics talking to comics, much of it is comics talking about comics, praising their contemporaries and the comedic idols that came before them, and name-checking the industry luminaries who have inspired and guided them throughout their careers. Here are eight of the book\u2019s fondest moments of comic-on-comic praise:\n\n1. Stephen Colbert on Letterman (2014)\n\nIn an interview from 2014, Colbert spoke about his admiration for David Letterman \u2014 whose \u201cLate Show\u201d desk he will be taking over in the fall \u2014 describing himself as Letterman\u2019s \u201cur-audience.\u201d As he put it: \u201cHis show started in \u201982, the year I started college. Dave was it. Johnny was great, I loved Johnny. I\u2019m the youngest of eleven children, and my elder sisters would wake me up to watch Carson with them because they didn\u2019t want to watch it alone. I would be like a toddler watching Carson with them, but Dave \u2014 Dave was like us. Dave was stupid. And I loved it. His disrespect was to his own form.\u201d\n\n2. Chris Rock on Jerry Seinfeld (2014)\n\nRock had a lot of praise for his fellow comics, from Eddie Murphy (\u201cthe funniest man on earth\u201d) to Richard Pryor (Rock said being praised by Pryor was one of \u201cthe highlights of my life\u201d), but perhaps his strongest words were for stand-up legend Jerry Seinfeld. As Rock put it: \u201cJerry\u2019s got no fucking pressure. God bless him, Jerry Seinfeld, one of the greatest comedians of all time and one of the cockiest bastards to ever live \u2026 To his credit, he writes some of the best jokes ever. He really does. I mean, they\u2019re like Billy Joel songs, you know what I mean?\u2026 That shit\u2019s American. Everybody likes those records. And Jerry Seinfeld writes jokes like that. Everybody gets those fucking jokes. I\u2019ve seen that guy work fucking Mexican crowds, black crowds, it doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s fucking cocky and kills every night.\u201d\n\n3. Harold Ramis on Bill Murray (2005)\n\nIn this interview from 2005, the late Harold Ramis spoke fondly and at length about his longtime collaborator Bill Murray, despite the fact they had hardly spoken since a falling out in the early \u201990s. As he put it: \u201cI\u2019m attracted to outlandish and excessive human behavior. Any experience with Bill Murray is better than any other experience because he does things no one you know would ever do. Every ride with Bill is a potential adventure. I say this with love and considerable distance, because I don\u2019t talk to him and I don\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\n4. Louis C.K. on Cosby (2014)\n\nIn a fascinating interview with Louis C.K. from 2014, before the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby reached a cultural tipping point, C.K. spoke out about his childhood admiration for the now-disgraced comic (Apatow \u2014 who would later come to be one of Cosby\u2019s most staunch critics \u2014 also referenced his admiration for the comic in his introduction to the book, with the caveat that he \u201cwas going to talk at length about Bill Cosby, but I can\u2019t, in good conscience, because he has more sexual accusers than I have had partners.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Sick in the Head,\" Apatow's new book of interviews, is full of comedians showing each other the love", "title": "Comedians praise their heroes: The 8 most insightful comic-on-comic raves from Judd Apatow\u2019s new book", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Sick in the Head,\" Apatow's new book of interviews, is full of comedians showing each other the love", "title": "Comedians praise their heroes: The 8 most insightful comic-on-comic raves from Judd Apatow\u2019s new book", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/20/comedians_praise_their_heroes_the_8_most_insightful_comic_on_comic_raves_from_judd_apatows_new_book/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/louie_rock_seinfeld.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Sick in the Head,\" Apatow's new book of interviews, is full of comedians showing each other the love", "title": "Comedians praise their heroes: The 8 most insightful comic-on-comic raves from Judd Apatow\u2019s new book", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/louie_rock_seinfeld.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Schumer, bill cosby, Books, Chris Rock, Comedy, David Letterman, Editor's Picks, Jerry Seinfeld, judd apatow, Louis C.K., sick in the head, Stephen Colbert", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc71\"", "article_summary": "I would be like a toddler watching Carson with them, but Dave \u2014 Dave was like us.\non Cosby (2014)In a fascinating interview with Louis C.K.\nAnd Jerry Seinfeld writes jokes like that.\nGod bless him, Jerry Seinfeld, one of the greatest comedians of all time and one of the cockiest bastards to ever live \u2026 To his credit, he writes some of the best jokes ever.\nI say this with love and considerable distance, because I don\u2019t talk to him and I don\u2019t see him.\u201d4."}
