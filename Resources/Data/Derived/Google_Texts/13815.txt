Oklahoma state senator Nathan Dahm, the man who once introduced the Piers Morgan Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Without Infringement Act, has been stymied in his attempts to declare abortion felony in Oklahoma. But not to worry, in case he runs out of ideas - like the one he he had about about “penalizing” enforcement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Oklahoma - well, here are some dandies he might want to consider:Do away with history requirements on both the high school and college level, and simply strongly urge that Oklahoma students watch up to two hours of the History Channel each week.Ban out-of-state newspapers and magazines, because they don’t always treat Oklahoma with the respect it deserves.More than one trip to the public library a month? Drug tests!Political candidates who aren’t already incumbents? Drug test ‘em.Require Sunday school teachers to honor their Second Amendment responsibilities.Develop an Oklahoma Cyber Defense Unit, which would have the ability to block certain TV programs from invading Oklahoma homes - Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Bill Maher, Neil deGrasse Tyson - cuz sometimes folks don’t always treat Oklahoma with the respect it deserves.Allow athletic coaches to “op-en carry” during both games and practices.Require separate bathrooms for gay people.Install cameras in public restrooms.Ban Sharia Law in the workplace.I think the above should keep Comrade Dahm busy. Not only that, but I strongly suspect that his many, if not most, of his compatriots in the Oklahoma legislature would also support the above.******Today’s blog was helped along considerably by the Chairman of the Board’s CD, “Sinatra Reprise: The Very Good Years.”Because like the man sings, it’s all or nothing at all.*****A: The Only Political Food ShowB: You really CAN put an entire jar of peanut butter between two slices of bread . . .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPf8HYcO3IU****I stuffed a lot of alligators down the tubes to get to where I am today. - Roddy Piper, American wrestlerrsdrake@cox.net
