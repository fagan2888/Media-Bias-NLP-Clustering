( Special to A&E Spotlight )\n\nIf you go What: Cupcake Cabaret Burlesque Revue When: 9 p.m. Friday, June 12. (Doors open at 8 p.m.) Where: Dickens Opera House, 300 Main St., Longmont Tickets: $13 in advance, $15 at the door Info: dickensoperahouse.com or juliadiverdi.com\n\nThe \"Cupcake\" part of the name is because cupcakes were trending big when Julia Diverdi started her dance company in 2008.\n\n\"It was a popular thing you saw everywhere,\" she said. \"Cupcake shops had just opened; everyone really liked cupcakes.\"\n\nThe \"Cabaret\" part of the moniker is because Diverdi, performing as a belly dancer on the Denver burlesque circuit, realized there weren't any burlesque shows in Fort Collins.\n\n\"I thought it would be fun to bring that here, and that's how we started,\" she said.\n\nAnd so the Cupcake Cabaret Burlesque Revue was formed.\n\nThe troupe performs monthly at Avogadro's Number in Fort Collins, but they will move to the Dickens Opera House in Longmont on June 12 when they put on \"Southern Comfort.\"\n\nRose Anne Wheeler's Le Buone Azioni Productions is promoting the Longmont show.\n\n\"I started taking burlesque lessons before I turned 60,\" said Wheeler, whose company is based in Loveland. \"I absolutely fell in love with the art. I love the freedom of movement, the naughtiness of it.\"\n\nWheeler said a venue with a bar near the action is perfect for events such as the Cupcake Cabaret, and the Dickens fit the bill.\n\nDiverdi said her show is different than Denver shows, which feature many solo numbers. The Cupcake Cabaret, she said, is like a themed Las Vegas show with group numbers, group dances and a lot of costume changes.\n\nThe Cupcake Cabaret has performed shows such as \"Sugar and Spice,\" where half the songs reference sweet things and half the songs are a little more sexy.\n\nThe \"Southern Comfort\" production will have a more country-western and southern flavor and consists of a variety of group dancing, strip tease solos and variety acts like jugglers, belly dancers, fire eaters, singers and comedians.\n\n\"There is some degree of playful nudity,\" Diverdi said, which is why the Longmont performance is a 21-older show. Pasties do cover the important parts.\n\nShe said the feedback has been fantastic.\n\n\"Almost all of our shows are sold out; they are packed-house shows,\" said Diverdi, whose troupe offers a variety of classes that include belly dancing and burlesque.\n\n\"It is a lot of fun. Everyone should come and attend a burlesque show at some time in their life. They might be surprised at how much they enjoy it.\"\n\nJessica Benes: 970-669-5050 (ext. 530), jbenes@aespotlight.com, twitter.com/jessicabenes", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_28245335/cupcake-cabaret-burlesque-revue-performs-dickens-opera-house-longmont", "modificationDate": "2015-06-05T07:17:47-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0603/20150603__05AECUP~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  A&E Spotlight", "description": "Cupcake Cabaret prepare for special engagement at Opera House in Longmont.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28245335:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-06T16:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_28245335/cupcake-cabaret-burlesque-revue-performs-dickens-opera-house-longmont", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0603/20150603__05AECUP~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Cupcake Cabaret prepare for special engagement at Opera House in Longmont.", "title": "Burlesque troupe ready to raise the Dickens"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Cupcake Cabaret prepare for special engagement at Opera House in Longmont.", "title": "Burlesque troupe ready to raise the Dickens", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_28245335/cupcake-cabaret-burlesque-revue-performs-dickens-opera-house-longmont", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0603/20150603__05AECUP~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-06T16:00:00-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-06-03T15:53:27-0600", "sailthru.title": "Burlesque troupe ready to raise the Dickens", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Jessica BenesA&E", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0603/20150603__05AECUP~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-06-05T07:18:39-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont TimesCall Colorado news sports features movies health lifestyles gardening music arts dance"}, "article_summary": "( Special to A&E Spotlight )If you go What: Cupcake Cabaret Burlesque Revue When: 9 p.m. Friday, June 12.\nAnd so the Cupcake Cabaret Burlesque Revue was formed.\nThe \"Cabaret\" part of the moniker is because Diverdi, performing as a belly dancer on the Denver burlesque circuit, realized there weren't any burlesque shows in Fort Collins.\nThe Cupcake Cabaret, she said, is like a themed Las Vegas show with group numbers, group dances and a lot of costume changes.\nWheeler said a venue with a bar near the action is perfect for events such as the Cupcake Cabaret, and the Dickens fit the bill."}
