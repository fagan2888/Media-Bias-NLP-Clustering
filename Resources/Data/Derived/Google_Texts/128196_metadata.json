He knows how to get people intrigued and, in some cases, to persuade them to give him money, not unlike the legendary pilot for whom he\u2019s spent much of his life searching \u2014 Amelia Earhart.\n\nAt first, the man who looks a bit like a weather-worn sea captain balks at the oft-repeated notion that his ability to charm, and maybe even his time on stage in high school, helped get him where he is. Then, Gillespie shrugs and capitulates, with a slight smile.\n\n\u201cNo apologies for my charisma. I put it, I hope, to very good use,\u201d he says, sitting on the back porch of the old farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania that is both his home and office of the organization he and his wife, Pat Thrasher, co-founded \u2014 The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, or TIGHAR.\n\nThe group\u2019s mission \u2014 and his life\u2019s goal for more than 25 years \u2014 has been to solve the mystery of Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, who disappeared in the South Pacific on July 2, 1937, during what was supposed to be a round-the-world flight.\n\nThe longstanding official theory is that the plane ran out of gas, crashed and sank into very deep ocean waters somewhere off Howland Island, a tiny speck that the pair missed.\n\nSince 1989, Gillespie and his team have been testing another theory \u2014 and they\u2019re headed back to the South Pacific this month. They surmise that Earhart made an emergency landing on a flat stretch of coral reef off what was then known as Gardner Island, southwest of Howland. Gillespie and members of TIGHAR have made several treks to the distant atoll, now called Nikumaroro. To do so, and to keep the organization running, they have raised millions of dollars in private funding.\n\nGillespie and his team left for the island this past week, on a boat from Fiji, and were scheduled to arrive this weekend. Among other things, they want to check an anomaly seen in sonar imaging on an underwater cliff where the reef drops off.\n\nCould it be the fuselage of Earhart\u2019s Lockheed Electra 10E airplane?\n\nGillespie makes no promises: \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee of success.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s far from the only person with an idea about Earhart\u2019s fate.\n\nAn Australian researcher thinks wreckage spotted by members of his country\u2019s military years ago deep in the remote mountains of a Papua New Guinea island could be Earhart\u2019s. Others are investigating local island lore that Earhart and Noonan crash landed on Mili Atoll, 800 miles northwest of Howland, and were taken prisoner by the Japanese and transported to the island of Saipan, where they died in captivity.\n\nVarious teams who believe the crashed-and-sank theory \u2014an explanation supported by curators at the Smithsonian\u2019s Air and Space Museum \u2014 have tried to pinpoint the crash location using sophisticated equipment to scan the ocean floor and employing computer models, based on the strength of Earhart\u2019s radio transmissions. No one has found a verified plane part or bone fragment.\n\nBut Gillespie \u2014 whose confident, sometimes brash style has made him a lightning rod among searchers \u2014 says he and his team are building their case, slowly but surely.\n\nHe has his admirers. In 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recognized Gillespie at a reception honoring Earhart. A photo of them together hangs on his office wall, along with a framed letter in which she said, \u201cThis great adventure embodies the very hope, ingenuity and boundless optimism of the American spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a reference to the expedition that year in which TIGHAR made underwater sonar images that include the one with the anomaly being examined this month.\n\nBut others question Gillespie\u2019s findings and even his motives.\n\nThere was the filing cabinet discovered on Nikumaroro that the team thought came from Earhart\u2019s plane but later linked to a military plane. The team also excavated a grave that turned up bones, not of the famous pilot but of a tiny infant.\n\nOver the years, Gillespie and his team have found other items in what they think is an old castaway camp. These, they say, aren\u2019t as easily explained \u2014 heel fragments from a woman\u2019s shoe; a rusted jack knife; fragments of toiletry bottles and a compact and other items that they believe are from the 1930s. Their own expert\u2019s high-tech analysis of an object in an old photograph of the island determined it could be Lockheed landing gear jutting from the reef before being washed away, they say.\n\nNone of it is definitive proof, they realize.\n\n\u201cWe have compiled a preponderance of evidence suggesting \u2014 not proving \u2014 that our hypothesis is true,\u201d says Tom King, an archaeologist and longtime TIGHAR member who has helped lead many of the expeditions.\n\nCritics say items found on the island are more likely remnants of an old Coast Guard station or islanders who settled on Nikumaroro in the years after Earhart\u2019s disappearance until the mid-1960s. Some insist that Gillespie has found nothing remotely tied to Earhart.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tim Mellon, a one-time supporter but now a critic, who thinks quite the opposite \u2014 that Gillespie knows more than he reveals. Two years ago, Mellon, a wealthy donor who joined TIGHAR\u2019s 2012 expedition, accused Gillespie in an unsuccessful lawsuit of hiding the fact that he\u2019d found Earhart\u2019s plane so Mellon would donate more than $1 million worth of stock to help fund that expedition. A judge rejected Mellon\u2019s appeal last month, but he\u2019s sticking to his assessment of Gillespie.\n\n\u201cI think his game is basically trying to perpetuate the search,\u201d Mellon said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a business for him . even though he calls it a charity.\u201d\n\nNow Mellon has filed a complaint with the IRS, claiming that TIGHAR has no independent oversight on the salary Gillespie draws and, thus, violates nonprofit guidelines. Already, public records show Gillespie has a tax delinquency in the state of Delaware for more than $55,000 \u2014 an amount Thrasher says they are working to pay back after getting into debt while paying for a defense in the Mellon lawsuit.\n\nGillespie, meanwhile, says the complaint to the IRS is unfounded and calls it \u201cthe pique of a pissed off millionaire.\u201d\n\nDismissing his critics, he adds, \u201cAmelia inspires passion. I understand that . But my skin got thick a long time ago.\u201d\n\nThis year, TIGHAR received its largest ever grant \u2014 $100,000 for this current expedition \u2014 from a \u201cmajor foundation that wishes to remain anonymous,\u201d he says. Over the years, the group has had larger donations from individuals, Mellon included.\n\n\u201cPeople really want this woman found,\u201d Gillespie says.\n\nRobin Jensen, an associate professor of communication at the University of Utah, tries to explain the enduring curiosity.\n\n\u201cIt seems very stark and sad and unfair to just be gone. We want something better than that,\u201d says Jensen, who studied Earhart when she was at Purdue University, where Earhart was on faculty.\n\nAs for Gillespie, his fascination was a while in coming.\n\nThe son of a decorated World War II bomber pilot, the 68-year-old says, \u201cThere was never any question that I was going to fly.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he was old enough, he got his pilot\u2019s license and worked his way through college by flying charters and ferrying, washing and pumping gas into airplanes at a local airport.\n\nGillespie graduated from the State University of New York at Oswego with a history degree in 1969, during the Vietnam War. Since he wore contact lenses, he couldn\u2019t fly in the military, he says. Instead, he enrolled in an Army officer training program and served with the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas.\n\nIn 1971, while attending an air race in New Jersey, he watched from the grandstand as WW II vintage training airplanes collided, killing four of his pilot friends. Witnessing the accident made him ask himself, \u201cWhat can I do to help?'\u201d\n\nAfter the Army, he worked for an insurance company that provided coverage for small airplanes and airports \u2014 and did accident investigation.\n\n\u201cI loved it, the detective work, connecting the dots, figuring out what really happened,\u201d he says.\n\nPersonal setbacks followed, including a divorce and bankruptcy.\n\nThen with a $35,000 loan from a former insurance client who ran a small airport in Delaware, Gillespie pursued an idea he\u2019d had for some time. He wanted to start an organization and search for the long missing \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d a biplane flown by French pilots Charles Nungesser and Francois Coli, who went down after leaving Paris in May 1927 attempting the first east-to-west transatlantic flight. American Charles Lindbergh made his successful flight in the opposite direction days later.\n\nGillespie and his new wife, Pat, applied for nonprofit status in 1986 and started TIGHAR.\n\nThey headed to Maine to investigate local folklore about a plane that had supposedly crashed in a remote forest on the same day the White Bird disappeared. \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t find anything, I was hooked,\u201d Gillespie says.\n\nThat search led to the repeated question, \u201cWhen are you going after Amelia?\u201d\n\nIt seemed an impossible request.\n\nIn Earhart\u2019s last radio transmission to the USS Itasca, the Coast Guard cutter stationed off Howland to help her and Noonan find the island, she was said to have sounded desperate as she stated that they were flying \u201con line 157/337,\u201d a route that some believe put them northwest of Howland with no other place to land. Low clouds blocked their view and they were running low on fuel, she reported.\n\nThen her transmissions to the ship stopped.\n\nBack then, Gillespie thought the crashed-and-sank explanation seemed plausible enough.\n\nThen a couple of retired military navigators who were TIGHAR members came to see him with another theory. What if the plane had been on that line southwest of Howland \u2014 a line that went right by Gardner Island, now Nikumaroro?\n\nAs he and his team began investigating, Gillespie became captivated with two factors that, to this day, he sees as indisputable (though others disagree).\n\nThe first are the distress calls heard on shortwave radio in the days after Earhart\u2019s plane disappeared. Though many have dismissed the radio calls as hoaxes, Gillespie and his team deemed 57 of them \u201ccredible.\u201d They\u2019ve compared dates and times of the calls with tidal patterns, since \u2014 according to his theory \u2014 Earhart and Noonan could only have returned to the plane on the reef at low tide to start the engine and run the radio. Gillespie has been particularly intrigued with hand-written notes of distress calls picked up by shortwave signal by Betty Klenck, then a 15-year-old in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\n\u201cIt reads like a 911 call,\u201d says Gillespie, who has put scans of her notebook on TIGHAR\u2019s website.\n\nThe second indisputable point, Gillespie says, is a purported castaway camp on the island \u2014 though others argue that it could have been made by the crew of the SS Norwich City, a ship that ran aground on the island.\n\nThere are other puzzle pieces, Gillespie says.\n\nHe says his team uncovered a file in England that contained measurements of bones found on Nikumaroro and taken to Fiji years ago. The bones themselves are missing, but an original assessment of them \u2014 that they belonged to a short man, perhaps of mixed race \u2014 is disputed by modern experts who say they could have belonged to a woman of European descent, Gillespie says.\n\nOne of TIGHAR\u2019s more controversial finds is a piece of metal, likely from an airplane, that the team found at Nikumaroro in the early 1990s. First, Gillespie theorized that it could be part of Earhart\u2019s plane\u2019s belly. At a 1992 news conference, he proclaimed that his team had \u201crecovered artifacts that conclusively prove this case.\u201d Several experts came forward to dispute that.\n\nCritics also dispute his current claim that the metal fragment could be the patch that covered a window on Earhart\u2019s plane. They say a stamp on the metal puts its date of manufacture after 1937, though Gillespie has at least one notable supporter.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, you have a very interesting artifact, and if I had to vote today with all that I know, I would say it is the real thing,\u201d wrote Thomas Eagar, a professor of materials engineering and engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a letter to Gillespie. Contacted by the AP, Eagar said he stood by that statement.\n\nAnd so, the search continues.\n\nThe TIGHAR team flew to Fiji on June 6 and later boarded a ship for a five-day journey to Nikumaroro. They plan to be on the island two weeks, with one team using unmanned underwater exploration robots to scan the reef cliff, while a land team searches for more clues.\n\n\u201cThey may find her on this trip, but I think the odds are huge against it,\u201d says Tom Crouch, a senior curator in the aeronautics department at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum. He considers Gillespie a friend and thinks he\u2019s done good work on the historic aircraft preservation front.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve argued about this stuff for 30 years.,\u201d Crouch says. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he knows where Amelia wound up. That\u2019s all.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cI could be wrong.\u201d\n\nMartha Irvine, an AP national writer, can be reached at mirvine@ap.org or at twitter.com/irvineap", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Searching for Amelia Earhart is his life\u2019s quest, despite doubters", "title": "Searching for Amelia Earhart is his life\u2019s quest, despite doubters", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/13/searching-for-amelia-earhart-is-his-lifes-quest-despite-doubters/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_105655_amelia-earhart.jpg", "height": 519}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_105655_amelia-earhart.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T10:40:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:28:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Critics also dispute his current claim that the metal fragment could be the patch that covered a window on Earhart\u2019s plane.\nThe first are the distress calls heard on shortwave radio in the days after Earhart\u2019s plane disappeared.\nThe TIGHAR team flew to Fiji on June 6 and later boarded a ship for a five-day journey to Nikumaroro.\nThere was the filing cabinet discovered on Nikumaroro that the team thought came from Earhart\u2019s plane but later linked to a military plane.\nWe want something better than that,\u201d says Jensen, who studied Earhart when she was at Purdue University, where Earhart was on faculty."}
