That\u2019s 815 times the number arrested after crossing in 2011, according to CNS.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough for a progressive government like Obama\u2019s that such children just be given food and shelter.\n\nTheir sexual-identity needs must be cared for as well, according to the DHHS, along with whatever kind of birth control they favor apparently.\n\n\u201cResidential care providers are required to provide or arrange for the program required services in a manner that is sensitive to the age, culture, religion, dietary needs, native language, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other important individual needs of each UAC,\u201d the grant states, according to CNS.\n\nNow, on one level the \u201cfamily planning\u201d part might make a certain amount of sense. Any time thousands of young human beings of sexually active age get together, couples are going to \u2013 well, get together.\n\nSo, trying to make sure that a flood of teenage illegal aliens doesn\u2019t become a flood of pregnant illegal aliens might be a sensible precaution.\n\nBut only in a government driven by hyper political correctness would ensuring a comfortable homosexual lifestyle for the new arrivals even be a consideration.\n\nAll of this is being handled by the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\nAt some point, sane people have to question this administration\u2019s absolute obsession with things homosexual. These are children who crossed international borders illegally, who don\u2019t have their parents and families and are stuck in a legal limbo thanks to Obama\u2019s now-trademark fecklessness \u2014 and DHHS minions are trying to make sure their gay lifestyle, if they have one, is comfortable.\n\nChances are, sexual intercourse that doesn\u2019t involve rape fears isn\u2019t way up on their list of concerns.\n\nIn every other country in the world \u201crefugees\u201d get a sack of flour and possibly potable water.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s America, apparently, they\u2019re supposed to get videos of Michael Sam\u2019s draft day display of affection or Laverne Cox\u2019s Katie Couric interview.\n\nWith any luck, the Dems and Obamabots figure, some of the boys might decide to marry each other and become good little \u201cModern Family\u201d Democrat voters.\n\nIf we knew you were coming we\u2019d have baked a cake.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "With tens of thousands of illegal alien children crowding detention centers in Texas and Arizona and taking up temporary homes in American military bases, the Department of Health and Human Services apparently wants to make sure they have enough condoms and gay culture.
