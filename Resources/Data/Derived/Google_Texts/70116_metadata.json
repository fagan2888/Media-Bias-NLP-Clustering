The debate began just after 8:30 p.m. and was hosted by ABC News.\n\nIt was to be the only time that the GOP presidential aspirants all met on the same stage between the Iowa caucuses Monday and next week\u2019s primary. It was also the first time that businessman Donald Trump had attended a debate since he snubbed the Fox News debate in Iowa because of a dispute between himself and moderator Megyn Kelly.\n\nThe results of the Iowa caucuses were something of a disappointment for Trump, who had led in polls there and came in second place behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But that wasn\u2019t the only thorn in Trump\u2019s side that evening: He barely beat Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the caucuses.\n\nRubio\u2019s performance that night -- a surprise for many who were closely watching polls -- has been a major boost for his campaign. In New Hampshire polling , where he was in fifth place prior to Iowa, Rubio has jumped to second place behind Trump. The businessman leads with 30.7 percent of the vote, Rubio takes in 16.4 percent and Cruz is tied for third place alongside Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 12 percent support in the Granite State.\n\nBut Trump hasn\u2019t taken Cruz\u2019s Iowa victory sitting down. Days after the caucus results came in, he began accusing the Texan of stealing the caucuses by telling caucus-goers that Dr. Ben Carson, who is in eighth place in New Hampshire, had suspended his campaign. Following those accusations, voicemails given to Breitbart showed that Cruz campaign employees had called caucus sites to tell them that Carson had suspended his campaign and to encourage all caucus supporters to throw their support in for Cruz.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Saturday's debate:\n\n.@realDonaldTrump on ISIS: \"4 years ago, I said bomb the oil and take the oil...
