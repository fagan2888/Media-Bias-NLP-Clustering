Criteria included \u201chigh standards of quality, access to additional capital, helping increase the number of local physicians and specialties, and the ability to handle the changes associated with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d according a news release from Tuomey.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to make sure we do what is in the best interest of Sumter, our employees and our physicians,\u201d said Tuomey Board Chairman John Brabham.\n\nHealthcare officials from Tuomey Healthcare System said they think the merger will improve care for patients at both hospital systems.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to find a culturally compatible, healthy South Carolina system. The employees of Tuomey care about their neighbors and families, and we wanted a similar system.
