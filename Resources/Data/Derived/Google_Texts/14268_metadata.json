But what if the answer to clear skin laid not in a clean face but a dirty one? Working on this premise, the skin company AOBiome LLC has created a topical solution they predict will be used to treat everything from pimples to chronic wounds, but you won\u2019t believe its main ingredient: underarm bacteria.\n\nHave you ever wondered why sweaty underarms smell? Bacteria in our underarms feed off the ammonia we naturally produce in our sweat. The most noticeable by-product of this ammonia consumption is, of course, the unpleasant smell we associate with sweaty underarms. However, smell isn\u2019t the only byproduct of the sweat-eating bacteria.\n\nResearchers have discovered that they also have the uncanny ability to improve overall skin health. Unfortunately, due to our society\u2019s fixation on cleanliness, these \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that naturally run rampant over our skin\u2019s surface are now nearly undetectable. In their latest study, researchers from AOBiome LLC decided to find out what would happen if these ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were to suddenly appear on the human face.\n\nAlthough the idea of purposely applying underarm bacteria to one\u2019s face is anything from pleasant, AOBiome managed to find 24 volunteers who were up for the challenge, according to the press release. The researchers used the Nitrosomonas eutropha strain isolated from organic soil samples and had the volunteers apply the bacterium on their face and scalp for a while, abstaining from cleansing products for two weeks. On the third week, the volunteers\u2019 faces were reanalyzed.\n\nResults showed that the volunteers who used the AOB have \u201cqualitative improvements in skin condition.\u201d Compare this with the control group, which reported either no improvement or minimal, and it seems like these AOBiome scientists might just be onto something.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that live Nitrosomonas are well tolerated and may hold promise as novel, self-regulating topical delivery agents of nitrite and nitric oxide to the human skin,\" explained AOBiome\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Larry Weiss, in the press release. Also, it is important to note that none of those involved in the study experienced any adverse effects from the AOB cream.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first study to show the skin-healing possibilities of bacteria. In May, New York Times journalist Julia Scott shocked the masses when she chose to abstain from showering for an entire month and rely only on AOBiome\u2019s A+Refreshing Cosmetic Mist to keep her \u201cclean.\u201d The journalist reported that other than suffering from oily hair, cleansing with the bacteria-rich mist actually helped to keep her skin smooth and prevented her from developing foul body odor.\n\n\u201cMy skin began to change for the better. It actually became softer and smoother, rather than dry and flaky, as though a sauna\u2019s worth of humidity had penetrated my winter-hardened shell. And my complexion, prone to hormone-related breakouts, was clear. For the first time ever, my pores seemed to shrink,\u201d Scott wrote in her New York Times article.\n\nThe AOBiome researchers are not restricting the bacteria\u2019s benefit to just clean and beautiful skin; they report their next step is to conduct clinical trials to assess the therapeutic potential in patients with diabetic ulcers as well as acne. Diabetic mice with skin wounds were already found to heal more quickly after two weeks of AOB treatment.\n\nOur understanding of the delicate balance between the human body and bacteria is still in its infancy, but if trial results are any proof, a showerless future may soon be upon us.\n\nThe study\u2019s results were presented at the 5th ASM Conference on Beneficial Microbes in Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "clear, skin, solutions, may, lurk, our, armpits, sweat, eating, bacteria, helps, clear", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers have found that the bacteria found in underarms is highly effective at improving skin's overall condition.", "title": "The Secret To Skin Health May Live In Your Armpits", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/clear-skin-solutions-may-lurk-our-armpits-sweat-eating-bacteria-helps-clear-complexion-and-305548", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/29/armpit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers have found that the bacteria found in underarms is highly effective at improving skin's overall condition.", "title": "The Secret To Skin Health May Live In Your Armpits", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/clear-skin-solutions-may-lurk-our-armpits-sweat-eating-bacteria-helps-clear-complexion-and-305548", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/29/armpit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/29/armpit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-09-29T17:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T17:02:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers have found that the bacteria found in underarms is highly effective at improving skin's overall condition."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95af\"", "article_summary": "Have you ever wondered why sweaty underarms smell?\nIn their latest study, researchers from AOBiome LLC decided to find out what would happen if these ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were to suddenly appear on the human face.\nBut what if the answer to clear skin laid not in a clean face but a dirty one?\nBacteria in our underarms feed off the ammonia we naturally produce in our sweat.\nDiabetic mice with skin wounds were already found to heal more quickly after two weeks of AOB treatment."}
