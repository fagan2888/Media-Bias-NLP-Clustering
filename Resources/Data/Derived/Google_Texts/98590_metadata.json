Paul LePage\u2019s latest power play.\n\nOn Friday, the Republican governor refused to swear in Sen.-elect Susan Deschambault, D-Biddeford, who won that vacant seat with 57 percent of votes in a Tuesday special election. It was a response to Democrats\u2019 rejection of LePage\u2019s nominee to a state unemployment appeals board on Thursday.\n\nMaine election law gives unsuccessful candidates five business days after the election to request a recount. LePage\u2019s office said it would wait the full period to swear Deschambault in, even though Republican Steve Martin told the Journal Tribune that he has no plans to ask for a recount.\n\nIt\u2019s leading to some unity between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate: The office of Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, told the Biddeford newspaper that there will be no roll call votes in the chamber until Deschambault is seated.\n\nThibodeau has emerged as one of the Legislature\u2019s top peacemakers over the past year, since he helped negotiate last year\u2019s state budget over LePage\u2019s objections. The governor\u2019s supporters retaliated with robocalls into his district.\n\nTuesday would be the fifth business day after the election. There\u2019s a full calendar in the Senate on Monday, so while the chamber can get some work done, it may put a damper on the Legislature\u2019s plans to adjourn by April 20. \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nWhat\u2019s the true cost of Medicaid expansion?\n\nAdvocates say an analysis from the Maine Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan budget office proves justifies a new proposal to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis year\u2019s bill, from Sen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, is headed for a likely death in the Maine Legislature: Even if it gets through majority Republicans in the Senate \u2014 which it likely won\u2019t \u2014 LePage has promised to veto it, as he has five past expansion proposals.\n\nThe LePage administration has said it \u201cblow a massive hole in the state budget,\u201d costing $500 million over the next five years. But expansion proponents have questioned those figures.\n\nThe nonpartisan office\u2019s estimates gave them ammunition, saying the law would result in increases of federal funding to the tune of $220 million in 2017 and $470 million in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident this legislation would actually save the state millions,\u201d said James Myall, a policy analyst for the liberal Maine Center for Economic Policy, in a statement. \u201cThis is a great deal for Maine.\u201d \u2014 Michael Shepherd\n\nReading list\n\nBest of Maine\u2019s Craigslist\n\nAn \u201cold grey haired guy\u201d tells a \u201cgorgeous young girl in a neon green jacket and low-cut top and jeans\u201d that he was \u201cenjoying your beauty\u201d at Trader Joe\u2019s in Portland. \u201cSorry if I appeared creepy I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just overwhelmed by your beauty, your smile and your wonderful cleavage!\u201d What a charmer.\n\n\u201cDamn girl,\u201d a Lothario in Brunswick says. \u201cI see you at ya work c.v.s\u2026then wal mart with your son.
