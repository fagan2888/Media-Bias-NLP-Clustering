This story was tailor-made for The Colbert Report.\n\n\u201cI give a tip of my hat to Breitbart News for breaking a story, finding out that it\u2019s broken, and then sticking to the story anyway,\u201d Stephen Colbert said last night, pointing out that Breitbart and its columnist, \u201cTeddy Roosevelt,\u201d had left the post up with the same headline with \u201c(Correction)\u201d added to it, and the actual correction at the very bottom of the article. To underscore how shockingly inaccurate Breitbart\u2019s column was, Colbert showed two photos of the two Lynches: One of them was black, and the other was very not-black.\n\n\u201cBy not taking down a headline that you know is false, they are craven political hatchet men,\u201d Colbert railed. \u201cOh \u2014 they eventually took it down? My apologies. They are craven political hatchet men (corrected).\u201d\n\nWatch below via Comedy Central:\n\n\n\n[Image via screenshot]\n\n\u2014\n\n>> Follow Tina Nguyen (@Tina_Nguyen) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I give a tip of my hat to Breitbart News for breaking a story, finding out that it's broken, and then sticking to the story anyway.\"", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-8.35.07-AM.png", "title": "Colbert on Breitbart\u2019s False Lynch Piece: \u2018They Are Craven Political Hatchet Men (Corrected)\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I give a tip of my hat to Breitbart News for breaking a story, finding out that it's broken, and then sticking to the story anyway.\"", "creator": "@tina_nguyen", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-12-at-8.35.07-AM.png", "title": "Colbert on Breitbart's False Lynch Piece: 'They Are Craven Political Hatchet Men (Corrected)'", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "tv", "date": "2014-11-12T09:01:18+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBy not taking down a headline that you know is false, they are craven political hatchet men,\u201d Colbert railed.\nThey are craven political hatchet men (corrected).\u201dWatch below via Comedy Central:[Image via screenshot]\u2014>> Follow Tina Nguyen (@Tina_Nguyen) on Twitter\nBreitbart News recently published a column attacking Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch for representing the Clintons during the Whitewater scandal, only to slowly retract it, and eventually deleting it, when they discovered they\u2019d been writing about the wrong Loretta Lynch.\nTo underscore how shockingly inaccurate Breitbart\u2019s column was, Colbert showed two photos of the two Lynches: One of them was black, and the other was very not-black.\nThis story was tailor-made for The Colbert Report."}
