State Rep. Amy Stephens, a Republican who fought her own party over how to implement “Obamacare,” has joined the Colorado Health Institute as a policy adviser.

In her advisory role, Stephens will ensure that the nonpartisan research institute is researching and analyzing health policy proposals from across the political spectrum, according to a news release from CHI.

“Health is often considered to be a liberal concern, but the mission of the Colorado Health Institute is to make sure that health and health policy is a universal concern,” said Michele Lueck, president and CEO.

Stephens sponsored the legislation that created the Connect for Health Colorado insurance marketplace. She believed the measure protected Colorado from being held hostage from the federal government regarding implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but a number of Republicans accused her of working with the enemy, and they dubbed her bill “Amycare.” Stephens responded that, “Amy cares.”

Stephens also was one of four bipartisan sponsors of this year’s Senate Bill 187, which created the Colorado Commission on Affordable Care.

“One thing that is certain is that we have absolute uncertainty in health care today,” Stephens said. “As a legislator, I’ve appreciated the even-handed professionalism of CHI’s research. Today, I’m excited to be working with CHI to explore health care policy ideas being done nationally and in specific states so that we can evaluate their effectiveness and potential applicability for Colorado.”

The Monument resident served two years as the House majority leader. She is term limited in January.
