One features a woman next to a cardboard cutout of Gosling with the text: \u201cHey girl, you\u2019re excited about easy access to birth control and I\u2019m excited about getting to know you.\u201d Another ad has a woman showing off her birth-control pills while standing next to man and saying: \u201cOMG, he\u2019s hot! Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control.\u201d\n\nLast year, Limbaugh called Fluke a \u201cslut\u201d after she told members of Congress that she wanted subsidized birth control. On his nationally syndicated radio show Wednesday, Limbaugh joked about \u201csome guy\u201d who got in trouble because \u201che used a word he didn\u2019t mean to use.\u201d\n\nSTORY: Rush Limbaugh Strikes Three-Year Deal With Cumulus\n\n\n\nLimbaugh also claimed not to remember Fluke\u2019s name, though it was clear he was revisiting the controversy, which erupted in March 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was this student, this 35-year-old student from Georgetown, who was complaining that, for as often as she had sex, birth control pills were costing her like, what was it, $3,000 a month?\u201d Limbaugh said Wednesday. \u201cShe wanted Obamacare to pay for her contraception.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe told his 12 million or so listeners Wednesday that he didn\u2019t mean to use a slur last year when describing Fluke, he meant to say \u201cpromiscuity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLo and behold, folks, even when I screw up I get it right,\u201d Limbaugh said Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis ad is associating promiscuity with Obamacare,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cI think back, ladies and gentlemen, when I predicted, I warned everybody that\u2019s where this was headed. I forget that woman\u2019s name now \u2026 she was sitting there, and she was basically saying, \u2018Look, I want to have limitless, endless sex, I want you to pay for it\u2019 \u2026 and I was like any normal, responsible person -- I was insulted by this.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ads, which were aimed at young adults in Colorado but have gone viral on the Internet, were unveiled at DoYouGotInsuance.com and are a collaboration between Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado Education. In a bit of irony, ProgressNow was one of the left-leaning groups that attacked Limbaugh last year and accused him of waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nEmail: Paul.Bond@THR.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Paul Bond", "description": "\"Lo and behold, folks, even when I screw up I get it right,\" the radio host told his nationally syndicated audience on Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "\"Lo and behold, folks, even when I screw up I get it right,\" the radio host told his nationally syndicated audience on Wednesday.", "title": "Rush Limbaugh Revisits Sandra Fluke in Wake of Controversial Obamacare Ads", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rush-limbaugh-revisits-sandra-fluke-655693", "image": {"width": 349, "identifier": "//cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2012/03/rush_limbaugh_hbo_screening_a_p.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 466}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-13 13:20:23", "sailthru.title": "Rush Limbaugh Revisits Sandra Fluke in Wake of Controversial Obamacare Ads", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "The Business", "sailthru.tags": "Business,Barack Obama,Rush Limbaugh,Politics", "sailthru.description": "\"Lo and behold, folks, even when I screw up I get it right,\" the radio host told his nationally syndicated audience on Wednesday.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01e7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis ad is associating promiscuity with Obamacare,\u201d Limbaugh said.\nLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control.\u201dLast year, Limbaugh called Fluke a \u201cslut\u201d after she told members of Congress that she wanted subsidized birth control.\nSome provocative online ads promoting Obamacare, including one with an image of actor Ryan Gosling, encouraged Rush Limbaugh to declare Wednesday that he was correct to disparage Sandra Fluke last year with controversial remarks that led to a media firestorm and advertiser defections.\nThe ads, which have been criticized on Fox News and dozens of conservative websites, suggest that women love Obamacare because it gives them access to free contraception.\n\"Lo and behold, folks, even when I screw up I get it right,\" the radio host told his nationally syndicated audience on Wednesday."}
