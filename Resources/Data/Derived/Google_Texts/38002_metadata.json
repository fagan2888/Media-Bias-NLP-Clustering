The first happened after he witnessed pro-reform protestors handing out flyers in the Moscow metro. Even though he was just a passerby, Andrey said he was forcibly taken into custody and interrogated by a group of four men who never revealed for which agency they worked.\n\n\u201cThey said they just wanted to have a talk,\u201d he said.\n\nThe second instance was at a government-sanctioned peace march in Moscow, in which Andrey was participating to protest Russia\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine conflict. He said police began beating protestors without provocation.\n\n\u201cTheir crime? They were just holding signs,\u201d he said.\n\nFed up with life in Russia and with no substantial opposition party or movement to join, Andrey said he did \u201cwhat any sensible man would do.\u201d He left Russia to fight for Ukraine as a member of the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Regiment.\n\nThe Ukraine war has drawn fighters from around the world. Loose government oversight over civilian volunteer battalions opened a pathway for foreign fighters from countries including the United States, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Georgia, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Croatia, Italy and Canada to join the ranks of pro-Ukrainian units with virtually no red tape.\n\nThere is even a Chechen volunteer battalion fighting for Ukraine named after Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Chechen rebel leader who led a war against Russia in the 1990s.\n\nBut recruitment rules were tightened after a push by Kyiv to incorporate volunteer battalions into the National Guard, sending many foreign fighters home. Although, according to an Azov Regiment spokesman, a new law has removed Ukrainian citizenship as a requirement for joining the National Guard.\n\nUnlike the majority of foreign fighters in Ukraine for whom returning home is an option, Andrey said he will never go back to Russia.\n\n\u201cThey will never forgive me,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be persecuted.\u201d\n\nAndrey, however, wasn\u2019t worried about Russian authorities retaliating against his family in Moscow. In fact, with the exception of his grandmother, he said his family generally supported his decision to leave.\n\n\u201cMy grandma went through the Stalin times and it\u2019s difficult to convince her that Putin isn\u2019t right,\u201d he said. \u201cShe watches Russian news and is terrified by what they tell her is going on in Ukraine. It\u2019s all lies of course.\u201d\n\nYears of exposure to Russian propaganda also distorted Andrey\u2019s perception of Ukraine before his arrival. He wondered whether the country had truly been taken over by Nazis and far-right groups as Russian media reports had claimed, or if the Ukrainian war effort was actually a front for NATO expansionism as Russian media sites had also reported.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s all a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got here, I realized the situation was totally different.\u201d\n\nOne of the key differences was the military training and firepower of the separatists.\n\n\u201cWe are not fighting coal miners and tractor drivers, we are fighting trained professional soldiers,\u201d he said, referring to Putin\u2019s characterization of the separatists on Russian TV.\n\n\u201cAnd where do these so-called tractor drivers and coal miners buy grenade launchers?\u201d he added. \u201cFrom a supermarket?\u201d\n\nFollowing the interview, Andrey left for the front lines near Shyrokyne, a small town about eight miles east of Mariupol. His mission that day was to film evidence of separatists using heavy weapons in violation of the Feb. 12 cease-fire agreement.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t get scared anymore before going to the front lines. While at the front, amid the constant sounds of mortars, artillery and small arms, he appeared calm, displaying the muted reaction to danger common to soldiers who have spent much time in combat.\n\nWhen separatists\u2019 heavy weapons ignited a fire in a residential area, sending up plumes of smoke, he climbed to the roof of the house being used as the Azov Regiment\u2019s combat outpost for a better vantage point from which to film the damage. He leaned around a corner, exposing himself to potential sniper fire, and filmed.\n\nAsked earlier what he was fighting for in Ukraine, Andrey succinctly replied: \u201cJustice.\u201d\n\nResponding to a follow-on question, he added: \u201cFor Ukraine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 22-year-old Russian defected from Russia to join a Ukrainian National Guard regiment.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A 22-year-old Russian defected from Russia to join a Ukrainian National Guard regiment.", "title": "Why a Russian Decided to Fight for Ukraine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RussianFeat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-05T16:56:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GyrGBI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A 22-year-old Russian defected from Russia to join a Ukrainian National Guard regiment.", "title": "Why a Russian Decided to Fight for Ukraine", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/RussianFeat.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-04-05T09:57:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-05T16:56:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, U.S. Army"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bdc\"", "article_summary": "Asked earlier what he was fighting for in Ukraine, Andrey succinctly replied: \u201cJustice.\u201dResponding to a follow-on question, he added: \u201cFor Ukraine.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all lies of course.\u201dYears of exposure to Russian propaganda also distorted Andrey\u2019s perception of Ukraine before his arrival.\n\u201cPutin is afraid of a Russian Maidan.\u201dTwo brushes with the \u201cPutin regime\u201d and its repressive tactics ultimately spurred Andrey to leave Russia.\n\u201cShe watches Russian news and is terrified by what they tell her is going on in Ukraine.\nThe second instance was at a government-sanctioned peace march in Moscow, in which Andrey was participating to protest Russia\u2019s involvement in the Ukraine conflict."}
