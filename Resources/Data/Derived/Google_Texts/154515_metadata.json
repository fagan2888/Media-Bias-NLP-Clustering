After all, when you\u2019re urging your kids to go play outside, it\u2019s usually in an attempt to distract them from the allure of the Internet and their devices, not an effort to engage them in yet another online activity or app.\n\nBut don\u2019t be too quick to dismiss technology. While it\u2019s fun, outdoor exploration is also an informal educational pursuit, and the Internet offers a wealth of information that can help match difficult concepts like biology and astronomy with real-life examples in nature, creating a solid foundation for scientific curiosity and inspiring new knowledge on a daily basis.\n\nTurn a tablet or phone into an instrument for inquiry with nature apps to make the great outdoors with your family even greater. Below are some apps to get you started.\n\nSource: Leafsnap\n\nLeafsnap: Identify foliage in a flash with this interactive field guide developed by Columbia University, the University of Maryland and the Smithsonian Institute by taking a photo of leaves, fruit or bark against a sheet of white paper.

Leafsnap is free in the app store and is coming soon to Android.\n\nSource: Merlin Bird\n\nMerlin Bird ID: Magic is for the birds with this fun app that asks five easy questions to help guess which bird has been sighted and then offers tips, resources and additional information including sound clips from Cornell Lab\u2019s Macaulay Library.

Plum\u2019s Photo Hunt: Kids are encouraged to take a closer look at the world through a new lens with scavenger hunts out in nature. Photo missions include quests like finding signs of animal life, taking a weather-related photo or searching for patterns in nature. The app also includes a field journal so little explorers can organize and analyze their findings, as well as a photo editing app to add characters to their shots. Plum\u2019s Photo Hunt is free and only available on iOS devices.\n\nSource: Project Noah\n\nProject Noah: Go out into the field with your citizen scientist and submit photos of nature to help with actual research missions and to earn virtual patches for participation. The community can help identify findings and the constantly growing field guide is informative. This app is recommended for ages 10 and up due to the social component but is best used as a family activity anyway. The Project Noah app is available for free on iOS and Android devices.\n\nKids have a natural curiosity that leads to a desire to learn, and often make discoveries about life and the world they live in through the simple act of playing in the dirt or sitting in a tree. While it\u2019s true that technology isn\u2019t necessary for good old-fashioned outdoor fun, it\u2019s possible to turn screen time into green time with educational apps that explore nature in a way that\u2019s interesting, social and scientific, too.\n\nAshley McCann writes for eBay about her life as a mother of two young boys.
