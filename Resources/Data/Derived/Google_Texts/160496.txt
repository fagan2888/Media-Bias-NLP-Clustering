NAMPA, Idaho (AP) - Police say a north Nampa trailer explosion that burned 2 men had a drug connection. Nampa Police Capt. Curt Shankel said Friday flammable gas ignited in a closed bathroom that was being used for illegal drug processing.

The Idaho Statesman reports (http://is.gd/2fNl9b ) one possibility was that butane was being used to intensify the THC content of marijuana by converting it to a “wax” or oil.

Shankel says the two men were working in a small confined space with no ventilation and something caused a spark midday on Wednesday.

The two men are being treated in a Utah burn unit,

Their names have not been released, and no charges have been filed, pending further investigation.
