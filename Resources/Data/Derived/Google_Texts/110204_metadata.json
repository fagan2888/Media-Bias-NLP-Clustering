He believed the FBI was after him. He was homeless and he didn\u2019t have insurance. He went to a hospital, but \u201cthey would tell me that I was faking it\u201d, said Ali. \u201cIt kept getting worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nSoon after that, Ali, now 61, broke into a building that he thought the FBI was using and set fire to it. That landed him in jail and then, after he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and dual personality disorder, in a state mental hospital.\n\n\n\nWhen he was released in 1998, he was linked to a mental health clinic for medication. \u201cI would only half go,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI kind of got back into gang banging.\u201d The clinic was in a rival gang\u2019s territory so he stopped going. Within weeks, he stopped taking his medication. Within months, he was homeless again.\n\n\n\nHe was living in Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park when, in 2004, he met a caseworker from Thresholds, an Illinois-based care provider for people with mental illnesses. Eventually he was coaxed into enrolling in Thresholds\u2019 program. He moved into assisted-housing and enrolled in Medicaid, the federal program that covers health costs for poor families and people with disabilities.\n\n\n\nUntil 2010, when the Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to all low-income adults, most men in the correctional system were not eligible for Medicaid. It was restricted to children, poor pregnant women, parents with young children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Ali, however, had been eligible for Medicaid throughout because of his disability. But he didn\u2019t enroll until six years after his release.\n\n\n\nThis gap in care is a huge concern as Medicaid adds 15.1 million new beneficiaries \u2013 35% of whom have interacted with the criminal justice system, according to early estimates.\n\n\n\nJails and prisons are enrolling people in the hope that access to care will cut recidivism and costs in the long run. Several studies argue that without healthcare, former prisoners, and especially those struggling with substance abuse or mental illness, are likely to break the law again.\n\n\n\nBut enrollment by itself may not be enough because it\u2019s just the first step in a long, often difficult, process of delivering care.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just medication,\u201d said Peggy Flaherty, Thresholds\u2019 associate director. \u201cThey also need housing. They need jobs.\u201d Thresholds, like many organizations working with people living in extreme poverty, provides \u201cwraparound\u201d services, which includes helping them get housing and employment.\n\n\n\nThresholds also hires and trains formerly homeless people to staff their teams. That helps, according to Flaherty, so the people they are trying to help can \u201cfeel this is somebody who\u2019s walked in similar shoes\u201d.\n\n\n\nTrust a hard thing to come by\n\nThe caseworker who befriended Ali had himself been homeless. \u201cI seen that he really cared about me,\u201d Ali said. Eleven years later, Ali is still on his medication. He now shares his apartment with Patty, his three-legged cat.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe try to offer something they want, something they need,\u201d said Flaherty. \u201cLike a cup of coffee or a bite to eat. We try to develop a relationship. Who are we for somebody to trust?\u201d\n\n\n\nMost providers will tell you trust is a hard thing to gain among the formerly incarcerated.\n\n\n\nAli started using drugs when he was 13 years old. He was first arrested when he was 17. Since then he has spent more than 16 years behind bars. Like Ali, most prisoners in the US are poor, uninsured and overwhelmingly African American. They often alternate between incarceration and homelessness. Many of them have been arrested, detained and incarcerated more than once, given the high rates of recidivism in the US.\n\nThey are also sicker than the average American \u2013 they have a higher incidence of hypertension, asthma, arthritis, HIV, hepatitis C and substance abuse. There are 10 times more people with mental illnesses in prisons and jails than there are in state hospitals. But most of them, like Ali, were probably diagnosed in prison because they have never been to a doctor, not counting visits to the emergency room. This makes them both vulnerable and challenging to work with.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re inside, you have all these dreams, goals, and then reality hits,\u201d said Mary Johnson, a tall 48-year-old with blond hair who spent 15 years in New York state prisons. \u201cPeople get discouraged. Nobody comes home wanting to go back to prison. It\u2019s really hard to put in the work.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohnson is now the director of the Coming Home program, which provides wraparound services to former prisoners, at the Mount Sinai St Luke\u2019s hospital in Manhattan. She joined the program after meeting Kathy Boudin, its co-founder. Boudin, now an adjunct professor at Columbia and New York universities, spent 22 years in prison. Johnson and her colleagues insist this is what gives programs like theirs an edge: having been in prison, they know what makes the formerly incarcerated a particularly challenging group.\n\n\n\nAnd it all circles back to healthcare. If they\u2019re sick or if they aren\u2019t taking medication, they are less likely to find a job. Without a job, it\u2019s harder to find a place to live. Shelters aren\u2019t always ideal because many of Johnson\u2019s patients, especially those who have spent time in solitary confinement, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cYou put him in a room with three people \u2026 it\u2019s easier for him to go out on to the street than stay inside,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nBut enrolling in Medicaid isn\u2019t easy either. For one, people have to provide a permanent address. Enrollees then have to wait 45-90 days as it\u2019s processed. To complicate matters more, there\u2019s a federal law that prohibits Medicaid payments during incarceration, and allows states to either suspend or terminate an inmate\u2019s benefits while they are behind bars.\n\n\n\nA sprawling bureaucracy\n\nAs of December 2014, only 13 states opted for suspension while the rest terminate coverage. So inmates in at least 20 states will have to reapply for Medicaid if they end up in prison a second time and lose coverage. Why? Because until recently Medicaid\u2019s enrollees didn\u2019t include this many former prisoners. So states are still entangled in a web of processes that are transitioning from old to new, from pre- to post-Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we are going to the back room and fixing something,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director, National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cEven seemingly simple changes can involve complicated negotiations across multiple layers of state, local and federal government agencies.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is Medicaid. A sprawling bureaucracy that disburses hundreds of billions of dollars in payments each year. And it\u2019s only getting bigger.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, people returning home from prison often when they are running out of medication and have no immediate access to a doctor find themselves without access to healthcare at a time when they need it the most.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Prisons are enrolling people Medicaid in the hope that access to care will cut recidivism and costs in the long run, but it may not be enough", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Aparna Alluri", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Prisons are enrolling people Medicaid in the hope that access to care will cut recidivism and costs in the long run, but it may not be enough", "title": "Ex-inmates navigate access to healthcare as many remain in Medicaid limbo", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/17/medicaid-prisoners-healthcare-access", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5a49601ae882192b9621130d673f1fd6a6f80cd/0_132_5616_3374/5616.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2edc2481a949aa7f153dd70b9f950949", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/17/medicaid-prisoners-healthcare-access?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/17/medicaid-prisoners-healthcare-access", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/17/medicaid-prisoners-healthcare-access?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a49601ae882192b9621130d673f1fd6a6f80cd/0_132_5616_3374/5616.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/17/medicaid-prisoners-healthcare-access?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Medicaid,US news,Healthcare industry,Obama administration", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-05-17T12:00:02.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aparna-alluri", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-05-17T12:00:02.000Z", "tag": "Medicaid,US news,Healthcare industry,Obama administration"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5a49601ae882192b9621130d673f1fd6a6f80cd/0_132_5616_3374/5616.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=4f685e2e39ce8515e62942702b2d2d11", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Medicaid,US news,Healthcare industry,Obama administration"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe125e\"", "article_summary": "That landed him in jail and then, after he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and dual personality disorder, in a state mental hospital.\nEventually he was coaxed into enrolling in Thresholds\u2019 program.\nHe moved into assisted-housing and enrolled in Medicaid, the federal program that covers health costs for poor families and people with disabilities.\n\u201cEven seemingly simple changes can involve complicated negotiations across multiple layers of state, local and federal government agencies.\u201dThat, in a nutshell, is Medicaid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we are going to the back room and fixing something,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director, National Association of Medicaid Directors."}
