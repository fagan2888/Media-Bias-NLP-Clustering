Those people, hit with tax penalties for going without coverage this year, could be more motivated to buy insurance the next time around.\n\nAlso, given Blue Cross' difficulties processing applications during the 2014 enrollment period, there may be some customers willing to switch from the state's dominant carrier to an alternative if the price is right.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't expect them to take 50 percent or take a huge portion of this group that Blue Cross has,\u201d said Nancy Daas, a partner at CMC Advisory Group, a Chicago-based benefits consultant. \u201cTo some degree they may be thinking that there are some opportunities going forward.\u201d\n\nChicago-based Blue Cross dominated the marketplace in the enrollment for the 2014 plan year, garnering about 200,000 signups from Oct. 1 to April 19, 92 percent of the state's total. The insurance giant was one of five carriers that offered plans on the state's exchange, which was operated in partnership with the federal government's site, HealthCare.gov.\n\nUnited stayed off the Illinois marketplace for 2014 but is planning on entering the exchange with its own individual policies, according to the Chicago Tribune, citing unidentified sources.\n\nA United spokesman would not confirm or deny the report, saying that the company is still evaluating its participation on the exchanges on a state-by-state basis.\n\n\"Although we intend to increase our participation in the exchanges as they mature and develop over time, in the near term we remain focused on the necessary first steps of this process, which include careful evaluation of exchanges on a state-by-state basis, (qualified health plan) application submissions and rate and product filings,\" the spokesman, Kevin Shermach, said in an email.\n\nPRICE PRESSURE\n\nBefore this year, nearly 1 million people in Illinois lacked insurance but had incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid, by some estimates.\n\nIf it does jump in, United will likely have to set its prices within shouting distance of Blue Cross' to be relevant in the market.\n\nFor the 2014 plan year, Blue Cross had the lowest premiums among plans sold in the Chicago area in the bronze, silver and gold metal categories. For example, in Cook County, Blue Cross' three lowest-cost silver plans all had premiums below $182 per month for a 27-year-old individual. No other carrier offered a plan below $200 a month, according to data released last fall by the federal government.\n\nDepending on what plan features the company offers and how it price them, United's entry could help hold down premium increases.\n\n\u201cWith UnitedHealthcare coming in, they're going to try to undersell Blue Cross, which will help keep the rates low for people in the coming year,\u201d said Jim Duffett, executive director of the Campaign for Better Health Care in Champaign.\n\nBlue Cross has been the largest carrier in the state by premium revenue and membership for years, with United a distant second.\n\nIn 2012 United held about 8.4 percent of the total market for individual and group plans. Its share was smaller in individual plans; it covered about 36,000 lives that year, or 6.4 percent of the market, according to research by Carl McDonald, a Boston-based analyst at CitiGroup Global Markets Inc.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Cross covered nearly 309,000 people, for 69.3 percent of the individual market.\n\nCarriers have from May 27 to June 10 to submit plans to the Illinois Department of Insurance for sale on the exchange.
