Fearing that time was running out for Kennedy Brown, the teen\u2019s friends hosted a \u201chigh school in a day\u201d experience by throwing her a surprise prom, crowning her prom queen, and even giving her a private graduation ceremony where she received an honorary diploma. However, there was one wish Brown\u2019s friends would need help with \u2014 getting Kennedy to meet her favorite rapper, Drake.\n\nThe teen\u2019s friends took to social media and launched a new hashtag, #drakeforken,\u201d last Thursday to get Drake\u2019s attention. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure how much time she has left; she has been in hospice and is immobilized. Please help! It would mean the world to her and all of us. Thank you #Drakeforken,\" wrote a student, according to the blog NecoleBitchie. Peyton Campbell, Brown\u2019s classmate and friend, asked viewers on Houston-affiliate station ABC 13 to hashtag \u201cdrakeforken\u201d in the video below. Within hours of the story airing, the trend went viral in Houston and other U.S. cities, causing Twitter to light up with supporters.\n\nWhile Brown\u2019s friends hoped the rapper could at least send her something, Drake decided to plan a surprise home visit when he contacted the teen\u2019s father late Friday night. The rapper made a trip to Houston just for Kennedy, leading Brown to feel overwhelmed and star-struck. However, Brown was not shy to touch Drake\u2019s eyebrows when she sat with him face-to-face.\n\nDrake took to his own Instagram and shared his experience of meeting the courageous 15-year-old cancer patient. \"All these beautiful people #drakeforken turned into #kenfordrake I am so happy,\u201d he wrote. Complete photos of the rapper\u2019s surprise visit can be found on his Instagram.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "drake, drizzy, rapper kennedy brown, brain cancer, terminally ill, cancer patient, wish come true, surprise visit, surprise home visit", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Rap superstar Drake makes a surprise home visit to 15-year-old terminally ill cancer patient Kennedy Brown, granting her dying wish.", "title": "Drake Surprise Visits Young Cancer Patient, Grants Dying Wish [PHOTOS & VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drakeforken-rapper-drake-surprises-terminally-ill-cancer-patient-surprise-home-visit-276614", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/drake-surprise-visits-terminally-ill-cancer-patient-her-house.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rap superstar Drake makes a surprise home visit to 15-year-old terminally ill cancer patient Kennedy Brown, granting her dying wish.", "title": "Drake Surprise Visits Young Cancer Patient, Grants Dying Wish [PHOTOS & VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/drakeforken-rapper-drake-surprises-terminally-ill-cancer-patient-surprise-home-visit-276614", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/drake-surprise-visits-terminally-ill-cancer-patient-her-house.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/drake-surprise-visits-terminally-ill-cancer-patient-her-house.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-14T17:26:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T17:26:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Rap superstar Drake makes a surprise home visit to 15-year-old terminally ill cancer patient Kennedy Brown, granting her dying wish."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded72\"", "article_summary": "However, there was one wish Brown\u2019s friends would need help with \u2014 getting Kennedy to meet her favorite rapper, Drake.\nThe teen\u2019s friends took to social media and launched a new hashtag, #drakeforken,\u201d last Thursday to get Drake\u2019s attention.\nWhile Brown\u2019s friends hoped the rapper could at least send her something, Drake decided to plan a surprise home visit when he contacted the teen\u2019s father late Friday night.\nThank you #Drakeforken,\" wrote a student, according to the blog NecoleBitchie.\nThe rapper made a trip to Houston just for Kennedy, leading Brown to feel overwhelmed and star-struck."}
