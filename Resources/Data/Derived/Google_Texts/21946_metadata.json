Obama\u2019s response rings true: \u201cThe suit is a stunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou notice that he didn\u2019t specifically say what exactly he was objecting to,\u201d the president added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for trying to do something while they\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d the president added later\u2026. What I\u2019ve told Speaker Boehner directly is, \u2018If you\u2019re really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, why don\u2019t you try getting something done through Congress?\u2019 You\u2019re going to squawk if I try to fix some parts of it administratively that are within my authority while you\u2019re not doing anything?\u201d\n\nBut the Speaker is not without defenders. The editorial page of the Wall Street Journal extended its unintentionally amusing support\n\nThe Beltway press is portraying Mr. Boehner as merely serving carrion to the tea party vultures, and no doubt he hopes in part to sate the political appetites of the backbench. But we doubt he\u2019d wager the House\u2019s reputation, and his own, on a novelty lawsuit that the courts wouldn\u2019t hesitate to toss as frivolous. From what we know of the Speaker\u2019s deliberations, he\u2019s been persuaded on the merits.\n\nLook, if the Speaker were genuinely persuaded on the merits of the litigation, he would have mentioned at least one example of executive overreach to bolster his point. Indeed, if Boehner actually believed his own rhetoric, he wouldn\u2019t have urged Obama to circumvent Congress while holding a press conference complaining about Obama circumventing Congress.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the funny part. Rather, what\u2019s amusing is the WSJ editorial board assuming that the upcoming lawsuit must have some merits because Boehner wouldn\u2019t \u201cwager the House\u2019s reputation, and his own\u201d on an election-year p.r. stunt.\n\nThe obvious follow-up question is, what reputation would that be?\n\nWho would have guessed that John Boehner and the House of Representatives had reputations to wager? Boehner\u2019s personal approval rating sits at 31 percent . Congress\u2019 approval rating is a muscular 16 percent . There\u2019s not a whole lot either could do to make the public hate them more. That\u2019s been the story of the Boehner speakership . The failure of his \u201cPlan B\u201d tax bill on the eve of the fiscal cliff? An embarrassment for Boehner . The collapse of his debt proposal during last autumn\u2019s budget crisis? An embarrassment for Boehner . The defeat of the farm bill last summer? An embarrassment for Boehner . Even his reelection as speaker was a humiliating affair , marked by rebellions and protest votes. House Republicans shut down the government on his watch. The guy is a walking own-goal. And I\u2019m not entirely sure where the Journal got the idea that Boehner wouldn\u2019t put himself in the positon of looking like an idiot.The guy is a walking own-goal.\n\nBy all appearances, Boehner and his aides will eventually think of some grounds for the lawsuit they\u2019re so eager to file and the partisan plan will be set in motion: fundraising letters will be sent, Fox News segments will be produced, speeches will be delivered, and podiums will be pounded upon. The Republicans\u2019 commitment to their silliest meme \u2013 Obama\u2019s an out-of-control tyrant \u2013 will have the frivolous lawsuit the far-right demands.\n\nBut Boehner\u2019s willingness to \u201cwager\u201d his and the institution\u2019s \u201creputation\u201d is barely an afterthought. If the Speaker was deeply concerned about such niceties, he wouldn\u2019t have threatened to crash the economy on purpose in debt-ceiling hostage crises; he wouldn\u2019t have shut down the government; he wouldn\u2019t have held several dozen pointless votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act; and he might have tried working on governing at some point over the last three-and-a-half years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Boehner's willingness to \"wager\" his and the institution's \"reputation\" is barely an afterthought in the GOP plan to sue President Obama.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/boehner-prepared-wager-the-houses-reputation", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Boehner's willingness to \"wager\" his and the institution's \"reputation\" is barely an afterthought in the GOP plan to sue President Obama.", "title": "Is Boehner prepared to 'wager the House's reputation'?", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/boehner-prepared-wager-the-houses-reputation", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/boehner_new_congress.jpeg-081e1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Is Boehner prepared to 'wager the House's reputation'?", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/boehner-prepared-wager-the-houses-reputation", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/boehner_new_congress.jpeg-081e1.jpg?itok=ZRctITre", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Boehner's willingness to \"wager\" his and the institution's \"reputation\" is barely an afterthought in the GOP plan to sue President Obama."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-27T10:02:08-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Boehner's willingness to \"wager\" his and the institution's \"reputation\" is barely an afterthought in the GOP plan to sue President Obama.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Is Boehner prepared to 'wager the House's reputation'?", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/boehner-prepared-wager-the-houses-reputation", "published": 1, "date": "06/27/2014 10:02:08 EDT", "tags": "barack-obama,house-republicans,john-boehner,rachel-maddow-show"}, "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, House Republicans, John Boehner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebff\"", "article_summary": "Rather, what\u2019s amusing is the WSJ editorial board assuming that the upcoming lawsuit must have some merits because Boehner wouldn\u2019t \u201cwager the House\u2019s reputation, and his own\u201d on an election-year p.r.\nBut we doubt he\u2019d wager the House\u2019s reputation, and his own, on a novelty lawsuit that the courts wouldn\u2019t hesitate to toss as frivolous.\nAnd I\u2019m not entirely sure where the Journal got the idea that Boehner wouldn\u2019t put himself in the positon of looking like an idiot.The guy is a walking own-goal.\nWho would have guessed that John Boehner and the House of Representatives had reputations to wager?\nBut Boehner\u2019s willingness to \u201cwager\u201d his and the institution\u2019s \u201creputation\u201d is barely an afterthought."}
