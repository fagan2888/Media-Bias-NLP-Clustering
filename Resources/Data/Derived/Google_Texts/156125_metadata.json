NEA membership dropped from 3,003,885 last August to 2,963,121 this August.\n\nNEA, the nation\u2019s largest labor union, has lost 272,014 members since 2009. The union paid Van Roekel $2.2 million from 2010-2014.\n\nLosing more than a quarter of a million members didn\u2019t keep Van Roekel from getting a huge raise this year, and taking millions of dollars from workers didn\u2019t prevent Van Roekel from being praised by union advocates in a series of videos recorded for an NEA meeting in July.\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees president Lee Saunders called Van Roekel \u201ca force for unity in the labor movement, and for protecting all public services \u2014 helping bring NEA, AFSCME, AFT and SEIU together in an unprecedented partnership to face our challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs someone who is truly committed to solidarity, you\u2019ve taken on the fight for workers\u2019 rights not just for your own members, but for all working people across this country,\u201d added Saunders, who was paid $350,058 in 2013.\n\nThe NEA Representative Assembly meeting in Washington, D.C. in July was Van Roekel\u2019s last as union president, and also featured remarks from Thomas Perez, President Obama\u2019s Labor Department secretary.\n\n\u201cThank you for fighting for a public education system that works for all of our children,\u201d Perez said in a farewell video to Van Roekel. \u201cThank you for being a visionary within the labor movement, for advancing the role that unions play in growing the middle class and expanding opportunity for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for being such a stalwart defender of collective bargaining rights for all workers \u2014 particularly public employees when they have come under fierce and unfair attack,\u201d Perez continued.\n\nWhat Perez and union bosses describe as a \u201cfierce and unfair attack\u201d has in fact been a trend toward freeing government workers from Big Labor\u2019s grasp. NEA membership losses have been due in part to reforms in Wisconsin and Michigan, where new public school contracts may no longer make paying union dues a requirement for having a job.\n\nDespite the union\u2019s sinking membership, Van Roekel was not the only NEA leader taking home a huge salary plus expenses this year. Executive Director John Stocks was paid $412,398, vice president Lily Eskelsen Garcia was paid $345,728, and secretary-treasurer Becky Pringle was paid $337,618. NEA paid 45 officers and employees more than $200,000.\n\nEskelsen Garcia is now president of NEA, elected by union delegates to serve as Van Roekel\u2019s replacement.\n\nIn 21 states and the District of Columbia, teachers and others covered by NEA contracts can still be forced to pay union bosses as a condition of employment. While NEA membership has declined by 8.4 percent, the number of people paying mandatory NEA \u201cagency fees\u201d increased from 86,746 in 2009 to 90,255 this year.\n\nNEA is a business selling union representation, and even with legal privileges most organizations wouldn\u2019t dream of \u2014 in addition to forced fee laws, unions pay no taxes on member dues and are protected by cumbersome requirements for dropping union representation \u2014 business hasn\u2019t been good. Officer pay hasn\u2019t reflected this, but NEA has shed staff at a rapid rate.\n\nExcluding members of the union\u2019s board of directors, NEA headquarters in Washington, D.C., reported payments to 671 officers and employees in fiscal year 2009. This year, NEA paid only 540 officers and employees.\n\nNEA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the membership numbers and officer pay reported in the union\u2019s latest annual filing with the Labor Department.", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Education Association president Dennis Van Roekel received a huge pay raise this year while the teachers union lost more than 40,000 members.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "National Education Association president Dennis Van Roekel received a huge pay raise this year while the teachers union lost more than 40,000 members.", "title": "Teachers union boss loses 40,000 members, gets a raise - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/AP191777969557.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-26T00:32:31+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/184668/nea-lose-members/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "National Education Association president Dennis Van Roekel received a huge pay raise this year while the teachers union lost more than 40,000 members.", "title": "Teachers union boss loses 40,000 members, gets a raise - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/AP191777969557.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2014-11-26T04:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T00:32:31+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Dennis Van Roekel, NEA, National Education Association, Big Labor, teachers union, forced dues, forced unionism, Thomas Perez, Lee Saunders"}, "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgNational Education Association president Dennis Van Roekel received a huge pay raise this year while the teachers union lost more than 40,000 members.\nThe union paid Van Roekel $2.2 million from 2010-2014.\nNEA, the nation\u2019s largest labor union, has lost 272,014 members since 2009.\nNEA membership dropped from 3,003,885 last August to 2,963,121 this August.\n\u201cThank you for fighting for a public education system that works for all of our children,\u201d Perez said in a farewell video to Van Roekel."}
