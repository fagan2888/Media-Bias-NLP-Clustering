Portugal\u2019s Rui Costa was third, 28 seconds behind Martin.\n\nWith two mountain stages still to come, Martin leads Dumoulin by 28 seconds in the overall standings, while Costa moved up to third, 1 minute, 5 seconds behind.\n\nSaturday\u2019s eighth stage takes the peloton from Delmont to the ski resort of Verbier. The tour finishes Sunday.\n\n\u201cNow for the weekend, anything is possible,\u201d Martin said. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s stage is the easier of the remaining two. The last climb, I hope I can treat it like a time trial, find a good rhythm and hang on to the other guys. I have the jersey, but it will not be easy.\u201d\n\nTeam Sky\u2019s Sergio Henao was involved in a training accident and retired from the race before the time trial. Martin\u2019s teammate Tom Boonen also pulled out, still feeling the effects of a crash in training earlier this month.\n\nBoonen\u2019s Quick-Step team said the one-day race specialist has a right hip injury that requires a few days of rest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, especially because I am sad I can\u2019t be there to help Tony Martin defend his leader\u2019s jersey at Tour de Suisse,\u201d Boonen said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a wise decision to stop now and recover.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tony Martin of Germany extends overall lead at Tour de Suisse", "title": "Tony Martin of Germany extends overall lead at Tour de Suisse", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/tony-martin-of-germany-extends-overall-lead-at-tour-de-suisse/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__tour-de-suisse-lawson-craddockp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__tour-de-suisse-lawson-craddockp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T12:01:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:47:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda886\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, especially because I am sad I can\u2019t be there to help Tony Martin defend his leader\u2019s jersey at Tour de Suisse,\u201d Boonen said.\nWORB, Switzerland \u2014 Time trial world champion Tony Martin of Germany extended his lead in the Tour de Suisse with a dominant performance against the clock in the race\u2019s seventh stage on Friday.\nMartin was in a class of his own on the 24.7-kilometer (15-mile) course and beat Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands by 22 seconds.\nWith two mountain stages still to come, Martin leads Dumoulin by 28 seconds in the overall standings, while Costa moved up to third, 1 minute, 5 seconds behind.\nPortugal\u2019s Rui Costa was third, 28 seconds behind Martin."}
