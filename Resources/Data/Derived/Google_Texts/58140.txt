Winter is finally upon us as the first storm system of the season is heading toward KELOLAND.

Along with the warning comes a significant amount of snow and high winds. There will be a chance of rain in the late afternoon and will switch to snow as the night progresses.

The temperatures should stay normal until Monday, when a big cool down is expected. Highs on Monday will be in the 20 to 30 range.

The high winds coupled with the snow will make travel difficult. Drivers are asked to slow down and be patient. Visit Safe Travel USA for the latest highway conditions.
