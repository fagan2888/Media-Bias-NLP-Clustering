You\u2019re not alone\n\nStill waiting for your MNsure tax form? You\u2019re not alone\n\nStill waiting for your MNsure tax form? You\u2019re not alone\n\nSt. Paul, MN \u2013 MNsure has been slow to provide its customers with necessary tax forms this year, irking some who have had to wait weeks for the documents.\n\nAlthough the 1095-A forms were supposed to be mailed by Jan. 31, batches of several hundred weren\u2019t sent out until the past few days, officials with the health insurance exchange said Friday. And, the officials said, about 1,300 forms had yet to be sent.\n\nThe 1095-A forms are sent to anyone who bought health insurance through MNsure or a similar exchange. Subsidies provided to eligible customers under the federal Affordable Care Act are based on income estimates and then revised based on the 1095-A.\n\nFrustrated MNsure customer Karen Snedecor of St. Paul said the delay was \u201cthe last straw.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d Snedecor said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another in a long list of irritating things that have been happening with MNsure over the last two years.\u201d\n\nMNsure spokespeople said the process has been slow because the agency is trying to ensure every form is accurate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being careful with the information we\u2019re sending out,\u201d said Allison O\u2019Toole, MNsure\u2019s deputy director for external affairs. \u201cBig picture, they are nearly all out. We are working hard to complete them.\u201d\n\nThough MNsure debuted in the fall of 2013, this year is the first year it has had to distribute the 1095-A forms.\n\nIn all, MNsure had to send out about 33,000 of the documents, including 480 on Wednesday and an additional 875 on Friday.\n\nSnedecor said she has called repeatedly for help\n\n\u201cI started calling in February when I did not get the form,\u201d she said. \u201cEach time they assured me it had been sent out. The last time they said, we\u2019ll send another one out.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly a month of calling, she said, the form arrived this week.\n\nO\u2019Toole defended the customer service staff, saying they are \u201cskilled and specialized now\u201d and in a \u201ccompletely different place\u201d from the problems MNsure experienced a year ago.\n\nMNsure, a state-run exchange, is not alone in having problems with 1095-A forms. About 800,000 people who purchased health insurance through federally run exchanges were mailed incorrect forms.\n\nIn Minnesota, O\u2019Toole said there are \u201cno widespread reports of errors\u201d in the 1095-A forms that have been sent out.\n\nHowever, some Minnesotans have complained of errors, including Mark Waggoner, who cited problems with his form at a MNsure board of directors meeting Feb. 18.\n\nMNsure spokespeople didn\u2019t identify specific problems that have contributed to the delay in getting the forms out. Instead, they said it was a learning process and predicted better results in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve gone through the process of issuing 1095-A forms,\u201d said Jenni Bowring-McDonough, MNsure\u2019s media relations coordinator.\n\n\u201cThis is all work that will contribute to a better experience next year.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneer Press is a media partner with Forum News Service.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Minnesota,MNsure,Minnesota,Insurance,Tax,forms", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "WDAZ", "description": "St. Paul, MN  \u2013 MNsure has been slow to provide its customers with necessary tax forms this year, irking some who have had to wait weeks for the documents.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 1095-A forms were supposed to be mailed by Jan. 31, batches of several hundred weren\u2019t sent out until the past few days, off...", "title": "Still waiting for your MNsure tax form?
