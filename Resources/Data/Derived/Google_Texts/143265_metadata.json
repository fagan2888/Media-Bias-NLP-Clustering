Williams is founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law, and Cynthia Thomas Calvert is the center's senior advisor on family responsibilities discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace discrimination against employees based on caregiving responsibilities\u2014called \u201cfamily responsibilities discrimination\u201d\u2014is often blatant. Many employers seem to know enough not to say openly \u201cThis is no job for a woman,\u201d but some seem to feel perfectly comfortable saying \u201cThis is no job for a mother.\u201d\n\nFor example, one woman\u2019s supervisor in New Mexico texted her: \u201cYou have a child who is medically disabled, you do not belong in the workplace,\u201d according to a 2015 complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In a case tried in Colorado, a woman\u2019s boss told her it was \u201ctoo bad she had to go and get pregnant\u201d after the promotion she had been promised went to a man.\n\n\n\nA new report by Cynthia Thomas Calvert for the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, found a 269% increase in this type of lawsuit in the past decade. Employees won two-thirds of cases that went to trial \u2014a far higher success rate than other employment discrimination cases\u2014and employers paid about half a billion dollars in verdicts and settlements in the decade ending in 2015, more than double the amount paid out in the decade before.\n\nEmployers take note: discriminating against caregivers can be an expensive proposition. Here are the four main trends of the study:\n\n1. Cases involving eldercare increased 650% over the last decade.\n\nMen are nearly three times more likely to bring cases involving eldercare as compared with childcare: nearly 40% of cases involving eldercare were brought by men. Employees are less likely to win eldercare cases because workers have better legal protections with respect to childcare than eldercare. Still, there is plenty reason for employers to be concerned.\n\nFor example, a surgical nurse took family leave intermittently over a period of two years to care for her ailing mother. She was entitled to the leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act but was nonetheless disciplined and ultimately fired. Her supervisor allegedly noted: \u201cWell, how much longer can she last\u2026as sick as she is,\u201d and, when she was fired: \u201cYou won\u2019t have to call in ever again about momma.\u201d The case settled for an undisclosed amount.\n\n2. Pregnancy discrimination remains the most-common type of caregiver discrimination.\n\nAlthough pregnancy discrimination has been illegal since 1978, it has increased by 315% in the past decade. Pregnancy discrimination claims frequently arise when pregnant women are denied simple workplace accommodations that would allow them to continue to work, such as giving a cashier a stool when her doctor orders her not to stand all day. A 2015 Supreme Court case gave pregnant women greater rights to workplace accommodations under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and federal courts also are increasingly likely to order accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n3. There has been a sharp increase in family caregiving cases brought by men.\n\nFully 25% of the calls to the Center for WorkLife Law\u2019s Hotline now are from men. Men are less likely to win than women, chiefly because courts have difficulty seeing how treating fathers differently from mothers is sex discrimination. But some men win their cases. In Dean v. Champion Exposition Services a graphic designer\u2019s lawsuit was settled after he was denied permission to work from home to care for his premature son, despite the fact that pregnant women and mothers allegedly had been allowed to work from home. Cases involving paternity leave have increased sharply, 336% over the past decade, although the number remains small.\n\nRead more: Dads Are Stepping Up in Fight for Caregiver Rights\n\n4. Breastfeeding cases have increased by 800%.\n\nWhile few cases involving breastfeeding have made it to the courts, recent court rulings may change that. For example, in Allen-Brown v. District of Columbia, when a police officer requested not to go out on patrol while she was breastfeeding because she was unable to wear a bulletproof vest, she allegedly was told to patrol or take leave. The federal district court held that breastfeeding was a medical condition related to pregnancy and allowed the case to go forward under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Breastfeeding employees also have new rights under some state laws and the Affordable Care Act to breaks for nursing in a clean and private place that is not a bathroom.\n\nSo what can employers do to support caregivers? Five simple lessons can help keep employers out of trouble.\n\nDiscriminating against employees because they are mothers is sex discrimination. Family accommodations offered to mothers, including parental leave, must be equally offered to fathers. It is illegal to discriminate against employees who are caring for a person with disabilities. Men as well as women covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act have a legal right to take leave to care their parents. They should provide pregnant women with workplace accommodations and give new mothers breaks and a clean, private place for expressing milk.\n\nThese five simple lessons will make the workplace fairer for employees with family responsibilities\u2014and will help save employers a bundle of money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New report for the Center for WorkLife Law found discriminating against parents can be an expensive proposition for employers", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "And breastfeeding cases are up 800%", "title": "Caregiver Discrimination Lawsuits Increased 269% in the Last Decade", "url": "http://time.com/4337233/family-responsibilities-discrimination/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/caregiver-discrimination.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/caregiver-discrimination.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "And breastfeeding cases are up 800%", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Caregiver Discrimination Lawsuits Increased 269% in the Last Decade"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "worklife law, family responsibilities lawsuits, caregivers, breastfeeding, pregnancy discrimination, sexism, eldercare, childcare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "WorkLife Law, family responsibilities lawsuits, caregivers, breastfeeding, pregnancy discrimination, sexism, eldercare, childcare"}, "article_summary": "Pregnancy discrimination remains the most-common type of caregiver discrimination.\nAlthough pregnancy discrimination has been illegal since 1978, it has increased by 315% in the past decade.\nThe federal district court held that breastfeeding was a medical condition related to pregnancy and allowed the case to go forward under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.\nFor example, a surgical nurse took family leave intermittently over a period of two years to care for her ailing mother.\nThey should provide pregnant women with workplace accommodations and give new mothers breaks and a clean, private place for expressing milk."}
