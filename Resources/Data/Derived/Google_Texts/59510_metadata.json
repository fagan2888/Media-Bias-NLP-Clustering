( Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call )\n\nPromise Keeper staffer Jeff Wilson today freely shares the story of how he came to cherish a Porta Potty as a prayer closet when he lived behind bars in an overcrowded prison.\n\nA 2005 arrest in California for igniting materials in a hotel dumpster after over-imbibing on alcohol that evening led to his felony arson conviction.\n\nConsequently, for the next six years, nine months, and 21 days, he lived a life of 7-minute meals, 3-minute showers, and precious few annual visits from his wife and three kids trying to make it back in Longmont without him \u2014 the breadwinner and rock of the family.\n\nBut in his disgrace, Wilson, 51, found a fresh sense of God's grace and a calling on his life to offer hope to other men who make mistakes.\n\n\"My story is in part the reason men need PK,\" he said of the Denver-based Christian men's ministry co-founded in 1990 by then University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney and noteworthy for hosting stadium-size conferences nationwide in the 1990s.\n\nIf you go What: Promise Keepers: Men of Integrity conference, \"Unleashing the Warrior.\" Featuring nine speakers including PK cofounder, Bill McCartney, and Big Daddy Weave in concert. When: Friday, July 25, and Saturday, July 26 Where: Budweiser Events Center, 5290 Arena Circle, Loveland Cost: $89 adult ($69 discounted ticket if registered with promotional code, LOVELAND69); $79 per group of 2 to 9 adults; $69 per group of 10 or more adults; $69 per \"Legacy\" partner (monthly PK supporters); $69 per pastors, students and military personnel.

But in the nearly 25 years since PK began, the challenge has not changed,\" he continued. \"We know every man needs relationships with other men to help him stay accountable and keep promises in those areas.\"\n\nBrotherhood matters\n\nLooking back, Wilson is convinced that being transparent in a men's group about his midlife crisis would have curtailed the drinking that led to his crime.\n\nBut after PK laid him off the year before as its national development director, he fell out of such fellowship and into what he calls \"a dark place\" as he traveled as a development consultant.\n\n\"It's quite a cycle to go from Promise Keepers to prison and back to Promise Keepers again,\" Wilson said.\n\nYet, that is exactly what he did after his Sept. 13, 2012, release from the California State Prison in Corcoran, where he volunteered as a chaplain and baptized inmates, some of them gang members tatooed from head to toe and in prison for life.\n\nPK rehired him as its conference services manager in early 2013, and he began planning the upcoming PK conference, \"Unleashing the Warrior,\" at the Budweiser Events Center in Loveland July 25 -26.\n\nTo pull it off, Wilson reached out to former PK staffer Ed Navva \u2014 now the volunteer men's ministry leader at New Creation Church in Longmont and volunteer cofounder of Men's Ministry Alliance of Northern Colorado \u2014 to serve as the PK Loveland conference volunteer coordinator.\n\n\"But it was not just about networking and who knows who,\" Wilson said. \"It's about the heart of this man.\"\n\nPK hired both men in January 1996, when it hosted a record 22 conferences.\n\nCompared to those days before email and Google docs \u2014 during the late 1990s, when they used phones and fax machines to mobilize thousands of volunteers to work stadium crowds \u2014 the Loveland conference at the 5,000-seat arena with 200 volunteers seems easy.\n\nYet, Navva, 64, explained that he and Wilson's ongoing call to men's ministry comes from a very personal place of brokenness.\n\n\"And I want men to experience the 'more' of God, not just the 'enough' of God,'\" he said.\n\nThe comeback trail\n\nWilson says he experienced that gift about 100 feet from the main prison gate when he met his wife and daughter with hugs and sobs in the parking lot after his emancipation.\n\nFor the first time in nearly seven years he wore civilian clothes and sensed no one watching him \u2014 until his daughter said, \"Turn around, Dad,\" he recalled.\n\nThere stood his oldest son, a Marine in fatigues.\n\nBen Wilson got back with his unit from Afghanistan at 10 p.m. the previous day and drove through the night on special leave in a borrowed car from Camp Pendleton in San Diego to meet him.\n\n\"Because of what I did, I didn't deserve that,\" Wilson said. \"I felt like the prodigal's son who had come home, and he's my son.\"\n\nWhen his short leave ended, Ben Wilson drove back to the base, and the rest of the family drove home to reunite with the youngest family member then studying at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.\n\nAlong the way, the trio took pictures at the Utah border by the \"Welcome to Colorful Colorado\" sign.\n\nWilson also gratefully noted the Longmont city limit sign.\n\nThen, a bittersweetness washed over him when he walked through their front door.\n\nBesides lost years with his family, his incarceration forced his wife to sell their new house on a cul-du-sac and move into an apartment.\n\nIt did not feel like home at first.\n\n\"But in every mess, there is a message. In every test, a testimony. ... (PK) conferences remind men that they are not alone in their struggles,\" Wilson said. \" ... And the direct beneficiary of a changed man is his wife and family, church and community.\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at Mellskog@msn.com or 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/faith/ci_26182249/promise-keepers-prison-and-back-longmont-man", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCAPRO~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "Promise Keeper staffer Jeff Wilson today freely shares the story of how he came to cherish a Porta Potty as a prayer closet when he lived behind bars in an overcrowded prison.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26182249:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-20T08:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/faith/ci_26182249/promise-keepers-prison-and-back-longmont-man", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCAPRO~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Promise Keeper staffer Jeff Wilson today freely shares the story of how he came to cherish a Porta Potty as a prayer closet when he lived behind bars in an overcrowded prison.", "title": "From Promise Keepers, to prison, and back for Longmont man"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Promise Keeper staffer Jeff Wilson today freely shares the story of how he came to cherish a Porta Potty as a prayer closet when he lived behind bars in an overcrowded prison.", "title": "From Promise Keepers, to prison, and back for Longmont man", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/faith/ci_26182249/promise-keepers-prison-and-back-longmont-man", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCAPRO~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-20T08:00:00-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "From Promise Keepers, to prison, and back for Longmont man", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0719/20140719__20TCAPRO~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Faith", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-07-20T08:05:14-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-20T08:00:00-0600", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-07-20T07:44:35-0600", "news_keywords": "longmont colorado articles faith religion god"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce376\"", "article_summary": "\"It's quite a cycle to go from Promise Keepers to prison and back to Promise Keepers again,\" Wilson said.\nYet, Navva, 64, explained that he and Wilson's ongoing call to men's ministry comes from a very personal place of brokenness.\nIf you go What: Promise Keepers: Men of Integrity conference, \"Unleashing the Warrior.\"\n\"We know every man needs relationships with other men to help him stay accountable and keep promises in those areas.\"\n( Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call )Promise Keeper staffer Jeff Wilson today freely shares the story of how he came to cherish a Porta Potty as a prayer closet when he lived behind bars in an overcrowded prison."}
