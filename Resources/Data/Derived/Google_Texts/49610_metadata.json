Anthony and Frederick Douglass Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act,\u201d a law passed in 2011 making it a felony for a doctor to knowingly perform an abortion if it is known that the mother is being coerced into the procedure because of the race or the sex of the unborn baby. They said the law was prejudiced against minorities (even though the law was all-encompassing and did not single out any racial group in its enforcement) and thus restricted access to abortion.\n\nThe federal district court judge in this case ruled that they lacked legal standing and dismissed the case.\n\nNow, the Arizona chapter of the NAACP and the National Asian-Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum, with the representation of the American Civil Liberties Union, is suing in the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. They are now claiming that the law is rooted in racial stereotypes. Once again, the law contains no racial specifications.\n\nThe law generally applies to doctors who would knowingly perform an abortion on someone pressured into the act because someone else was not happy with the race or gender of the unborn baby. While that alone smacks of racist intent, add to it the fact that it is reported that none of the plaintiffs or their lawyers can point to proof that the law has had a disparate impact or that minorities are already at risk of prosecution.\n\nDerryck Green, a member of the National Center\u2019s Project 21 black leadership network, commented on the previous lawsuit and the absurdity of the NAACP\u2019s crusade against protecting the unborn from the hate crime of an abortion based solely on sex or race. He is now commenting on this newest lawsuit, which could eventually see this argument before the U.S. Supreme Court:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/P21DerryckGreen.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1405829277754", "description": "Having been thrown out of one court already, the NAACP is once again suing to make it legal to abo...", "title": "NAACP, ACLU Sue Again to Make it Legal to Abort Babies Because of Race,\u00a0Sex - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "Having been thrown out of one court already, the NAACP is once again suing to make it legal to abort babies in the state of Arizona solely on the basis of the race or sex of the unborn.\nThe federal district court judge in this case ruled that they lacked legal standing and dismissed the case.\nHe is now commenting on this newest lawsuit, which could eventually see this argument before the U.S. Supreme Court:\nThey are now claiming that the law is rooted in racial stereotypes.\nOnce again, the law contains no racial specifications."}
