Police got the call just before 10 p.m. from the Summerfield Village apartment complex, which is just a half a mile east of the OU campus. Officers arrived and found the victim, 41-year-old Kenneth Keeling, lying on the ground suffering from a gunshot wound.\n\nKeeling was transported to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, according to police.\n\nDetectives spent several hours here collecting evidence and talking to whoever may have heard or saw anything leading up to this shooting. But police said the problem is they're getting multiple stories from multiple people.\n\nThey also spent several hours canvassing the area, but still, the search for a suspect has come up empty.\n\nRight now they don't know the reason behind the shooting or how many people could be involved.\n\nIf you have any information which can help them you're asked to call Norman Police.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Norman police are investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Monday night.", "author": "Rachel Calderon, News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30754257/norman-police-investigate-shooting-that-critically-injured-one", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9462288_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Norman police are investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Monday night.", "title": "Norman Police Investigate Homicide After Shooting Victim Dies"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9462288_G.jpg", "description": "Norman police are investigating a shooting that sent one man to the hospital Monday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "Norman Police Investigate Homicide After Shooting Victim Dies"}, "wnreadableurl": "norman-police-investigate-shooting-that-critically-injured-one", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/15", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, norman, police, shooting, hospital, apartment, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS07", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local, norman, police, shooting, hospital, apartment, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "article_summary": "Norman police are now investigating a homicide after a shooting victim died from his injuries.\nDetectives spent several hours here collecting evidence and talking to whoever may have heard or saw anything leading up to this shooting.\nThey also spent several hours canvassing the area, but still, the search for a suspect has come up empty.\nPolice got the call just before 10 p.m. from the Summerfield Village apartment complex, which is just a half a mile east of the OU campus.\nRight now they don't know the reason behind the shooting or how many people could be involved."}
