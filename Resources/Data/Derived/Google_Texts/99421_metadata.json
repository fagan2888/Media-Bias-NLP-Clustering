Ted Cruz to speak at Donald Trump\u2019s famously plush Mar-a-Lago Club mansion in the wealthiest county in Florida.\n\nPalm Beach County Republican Party Vice Chairman Mike Barnett has been holding the spot for Cruz since last year, when conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham beat him to the punch and headlined the county party\u2019s 2013 annual Lincoln Day fundraiser.\n\nSee Trump\u2019s introduction .\n\nBut that was before a tumultuous year in Washington made Cruz a household name nationwide. So even the soft sell paid off big when a crowd of 600 ticket-buying conservatives turned out Friday for a big-name evening as rich in humor as it was in politics.\n\nThe Florida crowd also heard from Dr. Ben Carson and newly appointed Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera at the 110,000-square-foot estate.\n\nIntroducing Cruz, Mar-a-Lago host Trump noted the venue has a reputation for bankrolling worthy causes in the Sunshine State and throughout the United States.\n\n\u201cThis room has raised more money for charity than any room in Florida by far, and one of the most, actually, in the country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey raise millions and millions for charity here, almost on a nightly basis.\u201d\n\nThat kind of philanthropy makes headlines and draws big names, including one of the biggest names in contemporary Republican politics. Trump jokingly acknowledged the headlines Cruz generates aren\u2019t always complimentary.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I like Ted Cruz so much is that he\u2019s not controversial,\u201d he said, drawing a round of laughter from the crowd.\n\n\u201cBut the truth is, he shouldn\u2019t be controversial because what he\u2019s doing is right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the controversy. It\u2019s common sense, its good government. It\u2019s so many good things.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in Republican politics agrees \u2013 and Cruz used part of his speech to poke fun at his own unpopularity among party leaders in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little nerve-racking to be introduced by Donald Trump. You don\u2019t quite know if it\u2019s going to end with \u2018you\u2019re fired,\u2019\u201d he joked. \u201cWhich if it did, it might make him an honorary member of the Republican leadership.\u201d\n\nCruz hit the other party too, drawing laughter and applause when he noted the weather in Washington had been so cold lately, \u201cI actually saw a Democrat with his hands in his own pockets.\u201d\n\nCruz promised to keep the speech short, at least by the standards of his 21-hour filibuster last September when he tried to keep Obamacare from going into effect \u2013 a speech that led to the 16-day government shutdown in October.\n\nA 21-hour speech, he joked, is \u201calmost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare website.\u201d\n\nBut the evening had a serious purpose, and Cruz took it on.\n\n\u201cThe reason all of you are here tonight \u2026 is because of your kids, because of your grandkids,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re here is everyone in this room \u2026 you love this country, you love freedom, and you love our kids and grandkids and want the best world for them.\u201d\n\nIt was a receptive crowd, and Sid Dinerstein, the long-serving former chairman of the Palm Beach County GOP, credited Barnett for the evening\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cThis is all because he got Ted Cruz here tonight,\u201d Dinerstein told BPR. \u201cHe made this happen.\u201d\n\nSee more Lincoln Day Dinner Photos by Marisol", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "It wasn\u2019t a hard sell to get Texas Sen.
