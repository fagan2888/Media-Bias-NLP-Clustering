(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the health-care law, it\u2019s no surprise small-business owners aren\u2019t familiar with all the nuances in the legislation. Some of the lawmakers who wrote and voted for the bill have themselves expressed confusion about the rules.\n\nStill, experts say there are some common and potentially costly misconceptions that have stuck with employers for the past few years \u2014 ones that, if cleared up, could help them avoid some headaches and save some money going forward.\n\n\u201cThe general feeling in the business community when the law came out was that the sky was falling,\u201d Michael Harlow, an accountant and partner at CohnReznick in Washington, said during a health-care forum held last week by the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington.\n\n\u201cOnce they looked more closely, it was clear that it\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d Harlow added. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of misinformation out there.\u201d\n\nJoining Harlow on the panel were Stephanie Cohen, an insurance broker and partner at Golden and Cohen, and Khalid Pitts, co-owner of a wine store and tasting room in the District and a board member with the city\u2019s new health insurance exchange commission.\n\nDuring the discussion, each identified and tried to clear up some of the most common myths and misunderstandings surrounding the health law and its new online small-business insurance marketplaces. Here are the ones they mentioned:\n\nObamacare is being forced upon employers.\n\n\u201cOne of the common misconceptions is that this is being forced upon you,\u201d said Pitts, who with his wife owns Cork Market and Tasting Room. He noted that the vast majority of companies, including his own, have fewer than 50 employees, and are thus exempt from rules requiring employer to offer a health insurance plan or pay a penalty.\n\nAnd even for small employers who want to continue offering or hope to start offering insurance, \u201cyou\u2019re still going to have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can still go directly through the insurance company, or you can go through the new online portals. No one is forcing you into them.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re going to have a choice, to stay with private insurance directly through the insurance company, or to go through the Small Business Health Options Program portal.\n\nNoncompliance penalties will cripple employers.\n\nCompanies above the 50-employee threshold will soon have to start providing coverage (enforcement has been delayed a year), and the penalties for noncompliant firms can run as $3,000 per worker per year.\n\n\u201cPeople hear those numbers and they freak out,\u201d Harlow said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the penalties are going to be that big of a deal.\u201d\n\nHarlow said the law simply requires those employers to offer an affordable plan (not exceeding in cost 9.5 percent of the worker\u2019s annual income); it does not require them to persuade those workers to enroll. So, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re looking at a service employee who makes $12 to $15 an hour, and you offer them something that costs $80 or $100 a month, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t take it, yet you have covered yourself and avoid the penalty by making the plan available.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wind up paying the penalties, it probably means you just threw up your hands and did nothing,\u201d Harlow added.\n\nThere\u2019s a quick fix to stay under the 50-employee mark.\n\nUnder the law, the 50-employee mark refers to full-time employees, which are defined as those who work more than an average of 30 hours per week. Consequently, Harlow says he has heard employers say \u201cthat they will just cut everybody hours back, and that will fix the problem because they won\u2019t have anyone over 30 hours a week.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. The new rules require employers to include in their calculations the hours worked by part-time employees; for every 130 hours worked per month, they must add one \u201cfull-time equivalent\u201d to their workforce.\n\nIf the sum of their full-time workers and full-time equivalents exceeds 50, they must offer coverage.\n\n\u201cYou have to be careful about that,\u201d Harlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the 30-hour rule.\u201d\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t afford a health plan before, you probably still can\u2019t.\n\nOne of the longest running misconceptions for individuals and employers has been that plans available through the new online exchanges are offered by the government, or that they were fundamentally different than those offered by health insurance companies. In fact, the plans are still purchased from and provided by traditional insurance companies \u2014 they can simply be purchased through the government-run shopping portals.\n\nHowever, just because the plans are often identical doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t some potential cost benefits to shopping on the exchange.\n\n\u201cI think what people need to understand is that there are ways to be creative and design the plans so that they are affordable for employers,\u201d said Cohen, the broker. She noted that some state-run exchanges (and the one in D.C.) now allow business owners to offer various plans from different insurers to their workers \u2014 an option not generally feasible in the past.\n\n\u201cI think people are still nervous that it\u2019s going to cost them a lot of money, but it truly doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can ask, \u2018How much do you want to pay?\u2019 and then work backwards from that number.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Harlow noted that businesses with fewer than 25 employees that buy plans through the new marketplaces are eligible for tax credits equalling as much as 50 percent of their total health costs, potentially helping some small employers cut costs even further.\n\nUsing the online exchanges means going it alone.\n\n\u201cSome employers think that because these portals allow you to go on and see rates for yourself and do it all yourself, that means they have to do it all themselves,\u201d Harlow said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. There are brokers who are there to help you though the process.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he noted that his \u201cclients sometimes think that a broker represents another cost that they are going to have to incur.\u201d He pointed out that it\u2019s the insurance company that pays the broker for the connection, not the small business.\n\nCohen said her role has actually expanded in some cases.\n\n\u201cWhen I first looked at the portals, I thought, \u2018Oh my God, they\u2019re not going to need us anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually the total opposite. There are a lot of new options, and they actually need our help more, so we have been very busy.\u201d\n\nFollow J.D.
