Weiner sat on the script for five years before it got any attention, and few could have predicted what it would become: A cultural sensation that would turn AMC into a cable juggernaut and launch the little-known cast of Jon Hamm, Christina Hendricks, January Jones, Vincent Kartheiser, Elisabeth Moss and John Slattery into Hollywood megastardom. The Hollywood Reporter has a great oral history with Weiner and the cast and crew up today \u2014 it\u2019s worth checking out in full, but here are some of the most interesting tidbits:\n\nWeiner\u2019s agents told him not to go to AMC:\n\nHe remembers them saying something to the effect of \u201cYou\u2019re going to be coming off \u2018The Sopranos.\u2019 I know you love this project, but don\u2019t go [to AMC]. It\u2019s really low status, no money, and even if they do it, they\u2019ve never made a show before, and you don\u2019t want to be their first one.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t all audition for the parts they got:\n\nJanuary Jones read for Peggy twice before Matthew Weiner suggested her for Betty \u2014 even though there were no scenes written for the character yet, and it was unclear how the part would develop. Meanwhile, John Slattery originally read for Don. \u201cMatt Weiner claims I was in a bad mood the whole [pilot]. I had a couple of scenes, but I wasn\u2019t as emotionally invested as some of the people because there wasn\u2019t that much of Roger in evidence yet. Being a selfish actor, I didn\u2019t necessarily see the full potential in the beginning.\u201d\n\nSpinoffs were discussed in the early days:\n\nIn early negotiations with AMC, the network asked for a spinoff, although Weiner wasn\u2019t comfortable with committing to one. One idea was a contemporary spinoff, probably following Sally, another was a Peggy spinoff, while a third involved a character going off to L.A. (which, as you know, sort of ended up happening).\n\nBetty wasn\u2019t always going to be so involved:\n\nWeiner received early pushback for his focus on Betty. As he put it: \u201cThey were really annoyed that I was paying attention to [Betty]. I wanted to branch the show out, and I felt that if Don was cheating on this woman, that was the story. They just wanted it to be a formula in the office.\u201d (Jones, meanwhile, says she was shielded from all the \u201cWe don\u2019t care about Betty\u201d stuff).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't leave us, \"Mad Men\"!", "title": "January Jones as Peggy?
