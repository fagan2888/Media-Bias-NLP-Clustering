(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nIn the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, only one candidate has any experience in Congress, and that\u2019s Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez of Orange County. But in a recent Senate debate, Sanchez denied she\u2019s the insider. She said she\u2019s not the status quo.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d she said, \u201cWashington hasn\u2019t changed me. I\u2019ve been changing Congress for 20 years.\u201d\n\nSpecial Feature California Counts California Counts is a collaboration of KPBS, KPCC, KQED and Capital Public Radio to report on the 2016 election. The coverage focuses on major issues and solicits diverse voices on what's important to the future of California.\n\nYou might say Loretta Sanchez began training for her current role early in life. Her sister, Linda, also a California congresswoman, said the younger kids in the family called her \u201cthe warden.\u201d She said when they got chore assignments, \u201cLoretta was sort of the supervisor that went around to make sure that we were doing them correctly and reported back to our parents if we were not.\u201d\n\nThese days, Loretta Sanchez oversees defense spending and policy on the House Armed Services Committee. Despite the serious issues she deals with, the media seem fascinated by her annual Christmas cards \u2014 playful pictures of her posing with cat Gretzky atop a fireplace mantle or astride a motorcycle.\n\nSanchez complains that the media rarely seem to show up at six-hour meetings that \u201cwe have on trying to figure out how much we\u2019re going to spend and whether we\u2019re going to redo our nuclear arsenal.\u201d\n\nRELATED: What Do You Want To Ask Our US Senate Candidates?\n\nAt the recent Senate debate in Stockton, Duf Sundheim, one of her Republican opponents, accused Sanchez of skipping a lot of committee meetings. Sanchez countered that she \u2014 like the rest of Congress \u2014 serves on multiple committees and can\u2019t be in two places at once.\n\nHouse Republicans back her up on that. The recently retired GOP chairman of Armed Services, Rep. Buck McKeon, said everyone is on two or three subcommittees and on several full committees, all with hearings, bill markups and votes. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get there for everything,\u201d he says.\n\nCritics difficult to find in D.C.\n\nFinding Sanchez critics of either party is difficult on Capitol Hill. Among Democrats in the California delegation, 17 have endorsed Sanchez \u2014 most of them from Southern California. Eight House Democrats from California have endorsed state Attorney General Kamala Harris, most of them from the Bay Area. Democrats who haven\u2019t endorsed Sanchez declined to speak on tape. House Republicans were similarly silent on Sanchez.\n\nBut not Rep. Mike Turner. The Ohio Republican chairs Tactical Air and Land Forces, the subcommittee that oversees procurement of everything except ships. Sanchez is the top Democrat on that subcommittee. Turner calls Sanchez\u2019s work \u201chighly substantive.\u201d He said Sanchez works to get \u201cthe right answer.\u201d He said even if they come to different conclusions about testimony, he benefits from \u201cher research, her inquisitiveness, her oversight\u201d of the Defense Department. The two work so well together across the aisle that when Turner switched subcommittees, Democratic leaders asked Sanchez to switch, too.\n\nDespite serving on Armed Services since she first came to Congress \u2014 back when it was called \u201cthe Committee on National Security\u201d \u2014 Sanchez voted against authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002. She pushed the Pentagon to allow women to participate in combat. When you ask Sanchez which bills she can claim as her own, she talks about getting funding for a water reclamation plant in her district and oversight of the Pentagon. Most of all, she speaks about collaboration.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t worry about the credit, you get a lot more done,\u201d she said.\n\nYou have to collaborate when you\u2019re not in charge. Marc Sandalow, associate academic director of the UC Washington Center, said there was a short window when Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act and Dodd/Frank banking reforms \u2014 the four years when Nancy Pelosi was speaker and Democrats controlled the House. Virtually the entire time Loretta Sanchez has been in the House, she\u2019s been in the minority. \u201cMinority members do not get a chance to bring bills to the floor,\u201d he says. \u201cRepublicans won\u2019t let them do that.\u201d\n\nGetting over the \"appearance hump\"\n\nSo why the perception of Sanchez being somewhat flaky? Sandalow said to blame D.C. because Washington remains a very buttoned-down, uptight place. \u201cThe kind of place where if you head to certain restaurants, and you\u2019re not wearing a tie,\u201d he said, \u201cthey hand you a tie to put on to make sure it\u2019s appropriate. Loretta Sanchez is not part of that culture.\u201d\n\nHow buttoned up? Sister Linda Sanchez remembers the day she was wearing a pair of what she described as \u201ccool shoes\u201d \u2014 strappy stilettos decorated with studs. The buzzer rang for votes, and one of her staff stopped her as she was running out the door. \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019re going to the floor in those shoes?\u2019 And I looked at her and I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m from California, damn straight I am.\u2019 And she was just shocked. And down I went to the floor to vote.\u201d\n\nLinda Sanchez said that with a Congress that\u2019s just 20 percent female, to be taken seriously you have to get over the \u201cappearance hump.\u201d She said if a woman came to the floor with hair askew \u2014 like, say, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 no one would listen to what she had to say. The only thing they\u2019d remember was what she looked like.\n\nShe said there\u2019s another layer of misperception for Latina members of Congress, based on old stereotypes that Latinas are \u201cspicy or hot. And it\u2019s really hard to overcome those preconceived ideas or those perceptions that get perpetuated that begin on a false note.\u201d\n\nLoretta Sanchez doesn\u2019t always help herself. Her comments after the San Bernardino terrorist attack upset many Muslim-Americans. She also offended Native Americans during an incident that went viral on social media.\n\nSanchez describes herself as substantive, but with a sense of humor. \u201cSometimes people see that and they say, \u2018Oh, my gosh, can I take her seriously?\u2019 And the answer is, ask my colleagues. They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m extremely serious about my work.\u201d\n\nSanchez will find out how seriously voters take her on June 7. Under the state\u2019s primary rules, the top two finishers face off in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen.
