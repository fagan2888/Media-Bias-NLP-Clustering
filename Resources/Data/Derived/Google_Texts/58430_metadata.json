Larrabee St., was found dead at his apartment last Thursday, an apparent victim of suicide.\n\nCouncilmember John D\u2019Amico asked for the adjournment in Holbrook\u2019s honor. D\u2019Amico, who, like Holbrook, works at UCLA, joked that Holbrook \u201cused to say that he thought of himself as being to the right of Attila the Hun.\u201d\n\nHolbrook was a computer programmer at UCLA who in recent years has shown up to offer comments at City Council meetings. He also published a blog sharing his opinions on subjects such as Obamacare (\u201cThe Obscenity That Is Obamacare\u201d) and a complaint to the City Council about Go Go Appreciation Day. Rhyss Leary, who worked with Holbrook for three years, said he was a \u201cvery intelligent\u201d man known for \u201chaving his own take on things.\u201d Holbrook also was a proud memory of the recovery community. \u201d Coe was an active member of West Hollywood\u2019s recovery community for many years,\u201d said Councilmember John Duran. \u201cWe will all miss him terribly. It\u2019s a reminder to all of us in the recovery community to watch over one another.\u201d\n\nHolbrook was known for walking his dog, Walt, along Santa Monica Boulevard in the city\u2019s Boystown area and for hanging out at Yogurt Stop. However, Leary said, \u201cCoe\u2019s world is composed of his apartment and his (work) cubicle. If Liberace had an apartment in West Hollywood that would be it. Every nook and cranny was filled.\u201d\n\nThe stuff Holbrook kept in his apartment was the subject of a major disagreement between him and his landlord, which tried to have him evicted, alleging that he was hoarding and had had an altercation with the building manager. Steve Martin, who represented Holbrook in his fight with the landlord, complained that the landlord had been difficult to deal with, at one point filing a restraining order against Holbrook using \u201ccompletely concocted allegations.\u201d The landlord refused to accept direct deposits of Holbrook\u2019s rent checks, and the building manager also refused to accept a package containing the ashes of Holbrook\u2019s deceased brother that was mailed to him in December after his mother died, Martin said.\n\nA court hearing on Mediterranean Village\u2019s suit to evict Holbrook had been set for Feb. 8 but was postponed. Leary said he had seen his co-worker that night. But \u201che didn\u2019t come in on Tuesday,\u201d Leary said. \u201cMy boss called and said \u2018where\u2019s Coe?\u2019 His not being there was not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWednesday we sent the Sheriff to do a wellness check,\u201d Leary said. He said they were told that Holbrook was okay and then learned of is death on Thursday.\n\nPerhaps Holbrook\u2019s most valued possession was Walt, his dog. Holbrook posted a number of videos on YouTube focused on Walt, including one showing his dog walking him. Walt is being taken care of by a friend, Jeff Owen.\n\nThe dozens of commenters on Holbrook\u2019s Facebook page expressed their sadness at his loss. But several couldn\u2019t resist making comments that reflected his charming eccentricity.\n\n\u201cI can just imagine the funny s\u2013t your whispering in God\u2019s ear, that brings a small smile to me, and some comfort,\u201d wrote one.\n\nTagged coe holbrook, mediterranean village", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Liberal West Hollywood laments the death of engaging conservative Coe Holbrook.", "title": "The Death of Coe Holbrook, a Conservative Republican, Is Lamented in Liberal WeHo | WEHOville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.wehoville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Coe-Holbrook-e1455686015203.jpg", "height": 404}, "url": "http://www.wehoville.com/2016/02/16/the-death-of-coe-holbrook-a-conservative-republican-is-lamented-in-liberal-weho/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "HOMEPAGE Worth a Look", "tag": "mediterranean village", "published_time": "2016-02-16T21:18:38-07:00"}, "description": "Liberal West Hollywood laments the death of engaging conservative Coe Holbrook.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "robots": "noodp"}, "article_summary": "The Death of Coe Holbrook, a Conservative Republican, Is Lamented in Liberal WeHoTue, Feb 16, 2016 By 5 Comments By StaffThe death last week of Coe Holbrook, a conservative Republican in an overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic town, prompted the West Hollywood City Council tonight to adjourn in his memory and spurred dozens of his friends and acquaintances to offer warm thoughts about him.\nTagged coe holbrook, mediterranean village\n\u201d Coe was an active member of West Hollywood\u2019s recovery community for many years,\u201d said Councilmember John Duran.\nHe said they were told that Holbrook was okay and then learned of is death on Thursday.\nA court hearing on Mediterranean Village\u2019s suit to evict Holbrook had been set for Feb. 8 but was postponed."}
