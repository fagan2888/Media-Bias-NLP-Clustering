Execs speculated that moviegoers \u2013 especially in Middle America \u2014 were hooked by a marketing campaign stressing the themes of patriotism, heroism, friendship and family.\n\n\n\nThe jump in projections underlines the fact that forecasts of box office performance can be occasionally unreliable, particularly outside coastal areas. Moviegoers are taking to Twitter to applaud the military bravery portrayed in the film, which looks to fill the gap in the marketplace for films with patriotic themes.\n\n\n\nRelativity\u2019s \u201cAct of Valor,\u201d which also centered on the heroics of Navy SEALs, also performed above expectations in 2012 with $70 million at the U.S. box office.\n\n\n\n\u201cLone Survivor\u201d also appeared to be benefiting from the relative absence of new competition following the barrage of high-profile titles opening in December. Reviews of the project, based on a 2005 attempt to capture or kill a Taliban leader, have been strong with Peter Berg\u2019s screenplay receiving a WGA nomination.\n\n\n\n\u201cLone Survivor\u201d was made for $48 million with coin from independent financiers including Randall Emmett and George Furla.\n\n\n\nDisney\u2019s toon \u201cFrozen,\u201d which won last weekend with $19.6 million, is expected to finish second in the low teens for Friday-Sunday. The family-friendly comedy has topped $302 million domestically.\n\n\n\nThe only wide opener is Lionsgate\u2019s sword-and-sandals actioner \u201cThe Legend of Hercules,\u201d starring Kellan Lutz and tracking to gross between $7 million to $8 million in the three days.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 futuristic \u201cHer,\u201d which broadens to 1,729 locations, appears headed for $2 million on Friday and a $6 million weekend. The Weinstein Co.\u2019s \u201cAugust: Osage County\u201d is also expanding into 905 locations; early forecasts project to between $7.5 million to $10 million for the three days.\n\n\n\nParamount\u2019s third weekend of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d will likely be a factor this weekend. The Leonardo DiCaprio drama has been holding well during mid-week days and led the chart on Thursday with $1.5 million for a total of nearly $70 million Stateside since its Christmas Day launch.\n\n\n\nClick her for more from Variety.com", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "movies", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Box Office", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30
