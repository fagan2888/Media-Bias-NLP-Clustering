(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAs President Obama spoke of the country\u2019s deepening sense of alienation and anger last month, a teacher in Michigan listened, her eyes fixed on the stone-faced Republicans in the House chamber who in her view represented the problem.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get over the party lines and work together!\u201d she tweeted during the president\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nIn Maryland, a retired lawyer was listening to the exact same words. He, too, was worried about the anger and division gripping the country, but as Obama spoke, his resentment toward the president only swelled.\n\n\u201cHearing him complain about political rancor is frankly nauseating,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe two tweets flashed across the Internet within seconds of each other, each in their own way capturing the country\u2019s mood and the challenge facing the president in his final months in office \u2014 not simply a partisan divide, but a deep mistrust that has become so entrenched that it seems to affect the very way Americans hear the president\u2019s words and see each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama rose to national prominence on the promise that he could deliver a less fractious and more rational politics to the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cEven as we speak, there are those preparing to divide us,\u201d he had warned in his 2004 speech to the Democratic National Convention. \u201cWell, I say to them tonight there\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America. There\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAnd yet 12 years later, Obama is confronting a far more vexing political problem than the one he first described as a product of cynical Washington \u201cspin masters\u201d and \u201cnegative-ad peddlers\u201d who would \u201cslice and dice our country\u201d along party lines.\n\nAccording to experts who study polarization, Americans don\u2019t necessarily disagree more on policy. What has changed is the level of mistrust, and even vitriol, Americans have for politicians and their fellow citizens on the other side of the political divide. It is a suspicion that makes people question their neighbors\u2019 motives, their sincerity and their intelligence.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is people\u2019s perception of other ordinary citizens,\u201d said Doug Ahler, who studied polarization at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cWe\u2019ve become so entrenched in our partisan identities. . . . It\u2019s like a really intense sports rivalry. It\u2019s not about policy but an emotional distrust of the other side.\u201d\n\nA senior White House official put it event more bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019re literally growing apart from each other.\u201d\n\nA major focus for Obama during his final year in office is to blunt those divisions by trying to remind Americans of the values that they share. \u201cIt will be core to what you hear from us this year,\u201d said David Simas, the White House director of political strategy. \u201cYou can expect to hear it in every setting, in every place, around any topic and speech, because it is that important to the president.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s opening shot on the subject was the State of the Union address \u2014 a speech he labored over, writing and rewriting its final section on the country\u2019s corrosive and divided politics, according to aides.\n\nIn his last State of the Union address, President Obama took shots at Republican presidential candidates, expressed one of his \"few regrets,\" and said he's \"as confident as I have ever been that the state of our union is strong.\" (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m addressing the American people now . . . \u201d Obama said as he began his pitch that night.\n\n***\n\nIn Boyne City, Mich., Erin Mastin, 36, the second-grade teacher, was listening.\n\n\u201cOur public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention,\u201d Obama warned. \u201cDemocracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nThis was how Mastin felt, and she was sure Obama felt it, too. When George W. Bush was president, she had picked apart his speeches, like a teacher scouring a paper for plagiarism or a parent\u2019s assistance, to figure out which parts he truly believed and which parts had been written for him.\n\n\u201cHe would have never used that word on his own,\u201d she often recalled thinking as the former president spoke.\n\nShe never felt that way about Obama. \u201cJust the way he speaks is genuine,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he has speechwriters, but those are his words and his feelings.\u201d\n\nFor her, Obama\u2019s final State of the Union and his call for a \u201cbetter politics\u201d was an attempt to sort through the country\u2019s unfinished business, to face up to his failures in office and prepare Americans for the dangers that lie ahead.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like a will,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what you need to do when I\u2019m gone. This is what\u2019s going to happen, and you need to stay strong.\u201d\n\nObama pressed forward in his address, speaking of a political system that often seemed \u201crigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many Americans feel that way right now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think everybody feels that way,\u201d Mastin agreed.\n\nShe could feel the influence of money in politics in her classroom, she said. In recent months, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative Michigan-based think tank funded in part by billionaires Charles and David Koch, had begun posting teachers\u2019 salaries online. Their goal was to highlight the need for teacher pay based on performance rather than seniority or degrees.\n\nMastin saw a darker purpose.\n\n\u201cI believe their agenda is to destroy public education,\u201d she said.\n\nShe shared the president\u2019s sense of frustration most acutely on the issue of gun control. After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, her school instituted active-shooter drills. \u201cYou have to shove all 24 kids into a little tiny area, and we all have to sit there and be quiet until the police come around,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the first few years, it was scary for her students. \u201cIs this for real or just practice?\u201d she said they would ask. Then it became a routine part of the school year. \u201cTo have it be a normal thing is just really sad,\u201d she said.\n\nShe thought of the times that Obama had teared up when talking about the Sandy Hook shooting and said that she knew exactly how he felt, because she had felt the same emotions.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we do something?\u201d she imagined him asking in the Oval Office.\n\nOn her television screen, Obama was confessing his regrets over the growing rancor and suspicion in the country that had grown on his watch. \u201cI have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the only line in his speech that didn\u2019t ring true to her. \u201cI felt like he was set up to fail from the beginning with that,\u201d Mastin said. \u201cThe Republicans weren\u2019t going to let him have that victory at all.\u201d\n\n***\n\nJohn Pettit, an 81-year-old retired lawyer, listened to the same speech in his living room in Easton, Md., his anger building as the president spoke of the dangers that lie ahead if the country did not fix its politics and change its course.\n\n\u201cThose with money and power will gain control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure,\u201d Obama said.\n\nTo Pettit, the single sentence encapsulated all that Obama had done to divide the country over the past seven years.\n\n\u201cHard at work preaching to his parallel universe,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nPettit had a ready list of Obama\u2019s failings: He had pushed through the Affordable Care Act without a single Republican vote. He had expanded government assistance to the point that 49 percent of the population \u2014 including Social Security recipients \u2014 depended on some form of federal help. Instead of working with mainstream Republicans, Obama had demonized, ostracized and ignored them.\n\n\u201cDemocracy can work, and you can make people feel heard if you really work at it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he never really worked at it. He never worked with Congress.\u201d\n\nDeep into Obama\u2019s second term, Pettit could feel the country\u2019s mood shifting and turning darker. His dentist insisted to him that Obama was a closeted Muslim \u2014 a conviction that Pettit said was absurd.\n\n\u201cIt really offends me to hear people talking about a politician\u2019s religion as a problem,\u201d he said, even as he suggested that his dentist\u2019s critique was probably grounded in Obama\u2019s foreign-policy failings.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s shorthand for saying Obama is more sympathetic to radical Muslim extremists than he should be,\u201d Pettit said.\n\nPettit had always considered himself a center-right Republican and not especially ideological. Before retiring, he had run the Washington office of a big, national law firm, where he worked closely with Democrats and Republicans. He was not passionate when it came to gun rights and broke with the Republican Party on most social issues, such as same-sex marriage and abortion.\n\nHe sometimes struggled to explain why the president\u2019s two terms in office so infuriated him. \u201cI\u2019m sure Obama is more complicated than I think,\u201d he said before quickly pivoting back to the president\u2019s many flaws. He was \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201cinexperienced.\u201d\n\nOn the night of his State of the Union speech, Obama was warning of the dangers of giving in to the creeping cynicism and mistrust that he could sense was spreading through the country.\n\n\u201cThere will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\u2019t look like us, pray like us or vote like we do,\u201d the president said.\n\nPettit listened and summed up his feelings in a tweet.\n\n\u201cObama, the most partisan and divisive POTUS in history, still can\u2019t resist preaching and vilifying those who disagree,\u201d he wrote.\n\n***\n\nThe challenge for Obama \u2014 and virtually every politician today \u2014 is breaking through in a climate defined more by alienation, frustration and anger than differences on policy. Policies can be modified or changed. But how does a president persuade an angry and mistrustful nation to actually listen to each other?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing puzzle,\u201d said Simas, the White House political strategy director. \u201cOnce we lose the ability to talk to each other, we lose the ability to reach consensus, which is at the core of politics in Washington and every town hall around the nation.\u201d\n\nObama has promised to make a greater effort in the coming year to engage with Americans who disagree with him, as he did at a recent CNN town hall meeting on guns. As attention shifts to the candidates vying to replace him, senior White House officials said that Obama\u2019s role as a sitting president will allow him to rise above the fray.\n\nThat was Obama\u2019s goal in the State of the Union.\n\nIn Michigan, Mastin listened as Obama spoke of an immigrant child working late on her science project and a teacher who bought extra supplies to help her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my voice,\u201d she recalled thinking.\n\nIn Maryland, Pettit listened as Obama described a worker who clocked extra shifts to keep his struggling company open and the boss who paid him higher wages \u201cinstead of laying him off.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaintly worker, evil employer,\u201d Pettit recalled thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he does that. Suggesting that the boss appreciated him by not laying him off diminishes the point.\u201d\n\nObama finished his speech. In the House chamber, Democrats rose to their feet to applaud while Republicans sat silently.\n\n\u201cWell said, Mr. President!\u201d Mastin tweeted.\n\n\u201cProfiles in pathetic delusion,\u201d Pettit countered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How two voters hear the president when he talks about the country\u2019s deepening partisan divide.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/greg.jaffe.5", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "How two voters hear the president when he talks about the country\u2019s deepening partisan divide.", "title": "What a divided America actually hears when Obama speaks", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-a-divided-america-actually-hears-when-obama-speaks/2016/02/13/b3c020a2-ce9a-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/12/National-Politics/Images/Obama_State_of_Union_CAPP128_5E1665AF3D0941FEB4F5C2968D55AED21452655265.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GregJaffe"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-a-divided-america-actually-hears-when-obama-speaks/2016/02/13/b3c020a2-ce9a-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/greg.jaffe.5"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "b3c020a2-ce9a-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad"}, "article_summary": "President Obama delivers his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 12.\n\u201cWell, I say to them tonight there\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America.\nTo Pettit, the single sentence encapsulated all that Obama had done to divide the country over the past seven years.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s shorthand for saying Obama is more sympathetic to radical Muslim extremists than he should be,\u201d Pettit said.\nHe, too, was worried about the anger and division gripping the country, but as Obama spoke, his resentment toward the president only swelled."}
