Pat Roberts, who has a long and extensive pro-life voting record in Congress.\n\nOne national pro-life group says Kansas voters who don\u2019t know much about Orman need to be aware that, though he is an independent, he would be just another pro-abortion Democrat working with Harry Reid to stop pro-life legislation in the Senate.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee reinforced its endorsement of Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts for re-election to the United States Senate, noting that \u201cindependent\u201d candidate Greg Orman would be \u201cjust another pro-abortion, anti-life Democrat vote\u201d if elected.\n\n\u201cGreg Orman has the same extreme abortion position as Barack Obama,\u201d said Carol Tobias, National Right to Life president. \u201cBoth Greg Orman and Barack Obama support a policy which allows abortion on demand for any reason.\u201d\n\nNational Right to Life\u2019s Tobias observed that, if elected, Orman, who previously ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, and who supported Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, \u201cwould support the Obama-Reid pro-abortion, anti-life agenda, which is out of touch with most Kansans and mainstream America.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported on September 4 that Orman \u201csupports abortion rights.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nIn sharp contrast, Sen. Pat Roberts has compiled a 100% pro-life voting record and, as National Right to Life noted in its April 21 endorsement, Roberts \u201chas been a key supporter of every major pro-life initiative\u201d during his tenure in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRoberts is a co-sponsor of S. 1670, the \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\u201d \u2013 groundbreaking legislation to protect unborn children at 20 weeks, a point by which the unborn child is capable of experiencing great pain when being killed by dismemberment or other late abortion methods.\n\nRoberts voted against enactment of Obamacare, which provides government funding for insurance plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will lead to the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments. On April 1, 2014, he introduced the \u201cRepeal Rationing in Support of Life Act,\u201d which targets the four key rationing components of Obamacare identified in a March 2014 report issued by National Right to Life.\n\n\u201cGreg Orman would be one more pro-abortion, anti-life Democrat vote in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cNo one should be fooled by Greg Orman\u2019s \u2018independent\u2019 charade.
