Photo: Getty Images\n\nWestern Sydney Wanderers striker Tomi Juric says his coach Tony Popovic could be the perfect man to repair the Socceroos in time for the 2014 World Cup in June but hopes he sticks with the A-League premiers in favour of the national team.\n\nPopovic is one of three domestic-based coaches that could be in the frame for the Socceroos' top job, alongside Central Coast Mariners coach Graham Arnold and Melbourne Victory's Ange Postecoglou.\n\nPopovic is seen as a potential candidate after winning the premiers plate in his first year in the profession. Juric praised the Wanderers' boss as a potential national team coach but would prefer to see him remain at the helm at Parramatta Stadium.\n\nBelief: Tomi Juric backs Tony Popovic.

I would like to have him here at the Wanderers because it helps me develop as a footballer with him and Ante [Milicic] together, which will be great for me and the team.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old striker scored a late equaliser on his club debut against Central Coast Mariners to earn the Wanderers a 1-1 draw in their season opener. As a substitute, Juric struck an 86th-minute volley to earn the Wanderers a share of the spoils in the grand final rematch and says his late leveller raised his personal expectations for the season.\n\n\"I think I've set my standards high now and I don't want to go below that,\" Juric said. \"I have a high expectation for myself and the coaching staff. I don't want to let anyone down.\"\n\nDespite clawing back late into the game, the Wanderers thought they were somewhat unlucky not to leave with all three points against the champions.\n\nWestern Sydney spurned a number of chances to take an early lead as Mariners goalkeeper Justin Pasfield produced a number of superb reflex saves to deny the visitors. They lacked sharpness in front of goal, but Juric warned rivals that they would become far more clinical as the season progressed.\n\n\"It's only going to get better from here on in. It's a big positive for us and we know we're only going to improve and that's a big factor for us,\" He said.\n\nThe match drew a crowd of 17,134 with nearly 7000 of those Wanderers fans who joined forces with the Central Coast faithful to create a colourful atmosphere inside Bluetongue Stadium.\n\nJuric revealed that the passion from the stands restored belief within the Wanderers team that they could salvage a point in the dying stages of the game.\n\n\"Once we went down, they kept cheering us on they cheered even harder,\" Juric said. \"The fans are who we play for. With a big showing like they had last night, it was just fantastic.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Soccer", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Western Sydney Wanderers striker Tomi Juric says his coach Tony Popovic could be the perfect man to repair the Socceroos in time for the 2014 World Cup in June but hopes he sticks with the A-League premiers in favour of the national team.", "title": "Wanderers striker Tomi Juric sees Tony Popovic as a Socceroos coach", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/wanderers-striker-tomi-juric-sees-tony-popovic-as-a-socceroos-coach-20131013-2vgbv.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/v/g/k/s/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.2vgbv.png/1381671195823.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/v/g/k/s/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.2vgbv.png/1381671195823.jpg"}, "description": "Western Sydney Wanderers striker Tomi Juric says his coach Tony Popovic could be the perfect man to repair the Socceroos in time for the 2014 World Cup in June but hopes he sticks with the A-League premiers in favour of the national team.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Wanderers striker Tomi Juric sees Tony Popovic as a Socceroos coach"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Western Sydney Wanderers striker Tomi Juric says his coach Tony Popovic could be the perfect man to repair the Socceroos in time for the 2014 World Cup in June ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcddff\"", "article_summary": "Natural leader: Wanderers coach Tony Popovic.\nBelief: Tomi Juric backs Tony Popovic.\nPopovic is one of three domestic-based coaches that could be in the frame for the Socceroos' top job, alongside Central Coast Mariners coach Graham Arnold and Melbourne Victory's Ange Postecoglou.\nPhoto: Getty ImagesWestern Sydney Wanderers striker Tomi Juric says his coach Tony Popovic could be the perfect man to repair the Socceroos in time for the 2014 World Cup in June but hopes he sticks with the A-League premiers in favour of the national team.\nThe 22-year-old striker scored a late equaliser on his club debut against Central Coast Mariners to earn the Wanderers a 1-1 draw in their season opener."}
