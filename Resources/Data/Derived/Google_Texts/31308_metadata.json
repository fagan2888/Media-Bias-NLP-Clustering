Our federal budget is $4 trillion, debt passed $19 trillion and unfunded entitlements are over $200 trillion. Politicians from both parties share in fueling this fiscal crisis.\n\n\n\nDemocrats think higher taxes on the rich will solve everything. Republicans think relying on cuts to discretionary programs is the panacea. Both fall short of dealing with this fiscal crisis and, left unchecked, increase our probability of default.\n\n\n\nSeventy percent of all federal spending goes to entitlements which are growing. Over 50 percent of the population receive some form of government benefit (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare) and reforming these mandatory programs is political suicide because people now expect it.\n\n\n\nSenator Lankford, R-Okla., published \u0093Federal Fumbles\u0094 which exposes wasteful discretionary spending that Congress can control.\n\n\n\nFor example, The Department of Defense (DOD) spent $43 million building a compressed natural gas station in Afghanistan that\u0092s rarely used. The DOD spent $48 million on military supplies for Yemen that never made it out of the Virginia warehouse. The National Park Service spent $65,000 to demonstrate what happens to bugs when the lights go out.\n\n\n\nTax dollars aren\u0092t free dollars. Congress must pass a constitutional amendment to limit spending to essential services and protection. Our financial crisis is too serious a matter to be left to irresponsible politicians who lack \u0093Profiles in Courage\u0094 to do the right thing.\n\n\n\nYou get what you accept.\n\n\n\nFRANK MAZUR\n\n\n\nSouth Burlington", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "rutland herald, rutland, montpelier, vermont, politics, news, daily news, sports, obituaries, editorial, events, community, calendar, headlines, classifieds, real estate", "google-site-verification": "owx42JO8vuWkAqHrRECpIvAKOvyL0ayHOzHQkbWgm5w", "y_key": "a158acb4f2ab39b3", "Description": "Rutland Herald Online  -  Vermont election news, news coverage, local news, state government, sports, classifieds", "Subject": "Vermont Election News & Information"}, "article_summary": "Tax dollars aren\u0092t free dollars.\nTax dollars aren\u0092t freeRising federal debt is a major threat to our country.\nOur federal budget is $4 trillion, debt passed $19 trillion and unfunded entitlements are over $200 trillion.\nSeventy percent of all federal spending goes to entitlements which are growing.\nThe DOD spent $48 million on military supplies for Yemen that never made it out of the Virginia warehouse."}
