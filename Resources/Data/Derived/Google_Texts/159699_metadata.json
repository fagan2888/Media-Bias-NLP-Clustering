Their carts, which were more flexible for users and more comfortable for the donkey, cost around $450 and could generate revenues of $200 a month. The increased steady income that the new carts gave those who bought them offered Mr Polak his first proof that innovation and business can be a powerful tool for getting people out of poverty.\n\nAlthough it was a heretical thought when Mr Polak started out, today the idea that business is better able to help lift millions of people out of poverty than international aid or charity borders on conventional wisdom. Connecting China\u2019s poor to the businesses of the global economy reduced by at least half the number of people living in extreme poverty, less than $1.25 a day, and enabled the world to achieve the Millennium Development Goal ahead of time. Less than a decade ago, the priority of policymakers was to get more aid for Africa; now they promote investing in African businesses, pointing out that the continent now boasts some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies.\n\nIn this new world aid and charity are criticised for seeing the poor as victims in need of handouts, which help breed dependency. Business, by contrast, treats poor people as workers and customers, empowering them to stand on their own feet. The crucial role that markets and companies can play in economic development has been ignored too often in the past, so Mr Polak\u2019s focus on business solutions is welcome, even if he compares them too starkly against the weaknesses of aid. Both have a role to play: for all the ingenuity of drugs companies, for example, recent progress in vaccinating millions of people in poor countries would not have happened without billions of dollars from foreign governments and philanthropists.\n\nMr Polak and Mal Warwick, his social venture-capitalist co-author, focus on the particular challenge of trying to reduce poverty by building big businesses that serve the 3 billion poorest people in the world. This idea is not entirely new. In 2004, six years before he died, C.K. Prahalad, an Indian-born academic at the University of Michigan, published a bestseller, \u201cThe Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid\u201d. But in \u201cThe Business Solution to Poverty\u201d, Prahalad\u2019s big idea has evolved into practical advice for anyone minded to take up the challenge.\n\nThis is at once inspiring and a bit daunting. A chapter on an unsuccessful effort to create a business making charcoal out of agricultural waste in Haiti is a reminder that great talent and good intentions are no guarantee of success and that, as the authors say, \u201cmarkets can be merciless\u201d, especially when the customer is poor.\n\nHence their emphasis on spending a lot of time talking to poor customers as part of \u201czero-based design\u201d, creating products with the \u201cradical affordability\u201d to appeal to people earning only a couple of dollars a day. (Mr Polak co-founded a non-profit organisation called D-Rev that does just this.) In order to become cost-effective these products need to be sold on a large scale, which means designing and building businesses that are capable of reaching at least 100m customers. Mr Polak, a psychiatrist turned social entrepreneur, has experience of this. Two of his start-ups, Windhorse International and Spring Health in India, are aiming to do precisely that with products such as safe drinking water, biofuels and rural education.\n\nA common failing of people setting up bottom-of-the-pyramid businesses is that they do not start by building in the capacity to scale up. Find a problem that affects at least a billion people, the authors recommend. Design a solution that has universal appeal. Know how you are going to deliver it over the \u201clast 500 feet\u201d, when there is no FedEx or working postal system. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand the problem you\u2019ve set out to solve from your customers\u2019 perspective, if your product or service won\u2019t dramatically increase their income, and you can\u2019t sell 100m of them, don\u2019t bother,\u201d they advise.\n\nBut if your business idea looks like it might fit the bill, this book may be just the guide you need to help you on your way.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20131012_BQD003_1.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Alleviating poverty", "description": "Authoritative weekly newspaper focusing on international politics and business news and opinion.", "pubdate": 20131010, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "How to design a company that really helps the poor", "title": "Good business", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/business-books-quarterly/21587754-how-design-company-really-helps-poor-good-business", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131012_BQD003_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "How to design a company that really helps the poor", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-10 15:13:14", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131012_BQD003_1.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "BUSINESSBOOKS", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20131012_BQD003_1.jpg", "articleid": 21587754, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20131012_BQD003_1.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Alleviating poverty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131012_BQD003_1.jpg", "news_keywords": "Alleviating poverty"}, "article_summary": "But if your business idea looks like it might fit the bill, this book may be just the guide you need to help you on your way.\nThe Business Solution to Poverty: Designing Products and Services for Three Billion New Customers.\nBusiness, by contrast, treats poor people as workers and customers, empowering them to stand on their own feet.\nBut in \u201cThe Business Solution to Poverty\u201d, Prahalad\u2019s big idea has evolved into practical advice for anyone minded to take up the challenge.\nThe increased steady income that the new carts gave those who bought them offered Mr Polak his first proof that innovation and business can be a powerful tool for getting people out of poverty."}
