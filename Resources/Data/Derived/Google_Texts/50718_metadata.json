And it\u2019s not about soccer, but about unfinished infrastructure, opulent stadiums, match-fixing, evictions and protests. The sordid business of hosting an international sporting event isn\u2019t a back story; it\u2019s the story.\n\nThere\u2019s some irony in this, because soccer has for decades been Brazil\u2019s best-known export, the seductive flair of the starting 11 closely linked to the nation\u2019s image abroad. At home, too, the squad and the ritual of support have close ties to national identity. But the strong association between Brazil and the Beautiful Game has only heightened the contrast between the organizers\u2019 cheery promotions and the open displeasure of Brazilians.\n\nIn taking on the World Cup, has Brazil exposed its own shortcomings \u2014 or those of the competition?\n\nIn part, the government has fallen short of its own expectations; a large number of infrastructure projects remain unfinished. A monorail connection to the Sao Paulo domestic airport will not be completed until 2015, and renovations to the terminals are running behind schedule. A light rail system in Cuiab\u00e1 won\u2019t be open in time; Rio\u2019s Transcarioca bus system, which opened last weekend, still has stations under construction. Half the stadiums, meant to be equipped with luxury perks like free Wi-Fi, will not be fully finished by the time Brazil and Croatia kick off. The list goes on.\n\nBut most Brazilians aren\u2019t angry about the unfinished projects so much as about the projects themselves. Why is a country with a high incidence of malnutrition spending some $3.5 billion on stadiums? Even the transportation infrastructure projects (especially those that are incomplete) can seem tenuously connected with the lives of ordinary Brazilians. For how many people will an easier connection to the airport constitute an important improvement? Many Brazilians view the general crackdown on the urban informal economy, such as the evictions of favela residents and the demolition of their homes, as an urban renewal project undertaken with the upcoming international exposure in mind.\n\nWhat seemed a sure bet on a \u201cnational passion\u201d has begun to look, to many Brazilians, like trickle-down economics. As Helen Jefferson Lanskyj, author of \u201cOlympic Industry Resistance,\u201d writes: \u201clegacy benefits accrue to the already privileged section of the population.\u201d The burdens go the other way.\n\nTo some extent, those perceptions are anchored in the remarkable contrasts of Brazilian society. Though income inequality here is declining quickly, and the country will soon have a more even distribution of wealth than the United States, the differing fortunes of the haves and have-nots are achingly visible in every Brazilian city.\n\nBut the protests that have roiled the country over the past two years and may continue to do so during the World Cup also mirror an emerging global consensus, from Sochi to Miami to Munich, that the professional sports industry has grossly manipulated the public interest.\n\nIn the United States, the announcement of a publicly funded sports event or facility is routinely accompanied by the prognosis that the handout will not pay off. The International Olympic Committee seems to have only two solid remaining candidates for the 2022 Winter Games: China and Kazakhstan. After Sochi\u2019s colossal expenses and Beijing\u2019s white elephants, who can be surprised that no democracy wants to put the money on the line?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a country where many are malnourished, why is the government spending $3.5 billion on stadiums?", "author": "Henry Grabar", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a country where many are malnourished, why is the government spending $3.5 billion on stadiums?", "title": "The World Cup\u2019s massive inequality problem is about to blow up", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/the_world_cups_massive_inequality_problem_is_about_to_blow_up/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil_world_cup_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a country where many are malnourished, why is the government spending $3.5 billion on stadiums?", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil_world_cup_dream_city.jpg", "title": "The World Cup\u2019s massive inequality problem is about to blow up", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The World Cup\u2019s massive inequality problem is about to blow up", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 World Cup, Dream City, FIFA, Income inequality, Soccer, Sports, urban planning, World Cup", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfda\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2014 World Cup, Dream City, FIFA, Income inequality, Soccer, Sports, urban planning, World Cup, Sustainability News, NewsThere is, as media people like to say, a narrative emerging around Brazil\u2019s upcoming World Cup.\nIn taking on the World Cup, has Brazil exposed its own shortcomings \u2014 or those of the competition?\nIn part, the government has fallen short of its own expectations; a large number of infrastructure projects remain unfinished.\nEven the transportation infrastructure projects (especially those that are incomplete) can seem tenuously connected with the lives of ordinary Brazilians.\nAnd it\u2019s not about soccer, but about unfinished infrastructure, opulent stadiums, match-fixing, evictions and protests."}
