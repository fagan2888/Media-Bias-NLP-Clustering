Rushmore was a particularly American sissy, because he was a \u201cwar-lover\u201d and he embodied the belief that physical bravery was the ultimate manly virtue. Vidal, inspecting the idiocy of this belief, concludes, \u201cThere is something strangely infantile in this obsession with dice-loaded physical courage when the only courage that matters in political or even real life is moral.\u201d\n\nThere is a war in the American cinema right now, and it is not the one that is visible in the boring battle scenes of Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper\u2019s jingoistic fairy tale. It is the war for attention and adulation taking place at award ceremonies and ticket booths between American Sniper, and a movie about the sacrifices of heroes who fought for freedom, Selma.\n\nSelma and American Sniper present two different heroes of two dramatically different historical narratives. As they compete at the box office, they mimic the competition between two conflicting conceptions of heroism. There is the heroism of Martin Luther King Jr., who challenged the most powerful forces and institutions of his culture, facing death threats and daily harassment, to work tirelessly toward equality and justice, practice peaceful resistance to oppression, and preach love for your neighbor, stranger and even enemy. Chris Kyle said it was \u201cfun\u201d to kill the \u201csavages\u201d of Iraq, and blindly followed the destructive marching orders of George W. Bush.\n\nAs much as these ideas of heroism clash ethically and politically, there is a deeper conflict at work in American culture. It involves America\u2019s inability to advance beyond its BCE notion of masculinity, and progress into an CE world of humanity. Martin Luther King and Chris Kyle not only represent two radically different definitions of heroism, but also two divergent models of manhood. Given the box office success of American Sniper, and the falling feather impact of Selma, it is clear how the majority of Americans view and enforce manhood.\n\nThe prevailing and prevalent projection of American manhood is at once a cartoon, simplistic in its emphasis on strength and eschewal of sensitivity, and dangerous in its celebratory zeal for violence. It is not masculine as much as macho, according to the useful distinction of one of America\u2019s finest male novelists, Jim Harrison. Because Harrison often writes about roughneck, working-class characters in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan or the ranches of Montana, many shortsighted critics have called his literature \u201cmacho.\u201d Explaining his objection to that label, Harrison said, \u201cI have always thought of the word \u2018macho\u2019 in terms of what it means in Mexico\u2014a particularly ugly peacockery, a conspicuous cruelty to women and animals and children, a gratuitous viciousness.\u201d\n\nIdolatry of physical strength and bravery, without an ethical compact or moral purpose, naturally morphs into the glorification of violence, and directly contributes to the maintenance and enhancement of social catastrophes and crises, especially those that involve abuse or neglect of the weak and vulnerable.\n\nThe American macho problem of social dysfunction and intellectual paralysis is at work on the football field whenever coaches, fans, parents, and even players enforce a code to take concussions like \u201creal men,\u201d and ignore the possibility of early onset dementia. America\u2019s antiquated notion of macho toughness is operational in the aggressive pursuit of sexual ownership in the military, where one third of women are victims of sexual assault, and on college campuses, where one fourth of women experience sexual harassment.\n\nIt is also not far in the background of America\u2019s foreign policy, and its enthusiasm for wars when primitive, locker room calls for \u201ckicking ass\u201d replace meaningful discourse on geopolitics and international affairs. Toby Keith\u2019s anthem about \u201cputting a boot in the ass\u201d of terrorists, like President Bush\u2019s flight suit posturing and \u201cbring it on\u201d finger waving, captured the nation\u2019s attention, demonstrating how at the highest levels of governance and in the most avid articulations of politics, America has not yet graduated out of the Bronze Age nor has it left the professional wrestling ring.\n\nAnyone who attempts to navigate the minefield of the macho mentality will face accusations of failing to live up to some bizarre standard of acting as a \u201creal man.\u201d Steve Almond writes that he is deluged, almost daily, by people telling him, through the tough guy forums of anonymous social media and email, that he is not a \u201creal man\u201d because he is critical of the NFL for its complicity in covering up concussions and their consequences. Antiwar activists and writers often have their \u201creal men\u201d credentials questioned. The recent mockery of John Kerry and James Taylor for a performance of \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d in France reveals that the only acceptable language of international alliance is the terminology of violence. Had Kerry vowed to \u201cdestroy\u201d or \u201celiminate\u201d all Islamic terrorists, he would have won favor in the press. Using song as a gesture of political and personal friendship is worthy only of scorn.\n\nThe failure to evolve out of stone age masculinity is especially damning because America prides itself on its status as a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d yet Jesus Christ said \u201che who lives by the sword dies by the sword\u201d and advocated \u201cturning the other cheek\u201d when facing a tormentor. It was this very idea, along with Gandhi\u2019s application of nonviolent protest to politics, that inspired King to lead the civil rights movement according to principles of peace.\n\nKing and Gandhi possessed what Vidal described as \u201cmoral courage.\u201d That standard of courage and measurement of bravery is flawlessly helpful in the world or adult reality, but not as appealing in the world of juvenile fantasy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America may love Clint Eastwood's gun-toting SEAL, but the true movie hero of the day is Martin Luther King, Jr.", "title": "Civil war at the cineplex: \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d \u201cSelma\u201d and the battle over American masculinity", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America may love Clint Eastwood's gun-toting SEAL, but the true movie hero of the day is Martin Luther King, Jr.", "title": "Civil war at the cineplex: \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d \u201cSelma\u201d and the battle over American masculinity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/01/american_sniper_selma_and_the_macho_cowardice_of_chris_kyle_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/american_sniper.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America may love Clint Eastwood's gun-toting SEAL, but the true movie hero of the day is Martin Luther King, Jr.", "title": "Civil war at the cineplex: \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d \u201cSelma\u201d and the battle over American masculinity", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/american_sniper.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Masciotra", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, american sniper, Masculinity, Selma", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9a4\"", "article_summary": "Selma and American Sniper present two different heroes of two dramatically different historical narratives.\nIt is the war for attention and adulation taking place at award ceremonies and ticket booths between American Sniper, and a movie about the sacrifices of heroes who fought for freedom, Selma.\nGiven the box office success of American Sniper, and the falling feather impact of Selma, it is clear how the majority of Americans view and enforce manhood.\nIt involves America\u2019s inability to advance beyond its BCE notion of masculinity, and progress into an CE world of humanity.\nAs much as these ideas of heroism clash ethically and politically, there is a deeper conflict at work in American culture."}
