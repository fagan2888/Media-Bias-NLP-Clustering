The ship\u2019s abolitionist passengers hoped to create an inspirational colony on an island off the west coast of Africa where Africans would be employees rather than slaves.\n\nInstead, as Billy G. Smith recounts in \u201cShip of Death: A Voyage that Changed the Atlantic World\u201d, the pioneers fueled one of the most devastating plagues in Western history.\n\nThe colonists toted water to their ship from streams on the African mainland, not knowing that the mosquitoes that bred in the water carried yellow fever. When the cargo ship sailed off on further ventures, crisscrossing the Atlantic for six months, it brought yellow fever to dozens of ports in the West Indies, North America and Europe.\n\nOther ships had carried yellow fever, but not with such lethality: \u201cUntil the Hankey\u2019s voyage in 1793, the concatenation of conditions that was to detonate the yellow fever bomb had never been present in so many places at the same time and with such ferocity,\u201d Smith writes. \u201cThe result was a pandemic that killed hundreds of thousands people.\u201d\n\nThe Hankey, infamous in its own time, fell into obscurity. Apparently by chance, Smith, a historian at Montana State University, came across references to the ship in shipping records in Philadelphia, where the epidemic killed one of every 10 residents.\n\nHe tracked the ship\u2019s voyages, matching them with yellow fever reports, and created a narrative that, the author says, \u201cbrings together peoples who lived thousands of miles apart who discovered that far-distant events could have impacts, sometimes fatal, on their own lives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an apt lesson, he points out, for our ever-shrinking globe.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Set asail with noble intentions, a European ship instead left widespread death in its wake"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd153c\"", "article_summary": "The colonists toted water to their ship from streams on the African mainland, not knowing that the mosquitoes that bred in the water carried yellow fever.\nWhen the cargo ship sailed off on further ventures, crisscrossing the Atlantic for six months, it brought yellow fever to dozens of ports in the West Indies, North America and Europe.\nOther ships had carried yellow fever, but not with such lethality: \u201cUntil the Hankey\u2019s voyage in 1793, the concatenation of conditions that was to detonate the yellow fever bomb had never been present in so many places at the same time and with such ferocity,\u201d Smith writes.\nInstead, as Billy G.
