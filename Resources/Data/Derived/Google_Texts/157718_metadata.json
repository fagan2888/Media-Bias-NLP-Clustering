Since 1953, presidents and other politicians (both domestic and foreign) have attended it, along with our nation\u2019s \u201cfaith leaders,\u201d among them the bloated, insufferably self-satisfied preacher of Neanderthalic mores, the late Jerry Falwell, and the aging (not fast enough) ultra-reactionary evangelical media potentate Pat Robertson.\n\nAfter the keynote speaker leaves the podium, the president, as a rule, delivers an address \u2013 usually pious pablum hardly worth listening to. This year was different: President Obama\u2019s words stirred Republicans to ire: They contended that he, in an excursus apparently of his own composition, drew a false equivalency between the atrocities committed by ISIS and the outrages perpetrated in Christianity\u2019s name, starting with the Crusades and running all the way up to slavery and Jim Crow in the United States.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss what upset the Republicans in a moment. Progressives, it turns out, actually have more reason for rancor. Start with Obama\u2019s attendance itself. No functionary, least of all the Democratic president of a country with a government proudly founded on the separation between Church and State, should show up at such an affair in an official capacity. Doing so lends credence to faiths that, by any humane standard, long ago discredited themselves and should certainly not be legitimized with Washingtonian pomp and reverence.\n\nWorse, the Prayer Breakfast\u2019s past keynote speakers have included a roster of obscurantist scoundrels, among them Mother Teresa (once denounced by Christopher Hitchens as a \u201cthieving, fanatical Albanian dwarf\u201d for the multifarious, entirely non-beatific controversies bespattering her long career); the evolution-denying, gay-marriage naysayer Dr. Ben Carson, who may seek the Republican nomination for 2016; and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the sanctimonious \u201cpoodle\u201d enabler of Bush\u2019s Iraq War. Actually, not all breakfasters are scoundrels: the Dalai Lama was there this time, and even Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah has visited, thus reminding us that the plague of religion in American public life can be exotic and multi-confessionary.\n\nWhat, some might ask, could be wrong with prayer? By common definition, prayer entails someone sitting for a quiet moment and beseeching his or her Lord for intervention in matters of grave import \u2013 that it rain on the crops or souls be saved, that gays be \u201chealed\u201d or atheists \u201csee the light,\u201d and so on. In objective terms, however, the supplicant is demanding improbable favors from an imaginary despot, and most likely doing so with lowered head and genuflections and other toadying gestures of obeisance \u2014 behavior that without faith\u2019s halo would be classified as symptoms of mental derangement. (And all the more so if the petitioner claims to receive answers to the muttered incantations.) This debasing ritual, fruitless and foolish though it may be, is at least usually peaceful, but in some cases (notably in certain corners of the Middle East), rioting and rampaging follow, especially on Friday afternoons, when imams may deliver sermons exciting crowds to fury and frenzy. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nSo, Obama spoke at the Prayer Breakfast, which was bad enough, but what\u2019s worse, not after some visiting head of state or other luminary, but a NASCAR driver, Darrell Waltrip. Subsequent to salutations offering \u201call praise and honor to God,\u201d Obama paid homage to this driver, wondering if \u201cDarrell has had the same thought as many of us have in our own lives \u2014 Jesus, take the wheel. . . . Although I hope that you kept your hands on the wheel when you were thinking that.\u201d (Was this tacit recognition of religion\u2019s inutility?) He voiced gratitude that the assembled could \u201ccome together in humility before the Almighty and to be reminded of what it is that we share as children of God.\u201d He confessed that he had \u201csought His guidance not just in my own life but in the life of our nation.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Obama launched into what so riled conservatives \u2014 musings about faith being, as he put it, \u201ctwisted and misused in the name of evil.\u201d His words deserve close scrutiny. I\u2019ll quote at length:\n\nFrom a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to stand up for faith, their faith, professed to stand up for Islam, but, in fact, are betraying it. We see ISIL, a brutal, vicious death cult that, in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism \u2014 terrorizing religious minorities like the Yazidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.\n\n\u201cBetraying\u201d Islam? Really? The Charlie Hebdo assassins were executing the death penalty against \u201cviolators\u201d of injunctions inscribed in the Quran and the Hadith that forbid the depiction and mocking of the Prophet Muhammad. Indeed, Al Qaeda and ISIS, to which the killers may have been linked, find sanction in these texts for beheadings, the enslavement of women and much else. To justifiably claim that any of these jihadis are \u201cbetraying\u201d Islam, we have to ignore the meaning of words in such injunctions and interpret them to suit our tastes. Unfortunately, neither the Charlie Hebdo assassins nor the butchers of ISIS choose to do this.\n\nObama continued:\n\nWe see sectarian war in Syria, the murder of Muslims and Christians in Nigeria, religious war in the Central African Republic, a rising tide of anti-Semitism and hate crimes in Europe, so often perpetrated in the name of religion.\n\nThe chief impetus for all this bloodshed and mayhem is, obviously, religion \u2013 the commonality Obama conveniently skirted. Had religion not existed, had it waned by our time, all this violence would just not have happened. If some of these people would have found other reasons to fight, the religious aspect of the conflicts renders them intractable, even insoluble.\n\nConservatives were vexed by what Obama said next: \u201clest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ. . . . So this is not unique to one group or one religion.\u201d\n\nStraightaway, remember that both the Old Testament and the New sanction and even sanctify slavery, as well as proffer helpful advice to slave masters. The Catholic Church embarked on the Holy Inquisition not to do inexplicable violence \u201cin the name of Christ,\u201d but to rid its \u201cflock\u201d of unclean \u201csheep\u201d \u2013 most notably \u201csecret Muslims\u201d and Jews, heretics and witches. Skull crushers and the auto-da-f\u00e9, breast rippers and thumbscrews (and much, much more, including Spanish Donkeys and Judas Cradles) all formed part of the godly torturers\u2019 ghastly repertoire, which aimed to prompt innocents to \u201cconfess\u201d their \u201ccrimes.\u201d Which without religion would not have been crimes at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not that religion gets twisted and misused for evil.
