As a result of the large numbers of uninsured people, hospitals remain under a lot of financial pressure.\n\nThe health care issue wasn\u2019t addressed much at the Democratic presidential debate, but Republican candidates have vowed to do away with the ACA, including Jeb Bush, who unveiled a health care reform plan that would include replacing Obamacare to \u201cstop the damage Washington central planners have caused for decades,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe largest uninsured numbers are not surprisingly in the largest states: California, Texas, and Florida, with a full 4.4 million Texans uninsured even though nearly a quarter of them were eligible for tax credits, and 11 percent were eligible for Medicaid. There were similar numbers for other states. In Florida, nearly a third were eligible for tax credits.\n\nObamacare\u2019s third open enrollment is set to begin on Nov. 1, and will mark another critical period for the nascent law that remains under siege from Republicans. The White House is pushing to raise the rate of insured Americans by focusing on areas that have high rates of uninsured residents.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 290619631106325}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4247\"", "article_summary": "A whopping 32.3 million Americans remain uninsured years after the passage of Obamacare.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation published new state-by-state numbers on the epidemic of uninsured Americans, finding that more than quarter of the uninsured are eligible adults or children.\nThe largest uninsured numbers are not surprisingly in the largest states: California, Texas, and Florida, with a full 4.4 million Texans uninsured even though nearly a quarter of them were eligible for tax credits, and 11 percent were eligible for Medicaid.\nIt\u2019s been years since the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 has been passed, but a full 32.3 million non-elderly people remain without health insurance.\nAs a result of the large numbers of uninsured people, hospitals remain under a lot of financial pressure."}
