Almost as many have abandoned the party label completely, either by shifting to independent status or by supporting Republicans. When this Democratic pollster tabulates the data, he finds that only half of all the young Obama voters surveyed will definitely, probably, or maybe vote for Democrats in the midterms. The rest plan to sit at home, or to back other candidates. In 2010, Millennial turnout dropped significantly compared to 2008, and the gap between the two parties among those who did vote narrowed considerably. The strategist\u2019s advice to Democrats, therefore, is to \u201cheavily invest\u201d in turning out \u201cprogressive Millennials,\u201d pronto. If the party heeds his counsel, expect to hear a lot about gay marriage and birth control over the next six months. Also via WaPo, here\u2019s a chart that employs the (fairly Democrat-friendly) NBC/WSJ polling series to track this year\u2019s fundamentals, comparing the current numbers to surveys conducted before previous midterm waves. Chris Cillizza says the results \u201cshould scare Democrats:\u201d\n\nThose indicators \u2014 which are also reflected in other public polling \u2014 would certainly seem suggest that Democrats are cruisin\u2019 for a bruisin\u2019 this fall. But lest conservatives start counting chickens, allow me to float two friendly reminders: (1) The most vulnerable Senate Democrat incumbent, on paper at least, is leading his (highly impressive) Republican challenger by double digits according to some polls, though others show a very tight race. (2) Republican-held Senate seats in Georgia and Kentucky aren\u2019t necessarily gimmes either. I\u2019ll add one more: Even if young Obama voters do blow off the midterm elections this year, they sure seem pretty susceptible to hype over famous presidential candidates with cool friends and vague, history-making campaign themes. What could go wrong?*\n\n*AP, feel free to just FedEx me the Eeyore crown whenever you have a spare moment.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Meh.", "title": "Dem poll: Half of young Obama voters don\u2019t plan to vote blue in November", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/16/dem-poll-half-of-young-obama-voters-dont-plan-to-vote-blue-in-november/", "image": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-12-at-1.32.19-PM.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T16:41:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T15:53:08+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, millennials, polls,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde85\"", "article_summary": "When this Democratic pollster tabulates the data, he finds that only half of all the young Obama voters surveyed will definitely, probably, or maybe vote for Democrats in the midterms.\nI\u2019ll add one more: Even if young Obama voters do blow off the midterm elections this year, they sure seem pretty susceptible to hype over famous presidential candidates with cool friends and vague, history-making campaign themes.\nAlmost as many have abandoned the party label completely, either by shifting to independent status or by supporting Republicans.\nIn 2010, Millennial turnout dropped significantly compared to 2008, and the gap between the two parties among those who did vote narrowed considerably.\nIf the party heeds his counsel, expect to hear a lot about gay marriage and birth control over the next six months."}
