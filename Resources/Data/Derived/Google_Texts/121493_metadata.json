He also posted a grossly disturbing YouTube video where he outlined his revenge.\n\nAccording to CNN, who spoke to a family friend, Simon Astaire, the receipt of the manifesto prompted his parents to call 911 and head to Santa Barbara to search for their son. Astaire is a talent agent and media advisor.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times also spoke to Astaire, and reported that one of Elliot\u2019s therapists called Elliot Rodger\u2019s mother, Chin, at around 9:17 PM PDT, after he had seen the email. Chin then visited her son\u2019s YouTube page where he had been known to post videos of himself. This is when she saw his final video about his plans for \u201cretribution\u201d against women and others in Isla Vista.\n\nChin then called Elliot Rodger\u2019s father Peter Rodger and asked him to watch the video. She subsequently called 911, according to Astaire, and Peter and Lichin drove from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara. On their way there they heard there was a shooting in Santa Barbara. According to police, the shootings happened around 9:30 PM PDT.\n\nLater the parents found out that their son was behind the mass murder.\n\nIn the sickening manifesto, Elliot Rodger laid out his plans for the mass murder, which included torture, murdering of women in a specific sorority, going on a killing spree in Isla Vista, killing his brother and stepmother and committing suicide. He also lays out a grotesque hatred of women, resentment towards his family\u2019s divorce and explains that his plans were nearly foiled by a police check-up last month.\n\nIn April, six police men showed up at Elliot\u2019s door to do a wellness check, after his mother called his therapist about other disturbing videos on his YouTube page. The deputies said he was polite and shy, and they left without suspicion. If they had searched his room however, the authorities would have found three semi-automatic handguns and an assortment of other weapons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A family friend said that the parents were on their way to Santa Barbara when they heard about the shooting", "title": "Isla Vista shooter\u2019s parents frantically searched for son after seeing manifesto", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A family friend said that the parents were on their way to Santa Barbara when they heard about the shooting", "title": "Isla Vista shooter\u2019s parents frantically searched for son after seeing manifesto", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/isla_vista_shooters_parents_frantically_searched_for_son_after_seeing_manifesto/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/college-community-shooting.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A family friend said that the parents were on their way to Santa Barbara when they heard about the shooting", "title": "Isla Vista shooter\u2019s parents frantically searched for son after seeing manifesto", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/college-community-shooting.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Elliot Rodger, Gun Control, Guns, isla vista shooting, Mental health, Misogyny, parents, Shooting, ucsb, Violence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is when she saw his final video about his plans for \u201cretribution\u201d against women and others in Isla Vista.\nTopics: Elliot Rodger, Gun Control, Guns, isla vista shooting, Mental health, Misogyny, parents, Shooting, ucsb, Violence, NewsFriday night a 22-year-old suspect, now identified as Elliot Rodger, went on a killing rampage in Isla Vista, California, a beach town adjacent to the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nChin then called Elliot Rodger\u2019s father Peter Rodger and asked him to watch the video.\nIf they had searched his room however, the authorities would have found three semi-automatic handguns and an assortment of other weapons.\nIn the sickening manifesto, Elliot Rodger laid out his plans for the mass murder, which included torture, murdering of women in a specific sorority, going on a killing spree in Isla Vista, killing his brother and stepmother and committing suicide."}
