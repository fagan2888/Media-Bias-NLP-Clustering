Tweets passed around a photo meme in which Howard, a North Brunswick native, strove to save everyone and everything. His body, frozen in a \"save\" pose, was photoshopped into various iconic scenes, including the death of Simba's father in \"The Lion King\" and the sinking of the Titanic.\n\nIn the photos, Howard was saving Blockbuster video stores from going out of business. Taylor Swift, too, from Kanye West's stunt at the Video Music Awards. And, in a scene from the movie \"Independence Day,\" defending the White House from an alien attack.\n\nFrom the ashes defeat, a new national hero.

Thanks to the Howard meme, the goalie could also be seen rescuing Team Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini from Suarez's toothy grip, the very same one that visibly injured Chiellini's shoulder during the Italy-Uruguay game on June 24.\n\nEven presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett got in on the fun, posting the Tim Howard hashtag with a photo that contained a big \"House of Cards\" spoiler. (Hint: the image related to a certain journalist, so, if trying to stay in a spoiler-free bubble, beware of the picture down below.)\n\n#ThingsTimHowardCouldSave pic.twitter.com/jpsJ8zFdga \u2014 Not Match of the Day (@NOT_MOTD) July 2, 2014\n\nThe meme was still trending globally on Wednesday night, well after the American team's 2-1 loss to Belgium.\n\nTim Howard fever also caused someone to edit the Wikipedia entry for the U.S. secretary of defense to include the goalie's name \u2014 for many soccer fans, he had indeed claimed the title. There's actually a White House petition for that, along with another petition to rename the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia after Tim Howard. Actual Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel even called Howard to thank him for defending the U.S. at the World Cup.\n\nRunning with the same theme, the @timhoward2016 Twitter account seemed to put forth the idea that Howard would be a safe bid for president.\n\nOn Wednesday President Barack Obama himself called Howard and his teammate, forward Clint Dempsey. The White House posted video of the call to YouTube.\n\n\"To see the way you guys captured the hearts and imaginations of the whole country is unbelievable,\" Obama told the players. Addressing Howard specifically, he added, \"I don't know how you're gonna survive the mobs when you come back home, man. You're going to have to shave your beard so they don't know who you are.\"\n\nGoogle recorded more than 2 million searches for the goalkeeper.\n\nBefore the game even began, he was already Nielsen Social's top Word Cup player for the week of June 23 through 30, with 47,000 \"@\" mentions for his account, @TimHowardGK. According to Twitter, Howard received the most mentions of any U.S. player during the Belgium game.\n\nBecause it's STILL TRENDING, and it may be the best hashtag ever. http://t.co/BLd0XJlE13 #ThingsTimHowardCouldSave pic.twitter.com/qqrjYBV7Hf \u2014 Bustle (@bustle) July 2, 2014\n\n#ThingsTimHowardCouldSave pic.twitter.com/TgqSDqXKTT \u2014 Not Match of the Day (@NOT_MOTD) July 2, 2014\n\n#ThingsTimHowardCouldSave: My uterus from conservative lawmakers.

But #BELvsUSA remained in the worldwide trends before, during and after the match. \"C'mon US\" urged the Americans on, and as the game wound down with the fate of both teams undecided \u2014 though Belgium was winning \u2014 \"Still 15\" went global, as in \"there's still 15 minutes.\"\n\n#BEL v #USA: replay the whole game on Twitter with our #animap #WorldCup LINK: http://t.co/hKNS2EMOLL pic.twitter.com/phIOUyqOwe \u2014 Twitter Data (@TwitterData) July 1, 2014\n\nBut not so fast \u2014 soon \"there's 1\" (minute left) and \"Wow 1\" trended when everyone noticed the extra time wasn't as much as team USA fans might have liked.\n\n\"Proud of the USA\" followed Team USA's loss to Belgium, along with \"Seeing Tim Howard,\" as tweets talked about seeing the goalie cry after the game was over. But Howard wasn't the only player who attracted a fair amount of tweets.\n\nWhen Team USA winger Julian Green scored, Twitter recorded 187,413 tweets per minute about the game. Green became an international trend, along with \"He's 19,\" given tweets that commented on his young age.\n\nBelgium player Kevin De Bruyne, who trended worldwide, dominated Twitter when viewers said he looked like Ron Weasley, Price Harry and Sherminator, Chris Owen's character from the movie \"American Pie.\" (All three identities trended as well.)\n\nAfter the loss, it would appear that American soccer fans got \"48-0 in Super Bowls\" trending as a concession, along with the less tasteful \"still 2-0\" (in world wars). Looking to the World Cup's future, \"Russia 2018\" followed the Belgium game in the trends, with many tweets taking solace in the notion that young Green may again fight for the U.S. in the tournament.\n\n\n\nSupreme Court's ruling on Hobby Lobby\n\nOn Monday, Twitter exploded with reactions to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that employers who have a religious objection to their insurance policies covering contraceptives do not have to cover them.\n\nWhile the contraceptives named in the case were IUDs, and so-called \"morning-after pills\" ella and Plan B, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, author of the court's dissenting opinion, said the ruling opened the door for other challenges to health coverage based on religious objection.\n\n\"The court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield,\" Ginsburg said, writing about the challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the decision, which the court says applies to \"closely held corporations\" \u2014 those named in the related cases are Hobby Lobby Stores (an arts-and-crafts chain) and Conestoga Wood Specialties.\n\nThe mandate that health plans offer complete coverage for birth control to female employees, the court said, violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nIts name inextricably entwined with the decision, Hobby Lobby drew more than a half million searches Monday, and Ginsburg trended on Facebook for excerpts from the dissent.\n\nIn a case of social media miscommunication, the Twitter account for the Supreme Court news site SCOTUSblog \u2014 @SCOTUSblog \u2014 fielded a whole lot of disgruntled posts intended for the actual court.\n\n\n\nTrending is a weekly column monitoring Twitter, Google, Facebook and the web.
