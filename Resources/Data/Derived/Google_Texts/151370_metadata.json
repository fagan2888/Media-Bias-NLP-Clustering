The data from TurboTax, the San Diego-based tax preparation software company, revealed that 70% of uninsured or partially uninsured TurboTax users claimed an exemption from the tax penalty through January 31. This figure is \u201cin line with last year\u2019s overall tax season data,\" said Debra Hammer, TurboTax\u2019s ACA spokesperson. The two most common reasons were the lack of affordability through their employer or geographic region.\n\nConsumers who faced financial difficulties qualify for the health care exemption and do not have to pay the tax penalty, including people with extremely low income where filing a federal tax return is not required, the lowest-priced coverage available either through a marketplace or job-based plan would cost more than 8.05% of their household income or hardships such as being evicted or facing foreclosure, filing for bankruptcy or receiving a shut-off notice from a utility company.\n\nThe data from TurboTax are \u201cconsistent with what we see among health insurance shoppers who don\u2019t qualify for Obamacare subsidies,\u201d said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.com, a health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nThe cost of health insurance has risen across the board for consumers. Between 2013, the year before the ACA mandates came into effect and 2015, the average monthly health insurance premiums for an unsubsidized, single adult increased by 45% or from $197 to $286, he said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Despite the increase in the penalty for not purchasing health insurance, nearly three in four uninsured consumers who used TurboTax filed an exemption in January.", "author": "Ellen Chang", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Despite the increase in the penalty for not purchasing health insurance, nearly three in four uninsured consumers who used TurboTax filed an exemption in January.", "title": "Consumers Claim an Exemption from the Health Insurance Penalty", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/consumers-claim-an-exemption-from-the-health-insurance-penalty", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancezoom.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancezoom.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Taxes", "keywords": "health insurance, premium, tax penalty, exemptions, hardships, ACA, Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Taxes", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2016-03-02T16:34Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611359"}, "date": "2016-03-02T16:34Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13476693, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the increase in the penalty for not purchasing health insurance, nearly three in four uninsured consumers who used TurboTax filed an exemption in January.", "title": "Consumers Claim an Exemption from the Health Insurance Penalty", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/consumers-claim-an-exemption-from-the-health-insurance-penalty", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancezoom.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancezoom.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health insurance, premium, tax penalty, exemptions, hardships, ACA, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTDespite the increase in the penalty for not purchasing health insurance, nearly three in four uninsured consumers who used TurboTax filed an exemption in January.\nThe cost of health insurance has risen across the board for consumers.\nThe data from TurboTax are \u201cconsistent with what we see among health insurance shoppers who don\u2019t qualify for Obamacare subsidies,\u201d said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.com, a health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif.\nThe passage of the Affordable Care Act requires that all consumers purchase health insurance or face a penalty of either $325 or 2% of their household income, whichever was greater in 2015.\nBetween 2013, the year before the ACA mandates came into effect and 2015, the average monthly health insurance premiums for an unsubsidized, single adult increased by 45% or from $197 to $286, he said."}
