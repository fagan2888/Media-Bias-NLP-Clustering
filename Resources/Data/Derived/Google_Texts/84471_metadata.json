Just 25 percent of enrollees are aged 18-35, well below the administration\u2019s target.\n\nThe field of teams in the college basketball tournament was set to be chosen on Sunday, also known as \u201cSelection Sunday.\u201d On Monday, the White House will release a \u201c16 Sweetest Reasons to Get Covered\u201d bracket listing the top reasons to get health insurance, along with a new web video featuring top college basketball coaches. The bracket will be updated all week to reflect the results of an online survey. The bracket is timed to coincide with the release of President Barack Obama\u2019s selections for his own NCAA tournament bracket on Wednesday, the White House official said.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, ads paid for by the Department of Health and Human Services featuring LeBron James, Magic Johnson and Alonzo Mourning will air during March Madness games and on ESPN, ABC, TNT and NBAtv, while the agency is targeting digital ads to basketball supporters. Administration officials including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer have called into sports radio stations across the country to promote insurance enrollment.\n\nThe effort follows Obama\u2019s appearance in a Funny Or Die Web video, \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d as well as a call-in to Ryan Seacrest\u2019s radio show.\n\nLast week the administration announced that 4.2 million Americans have enrolled in coverage through federal and state health care exchanges, well below the initial seven million projection and the revised six million projection from the Congressional Budget Office. The White House has said that the final weeks of the enrollment period are when they expect to see a surge in enrollment, particularly among young people, to avoid the law\u2019s tax penalty for not having coverage.\n\nMore from a White House official on the latest enrollment push:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration is using the NCAA tournament to help sell its health care reform law", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The Obama administration is banking on the popularity of the NCAA men's basketball tournament to sell the Affordable Care Act to young Americans by using athletes, coaches and sports celebrities to encourage more youth to sign up", "title": "White House Embraces March Madness To Sell Obamacare", "url": "http://time.com/26561/march-madness-selection-sunday-obamacare/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/obama1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/obama1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The Obama administration is banking on the popularity of the NCAA men's basketball tournament to sell the Affordable Care Act to young Americans by using athletes, coaches and sports celebrities to encourage more youth to sign up", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "White House Embraces March Madness To Sell Obamacare"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obamacare, selection sunday, white house, march madness, ncca tournament, obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, selection sunday, white house, march madness, ncca tournament, obama"}, "article_summary": "More from a White House official on the latest enrollment push:\nThe bracket is timed to coincide with the release of President Barack Obama\u2019s selections for his own NCAA tournament bracket on Wednesday, the White House official said.\nAdministration officials including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer have called into sports radio stations across the country to promote insurance enrollment.\nThe bracket will be updated all week to reflect the results of an online survey.\nThe White House has said that the final weeks of the enrollment period are when they expect to see a surge in enrollment, particularly among young people, to avoid the law\u2019s tax penalty for not having coverage."}
