University administrators emailed students earlier today instructing them not to bring \u201clarge objects which could interfere with the proceedings or create discomfort to others in close, crowded spaces shared by thousands of people.\u201d While Sulkowicz\u2019s mattress\u2014the centerpiece of her public awareness campaign designed to shame Nungesser for allegedly raping her\u2014wasn\u2019t specifically mentioned, many members of campus believe it was the intended target of the reminder.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Columbia might have wanted to prevent Sulkowicz from carrying the mattress to the ceremony area: graduations are indeed packed events. But beyond logistical reality, the fact remains that Columbia is named in a Title IX lawsuit filed by Nungesser, who believes administrators were legally obligated to do more to protect him from Sulkowicz\u2019s accusations\u2014accusations of which he was cleared.\n\nNevertheless, Sulkowicz was indeed permitted to bring the mattress to graduation. Multiple news outlets reported this outcome with glowing admiration for her achievement:\n\nForgive me if I don\u2019t slow clap. Unacknowledged in these headlines\u2014and the stories that accompany them\u2014is the fact that Nungesser was cleared of wrongdoing. The university found him innocent, based on a simple \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, and the police decline to charge him. He\u2019s legally innocent.\n\nDoes that mean he never raped her? The only people who know that for sure are Emma Sulkowicz and Paul Nungesser. We have no way to conclusively tell who is lying. His lawsuit raises some interesting discrepancies in her account, and the record of messages between them bolsters his side of the story without tipping the scales in any remotely definitive sense.\n\nBut reporters who continue to give a platform to Sulkowicz should feel obligated to report that this is a messy, messy situation in which the facts are seriously disputed. The closest thing we have to an objective determination\u2014the university\u2019s sexual assault trial\u2014went in Nungesser\u2019s favor.\n\nLawmakers should take note as well. Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, cited Sulkowicz approvingly in her commencement address at Barnard College on Sunday. Missing from her comments was any hint of the broader controversy.\n\nKnowing what we know (and what we don't know), anyone suggesting we should uncritically applaud Sulkowicz is either unscrupulous, or deeply misinformed.\n\nWatch a video of Sulkowicz accepting her diploma below.\n\n[*Update: Salon revised its headline and now calls Sulkowicz an \"alleged\" rape survivor.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Media ignores messy dispute between Emma Sulkowicz, Paul Nungesser, and Columbia University", "title": "Mattress Girl, Mattress Attend Graduation\u2014Hold Your Applause", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/19/mattress-girl-mattress-attend-graduation", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14320586545601.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Media ignores messy dispute between Emma Sulkowicz, Paul Nungesser, and Columbia University", "title": "Mattress Girl, Mattress Attend Graduation\u2014Hold Your Applause", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14320586545601.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-19T18:20:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Three important figures attended Columbia University graduation on Tuesday: Paul Nungesser, Emma Sulkowicz, and her mattress.\nThe only people who know that for sure are Emma Sulkowicz and Paul Nungesser.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Columbia might have wanted to prevent Sulkowicz from carrying the mattress to the ceremony area: graduations are indeed packed events.\nBut reporters who continue to give a platform to Sulkowicz should feel obligated to report that this is a messy, messy situation in which the facts are seriously disputed.\nKnowing what we know (and what we don't know), anyone suggesting we should uncritically applaud Sulkowicz is either unscrupulous, or deeply misinformed."}
