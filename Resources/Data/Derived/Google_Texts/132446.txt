An eight month long investigation has led to a big drug arrest in Sierra Vista.

In what's been dubbed as "Operation Bowtie" police seized more than a quarter million dollars worth of methamphetamines, heroin, and $10,000 in cash when they arrested John Thomas Jordan, 32.

Police said they had been watching Jordan for months before moving in. They finally got him while he was driving down Highway 90 near Sierra Vista. Police said his girlfriend violated a traffic law, so they were able to stop the couple, and find probable cause for an arrest.

Police said a K-9 unit was called to the scene, the dog air-sniffed drugs in the vehicle.

Detective Johnathon Hoyt with SVPD's Community Response Team, described Jordan's demeanor when they conducted the traffic stop.

"He was leaned back, had his arms crossed back against his chest, he appeared super nervous, staring straight ahead. His eyes were wide open," said Hoyt.

Police are calling Jordan one of the top drug dealers in the community.

"He is the top of the hierarchy. We see low level street dealers and users that have drugs for personal use. We don't see large quanties that's why we were targeting him," said Hoyt.

Police said Jordan was getting the drugs from Mexico and selling it to low level street dealers and users all over Arizona.

"They say drugs are a victimless crime, it's just affecting the individuals who are using the drug, but it's not. These users will commit other crimes, burglaries and thefts," said Hoyt.

The Community Response Team was made up of Sierra Vista Police officers, Department of Homeland Security agents, a Border Patrol officer, and DPS officers.

Police said seven others were in custody. They were street level dealers, and those who bought drugs from Jordan, but police have not released their names at this time.

Jordan now faces a long list of drug related charges.
