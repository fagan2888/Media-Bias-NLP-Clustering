Furthermore, half of states contract with managed care plans to provide only specific services, such as behavioral health, dental care, nonemergency transportation, or prescription drugs.\n\nThat number will only tick upward, Smith predicted; states making some sort of managed care change will grow next year to 35, up from 28 this year and 20 in 2012, he said. The growth comes from more care coordination initiatives and handling beneficiaries dually enrolled in Medicare.\n\nSmith also noted that 14 states will have some sort of change to their managed long-term care in 2014, when only five did so the last 2 years.\n\n\"When Nebraska is doing managed long-term care, you know something significant is happening,\" Smith said. \"That's exactly what is happening right now.\"\n\nAdditionally, 21 states will launch expanded Medicaid health homes next year, Smith said, as they try to better coordinate care amongst providers.\n\nAs managed care grows, so too does the risk to providers, who are increasingly responsible for their patients' care.\n\n\"You need to have a single entity that's responsible for outcomes and hold that entity accountable for that, and that's what we're trying to do in Arizona,\" Thomas Betlach, Medicaid director in the state, said at the MHPA conference.\n\nIn Arizona, the state Medicaid program has asked its managed care clients to share information on patients with primary care providers to help them manage patients.\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors in Washington, said Monday almost all of the people covered by the ACA's Medicaid expansion will be in managed care. But Medicaid programs and health plans will need to change the way they handle patients to realize gains from managed care.\n\n\"The potential value both from a quality standpoint and also a cost standpoint is huge,\" Salo said. \"But so is the leap in terms of the complexity that is required.\"\n\nCindy Mann, JD, director of Medicaid and CHIP Services at the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services, was to deliver to opening keynote address but had to cancel, citing the government shutdown, organizers said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David  Pittman", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Medicaid/42397", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Roughly 85% of Medicaid enrollees will be in managed care organizations by 2020, a health consultant and former state Medicaid director predicted here.", "card": "Summary", "title": "Managed Care Seen as Future of Medicaid"}, "dc.date.issued": "2013-10-21 14:05:23", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "practicemanagement,primarycare,publichealthpolicy,healthpolicy,generalprimarycare,washington-watch,medicaid,reimbursement,reform,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-21 14:05:23", "sailthru.title": "Managed Care Seen as Future of Medicaid", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 0, "description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Roughly 85% of Medicaid enrollees will be in managed care organizations by 2020, a health consultant and former state Medicaid director predicted here.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-18 14:10:23", "date": "2013-10-21 14:05:23", "sailthru.description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Roughly 85% of Medicaid enrollees will be in managed care organizations by 2020, a health consultant and former state Medicaid director predicted here.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Medicaid/42397", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Roughly 85% of Medicaid enrollees will be in managed care organizations by 2020, a health consultant and former state Medicaid director predicted here.", "title": "Managed Care Seen as Future of Medicaid"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2013-10-21 14:05:23", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "Other,primarycare,pain_management", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca435\"", "article_summary": "-- Roughly 85% of Medicaid enrollees will be in managed care organizations by 2020, a health consultant and former state Medicaid director predicted here.\nMichael Rashid, MHPA board chair, too noted the increase in Medicaid managed care during his address.\nAs managed care grows, so too does the risk to providers, who are increasingly responsible for their patients' care.\nIn Arizona, the state Medicaid program has asked its managed care clients to share information on patients with primary care providers to help them manage patients.\nAs Medicaid becomes a larger chunk of state budgets and enrollment grows under Medicaid expansion of the Affordable Care Act, states are turning to managed care to better handle costs, especially for certain populations, said Smith, a former Medicaid director in Michigan."}
