The number of restaurants in the city has grown from 800 to more than 1,400, according to Mark Romig, president of New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp.



There has been a marked increase for hotels as well, with inventory returning to the 38,000 hotel rooms it had prior to Katrina. Major chains like Virgin Hotels and Ace Hotels have begun development in the city.

New Orleans has 80,000 jobs in the hospitality sector and is slated to add 33,000 more in preparation for its tricentennial.

And that's not all.

The French Quarter, the crown jewel of New Orleans, endured considerable damage during Hurricane Katrina, but has since been revitalized along with the other 72 neighborhoods in the city.

New Orleans is slated to host 126 permitted festivals in 2015 all across the city, from the six-mile stretch of retail shops on Magazine Street to the art galleries in Bywater and the Jazz Market in the Garden District.

"We are looking at this week, particularly with the 10th anniversary of Katrina, as really a pivot point," Romig said. "It's important for us to remember those that we lost and the loss that occurred in the city and to thank those individuals and organizations and cities and countries that came to our aid, but it's also important to for us to close this door and look forward."
