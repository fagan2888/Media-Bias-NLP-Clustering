Bobby Jindal said that the Democratic presidency of Barack Obama is \u201ctaking us down the path towards socialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to see our future, look at Greece,\u201d said Jindal, who is running to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016. \u201cTaxes are too high, government spending is too high, pensions are underfunded, regulations are stifling the economy and private sector growth is too slow. But there is one key difference. The EU [European Union] may decide to bail out Greece. There is nobody that can bail out America. We are the last hope left for the free world.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreece gave us democracy, now they\u2019re showing us how to kill one,\u201d Jindal added. \u201cBut before we get on our high horse and start lecturing them, we need to look in the mirror. This is a warning sign of where we could be headed.\u201d\n\nJindal also criticized Obama\u2019s foreign policy and his negotiation skills. The Iranians and the Chinese get whatever they want, he claims, but the president won\u2019t even talk to Congress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why congressional leaders keep folding to him,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cNobody else does.\u201d\n\nAsked by an attendee about Social Security, Jindal said that entitlement programs must be reformed, and that those in Washington, D.C., who say otherwise are \u201cmath deniers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louisiana Gov.
