The slideshow also includes previously unpublished cartoons.\n\nGovernor John Kasich's chances of becoming the nominee were likely doomed when he agreed to Obamacare medicaid expansion in Ohio. Despite polls showing him beating Clinton in a general election, and being the governor of a key battle ground state hosting the convention, Kasich never registered with primary voters. At one point he was trailing both Trump and Ben Carson in Ohio.\n\nKasich's two biggest accomplishments were coming off as the \"Prince of Light\", when as a Congressmen and Governor he was known for being the Prince of Gruffness, and going from barely making the prime-time debate cut, to being the last of the field to suspend his campaign.\n\nThe Ted Cruz and Donald Trump relationship went from good, to bad, to ugly. Any chance Cruz had at winning the nomination in a contested convention really ended when he criticized Trump's \"New York Values\" in a debate. The comment wasn't forgotten by voters in New York, Pennsylvania and other eastern state primaries, where Cruz was not only blown out by Trump, he sometimes came in behind Marco Rubio and Ben Carson, who had dropped out weeks earlier. The huge momentum Trump had coming out of New York and Pennsylvania sealed his victory in Indiana and the fate of the Cruz and Kasich campaigns.\n\nHad Trump and Cruz remained on good terms, Trump might have chosen Cruz as a running mate, or if elected president, Trump might have nominated him for the U.S Supreme court.
