Bond was set at $46,000.\n\nAccording to warrants, a car crashed through a fence just after 8:30 p.m. on Friday outside Salvation Army on Kraft street. The fence surrounded a smoking area and several people were outside at the time, including a man at a picnic table who was injured.\n\nThe driver got out of the car and ran away, but police apprehended him a short time later and returned him to Salvation Army where he was positively identified, because he had previously stayed there, warrants said.\n\nWarrants said the 1996 Honda Accord involved in the crash had been reported stolen in Nashville, and arresting officers indicated that Jefferson gave them multiple names and dates of birth when he was taken into custody.\n\nThe man who was injured in the crash was taken to Gateway Medical Center were he was treated for an injury to his back and was released.\n\nAbout arrests\n\nReaders are reminded that an arrest, charge or indictment is an allegation and not a statement of guilt.
