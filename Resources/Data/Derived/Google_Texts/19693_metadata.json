She said it was most confusing for those who had never heard of the clinic.\n\n\n\nIn Zack\u2019s eyes, the most important part of the name change involves the change in who the clinic serves.\n\n\n\nShe defines \u201cunderinsured\u201d as pertaining to those whose insurance coverage isn\u2019t keeping up with what they can afford to pay for medical care. She said the clinic has a core group of patients who voiced their desire to remain patients, despite enrolling into a basic insurance program because they are still unable to visit a doctor when they need care due to the cost of monthly premiums, high deductibles and co-pays.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur new name gives us the opportunity to broaden our reach and provide the continuity of care our existing patients desire,\u201d Zack said.\n\n\n\nThe Wyandotte Clinic for the Working Uninsured began in 2005 with the purpose of providing preventive and primary care for working adults.
