So, today, I am asking for your help,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told students April 27 at Georgetown University. The town hall event in Gaston Hall was hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service.\n\nRyan spoke about building a confident America before taking questions from students in the audience and via Twitter.\n\n\n\nHe began by telling the student crowd that he wanted to make the case for supporting Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe America that you want is the America that we want: open, diverse, dynamic. It is what I call a confident America, where the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life \u2014 where we tackle our problems together so that all of us can thrive.\u201d\n\nRyan's remarks covered student debt, the war on poverty and rehabilitation for criminals, among other issues, examples of the work needing to be done in this country. He urged the students in front of him to step up and get involved: \u201cWe need your ideas.\u201d\n\nAfter his speech, in keeping with the town hall format, Ryan took off his suit jacket and rolled up his sleeves as he prepared to answer questions.\n\nInevitably, the talk turned to the current election, with one student asking what advice Ryan had for young Republicans who feel they have few desirable options in this race.\n\nRyan said that, beyond the person, young voters should consider the ideas and the platforms that are being advanced. \u201cIn front of you is not just a vote for a person, a political personality. In front of you, if we do our jobs the right way, will be a choice of two paths that you will have to take.\u201d\n\nRyan also addressed questions about immigration, the Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act and the difficulties students face in paying for higher education. He said he opposed the Democrats' solutions to these problems and gave his reasons why. Though he highlighted the need for viable Republican alternatives, he did not always explicitly share those in his answers.\n\nIn his response to the question of paying for college, perhaps the issue closest to the hearts of the millennials in the hall, Ryan called for more competition in student lending and among colleges \u2014 and the need to have credits more easily transfer. He even commented on his host Georgetown University\u2019s high tuition.\n\n\u201cNot everybody can afford a place like this. So how do we get this kind of an education within reach of people who have no chance of affording it?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "ugP87rLrMjrBYBz9rCcVsjWtHPbxwO_sPTuJFJaAP8M"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOnly we the people can build a confident America.\nSo, today, I am asking for your help,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told students April 27 at Georgetown University.\nRyan spoke about building a confident America before taking questions from students in the audience and via Twitter.\nThe town hall event in Gaston Hall was hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service.\n\u201cThe America that you want is the America that we want: open, diverse, dynamic."}
