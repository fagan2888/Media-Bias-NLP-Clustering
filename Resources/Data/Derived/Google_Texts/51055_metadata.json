For Los Angeles Lakers guard Kent Bazemore, 24, it happened in a week.\n\nLast month, the Lakers traded for Bazemore, along with MarShon Brooks in exchange for their own fan favorite, point guard Steve Blake. Many members of Laker Nation, including Kobe Bryant, criticized the deal.\n\nThat perception is starting to shift now that Bazemore, the Bay Area \u2014 and blogosphere \u2014 favorite has had a chance to see the court for a Lakers team in dire need of wing talent and, at the very least, excitement.\n\nBazemore, a 6-foot-5 shooting guard, is playing almost 30 minutes per game since moving to Los Angeles and he\u2019s made the most of the opportunity, scoring a shade below 15 points per game in 10 games for the Lakers. Compare that to his career averages of two points and five minutes per game in 105 games with the Warriors.\n\nThe only downside for Laker fans is that because he\u2019s spending so much more time on the court, there are far fewer chances for him to perform his outrageous bench celebrations.\n\nIf the Lakers are capable of producing a SportsCenter-worthy highlight this season when Bazemore is in a seated position, you\u2019ll immediately notice a blur of motion enter your peripheral vision. The source of that movement will be Bazemore\u2019s caffeinated, fast-twitch fiber celebrations.\n\nHe might sprint down the sidelines following an emphatic dunk, knees raised high, a subtle reminder of his track and field background. Or perhaps he\u2019ll unleash the Greek statue of celebrations, a move known as \u201cBazemoring.\u201d His hips will drop low, legs will extend, while his flexed arms and titled head point skyward \u2014 half celebration, half yoga position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all natural, I really don\u2019t premeditate what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d said Bazemore.\n\nIn Jack Nicholson\u2019s backyard, captivating performances are generally associated with the Botox brigade in attendance, not NBA bench players. But if you\u2019ve watched the Golden State Warriors the last two seasons, then you\u2019re probably already aware of his celebrations, even if you weren\u2019t able to place a name with the acrobatics. A YouTube compilation of his greatest fits has already amassed more than 260,000 views.\n\nVideo game company Visual Sports, creator of the popular NBA 2K franchise, certainly noticed. Last summer, they brought Bazemore into their studios and strapped motion-capturing sensors to his torso, to accurately depict his reactions in the game. Bazemore even has a brief cameo in the game\u2019s official trailer.\n\nBazemore doesn\u2019t have to think twice when asked about the play that created his most animated reaction: Harrison Barnes\u2019 dunk on Minnesota Timberwolves center Nicolas Pecovic, a rim meeting that\u2019s on most shortlists for best dunk of 2013.\n\n\u201cIt was the first NBA poster I\u2019ve seen in person,\u201d said Bazemore. \u201cI ran from the baseline all the way up to the scorer\u2019s table almost and back.\u201d\n\nBut Bazemore\u2019s excitable bench presence can be traced back a few years earlier, to his freshman year at Old Dominion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always had a sense for the stage, for the game,\u201d said Blaine Taylor, Old Dominion\u2019s former head coach. \u201cIt kind of harkens back to \u2018Cedric Cornbread\u2019 Maxwell, when he was with the Celtics. He was very well-received by the fans because a lot of guys try to be too cool and don\u2019t seem as human.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Taylor, and the rest of the Old Dominion team, to witness the euphoria.\n\nIn the fourth game of the 2008 NCAA season, the Georgetown Hoyas paid a visit. Bazemore redshirted his freshman season, so he sat close to the coaches, wearing a bright orange tie, with matching shoes.\n\n\u201cIt was his first time seeing a heavyweight come into our building,\u201d said John Richardson, an assistant coach at Old Dominion.\n\n\u201c[The Hoyas] were loaded \u2014 Roy Hibbert, DaJuan Summers, Jeff Green,\u201d said Bazemore. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very intense game and the referee makes this horrible call and I jump up screaming.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden,\u201d Taylor recalled of Bazemore\u2019s reaction. \u201cHe\u2019s waving a towel, guys are screaming and yelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe referee walks over and says, \u2018If you don\u2019t sit down, I\u2019m going to throw you out of the game,\u2019\u201d Bazemore remembered. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh man, maybe I\u2019m doing too much over here.\u2019 That was kind of what started everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first you\u2019re like, \u2018Who is this cartoon character?\u2019\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut the more you saw him that redshirt year, the more you realized how much he loved pulling for his teammates whether it was pushing them in practice or pulling for them in the game.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Bazemore was caught up in the moment considering the change in stage size.\n\n\u201cI came from a small town called Kelford [Virginia]\u201d Bazemore said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much down there. I didn\u2019t even have any stoplights where I grew up.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in a 245-person town, Bazemore was able to dabble in various sports, often training with the track team. A natural athlete, he once cleared 6-foot-8 in the high jump and ran the 200-meter sprint in 22.6 seconds.\n\n\u201cThe problem down there is he didn\u2019t get the gym time and have the one-on-one instruction,\u201d said Richardson, a fellow Kelford native. \u201cThere was one coach in charge of multiple sports.\u201d\n\nStill, Richardson saw the potential and wound up recruiting Bazemore. \u201cHe was the best athlete on the floor,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cAs a high school sophomore, he could do things that kids in college can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOnce Bazemore arrived at Old Dominion, he took full advantage of his academic opportunities. In contrast to the pervasive one-and-done culture in college hoops, Bazemore is something of a rarity, an NBA player who graduated college \u2014 with two degrees in human services and criminal justice \u2014 before playing professionally.\n\n\u201cKent had the extra year and the extra time and the extra education to be more mature and more comfortable in his own skin by the time he got to the NBA,\u201c Taylor said.\n\n\u201cStaying all four years helped me because I was able to grow as a person,\u201d said Bazemore.\n\nThe four years, however, did not lead to a draft night phone call even though Bazemore won the Lefty Driesell Award as the NCAA\u2019s top defensive player in 2011. Bazemore again had to prove himself.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like a snapshot of my entire life,\u201d said Bazemore. \u201cOnce draft day came, my agent told me that the chances [of getting drafted] were slim, but I already had my mind made up that I\u2019m going to continue to work hard.\u201d\n\nBazemore secured a spot in the summer league, before eventually being signed by the Warriors. Once he joined the team, Richard Jefferson immediately mentored the rookie, playing after practice and even letting Bazemore use his San Francisco apartment over the summer.\n\n\u201cI was a huge Richard Jefferson fan when he played with the New Jersey Nets,\u201d said Bazemore.\n\nJefferson still sends Bazemore game tape to study and takes an active role in keeping him focused. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a guy I\u2019d never take for granted,\u201d said Bazemore. \u201cAll the stuff you see me doing is 95 percent him.\u201d\n\nBeyond basketball, Bazemore would like to eventually put his degrees to use.\n\n\u201cI want to get into mentoring and I did a lot of shadowing of mentors in college,\u201d said Bazemore. \u201cJust trying to help kids try to turn their life around, which is what I ultimately want to get into.\u201d\n\nHis former coach agrees.\n\n\u201cI see him in a public setting, being very visible,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cHe has a knack for that and is well-suited for something of that nature.\u201d\n\nHomepage image courtesy of Flickr, Rose White/yarnivore.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "basketball,Laker Nation,Lakers,Los Angeles Lakers,Los Angeles Lakers guard,Marshon Brooks,National Basketball Association,NBA,Sports,Steve Blake,Thomas Johnson,Warriors,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured", "description": "Kent Bazemore, a 6-foot-5 shooting guard for the Lakers, is playing almost 30 minutes per game since moving to Los Angeles, and he\u2019s made the most of the\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc05f\"", "article_summary": "Jefferson still sends Bazemore game tape to study and takes an active role in keeping him focused.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always had a sense for the stage, for the game,\u201d said Blaine Taylor, Old Dominion\u2019s former head coach.\nCompare that to his career averages of two points and five minutes per game in 105 games with the Warriors.\nLast month, the Lakers traded for Bazemore, along with MarShon Brooks in exchange for their own fan favorite, point guard Steve Blake.\n\u201cKent had the extra year and the extra time and the extra education to be more mature and more comfortable in his own skin by the time he got to the NBA,\u201c Taylor said."}
