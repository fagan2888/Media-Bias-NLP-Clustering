A Collier County man was arrested for allegedly molesting an 11-year-old girl.

According to reports, a school counselor reported the child had been sexually abused.



The victim said she had moved to Naples from Honduras about nine months ago.

She told deputies Cecilio Rivera-Lozano, 24, had been sexually abusing her almost every day for the past eight months, beginning in March.

On Wednesday, the victim told a neighbor Rivera-Lozano had been forcing sex acts upon her. The neighbor reported the allegations to the victim's mother and school counselor.

Detectives interviewed Rivera-Lozano on Friday and eventually arrested him.

Rivera-Lozano refused to talk about the allegations but agreed to take a polygraph examination.

The detective who gave him the polygraph examination said results revealed Rivera-Lozano to be deceitful.

Rivera-Lozano is being held with no bond due to him being an illegal immigrant.
