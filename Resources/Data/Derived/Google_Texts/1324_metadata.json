On the business side, Comcast competes against companies like CenturyLink and Boulder\u2019s Zayo Group.\n\n\u201cThis particular investment is in addition to our ongoing infrastructure investments and will enable us to reach even more commercial customers throughout the Metro Denver area,\u201d said Parsons, pointing to features like Ethernet private lines and cloud-based phone service. \u201c\u2026The investment is primarily dedicated to expand our network to serve more businesses, which could include commercial grade services, including business Wi-Fi, etc.\u201d\n\nThe latest investment is separate from Comcast\u2019s investment in public Wi-Fi and its push to offer gigabit Internet to residential customers, she added.\n\nLast week, Comcast announced Gigabit Pro, and plans to offer this up-to-2 gbps Internet service in Atlanta beginning in May.\n\nAs for Denver?\n\n\u201cWe plan to roll out the service to more cities soon including Denver and will let you know when customers are eligible,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Colorado, CenturyLink began offering gigabit service to customers in Denver this year. Longmont built its own fiber-optic pipe and now offers gigabit service to residents. Also, Google Fiber recently registered to do business in Colorado but the company said it\u2019s not ready to add Denver to its broadband list.\n\nMore on Gigabit Internet\n\nView RSS feed\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Atlanta,broadband,CenturyLink,Comcast,Comcast Business,fiber,fiber network,gigabit,Gigabit Pro,Zayo", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "Comcast gigabit targets Denver businesses, not consumers (yet) | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/07/comcast-gigabit-targets-denver-businesses-not-consumers-yet/16635/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/comcast2gbps.jpg?fit=495%2C316", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "Comcast gigabit targets Denver businesses, not consumers (yet)", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/07/comcast-gigabit-targets-denver-businesses-not-consumers-yet/16635/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/comcast2gbps.jpg?fit=495%2C316", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Gigabit broadband spreads in Denver as Comcast Business ups investment for commercial customers.
