A super PAC supporting Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has released two new ads taking dead aim at Chris Christie, portraying the New Jersey governor as an Obama-loving liberal.The ad shows Christie alongside the president, calling him "Obama's favorite Republican" and criticizing his record on Common Core and Internet sales taxes.The spot ends with one last dig: "Chris Christie: One high tax, Common Core, liberal energy loving, Obamacare Medicaid expanding President is enough."Another ad faults him for the Bridgegate scandal and falling short on job growth in New Jersey. The spots will air in New Hampshire, where the candidates are depending on strong showings in order to gain traction in the race for the Republican nomination.Just hours after the Conservative Solutions PAC ads were aired, Christie replied in kind."I just wonder what happened to the Marco who so indignantly looked at Jeb Bush and said 'I guess someone must have convinced you that going negative against me helps you,'" Christie said on Bloomberg TV's "With All Due Respect." "I guess that same person must now have convinced Marco that going negative against Chris Christie is what he needs to do."Christie defended his record as "a good one" and touted the growth of private sector jobs in New Jersey."If Senator Rubio would just show up for work once in a while, he's only got one job, he's got to cast votes in the United States Senate," Christie said. "If he thinks that's a worthless job, which he has basically said before, he should resign it. If he doesn't, then he should show up and vote."The two Republicans are currently battling for votes from the establishment wing of the party. Nationally, Christie is polling in fifth place while Rubio has risen to third. In New Hampshire, where Christie is polling higher compared to his national average, he is slightly trailing the Florida senator.
