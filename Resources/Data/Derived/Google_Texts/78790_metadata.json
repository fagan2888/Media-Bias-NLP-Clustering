Birth control vs. religious liberty\n\nThe Supreme Court in early spring will hear two legal challenges to Obamacare\u2019s contraception coverage requirement, a case that addresses a complex question that has never come squarely before the court: Can a for-profit company engaged in commercial activities declare religious beliefs?\n\nUnder the women\u2019s preventive health benefit in the Affordable Care Act most employers must provide all Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception with no co-pays. There are exemptions for religious organizations and ways for religious-affiliated institutions to try to work around the requirement. But owners of nonreligious businesses who oppose some or all contraceptives say the government shouldn\u2019t be able to require them to break with their religious beliefs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Obama administration says the coverage requirement is about health \u2014 not religion \u2014 and business owners shouldn\u2019t be able to impose their views on their employees. They say the contraception policy is based on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine on the health of all women and their families.\n\nSo far, the lower courts have split on the issue, sending it to the Supreme Court. One hour of oral arguments is expected in March, and a ruling will come before the court\u2019s term ends in June. Here are five key questions:\n\n1. Who is bringing these cases?\n\nNearly 100 companies, nonprofits and religious groups, including several Catholic dioceses, have challenged the birth control rule. The two cases the Supreme Court took involve commercial interests. One case was brought by Hobby Lobby, a national chain store owned by a Christian couple who says it operates its business strictly in adherence to Christian principles. The other was brought by Conestoga Wood Specialties, a furniture store owned by a Mennonite family that employs about 950 people.\n\n\u201cWhat it shows in taking on both cases is that the court is interested in hearing the full array of issues that were present in both petitions and the diversity in which Americans practice their faith in all types of business,\u201d said David Cortman of Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Conestoga.\n\nThe other cases brought by religious groups and nonprofits have not advanced as quickly through the court system because the Obama administration did not finalize an attempt at an accommodation until the summer. Those groups argue that the accommodation \u2014 which allows them to have their insurance company pay for the contraception \u2014 is not broad enough. Depending on how the Supreme Court rules, the Hobby Lobby-Conestoga decision is likely to affect those religious and nonprofit cases, too.\n\n2. What will the court review?\n\nHobby Lobby filed its challenge under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says that \u201cgovernments should not substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification.\u201d The company, which says on its website that \u201cwe believe that it is by God\u2019s grace and provision that Hobby Lobby has endured,\u201d was granted an injunction to block the policy.\n\nConestoga argues that the coverage requirement is invalid under both the religious freedom law as well as the religious liberty protections in the First Amendment. An appeals court ruled that the policy is legal and denied Conestoga\u2019s attempt to block it.\n\nThe Supreme Court will most likely have to consider both whether a company that engages in commercial activity can have religious beliefs and whether such religious rights \u201cpass through\u201d from the owners to the business and how it operates.\n\nThat will be analyzed through both the Constitution and the religious freedom law.\n\n3.
