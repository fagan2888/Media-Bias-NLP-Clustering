Private payers have launched another 300-plus ACOs of their own.\n\nAnd California\u2019s been at the center of the action. By some counts, more than 100 ACOs \u2014 about one in seven nationwide \u2014 are located in the Golden State.\n\nBut the state of the nation\u2019s ACOs isn\u2019t universally strong. Many ACOs have yet to report significant savings or quality improvements. Some ACO leaders are frustrated with payers\u2019 terms, saying they\u2019re too punitive.\n\nAnd with providers taking a hard look at whether they want to continue in Medicare\u2019s programs, will the ACOs of the future come from California?\n\nA Golden State for Accountable Care\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that ACOs would take hold in California: The state\u2019s history has made it fertile ground for payment pilots, experts told California Healthline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re much more prepared in California to do at-risk contracting,\u201d says Stephen Shortell, a health policy management professor at UC-Berkeley and director of the Center for Healthcare Organizational and Innovation Research.\n\nShortell ticks off some of those reasons: The state\u2019s long experience with large, multispecialty medical groups; a record of progressive payment reforms; the unique role of Kaiser Permanente, particularly in setting the tone.\n\nDozens of hospitals and physician groups in California have joined Medicare\u2019s ACO programs. But what\u2019s helped distinguish the state is the activity on the commercial side, where Blue Shield of California and Anthem Blue Cross have led the way, Shortell says. More than 80% of the private-payer ACOs in the state are through those two organizations, he estimates.\n\nSome of the early results \u2014 and initiatives \u2014 have been eye-catching.\n\nAn ACO formed by Blue Shield, Dignity Health and Hill Physicians Medical Group saved CalPERS $37 million in 2010 and 2011. In late 2014, Anthem and seven hospital systems formed Vivity, essentially a virtual ACO for the Los Angeles area.\n\nAnd last week, Anthem reported that an ACO with six medical groups resulted in a 7.3% decline in admissions per 1,000 patients, which led to a drop in spending on inpatient care.\n\nSeveral observers have suggested that these California-based pilots could end up as national models for providers and insurers that are weighing their own ACOs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overstate [last week\u2019s] Anthem findings,\u201d Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, tells California Healthline. But \u201cI find these results very encouraging, because we should expect better care coordination in the sector of the market that has been virtually unmanaged to produce savings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSavings could be greater in the future as these programs mature and are scaled up to more medical groups,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd the numbers are starting to add up.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that California\u2019s ACOs are helping to move the state toward achieving the vision of having 60 percent of the population receiving care in integrated systems by 2022,\u201d Shortell and his colleague Richard Scheffler wrote in Health Affairs last week. \u201c[A]nd at the same time reducing the percentage of the state\u2019s health care expenditures paid through fee-for-service arrangements from 78 percent today to 50 percent by 2022.\u201d\n\nMedicare\u2019s ACO Initiatives at a Crossroads\n\nThe optimism around California\u2019s accountable care initiatives comes as some observers are growing pessimistic about Medicare\u2019s ACO programs.\n\nWhile some Medicare ACOs \u2014 although none in California \u2014 have collected savings of more than $50 million, more than half of the 400 organizations in the Medicare Shared Savings Program reportedly are wavering on whether to continue. One-third of participants have already dropped out from the Pioneer program.\n\n\u201cWe were getting harmed,\u201d Allison Fleury, then-CEO of Sharp HealthCare ACO, told California Healthline after her organization quit the Pioneer program last fall. \u201cAnd that\u2019s basically the case for all California ACOs.\u201d\n\n(In hopes of retaining MSSP participants, CMS issued a new rule last week that delays some of the punitive measures.)\n\nOne reason why Medicare ACOs aren\u2019t as popular with providers? The terms tend to be one-size-fits-all, says David Muhlestein, director of research for Leavitt Partners. In contrast, commercial ACOs \u201chave the ability to negotiate the terms of the commercial contracts with the payer,\u201d he points out.\n\nExperts stressed: Medicare\u2019s placed a big bet on the ACO model. HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has pledged that 50% of Medicare payments will flow through ACOs, or ACO-like models, by 2018.\n\nYet Medicare\u2019s ACOs have lagged private-payers\u2019 ACOs in several key areas.\n\n\u201c[M]any ACOs have found that accountable care arrangements in the private sector can support greater innovation in care,\u201d Brookings Institution researchers wrote in a recent Health Affairs blog post. \u201cThe commercial sector seems to be leading in payment and contracting innovation that can enable larger shifts away from [fee-for-service] payment with downside financial risk.\u201d\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nMuhlestein thinks that Medicare\u2019s working to be progressive with ACOs, such as by debuting a new model shifts more risk to providers that are ready for it.\n\n\u201cThe [Next Generation] model really is pushing the boundaries of what CMS has done in the past in terms of pushing risk to providers within the confines of the open-network Medicare program,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhich organizations apply and are accepted into the program will show CMS\u2019s vision of how which providers are best-prepared to take more risk.\u201d\n\nBut Medicare\u2019s broad push to keep more providers in ACO programs by delaying the pain may not be the right answer, either. And while some California ACOs show promise, \u201cwe\u2019re moving too slowly as a nation,\u201d says Shortell.\n\n\u201cWe need to move more quickly to downside risk, not just these upside shared savings.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nThe challenge of becoming an insurer. The ACA has encouraged more providers to take on risk, but hospitals making the shift to running a health plan may be in for a \u201crough landing,\u201d Melanie Evans writes at Modern Healthcare.\n\nWhat the states are \u2014 and aren\u2019t \u2014 doing to prepare for the King v. Burwell ruling. Writing at Health Affairs, a team led by David K. Jones and Nicholas Bagley canvassed how the states are preparing for potential outcomes in the much-watched Supreme Court case.\n\nHow the White House could fix the ACA if SCOTUS rules against it. Tom Scully, the former head of CMS under President George W. Bush, believes the Obama administration could unilaterally move to fix many problems that would result from the ACA\u2019s subsidies being struck down in the federal exchange, Dylan Scott writes at National Journal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organizations experimenting with the much-hyped accountable care organization model are starting to report uneven results.
