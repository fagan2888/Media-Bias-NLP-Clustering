He declared for the draft after that, his junior season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just reiterating my game, being a winner, being a team player, being that consistent person,\u201d said Johnson, who averaged 16.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game during the season. \u201cAnd showing that my position, being a combo guard, is a plus not a minus.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-2 Johnson is a solid defensive guard, which is of most importance to the Nuggets, who are looking to improve their perimeter defensive profile this offseason.\n\n\u201cFrom Day 1, you\u2019re going to get my leadership, my good attitude and a solid defender,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m going to work my tail off. And it\u2019s easy for me because it\u2019s something that I like to do. I love playing defense, I love getting blocked shots, I love coming over on help side and stuff like that. I think that\u2019s definitely one of the big draws for me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the 5-foot-9 Jefferson is out to prove that height is nothing but a number.\n\nHe\u2019s already turned heads being the Division II men\u2019s player of the year for a Metro State team that finished 32-2 and advanced to the semifinals of the NCAA Division II tournament.\n\n\u201cIn the NBA, it\u2019s all about height,\u201d said Jefferson, who displayed every bit of the sharp shooting that led him to average 45.3 percent from the 3-point line. Jefferson scored 21.6 points per game. \u201cI\u2019m done growing. I think I can make it (to the NBA). I have the confidence, God gave me good talent. I\u2019ve just got to work my butt off and make it.\u201d\n\nJefferson pointed to former Nuggets Earl Boykins and Anthony Carter as examples of smaller guards that did just fine. And in fact the Nuggets have two sub-six footers at guard in starter Ty Lawson and reserve Nate Robinson.\n\nGetting a shot with the Nuggets\u2019 summer league team \u2014 or any other NBA team\u2019s summer league squad \u2014 would be the next logical step for Jefferson.\n\n\u201cIt would be a great opportunity to see how the NBA works, the different coaches, the different plays and stuff,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cSo that\u2019s my goal to make the summer league.\u201d\n\nAlso in the workout were Towson forward Jerrelle Benimon and Central Florida guard Isaiah Sykes. Sykes could not finish the workout due to a hamstring injury.\n\nNUGGETS WORKOUTS TO DATE\n\nThe Nuggets have worked out seven players to date \u2014 two formal workouts and one private workout.
