It seemed so glamorous!\n\nThen, in the interview, her would-be boss swore like a trooper, and couldn\u2019t get Nihad\u2019s name right, saying it \u201cwas too ethnic.\u201d Despite her misgivings, Peavler took the position. She lasted all of four months. And it turned out those first few clues were just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.\n\n\"She was like the boss in The Devil Wears Prada, except not as imporant, Nihad now says wryly.\n\nRelated: 7 Signs Your Job Interview is Going Well\n\nIf you keep your wits about you, you can determine a lot about the job you\u2019re gunning for by reading between the lines. Of course, job number-one is to impress your interviewer and make them want you\u2014you can always decline the offer if it doesn\u2019t feel like a fit. But don\u2019t forget to take stock while you\u2019re busy knocking their socks off.\n\n\u201cAn interview should be an employer\u2019s best day,\u201d says Dana Manciagli, a career expert and consultant in Seattle, \u201cso candidates should pay close attention to anything that seems amiss. If things aren\u2019t right at the interview, it can only go downhill from there, and you\u2019ll likely end up looking for another job.\u201d\n\nHere are eight red flags to pay attention to before you sign on the dotted line.\n\n1. Your interviewer is very late. \u201cNot respecting someone\u2019s time isn\u2019t just rude, it\u2019s bad for business,\u201d says Manciagli. Sure, scheduling mishaps happen, but she points out that interviews are often scheduled with plenty of lead time, and most hiring managers should give themselves at least 15 minutes of prep before someone comes in. For your interviewer to sidle in considerably later than you agreed on, without an ounce of contrition, is a major red flag. \u201cIf they\u2019re this rude at the interview, imagine how they would be as a manager,\u201d she notes.\n\n2. She badmouths the person you\u2019d be replacing. While it\u2019s appropriate for your interviewer to talk about current roles in the department, or how it\u2019s structured, be wary of any hiring manager who badmouths someone who just left the company, or the boss she currently works for.\n\nRelated: 7 Signs Your Job Interview is Going Well\n\n\u201cNo hiring manager should ever speak ill about the person they are replacing. That shows poor character and judgment and also speaks poorly of the organization,\u201d says Melissa Gentile, a recruiter in New York City.\n\n3. The hiring manager hasn\u2019t reviewed your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. If you\u2019re one of many candidates coming in that day, it\u2019s entirely possible that the hiring manager may not have spent a lot of quality time with your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but they also shouldn\u2019t react as if you just dropped in from Mars.\n\nWhile this realization may (rightly) give you pause, it\u2019s also an opportunity you can use to your advantage: Manciagli suggests using your interviewer\u2019s lack of preparation, as off-putting as it may be, to package yourself as best as possible for the position: \u201cWhen they open with, \u2018Tell me about yourself,\u2019 you can control which parts of your career to highlight,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for whether this is truly a deal-breaker, first consider who didn\u2019t do her homework: If it\u2019s a recruiter who meets with hundreds of candidates a day, file it away, but don\u2019t be overly concerned. If it\u2019s the person who would be your manager, pay closer attention and keep your eyes open for clues during the rest of the interview. She may just have been rushed that day, or it could signal a more serious issue.\n\n4. Your would-be boss couldn\u2019t explain the role clearly. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a hard time explaining the role to friends and family after an interview, that should raise some questions,\u201d says David Lewis, a human resources consultant in Norwalk, Conn. \u201cSometimes hiring managers\u2014especially ones who are visionary, entrepreneur types\u2014think you\u2019d be great at the company, but aren\u2019t quite sure exactly what they want you to do. They\u2019ll spend the interview talking about the company, the culture, but not exactly what you would do.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 7 Worst Job Interivew Mistakes People Make\n\nLewis says candidates shouldn\u2019t be afraid to speak up and admit that the specifics of the role aren\u2019t clear to them yet. \u201cSometimes people are afraid to do this, because they don\u2019t want to rock the boat or make the hiring manager feel awkward,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important from the onset that you can clearly answer the question, \u2018What will I be doing?\u2019 \u201d Another good clarifying question: What would success look like in this role?\n\n5. The company has high turnover, or a toxic culture. Of course you\u2019re going to do your homework before a job interview. Check LinkedIn to see what friends of friends you may know at a given company or organization, and read up.\n\nWhen Kate Groebe*, 36, was contacted about a senior role with a stellar salary at a well-known company, she considered relocating her family for the opportunity\u2014until her husband forwarded her an in-depth and reputable article chronicling the firm\u2019s aggressive, antagonistic work culture, promoted by the hard-driving C.E.O. That was one factor Groebe had overlooked while busy getting starry-eyed about the package.\n\nSimilarly, if a hiring manager mentions that they\u2019re refilling the role for the second or third time in a short amount of time, it\u2019s important to ask why. Lewis says a good question to pose is what the person who recently had the role was doing five years ago, or what your hiring manager\u2019s trajectory has been in the organization. If there\u2019s been a lot of transferring out of the department you\u2019d be working in, proceed with caution.\n\n6. The firm\u2019s online reviews are bad. Similarly, websites such as Glassdoor offer employees a place to anonymously review companies they\u2019ve worked for. Since they are anonymous, they should be taken with a grain of salt. \u201cA lot of these reviews can just be angry elves with an axe to grind,\u201d Lewis says, but adds that it\u2019s important to look for recurring themes in poor reviews.\n\nRealted: 7 Ways to Handle the Worst Job Interview Questions\n\nIf the reviews are recent and all seem to complain about the same thing\u2014bad communication from management, low morale, etc.\u2014that should carry some weight. While you should never lead with that information when you meet a recruiter or hiring manager, you can find a subtle way to ask about the company culture, or what sort of values or management techniques are embraced, during the question and answer portion of your interview.\n\n7. Your interviewer asks personal questions. \u201cAn interview should be objective, not emotional,\u201d counsels Gentile, \u201cand your interviewer shouldn\u2019t blather on about her personal life, or probe about yours.\u201d In general, asking personal questions\u2014about your family, marital status, etc.\u2014is never O.K.\n\n\u201cHiring managers have lots of ways to try to find out if you\u2019re married or have kids,\u201d says Manciagli, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean you have to volunteer any information, especially if they start telling you about their own families. They might not even have one.\u201d Bottom line: You\u2019re there to talk about the job, not how you spent your weekend.\n\n8. Your interviewer checks her email during your meeting. Yes, we live in a digital age, but that doesn\u2019t mean that someone should be checking their phone during the time they allotted to get to know you, says Manciagli. If they\u2019re not paying attention during your interview, chances are they won\u2019t be all ears when you\u2019re an employee, either. Again, consider what role this person might play in your work life.\n\nIf it\u2019s a recruiter, you probably needn\u2019t be overly concerned. If it\u2019s your future supervisor, and they demonstrate other less-than-courteous tendencies, take heed.\n\nThis article originally appeared at LearnVest.com.
