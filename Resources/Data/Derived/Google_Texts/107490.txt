N.Y. Times Magazine hires Emily Bazelon

The New York Times Magazine has hired Slate's Emily Bazelon to serve as a full-time staff writer, the latest in a hiring spree that began when Jake Silverstein took over as editor-in-chief in May.

Bazelon, a senior editor at Slate, has been contributing to the New York Times Magazine since 2007.

“Emily writes with engagement, roving intelligence, and deep knowledge," Silverstein said in a statement. "She has also proven to be nimble at navigating the many platforms of modern media."

News of Bazelon's departure came within minutes of the announcement that Dave Weigel, a Slate blogger, would be leaving the site for Bloomberg Politics. Matthew Yglesias, another Slate blogger, left the site for Ezra Klein's Vox earlier this year. Dave Plotz, the site's editor-in-chief, stepped down in July.

Hadas Gold is a reporter at Politico.
