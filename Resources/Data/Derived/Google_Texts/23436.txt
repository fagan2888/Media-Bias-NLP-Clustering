Pervy uncle Jeremy Renner was presenting alongside Jennifer Lopez tonight. Lopez is a multi-talented singer, dancer and actress, but she is also a woman with breasts, something that Renner astutely observed at the end of his intro, muttering: “You got the Globes, too.” As one does during these shows, people instantly took to twitter to criticize Renner for the dopey remark (or to praise his chutzpah).

I just double checked Wikipedia and J Lo DOES NOT have two Golden Globes. So I don't know what Renner was talking about. #GoldenGlobes — Kel Kendrick (@TVKel) January 12, 2015
