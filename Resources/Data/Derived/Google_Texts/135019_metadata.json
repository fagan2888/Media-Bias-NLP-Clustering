Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a press statement.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have become important sources of public information, and as such they may be used to help scientists identify prevailing attitudes and myths about alcohol, tobacco, and other addictive substances. Additionally, scientists hope to use these interactive media to convey accurate information to the public. Using social media, researchers also may gain insights into patterns of use, risk factors, and behaviors associated with substance use.\n\nAmong those receiving NIH awards, a team led by Dr. Sean Young, assistant professor of family medicine at UCLA, proposes a feasibility study of a social media community model as a method for reducing prescription drug abuse among chronic pain patients. \u201cAlthough low cost, novel interventions are needed to reduce these risk behaviors before they lead to addiction and overdose. Few studies have focused on this area,\u201d noted the researchers. In recent years, prescription drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions with chronic pain patients among the most frequent abusers.\n\nOne grant-winning research team plans to use social method, instead of traditional survey-based approaches, to uncover patterns of substance use in a timely, economical, and in-depth way. Armed with a knowledge of slang, the researchers, who are led by Dr. Yong Ge, a computer science professor at UNC Charlotte, plan to develop advanced data mining techniques to extract tweets directly related to substance use.\n\n\u201cSubstance abuse is a serious health issue facing alarming numbers of young adults (aged from 18 to 25), who often suffer considerable consequences (e.g., blackout, rape, HIV-related sexual risk-taking, academic failure, mental issues, and violence) as a result,\u201d wrote the researchers in their proposal.\n\nFinally, a project led by Dr. Warren K. Bickel, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, focuses on providing better treatment of addiction. \u201cAlthough recognized as a chronic relapsing disorder, addiction is still largely treated as an acute disorder,\u201d wrote this particular team of researchers in their proposal.\n\nThe team proposes to recruit 1,536 multi-substance abusers to participate in two studies of recovery. The researchers will be investigating specific factors that influence whether an addict in recovery decides to participate in an online social network and the extent to which they explore, learn, and become involved in treatment via that activity. The researchers expect to gain an understanding of whether social networks can support continued recovery.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facebook, twitter, prescription drugs, substance abuse, drug use", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The NIH has granted $11 million in awards to researchers exploring the use of social media to advance the prevention and treatment of substance use and addiction.", "title": "Can Social Media Prevent Drug Use From Becoming Abuse?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prescription-drug-abuse-prevention-may-begin-facebook-twitter-and-other-social-media-307366", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/drug-addiction.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NIH has granted $11 million in awards to researchers exploring the use of social media to advance the prevention and treatment of substance use and addiction.", "title": "Can Social Media Prevent Drug Use From Becoming Abuse?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/prescription-drug-abuse-prevention-may-begin-facebook-twitter-and-other-social-media-307366", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/drug-addiction.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/17/drug-addiction.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-10-17T15:22:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-17T15:22:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The NIH has granted $11 million in awards to researchers exploring the use of social media to advance the prevention and treatment of substance use and addiction."}, "article_summary": "Using social media, researchers also may gain insights into patterns of use, risk factors, and behaviors associated with substance use.\nThe NIH has granted $11 million in awards to researchers exploring the use of social media to advance the prevention and treatment of substance use and addiction.\nThe National Institutes of Health has granted more than $11 million in awards to researchers exploring the use of social media to advance the understanding, prevention, and treatment of substance use and addiction.\nIn recent years, prescription drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions with chronic pain patients among the most frequent abusers.\nThe researchers expect to gain an understanding of whether social networks can support continued recovery."}
