One member, the retail clothing outlet Gap, voluntarily disclosed that it gave the coalition at least $1,000 in 2012, according to a document released by the company. But most companies haven\u2019t embraced such additional transparency practices.\n\nLobbying reports filed with Congress provide a bit more information on the group\u2019s finances. Members that contribute $5,000 or more in a quarter and \u201cactively participate in the planning, supervision or control of the lobbying activities\u201d are required to be disclosed, though the exact amounts of their contributions need not be reported.\n\nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association and the American Staffing Association are among those named in E-Flex\u2019s reports to Congress, as are health insurer Aetna, the Food Marketing Institute and the National Restaurant Association.\n\n\u201cSome probably chip in a quarter million\u201d while others give closer to $5,000, said Craig Holman of Public Citizen, a public interest group.\n\nBefore Congress passed reforms in 2007 in the wake of the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, these informal lobbying groups, formerly known as \u201cstealth coalitions,\u201d had no obligation to disclose contributors.\n\nEarlier this month, the E-Flex coalition told the House Ways and Means Committee that the current health care law\u2019s requirements for employers are \u201cfundamentally unworkable.\u201d\n\nThe group asked that the definition of full-time employment be raised from 30 hours per week, arguing that this would \u201cmaintain flexible work options,\u201d allow employees to work more hours in order to take home more pay and let employers offer \u201cmore generous\u201d health coverage to full-time workers.\n\nDavid Rehr, a former lobbyist who is now an adjunct professor at George Washington University\u2019s graduate school of political management, says forming coalitions is \u201can important advocacy tool.\u201d\n\nThe most effective coalitions have a variety of members that attract attention and \u201cbreaks the norm\u201d on Capitol Hill, he said.\n\nOne obvious reason to join a coalition is that there\u2019s \u201cstrength in numbers,\u201d added Emily Holubowich, senior vice president at lobbying firm Cavarocchi Ruscio Dennis Associates.\n\nUniting various groups on a common issue can show \u201cdiversity of support\u201d and facilitate easier \u201caccess to congressional offices,\u201d Holubowich continued.\n\nWith all of its members, the E-Flex coalition can claim to represent dozens of employers and millions of jobs over a wide range of industries.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all that\u2019s at stake when forming a lobbying coalition.\n\n\u201cCoalitions add a great deal of credibility to each of the members, especially in a case like this,\u201d where there\u2019s an \u201cimmediate and singular legislative issue,\u201d Holman said.\n\nHe added that smaller businesses can use coalitions to amplify their lobbying power, and members can pool their funds.\n\nOne active member of E-Flex that attends weekly meetings is the American Staffing Association, a group that calls itself \u201cthe poster child for that sort of intermittent, short-term work\u201d represented in the coalition, according to Lenz, the association\u2019s legal counsel.\n\nForming a coalition makes sense \u201cif the interests are sufficiently similar,\u201d Lenz said, adding that the association was \u201cunquestionably\u201d more successful lobbying through the coalition than if they\u2019d gone it alone.\n\nMoreover, with the midterm election season approaching, members might look to the deep-pocketed businesses and trade associations among them who can \u201cspend very heavily in the next election,\u201d Holman said, meaning congressional support or opposition to E-Flex could have potential campaign ramifications.\n\nSome ad hoc groups are entirely run out of lobby shops.\n\nThe Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform and the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service both list lobbyists on the \u201cContact Us\u201d pages of their websites.\n\nA steering committee of major corporations including 3M, Caterpillar, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Proctor & Gamble leads the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, a group formed in 2005 with nearly 50 current members.\n\nSince 2007, the coalition has spent just shy of $8 million on lobbying, with a top priority being the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which went into effect last year. 3M voluntarily disclosed a $70,000 contribution to the coalition in 2012, which was used for lobbying.\n\nThe Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, which calls itself the \u201ccollective voice of the mailing community,\u201d has spent $655,000 in its five years of lobbying.\n\nIts more than three dozen members include businesses and associations who rely on, represent or supply the mailing industry, such as American Express, Bank of America, Conde Nast, the Envelope Manufacturers Association, FedEx, the National Retail Federation, the Newspaper Association of America and Verizon.\n\nThe only coalition member known to self-report financial contributions to the group is eBay, which voluntarily revealed a $5,000 payment for membership dues in 2012.\n\nLast year, the coalition, which says it represents a $1.3 trillion industry with 7.8 million private-sector workers, lobbied Congress and the U.S. Postal Service. It has endorsed the Postal Reform Act of 2013, which would address financial constraints for the postal service and modify mail delivery schedules and rates.\n\nAnother informal lobbying group is the Coalition for a Domestic Insurance Industry, a business set up in Wilmington, Del., in 2007. It represents 13 U.S.-based insurance firms, half of which are Fortune 500 companies. They include American Financial Group, Berkshire Hathaway, Chubb, Hartford Financial Services Group, Liberty Mutual Group, W. R. Berkley and the Travelers Companies.\n\nThe coalition primarily lobbies for corporate members before Congress on tax issues regarding a \u201cloophole\u201d that exists for foreign-based insurers, and it spent $2.5 million during the past seven years doing so.\n\nIn 2012, when the coalition spent a total of $190,000 on lobbying efforts, Chubb disclosed a contribution of $140,000, all of which was used for lobbying.\n\nA phone call from the Center for Public Integrity to the point of contact on the coalition\u2019s website was immediately referred to the group\u2019s lobbyist at Capitol Tax Partners, who only spoke with the Center off-the-record.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies, trade groups band together to lobby on issues of common interest.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Retailers band together to fight health reform law", "og": {"site_name": "Center for Public Integrity", "description": "Companies, trade groups band together to lobby on issues of common interest.", "title": "Retailers band together to fight health reform law", "url": "https://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/02/19/14265/retailers-band-together-fight-health-reform-law", "image": "https://static-00-www.publicintegrity.org/files/styles/12col/public/img/eflex2.png?itok=pV1O8bga", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://static-00-www.publicintegrity.org/files/styles/1x1-3col/public/img/eflex2.png?itok=Lf-iWp7A", "site": "@Publici", "card": "summary", "creator": "@erin_rq"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-19T16:41:58+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 59300693, "app_id": 208489549167264}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/publici", "published_time": "2014-02-19T11:41:58-0500", "author": "https://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/erin-quinn", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2014-05-13T15:18:10-0400", "tag": "American Medical Association"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c6a\"", "article_summary": "They include American Financial Group, Berkshire Hathaway, Chubb, Hartford Financial Services Group, Liberty Mutual Group, W.
