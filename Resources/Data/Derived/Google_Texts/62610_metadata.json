At the Atlantic, James Fallows captures the mood by declaring that Iraq War boosters \u201cmight have the decency to shut the hell up on this particular topic for a while.\u201d\n\nCertainly commentators have every right to point out that Dick Cheney \u2013 whose Wall Street Journal op-ed with Liz Cheney on Iraq states \u201cRarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many\u201d as Barack Obama \u2014 was wrong about the military engagement and the rebuilding but also about the idea of democratic contagion in the Middle East. But, then again, it\u2019s also perfectly legitimate for neocons to point out that the Obama administration may have wasted the gains made by the previous administration. No president gets to start from scratch, after all. And Obama was bragging about the \u201cextraordinary achievement, nearly nine years in the making\u201d not so long ago, as he took credit for finishing the neocon project and facilitating its turnaround.\n\nNow, I find neoconservatives arguments mostly unconvincing, but taking a reductionist view of a complex historical event and then pompously instructing everyone \u2013 and by everyone, we\u2019re talking about the majority of Americans \u2013 to shut up, seems to be a bad habit on the left.\n\nThe president has constantly claimed that conservatives \u201cdrove us into a ditch,\u201d via the imaginary free-market policies of George Bush, so they really had no standing to participate in the debate or offer an opinion about how we deal with recession. We hear this often. It\u2019s a silly demand. And whatever the case, if the new bar for engaging in debate is being right on the big questions, it might be worth remembering a few other things. Namely, that in Washington everyone is wrong.\n\nAs Jonathan Chait points out:\n\nMost Democrats in Congress opposed the Gulf War, warning of Saddam Hussein\u2019s fearsome, World War I\u2013style fortifications and citing 45,000 body bags as an indication of the likely U.S. death toll \u2014 predictions that turned out to be wildly incorrect. Why shouldn\u2019t anti-Gulf war Democrats \u2014 that is, the vast majority of Democrats \u2014 have been excluded from subsequent foreign policy debates?\n\nNow, I imagine people may argue that the consequences of losing war are far higher than being judicious about war. This might well be true, but just because one contingent on the left oppose any intervention anywhere and at any time, makes them more lucky than smart. But even if they were especially prescient a decade ago, attempting to shame dissent off the playing field, as David Frum did during the lead up to war, is as bad an idea now as it was in the lead-up to Iraq.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that while many Republicans were wrong, there were others who were also wrong, others with access to intelligence and the ability to ask critical questions from people in power. They also voted on the matter. Shouldn\u2019t they be held to the same level accountability as whipping boy Bill Kristol? One of these individuals is the shameless Harry Reid, who, when he isn\u2019t wasting our time blathering about the Redskins and Koch Brothers, had the temerity to offer this statement: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing this country does not need, is that we should be taking advice from Dick Cheney on wars. Being on the wrong side of Dick Cheney is being on the right side of history.\u201d\n\nIf only things were that easy. Reid wasn\u2019t simply a supporter of war, he argued for it. In an interview in 2002 with Judy Woodruff, as well as in other appearances, he reiterated that Saddam Hussein had \u201cthumbed his nose at the world community\u201d (the same formulation Bush used many times) and was in possession if WMDs and was confident there would be a good debate. The opposition party has a duty to challenge those in power. Did Reid do a good enough job? It was only later that Reid would call the Iraq war a \u201cfailure,\u201d and when things seemed to have turned a corner post-surge he taking credit for pressuring Bush into deploy more troops \u2014 which hardly sounds like a person who\u2019s sorry about his vote.\n\nThe same can be said for Joe Biden and John Kerry. Shouldn\u2019t they all shut up, too? Another person who voted for the war will be running for president soon, Hillary Clinton. The most consequential vote she\u2019s ever had, perhaps the only consequential vote she ever had \u2026 and now we hear that she \u201cgot it wrong. Plain and simple.\u201d And that\u2019s great. But is that all it takes to rejoin the discussion? Flowing with the current of public opinion means you can now participate in the conversation; failing to do so means you should zip it.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 19 Jun 2014 13:09:25 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Those who opposed the Iraq war should understand that telling people to shut up isn\u2019t exactly conducive to a healthy debate.", "title": "STFU, They Said", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/neoconservatives.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-20T19:48:52+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/06/19/stfu-they-said/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Those who opposed the Iraq war should understand that telling people to shut up isn\u2019t exactly conducive to a healthy debate.", "title": "STFU, They Said", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/neoconservatives.jpg"}, "creator": "@davidharsanyi", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Barack Obama,Bill Kristol,Dick Cheney,James Fallows,Jonathan Chait,Saddam Hussein,Wall Street Journal", "published_time": "2014-06-19T13:09:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-20T19:48:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Those who opposed the Iraq war should understand that telling people to shut up isn\u2019t exactly conducive to a healthy debate."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7e9\"", "article_summary": "Why shouldn\u2019t anti-Gulf war Democrats \u2014 that is, the vast majority of Democrats \u2014 have been excluded from subsequent foreign policy debates?\nBeing on the wrong side of Dick Cheney is being on the right side of history.\u201dIf only things were that easy.\nNow, I imagine people may argue that the consequences of losing war are far higher than being judicious about war.\nThe most consequential vote she\u2019s ever had, perhaps the only consequential vote she ever had \u2026 and now we hear that she \u201cgot it wrong.\nAnother person who voted for the war will be running for president soon, Hillary Clinton."}
