For today, Chris Hayes has some harsh words for the Obama administration:\n\nThis is seriously some shameful sh*t: http://t.co/08vHa1vHwT \u2014 Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) February 7, 2014\n\nFrom Talking Points Memo:\n\nA bundler for President Barack Obama who is nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Argentina said Thursday that he\u2019s never actually been to that country.\n\nDuring a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing for political consultant Noah Mamet, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) asked \u201cMr. Mamet, have you been to Argentina?\u201d \u201cSenator, I haven\u2019t had the opportunity yet to be there,\u201d Mamet replied. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled pretty extensively around the world, but I haven\u2019t yet had a chance.\u201d\n\nSounds like Mamet, echoing Max Baucus, might be \u201cno real expert\u201d on Argentina. Yeah, he\u2019s totally qualified for the job.\n\nAmbassadorships are jokes @stacyherbert RT @chrislhayes: This is seriously some shameful sh*t: http://t.co/T22vh213uv \u2014 Sean Caulfield (@Seanismoney) February 7, 2014\n\n@chrislhayes I mean, he couldn't have gone there the weekend after he was nominated? \u2014 John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) February 7, 2014\n\nIn all fairness, Obama couldn't find Argentina on a map, so\u2026 @RBPundit @chrislhayes \u2014 Jim Branch (@jamesbranch3) February 7, 2014\n\nHeh.\n\nThank you for pointing this out.

Obama has a knack for wanting to reward his bundlers with plum positions, regardless of their qualifications.\n\n.@RBPundit Just be thankful he is actually saying something about it. Credit where credit due @chrislhayes \u2014 John (@johninUT) February 7, 2014\n\nThat\u2019s fair, but how about some perspective?\n\nMore shameful: You still defending this President.
