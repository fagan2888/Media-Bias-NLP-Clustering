They turned to MDLive, a Florida-based online care provider.\n\nA little more than a year later, they\u2019re going it alone.\n\nLast month the 12-hospital, 184-site network based in western Michigan launched its own MedNow platform, bringing a three-pronged virtual care program under its own virtual roof. The service, run through the health system\u2019s affiliated health plan, Priority Health, offers on-demand and specialty care, as well as home monitoring tools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leveraging our own providers, who know their patients and want to take responsibility for their care,\u201d says Tracey Burke, MedNow\u2019s director.\n\nBurke and Joseph Brennen, MedNow\u2019s director of operations, are quick to point out they weren\u2019t displeased with MDLive \u2013 the company still manages Spectrum Health\u2019s pediatric care services and any telehealth services that cross state lines. But the health system wanted to integrate its care offerings, linking this new platform that extends beyond the physical walls of the hospital and clinic with its evolving patient-centered medical home program and its Epic EMR platform, as well as the health system\u2019s own text messaging program and online patient portal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re caring for their total life, not just that one encounter,\u201d says Burke. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting the needs of our patients all the time. It\u2019s comprehensive care.\u201d\n\nAs virtual care platforms take a hold in health systems throughout the country, it\u2019s interesting to see how they evolve. Some health systems are contracting out the whole platform to a third party, content to have someone else manage the particulars. Others are going for a hybrid approach that parcels out certain services \u2013 like emergency care \u2013 while keeping others in-house, or offering a branded platform that\u2019s run by a telehealth provider but managed by the health system. Others are developing their own platform.\n\nSpectrum Health is part of a large \u2013 and growing \u2013 percentage of providers who are moving into telehealth gradually, working first with a vendor to establish the platform, then gradually moving to their own system. Experts estimate as many as 40 percent of health providers who have virtual care networks have followed this route, and they expect that number to grow as the technology becomes more ubiquitous and the Affordable Care Act mandates a more comprehensive approach to care management.\n\nBrennen and Burke say telehealth technology has improved to the point that health systems can take it on themselves now, rather than contract out. \u201cIt\u2019s become seamless, efficient and low-cost,\u201d says Burke. \u201cOur doctors are amazed at what they can do themselves with video.\u201d\n\nBrennen says it took the better part of a year to prepare the health system \u2013 from the providers to the patients \u2013 for this shift. The doctors and nurses were skeptical at first, until they got used to the technology through repeated dry runs. Focus groups, surveys and questionnaires helped patients find their own comfort level.\n\n\u201cYou do it in stages,\u201d says Burke, who expects Spectrum Health to assume control of pediatric telehealth services early next year and eventually take over care of patients across state lines, as soon as they can get the licensure issues worked out.\n\nShe and Brennen also see the health system using wearables and other patient-facing health and wellness monitors to connect those patients with care providers when and where they want and need to be connected. And she expects the virtual care platform to expand, offering behavioral health and specialty follow-up services to patients in their own homes.\n\nAnd, she says, targeting a growing demographic of older patients who want to stay at home.\n\nBrennen says when Spectrum Health officials first envisioned the platform, they expected that it would be used primarily by young, tech-savvy consumers who are too busy to visit the doctor or hospital and just want to connect via their laptop or tablet. But the average user is a 54-year-old female, he says, and 93 percent of the patients are connecting via their smartphone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re meeting the needs of our patients,\u201d says Burke.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health systems are taking control of their telehealth offerings", "author": "mHealthIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/news/spectrum-health-takes-its-telehealth-platform-in-house", "type": "article", "image": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/175129682.jpg", "site_name": "mHealthIntelligence", "title": "Spectrum Health Takes its Telehealth Platform In-House"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health systems are taking control of their telehealth offerings", "title": "Spectrum Health Takes its Telehealth Platform In-House", "image": {"src": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/175129682.jpg"}, "creator": "@mHealthIntel", "site": "@mHealthIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The service, run through the health system\u2019s affiliated health plan, Priority Health, offers on-demand and specialty care, as well as home monitoring tools.\nWhen Spectrum Health jumped into the virtual care arena in 2014, administrators realized they would need help developing the platform.\nSome health systems are contracting out the whole platform to a third party, content to have someone else manage the particulars.\nAnd she expects the virtual care platform to expand, offering behavioral health and specialty follow-up services to patients in their own homes.\nIt\u2019s comprehensive care.\u201dAs virtual care platforms take a hold in health systems throughout the country, it\u2019s interesting to see how they evolve."}
