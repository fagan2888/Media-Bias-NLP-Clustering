She\u2019s an early childhood education major with dreams of opening up a child development center when she graduates.\n\nHer story sounds like so many other college students, but in her family she will not only be the first to graduate from college, but is already the first to graduate from high school.\n\n\u201cWhere we were from, we were from a low income family, so we didn\u2019t really have like a lot of support; and with I Have A Dream Foundation, they just was somebody we could look toward if we had problems \u2013 like financially or anything,\u201d Smith said in an interview with Atlanta Progressive News.\n\nThe \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Foundation (IHAD) adopted 54 second graders from the now demolished Bowen Homes public housing project.\n\nMore than two-thirds have completed high school, and half have gone on to college.\n\nAccording to IHAD, their students are twice as likely to earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree as their low-income peers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without them,\u201d Smith said.\n\nBobby Daniels is a senior at Tuskegee University majoring in political science, with eyes on pursuing a law degree after.\n\n\u201c[College has] been a growing experience\u2026 It teaches you a lot, it\u2019s been the best thing I could\u2019ve done,\u201d Daniels said.\n\n\u201cWhere we grew up, of course it was a tough place, but I Have A Dream really gave you stuff that the other students didn\u2019t have a chance to get,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nLike Smith, Daniels is also the first person in his family to graduate from high school.\n\nBoth Daniels and Smith spoke positively about the array of opportunities they\u2019ve had from the \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Foundation program \u2013 including annual summer camp experiences that took them all across the country, mentorship programs,, and the Annual Dreamer Conference to help them connect with the over 17,000 alumni of the program across the nation.\n\nAdditionally, IHAD provides support for the \u201cDreamers,\u201d as their students are called, to apply for colleges, attend campus tours, and receive financial aid. They also help students make up the \u201clast dollar,\u201d covering books, supplies, and other necessities of supporting themselves in college beyond just tuition.\n\nVicky Jackson, the Program Director of the Atlanta IHAD Chapter, has been working with the program since 2010.\n\n\u201cI honestly have to say it\u2019s been a very rewarding experience, I\u2019ve grown, they\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve grown together. It\u2019s almost like raising fifty or so foster children,\u201d Jackson said in an interview.\n\nJackson visits her Dreamers each semester to check in on their progress and help them navigate the new and challenging environment college provides.\n\nIHAD also works with students who want to pursue technical degrees or gain certification in other areas, with a focus on all students having the ability to truly capitalize on their talents and fulfill their dreams.\n\n\u201cWe know with the program that we set a base for them, set a foundation for them go forward. What I try to teach them is that you give back, so some of the kids mentee other kids, and then they have younger brothers and sisters, and now they are teaching them about college,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cI have friends who I went to school with who wasn\u2019t chosen to be adopted and their outcome was way different from mine. I just think it\u2019s a blessing to be in this program,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cThis process has been a life changing experience, it\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Smith said.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8"}, "article_summary": "The \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Foundation (IHAD) adopted 54 second graders from the now demolished Bowen Homes public housing project.\nHer story sounds like so many other college students, but in her family she will not only be the first to graduate from college, but is already the first to graduate from high school.\nI just think it\u2019s a blessing to be in this program,\u201d Smith said.\nAccording to IHAD, their students are twice as likely to earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree as their low-income peers.\nLike Smith, Daniels is also the first person in his family to graduate from high school."}
