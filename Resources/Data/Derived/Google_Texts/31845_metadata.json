And while coronary mortality rates have declined overall, there are signs that the disease, its precursors and its potentially fatal consequences are increasing among young women.\n\nA 2007 study referred to the rise in cardiovascular risk factors among young women as \u201cthe leading edge of a brewing storm.\u201d\n\nWhile so many women worry about cancer, only slightly more than half realize that heart disease is their No. 1 killer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More women in the United States die from cardiovascular causes \u2014 heart disease and stroke \u2014 than from all forms of cancer combined.\n\nNumerous campaigns by the American Heart Association and other organizations have raised awareness among women of their mostly self-inflicted risks and of symptoms that are typically far more subtle in women than in men. \u201cEven if they believe they\u2019re having a heart attack, 36 percent don\u2019t call 911,\u201d said Dr. Holly S. Andersen, director of education and outreach at the Perelman Heart Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College, citing the latest heart association national survey.\n\nRather than crushing chest pain, women in the throes of a heart attack more often experience discomfort in the neck, jaw, shoulder, upper back or abdomen, dizziness, nausea, right arm pain, shortness of breath, and sweating or unusual fatigue. Almost two-thirds of women who die suddenly of a heart attack had no prior symptoms.\n\nDoctors too often fail to take a woman\u2019s risk seriously and treat it aggressively, or to provide adequate recommendations for prevention, Andersen and other experts say.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true for young women,\u201d she said. Yet, she added, \u201camong women between the ages of 29 and 45, it looks like the incidence of heart disease is rising.\u201d\n\nThere are ample reasons. Stress, for example, is a known, though not often cited, risk factor, \u201cand the youngest women in this country are more stressed than ever,\u201d she said: \u201cThey\u2019re always \u2018on\u2019 and self-comparing.\u201d\n\nSmoking \u2014 marijuana as well as cigarettes \u2014 is a coronary risk. And while smoking has declined among older women, \u201cyoung women are the ones still smoking,\u201d Andersen said. Women on birth control pills who smoke are especially at risk.\n\nTwo other major risk factors, obesity and diabetes, are more rampant than ever, especially among Hispanic women born in the United States, half of whom develop diabetes by age 70.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good at treating heart disease, but we\u2019re failing at prevention,\u201d Andersen said.\n\nAs Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, a professor emeritus at the Emory University School of Medicine, noted in 2010, the steady annual decline in heart disease deaths among women since 2000 resulted more from better care than from prevention.\n\n\u201cA particular unmet need is prevention at younger age, the subset of women less likely to undertake preventive behaviors,\u201d she wrote. Yet decades ago, heart disease was found to originate in the teenage years or early 20s and gradually worsen unless preventive measures were undertaken.\n\nWhen women with high levels of artery-damaging LDL cholesterol are prescribed statins, the treatment often provides \u201cfalse reassurance\u201d that the drugs \u201ccan compensate for poor dietary choices and a sedentary life,\u201d Dr. Rita F. Redberg, a cardiologist and the editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, wrote last year.\n\nIn one study she cited, \u201cstatin users significantly increased their fat intake and calorie consumption, along with their BMI (body mass index), in the last decade. Focusing on cholesterol levels can be distracting from the more beneficial focus on healthy lifestyle to reduce heart disease risk.\u201d\n\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which contain natural antioxidants that statins don\u2019t provide, is more important, Andersen said. \u201cSo is getting regular aerobic exercise, spending time with friends and getting a good night\u2019s sleep \u2014 six to eight hours,\u201d she said. \u201cChronic lack of sleep doubles the risk of heart disease.\u201d\n\nCoronary risk is also greater among women who carry extra weight around the abdomen \u2014 the so-called apple shape. Abdominal fat is metabolically active and can result in high blood pressure and diabetes, even if a woman is otherwise slender.\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s waistline is more important than BMI,\u201d Andersen said.\n\nDepression and lack of social support, more common among older women, are also often underappreciated risk factors.\n\n\u201cSocial isolation is detrimental,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen who regularly spend time with close friends live longer and have less heart disease.\u201d\n\nA positive outlook on life \u2014 laughing a lot, having a sense of humor, being optimistic and seeing the glass as half full \u2014 is also protective, Andersen said.\n\nAlthough \u201cmarital stress increases a woman\u2019s risk of coronary heart disease,\u201d having a compatible partner or a pet is beneficial, she said.\n\nSeveral factors that women may experience early in life, especially two pregnancy- related conditions \u2014 pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes \u2014 have been linked to a greater coronary risk years later.\n\nTwo other conditions more prevalent among women cause symptoms that are often overlooked by them and their doctors as likely due to heart attack.\n\nWomen are more prone to develop blockages in the small vessels that feed the heart, which can cause pressure or tightness in the chest rather than crushing pain, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nThey are also far more susceptible to \u201cbroken heart syndrome\u201d brought on by events like the sudden loss of a loved one, divorce, a bad accident, a natural disaster, or even a surprise party.\n\nThe resulting intense stress reaction of chest pain and shortness of breath, although usually temporary, can mimic a heart attack, though it rarely causes one.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/DOCTOR.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda38b\"", "article_summary": "Although long thought of as a man\u2019s disease, heart disease afflicts as many women, though women tend to develop and die from it about 10 years later.\nAttention, U.S. women, especially young women: Have you got the heart to save yours?\nAnd while smoking has declined among older women, \u201cyoung women are the ones still smoking,\u201d Andersen said.\nMore women in the United States die from cardiovascular causes \u2014 heart disease and stroke \u2014 than from all forms of cancer combined.\nYet decades ago, heart disease was found to originate in the teenage years or early 20s and gradually worsen unless preventive measures were undertaken."}
