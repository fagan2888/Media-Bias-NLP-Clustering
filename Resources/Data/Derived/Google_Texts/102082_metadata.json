The corporation\u2019s size can, among other things, allow hospitals to take advantage of centralized human resources and information technology systems to cut costs, he said.\n\n\u201cWe will bring capital access and sustainability for these organizations, without negating who or what they\u2019ve represented to those (local) communities over history,\u201d Pilgrim said.\n\nUnion officials who represent hospital workers aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cThere are serious questions about how this takeover would impact quality of care,\u201d said Suzanne Haviland, field representative for AFSCME International, the union representing nurses and technical employees at Waterbury Hospital, which Tenet is in the process of acquiring.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there needs to be significant protections in place\u201d before the purchase is approved, she said.\n\nEmployees worry about Tenet\u2019s reputation, she said. The company has paid Medicare-related fines of more than $1 billion over the past 12 years and has been sued for allegedly receiving Medicaid kickbacks, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of issues.\u201d\n\nShe also said the company is anti-pension and employees worry about potential changes to future contracts.\n\nHaviland also worries about Tenet\u2019s \u201cpotential dominance\u201d of Connecticut\u2019s healthcare landscape. In addition to vying to buy hospitals in Waterbury, Manchester, Vernon and Bristol, Tenet has partnered with Yale New Haven Health System \u2013 though it has not bought Yale-New Haven Hospital \u2013 so if the pending deals go through, Tenet will have some sort of connection with about one-third of Connecticut hospitals, she said.\n\nIf Tenet keeps expanding and begins buying physicians\u2019 practices in the state that could result in higher costs for patients, she warned. The same procedures administered by the same doctors can be billed at a more expensive rate if that doctor technically is an employee of a hospital, she said.\n\nPilgrim spoke earlier and had to leave the roundtable discussion early, to catch a flight, before the union officials spoke so he was unable to respond to their claims.\n\nThe privatization of hospitals is \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d said Deborah Chernoff, public policy director of the New England Health Care Employees Union District 1199, SEIU. The union represents 400 workers at Waterbury Hospital who work in nursing support roles and maintenance jobs.\n\n\u201cNo one can serve two masters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be very careful every step of the way\u2026lest we discover our hospitals have been converted from centers of care to cash cows for investors.\u201d\n\nHospital employees worry that privatization will lead to layoffs and reduced work hours, she said.\n\nMelodie Peters, president of the American Federation of Teachers Connecticut union that represents 700 workers in the Eastern Connecticut Health Network (ECHN), also spoke. Tenet is in the process of buying two ECHN hospitals, Rockville General Hospital in Vernon and Manchester Memorial Hospital.\n\n\u201cWe do have some fears,\u201d she said, though employees are hopeful that a private hospital can thrive with proper checks and balances and still retain its ties to the local community.\n\nIn his earlier comments, before the union officials spoke, Pilgrim said Tenet\u2019s previous privatizations of hospitals have gone smoothly.\n\n\u201cMy experience is those hospitals thrive after conversion,\u201d he said.\n\nState Rep. Whit Betts, R-Bristol, asked Pilgrim how privatization typically impacts employee turnover.\n\n\u201cPhysician retention has been very good,\u201d Pilgrim answered, citing turnover declines in Tenet-acquired hospitals in San Antonio, Detroit and Chicago.\n\nBristol Mayor Ken Cockayne and Manchester Mayor Jay Moran addressed the roundtable, both saying they support any measure that will keep their municipalities\u2019 hospitals in town.\n\n\u201cThe hospital is one of our biggest employers,\u201d Cockayne said. \u201cIf this (privatization) is going to keep the hospital strong, then I fully support it.\u201d\n\nMoran agreed, saying his priority is to keep Manchester Memorial Hospital as his town\u2019s largest employer.\n\n\u201cECHN is not in a financial position to compete without new capital,\u201d he said, adding that if privatization is the best solution \u201cthen we\u2019re willing to accept the change.\u201d\n\nTenet\u2019s acquisition of the now tax-exempt Bristol General Hospital will add $1.5 million to $2 million to that city\u2019s tax roll, Cockayne said. Manchester doesn\u2019t yet know the tax impact a Tenet deal would have, Moran said.\n\nThe bipartisan Roundtable on Hospitals and Health Care was formed by the legislature earlier this year. The group is tasked with reaching out to policy makers, hospitals, physicians, health insurers, patient advocates and other stakeholders.\n\nThe group\u2019s goal is to monitor the implementation of recent legislation, discuss the changing health care market and develop policy recommendations to ensure continued access to affordable quality care in the state.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/unions_continue_to_express_concerns_over_hospital_conversions/", "type": "article", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "description": "A senior official at the Dallas-based corporation trying to buy community hospitals in Bristol, Vernon, Manchester and Waterbury says privatizing them is the best way to keep them viable, but employee representatives have major concerns about the potential buyouts.", "title": "Unions Continue To Express Concerns Over Hospital Conversions | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe041d\"", "article_summary": "Tenet is in the process of buying two ECHN hospitals, Rockville General Hospital in Vernon and Manchester Memorial Hospital.\nThe bipartisan Roundtable on Hospitals and Health Care was formed by the legislature earlier this year.\nThe group\u2019s goal is to monitor the implementation of recent legislation, discuss the changing health care market and develop policy recommendations to ensure continued access to affordable quality care in the state.\nThe group is tasked with reaching out to policy makers, hospitals, physicians, health insurers, patient advocates and other stakeholders.\nThe privatization of hospitals is \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d said Deborah Chernoff, public policy director of the New England Health Care Employees Union District 1199, SEIU."}
