Community members gathered in downtown Greenville to voice their opposition to ISIS on Sunday.

Dozens came together at 2 p.m. at One City Plaza on North Main Street to demonstrate they are united in opposition to terrorism and violence.

Many held signs with messages like, "Not in my name," and "Muslims condemn ISIS."

The Islamic Society of Greenville organized the event in the wake of a recent series of terror attacks in Paris, hoping to show the Upstate community that their beliefs are not the same as those who commit terrorist attacks in the name of Islam.

"There's a lot of misunderstanding and stereotyping and prejudice against Muslims in general," said Akif Aydin, an attendee of the protest. "Whoever does the attacks in Paris and other parts of the world, they do it in the name of Islam which is hijacking our identity as Muslims."
