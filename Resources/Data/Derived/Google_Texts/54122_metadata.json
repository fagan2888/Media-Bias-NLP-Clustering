So it wasn\u2019t really a surprise when he had some fun at his recent photoshoot and interview with Buzzfeed. But the fallout has been swift.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s great that the President\u2014and a person of his stature\u2014knows how to have some fun once in a while. Like the proper way to take selfies:\n\nAnd who\u2019s to blame when things inevitably go wrong:\n\nBut there are two reasons why his viral interview has come under fire.\n\nFirst, it was all a part of his push to promote the much-maligned Affordable Care Act to a younger, hipper demographic. He did something similar last year to reach the same crowd.\n\nSecond, this was so poorly timed. While it wasn\u2019t necessarily the White House\u2019s decision to post the video on the day of Kayla Mueller\u2019s death at the hands of ISIS mercenaries, the fact that the video was released on the same day has become a public relations problem.\n\nTwitter has responded in full force:\n\nSame day WH found out about Kayla Mueller RT @sqwerin: I actually feel ill\u2026Obama's last words in that Buzzfeed video, \"Can I live?\" \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 13, 2015\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Obama takes his power lightly, his on-camera decisions make you wonder a bit about whether this demeans the office he holds. And when George Will joined the Fox News Live desk, he made some great points about it.\n\nGeorge Will on Obama's BuzzFeed Video: \"Some People Think This Diminishes The Presidency, I Certainly Hope So\" \u2014 Carla Chamorro (@CarlaChamorros) February 13, 2015\n\nAccording to RealClearPolitics, Will explained how he felt about the grandstanding:\n\nSome people think this diminishes the presidency, I certainly hope so because I think the presidency, not this president but the office itself, is too much with us and far too grand and encrusted in royal trappings. But beyond that, what makes this interesting, he is trying to get people to sign up and in 37 states\u2026 the Supreme Court\u2019s going to be heard from on this and 37 states, they\u2019re signing up to get subsidies through federal exchanges which, by the end of June, may be defunct. So this is a small episode, leading up to the biggest Supreme Court decision of the year.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Obama is making videos about YOLO. It\u2019s that he\u2019s making these videos while ISIS is committing atrocities overseas. He might not need to have an opinion about everything they do, but people are starting to take notice when he takes selfies instead.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People are starting to take notice when he takes selfies instead.", "published_at": "2015-02-14T10:14:11+00:00", "tags": "World", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "People are starting to take notice when he takes selfies instead.", "title": "George Will Has A Something to Say About Obama's Buzzfeed Video & What That Means for the Presidency", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 820, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obama-selfie.png", "height": 457}, "updated_time": "2015-02-14T11:32:47-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/02/251061-george-will-just-saw-obamas-yolo-buzzfeed-video-thinks-says-volumes-presidency/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "People are starting to take notice when he takes selfies instead.", "creator": "@charlesSAMUEL_", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obama-selfie.png", "title": "George Will Has A Something to Say About Obama's Buzzfeed Video & What That Means for the Presidency", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Charles Samuel", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-14T10:14:11-04:00", "wp-categories": "687 14086 482 1471 2679", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/02/251061-george-will-just-saw-obamas-yolo-buzzfeed-video-thinks-says-volumes-presidency/", "wp-category-slugs": "culture, headlines, nation, politics, world", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-02-14T10:14:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-14T11:32:47-04:00", "author": "charlessamueldotcom"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obama-selfie.png", "post_id": 251061, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb8e\"", "article_summary": "Twitter has responded in full force:Same day WH found out about Kayla Mueller RT @sqwerin: I actually feel ill\u2026Obama's last words in that Buzzfeed video, \"Can I live?\"\nSo it wasn\u2019t really a surprise when he had some fun at his recent photoshoot and interview with Buzzfeed.\n\u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 13, 2015While this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Obama takes his power lightly, his on-camera decisions make you wonder a bit about whether this demeans the office he holds.\nAnd when George Will joined the Fox News Live desk, he made some great points about it.\nFor starters, it\u2019s great that the President\u2014and a person of his stature\u2014knows how to have some fun once in a while."}
