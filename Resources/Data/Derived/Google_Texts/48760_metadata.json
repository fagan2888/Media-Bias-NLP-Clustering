Trent Franks (R-AZ) and comprised of 12 other male lawmakers, is deciding whether to advance sweeping restrictions on abortion coverage that would make the procedure less affordable for women across the country.\n\nAbortion opponents are relentless in their efforts to ensure that taxpayer dollars don\u2019t end up financing abortion services. But HR 7 is actually deceptively titled. Under the guise of preventing federal money from covering abortion, it would actually have dramatic consequences for the insurance industry and the tax code as a whole, potentially creating a society in which private insurance no longer includes abortion care.\n\n\u201cThis bill is a sweeping piece of legislation that would affect nearly all women in this country and would do significant harm to many, especially those women and families who are struggling to make ends meet,\u201d Susan Woods, an associate professor of health policy at George Washington University, explained in her testimony against HR 7 on Thursday.\n\nIn addition to banning insurance coverage for abortion in all of Obamacare\u2019s new state-level insurance marketplaces, HR 7 would also reach into Americans\u2019 private insurance plans. It would force small businesses to pay additional taxes on their health benefits if they offer their employees a plan that covers abortion. It would also eliminate medical-expense deductions for abortion care, except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment \u2014 an update to the tax code that the IRS would be forced to figure out how to implement. NARAL Pro-Choice America points out that the IRS would be empowered to make the final decision about what \u201ccounts\u201d as rape or incest, essentially conducting an audit of victims to ensure they\u2019re not committing fraud.\n\nIn an interview with ThinkProgress, Wood explained that these regulatory changes could end up dramatically reshaping the entire private insurance market. \u201cThe status quo is that abortion has been regularly covered \u2014 not called out, not controversial \u2014 as part of general medical coverage in private health insurance,\u201d she noted. \u201cHR 7 could really change the nature of the insurance market such that ultimately it becomes the norm not to cover abortion.\u201d\n\nWithout insurance coverage for the procedure, an abortion can cost anywhere between $300 and $10,000 out of pocket. Particularly because abortions are increasingly concentrated among low-income Americans, economic barriers to the procedure are a serious threat to access. The situation is especially dire now that a mounting pile of state-level restrictions have driven up the cost of getting an abortion even further.\n\nAnd ultimately, Wood told ThinkProgress, there\u2019s simply no reason to segregate abortion from the rest of medical care that\u2019s covered by insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not an a la carte system,\u201d she noted, pointing out that insurance coverage is supposed to be available for a range of unanticipated needs \u2014 including unintended pregnancies.\n\nMany of the lawmakers who serve on the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice aren\u2019t strangers to efforts to broadly restrict reproductive rights. Committee leader Franks co-sponsored the 20-week abortion ban that passed the House last fall, and has made it his personal mission to prevent the low-income women who live in the District of Columbia from being able to access abortion. Arguing in favor of Franks\u2019 abortion ban, another subcommittee member, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), once suggested that women should simply be forced to give birth to fetuses with no brain function if they discover this type of serious fetal abnormality after the 20-week deadline.\n\nNonetheless, not every lawmaker on the subcommittee expressed support for HR 7 during Thursday\u2019s hearing. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) delivered a passionate speech against his colleagues\u2019 repeated efforts to attack reproductive freedom, noting that the proposed bill represents \u201cthe massive power of the federal government\u201d to \u201cshut down a constitutionally protected right.\u201d Deutch argued that bodily autonomy is part of a larger set of policies \u2014 like pay fairness, affordable child care, and paid sick leave \u2014 that are necessary for women to achieve equality.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The \"No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act\" would prevent women across the country from using their insurance coverage for their own reproductive needs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The \"No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act\" would prevent women across the country from using their insurance coverage for their own reproductive needs.", "title": "All-Male Congressional Committee Considers Imposing Far-Reaching Abortion Restrictions", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/09/3140711/taxpayer-funding-abortion-hearing/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act\" would prevent women across the country from using their insurance coverage for their own reproductive needs.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1-321x214.jpg", "title": "All-Male Congressional Committee Considers Imposing Far-Reaching Abortion Restrictions", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/abortion1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-09T12:06:12+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "In an interview with ThinkProgress, Wood explained that these regulatory changes could end up dramatically reshaping the entire private insurance market.\nIn addition to banning insurance coverage for abortion in all of Obamacare\u2019s new state-level insurance marketplaces, HR 7 would also reach into Americans\u2019 private insurance plans.\n\u201cThe status quo is that abortion has been regularly covered \u2014 not called out, not controversial \u2014 as part of general medical coverage in private health insurance,\u201d she noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an a la carte system,\u201d she noted, pointing out that insurance coverage is supposed to be available for a range of unanticipated needs \u2014 including unintended pregnancies.\nAbortion opponents are relentless in their efforts to ensure that taxpayer dollars don\u2019t end up financing abortion services."}
