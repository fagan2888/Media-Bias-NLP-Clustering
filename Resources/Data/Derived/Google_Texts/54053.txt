What supporters say: The Climate Action Plan tax is essential to Boulder continuing to make progress on its greenhouse gas reduction goals. It pays for residential and commercial EnergySmart programs that help residents and business owners identify energy efficiency measures and available private and public rebates, as well as the SmartRegs program that requires landlords to meet energy efficiency standards. The Climate Action Plan tax also has paid for pilot programs that encourage innovation, including the Boulder Energy Challenge and the development of a rooftop solar tool. The program has produced real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

What opponents say: There is no organized opposition to this measure.
