You cannot contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year.\n\nIn addition to an absolute limit, there are income limits to contributing to a Roth IRA. The following table shows how much you can contribute depending on your marital status for tax purposes and your income. If you fall in the \"reduced amount\" category, your contribution amount is phased out linearly. For example, if you are single and earn $119,000, you fall one-third of the way into the phase-out range. (The range is $114,000 to $129,000, a range of $15,000, and you fall $5,000 into the range and $5,000 is one-third of the $15,000 range.) Since you are one-third of the way into the phase-out range, you would lose one-third of your contribution limit. This would leave you with a contribution limit of $3,333 (two-thirds of $5,000 is $3,333). For more details on this calculation, please visit the IRS website.\n\nRoth contribution limits by income and tax filing status\n\nIncome Single or Head of Household Qualified Widow(er) Married (Filing Jointly) Married (Filing Separately)* $0 to $10k Full amount Full amount Full amount Zero $10 to $114k Full mount Full amount Full amount Zero $114k to $129k Reduced amount Full amount Full amount Zero $129k to $181k Zero Full amount Full amount Zero $181k to $191k Zero Reduced amount Reduced amount Zero Above $191k Zero Zero Zero Zero\n\nTraditional IRAs\n\nAnyone can contribute to a Traditional IRA, but to deduct your contributions from your taxable income, you must meet the following income requirements.

This means that anyone, regardless of income, can contribute to a Traditional IRA and immediately convert it to a Roth IRA.
