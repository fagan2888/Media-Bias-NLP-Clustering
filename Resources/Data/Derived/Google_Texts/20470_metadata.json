I don\u2019t need to see that play.\u2019 But, not to name-drop, Mike Nichols read my book, and he said, \u2018You know, a story always seems to be about one thing, but it\u2019s really about something else.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd \u2018The Tricky Part\u2019 and \u2018All The Rage\u2019 are about a guy who was abused in Colorado, but they\u2019re really a meditation on human questions that are much larger. They\u2019re about how any of us are able to go on in life, shift a paradigm, gain authority over the past.\u201d\n\nMoran\u2019s past famously includes (by his own autobiographical disclosures) a period of being abused by a pedophile \u2014 but his work really is about more than that.\n\nIt\u2019s about being a 12-year-old altar boy whose faith in his church, his God and his school, Christ The King, once was unshakable. It\u2019s about the dawning understanding that he is gay. It\u2019s about his anger at Bob Kosanke,his abuser, and Moran\u2019s perplexing jealousy upon discovering that Kosanke had been involved with other boys.\n\n\u201cBoth plays are, at their core, about the mystery of compassion and forgiveness in a world where we live through a lot of violations and trespasses,\u201d Moran said. \u201cIn a sense, \u2018All The Rage\u2019 picks up where \u2018The Tricky Part\u2019 left off. But they\u2019re very different pieces. Each was born out of a need, an imperative to answer a question, and that question led to larger territory, and they\u2019re very different stylistically.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, Moran is a seated storyteller in \u201cThe Tricky Part.\u201d Curious Theatre co-founder Chip Walton compares watching \u201cThe Tricky Part\u201d to listening to someone tell a story at a campfire.\n\nBut in \u201cAll The Rage,\u201d Moran is all over the stage. New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley described his rambles this way: \u201cLoopsand doubles back and slides off the page, as if dictated by a broken compass.\u201d\n\nMoran\u2019s term is \u201crather mad-professor-y.\u201d Perhaps the incessant pacing is because Moran can\u2019t sit still for \u201cAll The Rage\u201d to address the question many audiences had after seeing \u201cThe Tricky Part\u201d: Why wasn\u2019t Moran angry at his abuser?\n\n\u201cThat was the impetus for \u2018All The Rage,\u2019 \u201d Moran said. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I mad? Am I avoiding anger? I thought, I better figure this out, and that process took over until I realized, doggone it, now I have to write about this.\u201d\n\nTo lump both plays together as \u201ccomedies about a pedophile\u201d is as large a disservice as Boulder author Rick Polito\u2018s celebrated summary of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d: \u201cTransported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets, and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Marty does in both plays, in very different ways, is that he takes a personal story and grows it universally so that the people who have never gone through that terrible trespass can find a way to see how that tale of compassion and forgiveness resonates in their own lives,\u201d Walton said.\n\n\u201cI think these plays are, just in and of themselves, wonderful pieces of literature. And then, when Marty brings his own incredibly unique and warm and wholly accessible voice to it, they become something else altogether.\u201d\n\nClaire Martin: 303-954-1477, cmartin@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byclairemartin\n\nALL THE RAGE Written and performed by Martin Moran, directed by Seth Barrish.
