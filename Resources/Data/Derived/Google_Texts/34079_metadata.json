It has been corrected since it first published.\n\nTech consultant/writer and Seattle native Jeff Reifman is having a hard time finding a date in his city. But unlike most men, who might blame their romantic travails on being overweight or living with their parents or women being selfish shallow bitches who just can\u2019t appreciate Nice Guys, Reifman believes his dating woes come from a less expected source: Amazon.com.\n\nIn a blog post titled \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Male: Amazon\u2019s Growth Impacting Seattle\u2019s Dating Scene,\u201d Reifman says that the retail conglomerate\u2019s rapid expansion\u2014Amazon\u2019s Seattle workforce has increased nearly fivefold over the past few years, with its number of Seattle employees up from 5,000 to 25,000 since 2010\u2014has affected his ability to get a date. Approximately 75 percent of Amazon\u2019s workforce is male, and Reifman argues that there simply aren\u2019t enough available single women in the city to go around:\n\nOver the past two years, I\u2019ve personally found dating in Seattle has become increasingly difficult. It\u2019s less common to meet single women in person and online dating is more difficult. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t get dates but it\u2019s harder to find women that are a good match for me. Online, it\u2019s been harder to catch women\u2019s attention, harder to get them to schedule a date and they cancel dates more frequently. When we do meet in person, it\u2019s been harder to capture their interest and nearly impossible to find one interested in a relationship. The women here seem more distracted than ever before and at times, I\u2019ve felt like a number to them.\n\nSo Reifman did what any sexually frustrated single male would do: He crunched the numbers, comparing estimates of Amazon\u2019s expansion to census data in Seattle. What he found was a significant gender imbalance between eligible single men in Seattle and eligible women, weighing heavily in women\u2019s favor: By the end of 2014, he projects, there\u2019ll be 130 single men for every 100 single women, an estimate that\u2019s up from a ratio of 119 single men to 100 single women in April 2010. In short: Amazon has turned Seattle into one big sausage fest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The company's rapid expansion has brought severe gender imbalance to the city -- and things are only getting worse", "title": "Is Amazon ruining dating in Seattle?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The company's rapid expansion has brought severe gender imbalance to the city -- and things are only getting worse", "title": "Is Amazon ruining dating in Seattle?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/18/is_amazon_ruining_dating_in_seattle/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/bad-date.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The company's rapid expansion has brought severe gender imbalance to the city -- and things are only getting worse", "title": "Is Amazon ruining dating in Seattle?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/bad-date.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ej Dickson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, Amazon.com, dating, the daily dot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6c5\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s less common to meet single women in person and online dating is more difficult.\nTopics: amazon, Amazon.com, dating, the daily dot, Social News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily Dot .\nWhat he found was a significant gender imbalance between eligible single men in Seattle and eligible women, weighing heavily in women\u2019s favor: By the end of 2014, he projects, there\u2019ll be 130 single men for every 100 single women, an estimate that\u2019s up from a ratio of 119 single men to 100 single women in April 2010.\nTech consultant/writer and Seattle native Jeff Reifman is having a hard time finding a date in his city.\nSo Reifman did what any sexually frustrated single male would do: He crunched the numbers, comparing estimates of Amazon\u2019s expansion to census data in Seattle."}
