Little do they know ... the worst has yet to come,\u201d one tweet read.\n\nThe group also filmed the trip. That footage will be compiled into a YouTube video later this year, Douglas said.\n\nThe group covered about 35 miles of the 90-mile trail the Donner Party crossed, Douglas said.\n\n\u201cThe entire 90 miles isn\u2019t feasible without putting ourselves in the same peril as others that traversed the area,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group hiked at night sometimes, with daytime temperatures reaching nearly 100 degrees.\n\n\u201cYou could see the heat waves all over the ground, mirages off in the distance,\u201d intern Hannah Cowan told KSL-TV. \u201cThe mountains looked like they were floating.\u201d\n\nMichael Knight, another intern, said the trip was mentally taxing because it was \u201cjust straight, flat and monotonous.\u201d\n\nThe group followed trail markers to stay on the path, and while they took steps to stay safe, Douglas said they tried to keep the trek as authentic as possible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of U.S. Bureau of Land Management interns trekked three days this week across a blistering stretch of Utah desert, re-creating part of the 1846 path of the ill-fated Donner Party.", "parsely-tags": "Nevada and West,News", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/interns-follow-donner-party-path-through-utah", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1896806"}, "author": "The ASSOCIATED PRESS", "parsely-title": "Interns follow Donner Party path through Utah", "twitter": {"description": "A group of U.S. Bureau of Land Management interns trekked three days this week across a blistering stretch of Utah desert, re-creating part of the 1846 path of the ill-fated Donner Party.", "title": "Interns follow Donner Party path through Utah", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/interns-follow-donner-party-path-through-utah", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_1628657-e82fa3b608614953851c4f3c4ca041c9.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1628657", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1628657", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "The ASSOCIATED PRESS", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Nevada and West,News,", "parsely-section": "Nevada and West", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-12T14:32:36-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "A group of U.S. Bureau of Land Management interns trekked three days this week across a blistering stretch of Utah desert, re-creating part of the 1846 path of the ill-fated Donner Party.", "title": "Interns follow Donner Party path through Utah", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/interns-follow-donner-party-path-through-utah", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_1628657-e82fa3b608614953851c4f3c4ca041c9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_1628657-e82fa3b608614953851c4f3c4ca041c9.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-12T21:32:36Z"}, "article_summary": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 A group of U.S. Bureau of Land Management interns trekked three days this week across a blistering stretch of Utah desert, re-creating part of the 1846 path of the ill-fated Donner Party.\nThe group covered about 35 miles of the 90-mile trail the Donner Party crossed, Douglas said.\n\u201cThe idea behind this was to essentially expose a younger generation to national historic trails,\u201d bureau spokesman Chad Douglas said.\nThe path across Utah\u2019s Great Salt Lake Desert en route to California delayed the Donner Party, leading to starvation, deaths and cannibalism when they got to the Sierra Nevada later than expected and became stranded.\n\u201cYou could see the heat waves all over the ground, mirages off in the distance,\u201d intern Hannah Cowan told KSL-TV."}
