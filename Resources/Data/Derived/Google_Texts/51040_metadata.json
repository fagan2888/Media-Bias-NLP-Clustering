The Nov. 4 ballot issue would continue, not raise, a tax that last was approved in 2012 for an additional five years. The current millage expires at the end of 2015.\n\nIt would cost the owner of a home with a $100,000 taxable value $52 annually.\n\nThe renewal request comes despite the health plan carrying a $9.6 million fund balance, which officials say has accrued for at least six years.\n\nProgram advocates say they will have to dip into those reserves once federal funding ends after this year under a provision of the Affordable Care Act that widened coverage for the uninsured \u2014 including many people once covered by the county\u2019s plan.\n\nA final payment of about $800,000 should arrive this month, said Robin Reynolds, Ingham Health Plan\u2019s executive director. That\u2019s down from about $2 million the plan received quarterly, Reynolds said. Starting in 2015, the program will be funded entirely by local millage dollars.\n\nThe millage is expected to generate $3.4 million each year.\n\nYet, the Ingham Health Plan today is serving fewer customers. Enrollment plummeted 93 percent in the past year \u2014 from roughly 11,000 participants in 2013 to 800 \u2014 as most recipients were sent to shop for private insurance policies on a new statewide health exchange or were newly eligible for Medicaid that was a central part of President Obama\u2019s health care reform law.\n\nAbout half of those disenrolled in April have found coverage through either the Affordable Care Act insurance exchange or the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nReynolds, who said 80 percent of the plan\u2019s former customers were eligible for the federal Medicaid program, believes membership will rebound to between 4,000 and 5,000 by the end of 2015. The plan\u2019s current members signed up after June 1, with at least 125 added monthly, she said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to use taxpayer money on someone who was eligible for another program,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe are trying to be good stewards of the (people\u2019s) money.\u201d\n\nThe Ingham Health Plan serves county residents who earn less than $28,000 annually for a single household and less than $55,000 for a family of four and don\u2019t qualify for other types of insurance.\n\nIn 2013, the plan spent about $1.3 million on doctor visits and $659,000 on pharmacy services. The rest went for such services as radiology, lab work and outpatient care.\n\nParticipants in the plan have also benefited from preventive health care. Between October 2012 and June 30, the Ingham Health Plan paid for more than 6,000 such procedures, including mammograms, colonoscopies and blood tests.\n\nThe millage doesn\u2019t have universal support: Don Vickers, a Republican county commissioner who represents parts of southern Ingham County, said he supports the health plan but it was supposed to be a \u201cstopgap\u201d until the federal health care reform law took effect.\n\nVickers said the county could wait to bring the issue before voters for another year. He\u2019s also concerned about how the millage will be allocated.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear is people will come up with ways other than how that money was designed to be spent,\u201d he said.\n\nVickers and at least one other county commissioner \u2014 Todd Tennis, a Democrat who represents southeastern Lansing \u2014 say the millage revenue may not be solely dedicated to the health plan and could be diverted to other programs.\n\nThat may not be true. Jared Cypher, the county\u2019s deputy controller, said the ballot language is too narrow to allow many other uses besides health care for low-income residents.\n\nThe millage renewal has been supported by numerous public officials, as well as Lansing\u2019s Sparrow Health System and McLaren-Greater Lansing hospital.\n\nThe plan \u201cwill remain in business until we don\u2019t have any funds left to do so,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\nAt a glance\n\nBelow is the full text of the ballot language for a reneal of a millage for the countywide Ingham Health Plan:\n\n\u2022 INGHAM COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES RENEWAL MILLAGE\n\nFor the purpose of reauthorizing and continuing a millage at the same millage level previously approved by the voters in 2012 for funding of providing basic health care services to Ingham County residents who are not eligible for Medicaid under the Federal Affordable Care Act, and whose individual income is less than $28,000 and who do not have medical insurance, including use of these funds to help pay for access to doctor visits, generic medications, and essential care such as preventative testing and treatment for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses for low-income residents, shall the previously approved millage above the constitutional limitation upon the total amount of taxes which may be assessed in one (1) year upon all property within the County of Ingham, Michigan, be continued and renewed at up to 0.52 mills ($0.52 per thousand dollars of state taxable valuation) for a period of five years (2015-2019), inclusive?\n\nIf levied in full, this millage would raise an estimated $3,425,803 in the first calendar year.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1wrR4mI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Federal funding cut for low-income program; $9.6 million surplus to be gone in a few years", "og": {"site_name": "Lansing State Journal", "description": "Federal funding cut for low-income program; $9.6 million surplus to be gone in a few years", "title": "Ingham Health Plan seeks millage renewal", "url": "http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/10/25/ingham-health-plan-seeks-millage-renewal/17902499/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lansingstatejournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federal funding cut for low-income program; $9.6 million surplus to be gone in a few years", "title": "Ingham Health Plan seeks millage renewal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/857158d2dc49195830d03feb3ca0811c81b7749d/c=0-378-1520-1898&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Lansing/2014/10/25/lsjbrd10-06-2013lsj1f00220131004imglsjbrd01-11-2013ls11jn5a9p.jpg", "creator": "@LSJnews", "site": "@LSJnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=902480950", "fb": {"app_id": 155580771156105}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Ingham Health Plan, Ingham Health Plan millage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce32c\"", "article_summary": "Ingham County voters would see a renewal of a 0.52-mill levy for the Ingham Health Plan that covers doctors\u2019 visits and other health services for low-income residents.\nBetween October 2012 and June 30, the Ingham Health Plan paid for more than 6,000 such procedures, including mammograms, colonoscopies and blood tests.\nA final payment of about $800,000 should arrive this month, said Robin Reynolds, Ingham Health Plan\u2019s executive director.\nThe renewal request comes despite the health plan carrying a $9.6 million fund balance, which officials say has accrued for at least six years.\nYet, the Ingham Health Plan today is serving fewer customers."}
