Yet Mr. Krugman argues, in his essay, \u201cHigh office shouldn\u2019t be about putting points on the electoral scoreboard, it should be about changing the country for the better.\u201d\n\nStill, Howard Kurtz at Fox News points out that Democrats running in midterm elections might not be feeling the same way: \u201cIf Democrats are hanging on in the Senate shootout, it\u2019s in spite of Obama, not because of him.\u201d\n\nMr. Kurtz sees Obama\u2019s performance and approval as linked: \u201cIf the economy wasn\u2019t still having an anemic recovery six years into Obama\u2019s tenure, his approval would be higher. If he had moved earlier to beat back the ISIS terrorists, his approval would be higher. If he hadn\u2019t botched the ObamaCare rollout, his approval would be higher.\u201d\n\nAnd Guy Benson at Hot Air, looking at state-by-state approval ratings, says, \u201cThe good news is that Barack Obama\u2019s weakness, ineptitude and ideological overreach has become so undeniable that majorities in 43 of our 50 states now disapprove of his job performance.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in light of those numbers, as Jonathan Martin reports for The New York Times, Mr. Obama has been benched by his own party in midterm campaigns: \u201cThe president who became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the vote is flying in politically restricted airspace.\u201d\n\nBut in an accompanying piece to Mr. Krugman\u2019s essay, the editors at Rolling Stone point to different numbers \u2014 \u201cfigures that prove President Obama has accomplished more than you may realize\u201d \u2014 in support of Mr. Krugman\u2019s argument:\n\n\u201cPeak unemployment, October 2009: 10 percent\n\nUnemployment rate now: 5.9 percent\n\nConsecutive private sector job growth: 55 months\n\nPrivate sector jobs created: 10.3 million\n\nFederal deficit, 2009: 9.8 percent of GDP\n\nDeficit in 2014: 2.8 percent of GDP\n\nAverage under Ronald Reagan: 4.2 percent of GDP\u201d\n\nMr. Krugman highlights the president\u2019s accomplishments in the areas of health care, financial reform, the environment, the economy, national security (sort of \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get excited about a policy of not going to war gratuitously\u201d) and social change.\n\n\u201cVirtually every achievement Krugman recounts,\u201d according to Ezra Klein at Vox, dates to the first two years of the Obama presidency, when Democrats held huge majorities in congress and over \u201cscreaming\u201d Republican opposition.\n\nBut they came at a price, says Mr. Klein: Those years \u201care the story of Obama being haunted by his promises of a postpartisan presidency, and choosing, again and again, to pass bills at the cost of worsening partisanship.\u201d\n\nThe achievements came \u201cby breaking American politics further. The candidate who ran for office promising to heal Washington\u2019s divisions became the most divisive president since the advent of polling,\u201d Mr. Klein says.\n\nPerhaps the president and his administration were na\u00efve to expect more cooperation, Mr. Klein continues, but \u201cthey thought that success would build momentum; that change would beget change.\u201d\n\nKevin Drum at Mother Jones asks, was he na\u00efve? \u201cDid he really think he could pass liberal legislation with some level of Republican cooperation?\u201d\n\nHis answer: \u201cIn Obama\u2019s case, it sure sounded like more than pro forma campaign blather.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big difference this time around was the opposition,\u201d Mr. Drum adds. Most presidents receive \u201csome level of cooperation from the opposition party. Maybe not much, but some. Obama got none. This was pretty unprecedented in recent history, and it\u2019s hard to say that he should have been able to predict this back in 2008.\u201d\n\nOther observers point out areas that Mr. Krugman either overlooks or overestimates in Mr. Obama\u2019s favor. Ben Mathis-Lilley at Slate, for example, writes that \u201cKrugman also, somewhat surprisingly given the source, doesn\u2019t mention President Obama\u2019s lack of interest in the lobbying/corporate-money-in-politics issues that Candidate Obama talked about often.\u201d\n\nCole Stangler at The New Republic disputes the praise for Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental record: \u201cIf the planet is to avoid a two degree Celsius rise above pre-industrial levels \u2014 the internationally recognized threshold that, if surpassed, will unleash the most nightmarish effects of climate change \u2014 then we need to start leaving carbon in the ground, right now,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven that math, the least we might ask of an American administration is not to exploit the reserves that happen to fall within U.S. borders. We might also ask that federal policy encourage a faster transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u201cOn both counts, the administration has failed.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Krugman does not see a perfect president: \u201cThere\u2019s a theme running through each of the areas of domestic policy I\u2019ve covered. In each case, Obama delivered less than his supporters wanted, less than the country arguably deserved, but more than his current detractors acknowledge. The extent of his partial success ranges from the pretty good to the not-so-bad to the ugly.\u201d\n\nHe concludes: \u201cAm I damning with faint praise? Not at all. This is what a successful presidency looks like.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141015111756, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "per": "Obama, Barack", "org": "Democratic Party;New York Times;Rolling Stone", "keywords": "Obama Barack,Alternative and Renewable Energy,Elections House of Representatives,Elections Senate,Midterm Elections (2014),Performance Evaluations (Labor),Unemployment,United States Economy,United States Politics and Government,Democratic Party,New York Times,Rolling Stone,Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Is Obama a Great President or a Drag on the Democratic Ticket?
