DAY 1:

AARP Age-Friendly Community Updates (Part 1)



Suffolk County (Long Island, New York), population 1.4 million, adopted the first countywide Complete Streets policy, an inclusive design mandate on affordable housing, and an incentive ordinance to allow expedited zoning for builders who use inclusive design standards in private dwellings. County officials are supporting transit-oriented development into downtown areas while maintaining the surrounding area’s rural feel. Further age-friendly efforts on Long Island are occurring at both the town (Brookhaven) and village levels (Great Neck Plaza).



Westchester County (New York), population 900,000, has nine regional Livable Community Connection sites throughout the county that are working to promote education and change within the community. When Westchester conducted a Complete Streets week, the work resulted in a countywide Complete Streets ordinance. In the award-winning Caregiver Coaching program, trained volunteers mentor family caregivers, helping them understand their options and make informed decisions about caring for an older or disabled person. There is a significant engagement of volunteers throughout the county for caregiving support villages, which bring together and encourage residents who have common interests to identify community priorities.



Portland (Oregon) was one of the first cities that the World Health Organization reached out to in 2006 upon launching the World Health Organization’s Age-Friendly Cities and Communities Program. Portland was grandfathered into the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities when the program debuted in 2012. The Portland State University Institute of Aging conducts focus group research with older adults to get a sense of their priorities and how they experience the city. Portland has recently completed the development of its action plan.
