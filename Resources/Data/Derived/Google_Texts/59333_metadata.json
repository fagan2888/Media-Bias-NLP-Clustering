There are reasonable explanations for this. Voters reliably turn against the president\u2019s party during midterms, and Obama\u2019s approval ratings have been in the pits. Turnout was especially low this year and dominated by older whites who tend to be conservative. Much of the country went to the polls to register nebulous anger at the White House rather than their specific feelings about federal spending.\n\n\n\nUtah Sen. Mike Lee, a member of the Tea Party class of 2010 who has become one of the GOP\u2019s more high-profile policy minds, has written a Republican to-do for the Federalist that vaguely seems to recognize this reality. The \u201cparty establishment and consultant class chose to de-emphasize Republican policy alternatives during the campaign,\u201d Lee writes. \u201cSo despite that strategy\u2019s apparent success Tuesday night, our new majority cannot claim a sweeping legislative mandate.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nModesty! Coming from a man who was largely responsible for the government shutdown, no less. Maybe Washington isn\u2019t heading for another two years of hellish gridlock after all.\n\nBut then Lee begins talking about the budget.\n\nThe three most obvious Republican consensus principles\u2014to me, anyway\u2014are that our budget should:\n\n1. Balance within ten years (without accounting gimmicks),\n\n2. Not raise taxes, and\n\n3. Repeal Obamacare.\n\nThese goals comprise the closest thing our party has to a mandate in the wake of this election, and my guess is that every House and Senate Republican is already on record supporting them.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Tea Partier Says Republicans Lack Sweeping Legislative Mandate, Should Enact Sweeping Legislative Mandate Anyway", "sailthru.author": "Jordan Weissmann", "description": "The Republican party won a resounding victory in this week\u2019s elections, even though the majority of Americans appear to disagree with its policy positi ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The Republican party won a resounding victory in this week\u2019s elections, even though the majority of Americans appear to disagree with its policy positi ...", "title": "Tea Partier Says Republicans Lack Sweeping Legislative Mandate, Should Enact Sweeping Legislative Mandate Anyway", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard/184060343-senator-mike-lee-speaks-at-the-2013-values-voter-summit.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican party won a resounding victory in this week\u2019s elections, even though the majority of Americans appear to disagree with its policy positi ...", "title": "Tea Partier Says Republicans Lack Sweeping Legislative Mandate, Should Enact Sweeping Legislative Mandate Anyway", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard/184060343-senator-mike-lee-speaks-at-the-2013-values-voter-summit.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@JHWeissmann", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-06T11:49:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Tea Partier Says Republicans Lack Sweeping Legislative Mandate, Should Enact Sweeping Legislative Mandate Anyway", "sailthru.headline": "Tea Party Delusions Die Hard", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Tea Partier Says Republicans Lack Sweeping Legislative Mandate, Should Enact Sweeping Legislative Mandate Anyway\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard/184060343-senator-mike-lee-speaks-at-the-2013-values-voter-summit.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"221141106002\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-06T11:49:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Jordan Weissmann\",\n  \"tags\": [\"congress\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Tea Party delusions die hard:", "keywords": "mike lee, mike lee congress, mike lee budget, republican midterms, republican midterm victory, republicans win midterms", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "mike lee, mike lee congress, mike lee budget, republican midterms, republican midterm victory, republicans win midterms", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "The Republican party won a resounding victory in this week\u2019s elections, even though the majority of Americans appear to disagree with its policy positi ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/06/mike_lee_post_election_plan_tea_party_delusions_die_hard/184060343-senator-mike-lee-speaks-at-the-2013-values-voter-summit.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce32b\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cparty establishment and consultant class chose to de-emphasize Republican policy alternatives during the campaign,\u201d Lee writes.\nPhoto by Andrew Burton/Getty ImagesThe Republican party won a resounding victory in this week\u2019s elections, even though the majority of Americans appear to disagree with its policy positions.\nVoters reliably turn against the president\u2019s party during midterms, and Obama\u2019s approval ratings have been in the pits.\nUtah Sen.
