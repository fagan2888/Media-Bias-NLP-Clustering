Among the highlights: \u2014 The number of uninsured dropped from 48.6 million in 2010 to 37.2 million for the period from Jan.-Sept. last year. That amounted to 11.4 million fewer uninsured since the signing of the health care law. \u2014 In 2014, about 27 million people said they had been without coverage for more than a year. \u2014 Some 6.8 million people were covered through the health care law's new insurance markets during July-Sept. of 2014. \u2014 The most significant coverage gains last year came among adults ages 18-64. Nearly 40 million were uninsured in 2013. But that dropped to 32.6 million in the first nine months of 2014. \u2014 States that moved forward with the law's Medicaid expansion saw a bigger decline in the share of their residents uninsured.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control released a pair of reports on Monday calculating that 11 million people who had been uninsured now have insurance, thanks to Obamacare. While 37 million people are still uninsured\u2014some 4 million who would be eligible for Medicaid expansion if the states took it, the remainder undocumented immigrants and people either unaware of or purposefully boycotting insurance\u2014 this is the lowest uninsured population in more than 15 years.The discrepancy between the White House's announcement that 16.4 million have gained insurance through Obamacare and the CDC's numbers is that the CDC's numbers don't include the second round of enrollments that began last fall.\n\nNot everyone sees this as a good thing. \"House Speaker John Boehner says it amounts to a 'legacy of broken promises.'\" What promises were broken, exactly, this article doesn't clarify. Considering the biggest broken promise from Republicans of the past five years\u2014a replacement plan for Obamacare\u2014it's hard to take him too seriously.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control released a pair of ...", "title": "Boehner: 11 million gaining health insurance is a 'legacy of broken promises'", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/3/24/1373019/-Boehner-11-million-gaining-health-insurance-is-a-legacy-of-broken-nbsp-promises", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/131917/story_image/RTR4LAHI.jpg?1425242825", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "The Centers for Disease Control released a pair of reports on Monday calculating that 11 million people who had been uninsured now have insurance, thanks to Obamacare.
