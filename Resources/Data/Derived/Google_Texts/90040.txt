Late last month, during an interview on The Fan 104.3, Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders was asked the difference between Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger, with whom he spent four seasons in Pittsburgh.

“I feel like Peyton is a far better leader, in terms of staying after practice, catching balls, wanting guys to get on the same page with him, things of that sort,” Sanders had said. “This is the first time that I’ve had a quarterback that every single day after practice — no matter what his accolades, NFL MVP, Super Bowl ring — he keeps guys like me and [rookie receiver Cody] Latimer after practice. … He’s not one of those guys you’ve got to chase down. He’s going to be right in the same spot, ready to work, every single day. I just feel like that’s a difference from a mental standpoint.

“I’ve got so much love for Ben. At the same time, I’m not going to lie. I’m happy to be part of this organization and happy that Peyton is my quarterback.”

Sanders took heat for those comments, namely from Antonio Brown, his former Steeler teammate who said they were “disrespectful.” The Broncos reciever stood by his comments, though, and said he doesn’t regret them.



But now, Big Ben has spoken up. In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday, the Steelers quarterback said he was taken aback by Sanders’ words.

“Whether he meant it or not, it hurt in a sense that I tried so hard to keep him here last year and was always supporting him,” Roethlisberger said. “When he was down in practice, I always talked to him. When he had a baby, I was trying to help him.

“I was more disappointed he didn’t reach out to me. I know he told some other guys: ‘You know I love Ben, I didn’t mean it like that.’ I wish he would have reached out to me and just say that and I would have been fine with it.”
