When her partner Steve Knight poured it into two glasses, one revealed an enormous spider. Graphic photos of the spider can be found here.\n\n\u201cSteve came back from the kitchen with two glasses and said to me that I probably wouldn\u2019t want to drink it,\u201d Barr said, according to Metro. \u201cI had a look in my glass, and I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 there was a huge spider floating in it. Heaven knows where it came from \u2014 it doesn\u2019t look like any British spider I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThis type of spider has yet to be identified. According to a spokesman for Coca-Cola:\n\nWe can understand the distress this incident must have caused. That\u2019s why we have arranged to collect the bottle and spider from her so that we can investigate thoroughly this complaint. These particular plastic bottles are produced in a machine called a \"blow-fill machine.\" This blows the bottles into shape and then fills them immediately in a clean and secure environment at speeds of 13,000 bottles an hour\u2026 we believe it is very unlikely that anything could have found its way inadvertently into products made on this particular machine. But we will know more once we have received the bottle back from [Ms Barr] and can conduct the necessary tests on its contents.\n\nWhether or not the spider really was in the bottle originally, or if it originated in the house and ended up in the glass \u2014 take this as a little sign to start curbing your soda intake. At the end of the day, soda is bad for you; it spikes your blood sugar, forcing your liver to begin transforming any sugar into fat. All the sugar and caffeine in Coke, likewise, will dehydrate you. Choose water, fresh juice, or unsweetened tea for hydration instead.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "coca-cola, coke spider", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A couple was disgusted to find a giant spider fall out of their Coke bottle as they were about to enjoy dinner.", "title": "Couple Finds Giant Spider In Coke Bottle, Blames Coca-Cola [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/spiders-your-coke-couple-finds-giant-bug-coke-bottle-disgusted-300792", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/02/coke_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A couple was disgusted to find a giant spider fall out of their Coke bottle as they were about to enjoy dinner.", "title": "Couple Finds Giant Spider In Coke Bottle, Blames Coca-Cola [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/spiders-your-coke-couple-finds-giant-bug-coke-bottle-disgusted-300792", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/02/coke_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/02/coke_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-02T15:06:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-02T15:06:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A couple was disgusted to find a giant spider fall out of their Coke bottle as they were about to enjoy dinner."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf3a\"", "article_summary": "A couple in England were about to eat dinner when they discovered a giant dead spider floating in their Coke.\nAmanda Barr, from Eastbourne in the UK, reportedly bought a 3-liter bottle of Coke from a local store called Iceland Foods.\nThat\u2019s why we have arranged to collect the bottle and spider from her so that we can investigate thoroughly this complaint.\nThese particular plastic bottles are produced in a machine called a \"blow-fill machine.\"\n\u201cI had a look in my glass, and I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 there was a huge spider floating in it."}
