Lawmakers were concerned about revelations that Ms. Cohn had sought to block the Commerce Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General from releasing an unredacted copy of its findings.\n\nSEE ALSO: Congress fumes as idle federal workers went shopping\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act request, The Washington Times obtained a copy of the report in July and identified Ms. Cohn as the target of the misconduct investigation. Her resignation was first reported on Monday by Law360.\n\nBefore her role in the nepotism probe became public, an attorney for Ms. Cohn had warned the inspector general that she did not consent to public release of the report \u201cin order to avoid any costly and unnecessary litigation,\u201d according to documents.\n\nThe investigation had focused on the hiring of a lawyer living with a relative of Ms. Cohn. The applicant was among more than 700 people applying for the job, but he failed to qualify as one of the 250 candidates to advance to the first round of screening. Because of his connections, the report said, he advanced the next round of screening anyway, finishing 75th out of 76.\n\n\u201cAfter the applicant was rejected, the [Patent Office] executive intervened and created an additional position specifically for the applicant,\u201d Inspector General Todd Zinser said in a statement on the report before Ms. Cohn was publicly identified as the executive.\n\nDays later, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa sent a letter to Department of Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker calling for \u201cimmediate\u201d disciplinary action against Ms. Cohn.\n\nThe California Republican wrote that Ms. Cohn displayed \u201cappalling\u201d behavior when she used her influence to find a job for a less qualified candidate, and then threatened to sue to block public release of the report.\n\nBut Ms. Cohn has her supporters, too. A former general counsel at the Patent Office Bernie Knight said he worked with Ms. Cohn for eight years and never witnessed her act unethically.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t investigate what happened here, I don\u2019t know if the stuff in the [inspector general\u2019s] report is accurate or not accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you this woman is of the highest ethical standards based on my working relationship with her. She\u2019s always followed the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office commissioner has announced plans to resign just months after a watchdog agency revealed that she'd pressured staff to hire the live-in boyfriend of an immediate family member over other qualified applicants.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office commissioner has announced plans to resign just months after a watchdog agency revealed that she\u2019d pressured staff to hire the live-in boyfriend of an immediate family member over other qualified applicants.", "title": "Patent Office head to step down amid nepotism charge", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/8/patent-office-head-step-down-amid-nepotism-charge/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/02/28/20110228-192415-pic-734856768.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/02/28/20110228-192415-pic-734856768.jpg", "description": "A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office commissioner has announced plans to resign just months after a watchdog agency revealed that she'd pressured staff to hire the live-in boyfriend of an immediate fami", "card": "summary", "title": "Patent Office head to step down amid nepotism charge"}, "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Deborah Cohn"}, "article_summary": "A former general counsel at the Patent Office Bernie Knight said he worked with Ms. Cohn for eight years and never witnessed her act unethically.\nLawmakers were concerned about revelations that Ms. Cohn had sought to block the Commerce Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General from releasing an unredacted copy of its findings.\nBut the investigation brought unwanted attention both for Ms. Cohn and the agency from Congress.\nThe investigation had focused on the hiring of a lawyer living with a relative of Ms. Cohn.\nBut Ms. Cohn has her supporters, too."}
