Watch! (They really get going at about the 5-minute mark.) Read more about it at Little Things.\n\nAnd this paraplegic groom surprised his bride on their wedding day with a very special first dance. Still have that hankie handy? Watch the video.\n\nWedding anniversaries can be just as memorable. Witness these two brothers who decided to give their parents a hilarious anniversary gift when Matthew and James Houghton took several of their childhood photos and reenacted them as adults. Here\u2019s one of them:\n\nSpeaking of weddings and anniversaries, how\u2019s this for a wedding coach?\n\nLooks more like a hearse, doesn\u2019t it? One Facebook commenter noted: \u201cThat car says, \u2018Wanna get married? Hey, it\u2019s your funeral.'\u201d\n\nFuneral? Did someone say funeral?\n\nDid you know that beginning right around the time of the Civil War, families who could afford it had photographs taken of their dead? I know, sounds pretty creepy, doesn\u2019t it? But postmortem photography was a way for loved ones to remember those who had passed on.\n\nThe photographer would be called out shortly after the loved one died. The deceased was propped up and dressed in their finest. It is said that postmortem photos or \u201cmemento mori\u201d of children and babies were common, especially during the Victorian era when mortality rates were high. Read more about it and view more photographs here.\n\nFrom postmortem photos to hidden heads. Oleg Shuplyak\u2019s paintings contain more than meets the eye. Take a look at the double images created by his paint and brush.\n\nWhile we\u2019re into metamorphosis, here\u2019s how one Texas community transformed an empty big-box retail store into something else altogether. Hint? It\u2019s a play on words.\n\nSand art\n\nLending new meaning to playing in the sand, artist Andres Amador creates masterpieces with a rake only to see them washed away with the incoming tide. Seems self-defeating, so why does he do it?\n\n\u201cIts fun. I get to be at the beach,\u201d he says.\n\nVisit his Facebook here. Amador\u2019s website has more beach murals.\n\nThe good, the bad, the Gruber\n\nJonathan Gruber, MIT economics professor and Obamacare architect, is now part of the common lexicon.\n\nAs reported in WND, last week \u201ctapes surfaced that Gruber had said he and his Democratic colleagues had hid the health law\u2019s true costs from the public to take advantage of the \u2018stupidity of the American voter\u2019 and pass the bill. In another speech, Gruber said \u2018Americans were too stupid to understand\u2019 Obamacare\u2019s main tax hike. In yet another, he boasted of Obamacare\u2019s \u2018exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.'\u201d\n\nUrban Dictionary has added a new word and definition: Grubered: (Verb) To mislead the public into believing lies to achieve personal ideological laws pass. Example: \u201cThe President really grubered us on that healthcare bill.\u201d\n\nGruber also was the subject of an online Twitter hashtag #ReplaceMovietitleWithGruber contest, resulting in titles like \u201cMidnight in the Garden of Good and Gruber.\u201d\n\nGruber has also inspired online jokes and photoshops:\n\nRelated tweets (courtesy of Twitchy.com): \u201cGuy who never worked on Obama\u2019s staff worked on Obama\u2019s staff.\u201d\n\nHow times have changed: What the White House said about Gruber in 2009\n\nDavid Axelrod calls Gruber the definition of \u2018stupid,\u2019 gets asked one \u2018great question\u2019\n\n\u2018Well briefed\u2019 Obama tells Ed Henry \u2018I just heard about\u2019 Gruber\n\n2012 OFA \u2018Truth Team\u2019 video features Jonathan Gruber touting O-care development role\n\n\u2018Grubered again!\u2019 If you like your plan, you can pay more for your plan in 2015\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Democrats have like an island they send this guy to?\u2019 Gruber admits to \u2018mislabeling\u2019 in latest video\n\nObamacare architect Jon Gruber calls voter \u2018adolescent child\u2019 in 5th video\n\nPity the poor guy who shares the same name! Being Jon Gruber on Twitter right now must be really awkward!\n\nTim Young at The Clash Daily posted photos of Gruber\u2019s comic book to promote Obamacare, explaining:\n\nBy now we all know who Jonathan Gruber is \u2026 and if you don\u2019t, turn on the news. The quotes this \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare gave us on his work were golden:\n\n\u201cThis bill was written in a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes,\u201d and, \u201cIf CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies, OK? \u2026 Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage, and basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically, that was really, really critical to getting this thing to pass.\u201d\n\nAfter those quotes, it makes perfect sense that Gruber\u2019s greatest treatise for the stupid American voters is a comic book \u2026 and when I heard this, I had to find a copy and read it for myself so that you, the stupid American voter, wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nWe leave you with this one.
