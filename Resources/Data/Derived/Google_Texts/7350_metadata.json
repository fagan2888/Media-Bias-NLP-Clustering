As usual, Noah is very mild and eager to give the benefit of the doubt, although even so there\u2019s not much there.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to point out, however, is that there\u2019s an overarching reason not to take any of this stuff seriously. All the anti-Keynesian stories (except \u201cuncertainty\u201d, which as Nick Rowe points out is actually a Keynesian story but doesn\u2019t know it) are supply-side stories; Cochrane even puts scare quotes around the word \u201cdemand\u201d. Basically, they\u2019re claiming that unemployment benefits, or Obamacare, or regulations, or something, are reducing the willingness of workers and firms to produce stuff.\n\nHow would you test this? In a supply-constrained economy, the kind of monetary policy we\u2019ve had, with the Fed quintupling the size of its balance sheet over a short period of time, would be highly inflationary. Indeed, just about everyone on the right has been predicting runaway inflation year after year.\n\nMeanwhile, if you had a demand-side view, and considered the implications of the zero lower bound, you declared that nothing of the sort would happen:\n\nNow, the equation [the quantity equation for money] still holds. But all that tells us is that any changes in the money supply are offset one for one by changes in velocity \u2026 Actually, in the real world it\u2019s even worse, because central banks don\u2019t control the money supply, they only control the monetary base. Broad aggregates like M2 may well be unaffected by what the central bank does: increase the monetary base, and all that happens is an offsetting fall in the money multiplier.\n\n(I was arguing against neomonetarism, but the point holds more generally.)\n\nReality:\n\nPhoto\n\nIt seems to me that the failure of the inflation predicted by anti-Keynesians to appear \u2014 and the fact that this failure was predicted by Keynesian models \u2014 is a further big reason not to take what these people are saying seriously.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140706095600, "BN": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 6, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Slump Stories and the Inflation Test ( 20140706 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "twitter": {"description": "Why you shouldn\u2019t take anti-Keynesians seriously.", "title": "Slump Stories and the Inflation Test", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/slump-stories-and-the-inflation-test/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Why you shouldn\u2019t take anti-Keynesians seriously.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 6, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1404654960, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-07-06T13:56:00-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140706135600, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140706, "pdate": 20140706, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Why you shouldn\u2019t take anti-Keynesians seriously.", "title": "Slump Stories and the Inflation Test", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/slump-stories-and-the-inflation-test/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/slump-stories-and-the-inflation-test/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Slump Stories and the Inflation Test", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1204\"", "article_summary": "What I\u2019d like to point out, however, is that there\u2019s an overarching reason not to take any of this stuff seriously.\nIndeed, just about everyone on the right has been predicting runaway inflation year after year.\nAs usual, Noah is very mild and eager to give the benefit of the doubt, although even so there\u2019s not much there.\nBut all that tells us is that any changes in the money supply are offset one for one by changes in velocity \u2026 Actually, in the real world it\u2019s even worse, because central banks don\u2019t control the money supply, they only control the monetary base.\nNoah Smith has another post on John Cochrane\u2019s anti-Keynesian screed, in which he takes on various \u201cstructural\u201d stories about the continuing weakness of the economy."}
