It felt good, and it felt very familiar.\u201d\n\nWith a new record finally issued a decade later \u2014 their first studio album in 23 years \u2014 the Pixies still sound remarkably familiar, but they definitely don\u2019t look the same.\n\nOriginal bassist Kim Deal quit last year during sessions for the album, \u201cIndy Cindy.\u201d She has since been replaced twice. Paz Lenchantin, former bassist for A Perfect Circle, ultimately landed the job.\n\nKnown for its influence on everyone from Nirvana to Radiohead \u2014 and for its own small batch of rock-radio staples such as \u201cMonkey Gone to Heaven,\u201d \u201cGigantic\u201d and \u201cWhere Is My Mind?\u201d \u2014 the Pixies will play their first Twin Cities show without Deal at the State Theatre in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Deal with Deal?\n\nPaz Lenchantin of the Pixies performed in Atlanta this year.\n\nTalking by phone last week en route to a San Francisco gig, the band\u2019s sometimes testy frontman sounded a tad annoyed when the subject of his former bandmate and singing partner came up. (Deal herself has yet to talk specifics to the news media.)\n\n\u201cShe signed on, and then she signed out \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d said the real-life Charles Thompson. \u201cShe left for reasons that are between her and herself. We continued on. It\u2019s not like she was kicked out.\u201d\n\nWith a more amicable and playful hue, he added, \u201cLooking at her activities since then, she\u2019s been working with her old band, the Breeders, and I suppose sometimes you just want to be the captain of your own boat. Sometimes there\u2019s only enough room for one control freak in the room.\u201d\n\nJust getting all four original Pixies into one room to make a new album proved quite a challenge. Black Francis, guitarist Joey Santiago, drummer David Lovering and Deal toured with all old songs in the interim. During their last concert in town, a 2011 date, they played their 1989 album \u201cDoolittle\u201d front to back.\n\n\u201cIt was getting a little weird,\u201d the frontman admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time to be doing the same routine.\u201d\n\nSongs from \u201cIndy Cindy\u201d have helped freshen up the shows. Issued through their own Pixiesmusic label, the 12-song collection landed modest radio/online hits with \u201cBagboy\u201d and \u201cGreens and Blues\u201d but earned mostly lukewarm reviews. Even the more negative write-ups, however, often remarked how closely the record hewed to certain formulas from the band\u2019s heyday albums \u2014 the juxtaposed screaming verses and melodic boy/girl choruses, the surfy-to-screechy guitar work, etc.\n\nWriting under his old moniker for the first time in two decades, the reborn Black Francis admitted that he tried hard to live up to the name.\n\n\u201cI edited myself a lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cI fretted over the songs more. I felt like they had to be extra good and live up to the expectations people have for a Pixies record \u2014 which is a good thing.\u201d\n\nJust as the songwriting took time and care, he said, the band had to make sure that its new bass player fit the Pixies mold. Without knocking the talent of Deal\u2019s initial replacement, Milwaukee\u2019s Kim Shattuck (who was let go after a few months), he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re in a real rock band like ours \u2014 not a slicko rock band with an army of producers \u2014 the fit has to be right. You can tell if it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nLenchantin, who also played in Billy Corgan\u2019s band Zwan, proved to be the right fit \u2014 which meant that the Pixies bandleader had been wrong.\n\n\u201cPaz was one of the ones who auditioned for us originally, and I was the one who sort of passed her over and said to use the other one,\u201d he conceded with a laugh. \u201cFortunately, she was still willing and able to join us.\u201d\n\nA song for Slim\n\nSpeaking of replacement band members, one of Thompson\u2019s more recent recordings was a cover of Minneapolis music hero Slim Dunlap\u2019s song \u201cThe King & Queen\u201d as part of the \u201cSongs for Slim\u201d series to benefit the former Replacements guitarist, who suffered a severe stroke in 2012. Thompson recorded it under his solo name Frank Black with help from the Suicide Commandos and his personal pal Tommy Stinson, Dunlap\u2019s former bandmate.\n\n\u201cThat was a way of me paying back the Replacements, a band I feel indebted to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey paved a way for a band like the Pixies. They were that kind of admirable band that taught other bands you can do whatever the hell you want to do.\u201d\n\nConversely, the Pixies may have taught Stinson and Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg a thing or two about cashing in on a reunion when your old band\u2019s influence greatly outweighed its commercial success.\n\nBlack Francis recounted a conversation he had with a veteran, sage-like roadie early in the Pixies reformation that helped shape his outlook on playing the reunion card.\n\nTHE PIXIES With: Royal Blood. When: 7:30 p.m. Sat. Where: State Theatre, 805 Hennepin Av. S., Mpls. Tickets: $45-$59.50. 1-800-982-2787 or Ticketmaster.com.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018You wrote some good songs, made some good records. You\u2019ve been given this opportunity to play them again, and you should keep playing them for five years or however long you can. You\u2019ve earned the right. You deserve it.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, we did it for 10 years, and we\u2019re still doing plenty of those original songs. Where we\u2019re at now \u2014 playing nice venues where tickets cost $50 to $100 \u2014 you have to meet people\u2019s expectations and play a lot of certain songs. And I\u2019m fine with that. I think there\u2019s a lot of honor in that, actually.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A decade since the '90s rock heroes launched their reunion in Minneapolis, the frontman talks about their new disc \u2013 and newest member.", "title": "Pixies first album in 23 years has familiar sound, but band has a different look", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/back-in-black-with-the-pixies/277953871/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141228886696197.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141228886696197.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A decade since the '90s rock heroes launched their reunion in Minneapolis, the frontman talks about their new disc \u2013 and newest member.", "title": "Pixies first album in 23 years has familiar sound, but band has a different look", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/back-in-black-with-the-pixies/277953871/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141228886696197.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141228886696197.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A decade since the '90s rock heroes launched their reunion in Minneapolis, the frontman talks about their new disc \u2013 and newest member."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd94\"", "article_summary": "Black Francis recounted a conversation he had with a veteran, sage-like roadie early in the Pixies reformation that helped shape his outlook on playing the reunion card.\nWhen the Pixies played their first reunion show a decade ago at the Fine Line in Minneapolis, the band\u2019s frontman, Black Francis, had at least a hunch that their new era would not be short-lived.\nBlack Francis, guitarist Joey Santiago, drummer David Lovering and Deal toured with all old songs in the interim.\nWriting under his old moniker for the first time in two decades, the reborn Black Francis admitted that he tried hard to live up to the name.\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018You wrote some good songs, made some good records."}
