But among the speaker\u2019s first acts was to remove a whistleblower and outspoken critic of single-payer health care from a powerful health committee.\n\nState Rep. Mary Morrissey, R-Bennington, was noticeably absent from the list of members announced Wednesday to serve on the House Committee on Health Care, an 11-member panel that makes crucial decisions about health care in Vermont.\n\nThe 19-year lawmaker and four-year member of the committee was known for asking tough questions about whether the state could afford a universal, taxpayer-funded health-care system in Vermont.\n\nGov. Peter Shumlin defended the speaker\u2019s imminent committee announcements Monday at a news conference, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job; it\u2019s a thankless job.\u201d\n\nDuring the lead-up to Shumlin\u2019s Dec. 17 decision to pull the plug on single payer, Morrissey told reporters she didn\u2019t think a small state could \u201cdo this multi-billion-dollar initiative without information or even the tax base to produce a good product.\u201d\n\nIn his December speech dumping single payer, Shumlin agreed.\n\n\u201cAs we completed the financing modeling \u2026 it became clear that the risk of economic shock is too high at this time to offer a plan I can responsibly support for passage in the legislature.\u201d\n\nMorrissey also accurately predicted the single-payer plan would far exceed cost estimates.\n\n\u201cWith this health care, it\u2019s gone from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion, and I will contend it\u2019s probably more likely going to be in the $3 to $4 billion range,\u201d she said.\n\nThe single-payer balance sheet released by the administration last month indicates the plan would have required $2.6 billion in new revenue for 2017, yet almost $3.2 billion in 2021.\n\nMorrissey said the dismissive attitude shown her during her time on the committee was disturbing.\n\n\u201cThe total disregard by all the folks working on the reform is pretty disrespectful. Every time I have asked a question I get, \u2018Ugh, totally unfounded\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty pointed with financial questions. I\u2019ll ask simple questions that are not trick questions or to catch anyone. I want honest answers.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "She was skeptical of single-payer health care.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "She was skeptical of single-payer health care.", "title": "Vt.
