James Hastings and Sen. Jacob Javits, R-New York, and later as associate director of the Domestic Council for Health, Social Security and Income Assistance at the White House under President Gerald Ford.\n\nBefore he was hired by the Michigan Hospital Association, as it was called until the mid-1990s, he was executive vice president of the Hospital Association of New York State.\n\n\u201cI came here in 1985; it turned into a life sentence,\u201d said Johnson, 70, in typical deadpan fashion.\n\nOn his \u201cpolitical\u201d career, Johnson said: \u201cI participated with Ted Kennedy and the House of Representatives in passing the HMO Act (of 1973). He was one of the first to propose a comprehensive health program \u2014 Medicare for all.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Kennedy\u2019s discussion of universal health insurance, which he now calls Medicare Part E (as in \u2018e\u2019 for everyone), inevitably led to the passage in 2010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis might be the new \u2018wild West\u2019 mentality as people, voters and (health care) people providing care try to figure out what happened,\u201d said Johnson, predicting that the next presidential election will stimulate a movement to \u201cfix health care reform.\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson credits Obamacare with intensifying reform of the health care delivery system that already was underway, he said he would have suggested the president and Congress roll out the changes more slowly.\n\n\u201c(Health reform) is like trying to rebuild your house while it is still burning,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOverall, how far can we move, how fast do we go without damaging the financing and the delivery system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe expectations have been set very high (for success).\u201d\n\nAdjusting to change\n\nBut over the years, the Johnson-led association has worked diligently to help hospitals in Michigan navigate the changing waters of public and private reimbursement, consolidation, physician inclusion, and the movement toward higher quality, better medical outcomes and patient safety.\n\n\u201cThe problem all providers have, and it is not just hospitals, is the constant readjusting of the economic impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will not be as much revenue in the system. This has been the theme the past few years.\u201d\n\nJohnson calls health care in the 21st century \u201cthe do-more-with-less era. \u2026 This has happened as government has gotten more involved in health policy.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Johnson said he has delivered a four-pronged message to hospital executives, physicians, the media, politicians and the public about health care change.\n\nHis four messages are: the need to transform the health care delivery system from within; the importance of managing the health of patient populations and coordinate care; the need to better manage reimbursement and develop methods to manage financial risk; and the value of sharing patient data among providers using electronic health records and integrated health information exchanges that link all providers.\n\n\u201cWe need to prepare because there will not be the same amount of money in the system for providers and others. We will see more Medicare cuts in the next two to three years,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nJohnson predicted that consolidation of hospitals and physicians into larger organizations is a trend that will continue.\n\n\u201cA small practice can\u2019t afford a $500,000 bill for an electronic health record,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be more consolidation of physicians into bigger groups, and doctors into hospitals.\u201d\n\nFor example, American Medical Association data shows that about 65 percent of the state\u2019s 19,000 physicians either work for hospitals or have close affiliation relationships with hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is really important we get access to clinical data to help manage patient care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you show up in an ER or physician office, the ability to pull up your chart, see what quality you have, is very important.\u201d\n\nAchievements\n\nJohnson cited several achievements under his tenure. One was in 1993 when the state enacted medical liability reform that has led to fewer malpractice lawsuits and more stable premium costs.\n\n\u201cWhen we got that done, that was a significant (help) for providers,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother was the creation in 2003 of the MHA Keystone Center.\n\n\u201cMy view is if there is no measurement, there is no improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found that out with (the Keystone Center) over the last 10 years.\"\n\nFunded in part by state and federal governments, member hospitals and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the Keystone Center has researched and helped hospitals implement a number of clinical care and quality improvement initiatives that have saved thousands of lives.\n\nWhile Johnson said there are some things he won\u2019t miss as head of the state hospital association \u2014 like losing the 2002 state constitutional amendment battle about using 90 percent of tobacco settlement money specifically for health care \u2014 there are things he will miss.\n\n\u201cI will miss being on the cutting edge of things\u201d and advocating for hospitals and patients, said Johnson, who said he and his wife, Julianne, will remain in the Lansing area to be close to their three sons and three granddaughters.\n\n\u201cWe will stick around. My wife has spent a lifetime being indispensable to them,\u201d he said.\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
