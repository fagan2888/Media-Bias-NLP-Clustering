SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The Rockies’ spring training pitching schedule is taking shape.

The full pitching schedule has not been released yet, but right-hander Jhoulys Chacin is scheduled to start on Thursday against the D-backs, newly acquired righty Kyle Kendrick on Friday vs. the Angels at Tempe Diablo Stadium, and lefty Jorge De La Rosa on Saturday at Salt River Field vs. the Cubs.

On Tuesday, the Rockies will play a seven-inning intrasquad game on a practice field at the Salt River complex. Pitching for one team will be left-hander Chris Rusin (two innnings), right-hander John Lannan (two innings), with as right-handers Justin Miller and Scott Oberg, and lefty Jason Gurka all pitching one inning.

Lefty Tyler Matzek will start for the other team. He’s scheduled to throw two innings. He’ll be followed by right-handers John Axford, Jose Ortega and Rafael Ortega, as well as lefties Boone Logan and Buddy Boshers. They will throw one inning apiece.

The intrasquad game is not open to the public because the D-Backs are hosting Arizona State in the main stadium on Tuesday.
