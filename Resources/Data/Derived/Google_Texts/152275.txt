Republican Secretary of State Tom Schedler easily won election Saturday (Oct. 24) to his second full term over Democratic challenger Chris Tyson.

Schedler said he would continue to push for a reduction in the number of elections held in Louisiana, which holds more elections than any other Southern state. Schedler said he believes voter participation could be higher if there were fewer elections to track.

Tyson, an LSU law professor, ran on a platform of automatic voter registration, an idea popular with the national Democratic Party. Citizens who are black and Hispanic are less likely to be registered to vote than their white counterparts. Some experts believe automatic voter registration might close that gap.
