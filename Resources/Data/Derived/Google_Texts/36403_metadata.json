That sense of urgency makes them vulnerable to the cons spreading on the Internet no matter that open enrollment lasts until February 15, 2015.\n\nIn a common scheme, you\u2019ll get a phone call from a so-called \u201cNavigator\u201d, claiming to have the authority to help \u201cnavigate\u201d the health exchange website for you. The caller guesses, most of the time rightly, that you started to sign up but haven\u2019t finished and will offer to help you through the process. The catch: you have to turn over a lot of personal information that the scammer will then use for no good. \u201cThe main thing we try to tell people is to never give identifying information over the phone,\u201d says Luss. \u201cNo reputable person ever asks you for your Social Security number or password or any other identifying information.\u201d Even if your caller ID displays an official name don\u2019t believe it. Scam artists can manipulate the name/number they are calling from.\n\nStealing your personal information is the way many make their living, and an easy way for them to do that is to trick you into clicking on a link. Katherine Hutt, a spokeswoman for the Better Business Bureau, says consumers are getting official looking emails daily about open enrollment urging them to visit a website to sign up, update their information or purchase insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the same scam we saw last year,\u201d says Hutt. \u201cOpen enrollment is in the news. They take advantage of that.\u201d Since the government communicates through mail and already has your Social Security number, be leery of any unsolicited communications, advises the BBB.\n\nConfusion over how long open enrollment lasts isn\u2019t the only problem with the ACA. Where to buy insurance has many scratching their heads. In the majority of states you can purchase health insurance through the federal government\u2019s website at HealthCare.gov, but if you live in some states you have to use the state website. There are also third parties that are authorized to sell ObamaCare approved plans including online marketplaces and insurance agents. \u201cThere\u2019s so many websites out there, there\u2019s so much information they are not sure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real,\u201d says Tom Pegues, founder of GoodScout, an online health insurance marketplace.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bad guys haven\u2019t missed this and responded by launching fake websites for a host of nefarious activities. Theft being one of them. Luss has one client who lost $5,000 purchasing a bogus plan on the Internet. \u201cShe went on to the web to pay for a whole year up front and found this Website that looked real but was a fake,\u201d says Luss. \u201cThere\u2019s legions of fake websites that look like the particular state exchange wherever you are.\u201d\n\nBefore offering up any information make sure the website is legit, says Pegues. That means if you are using a state exchange make sure it ends in .gov and if you are shopping in the private market the company\u2019s physical address and phone number match and that the company is licensed to sell qualifying health plans. A search for any complaints is also necessary. \u201cWhen someone approaches you be suspicious. Don\u2019t trust your caller ID. Don\u2019t click on links,\u201d says Hutt. \u201cIf you need information go directly to the source at Healthcare.gov.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE/Medicare,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 01:44:19 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is in full swing, which means so are the swindlers.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452278663496.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is in full swing, which means so are the swindlers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Don\u2019t Get ObamaCare Scammed"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE/Medicare\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\"],\"author\":\"Donna Fuscaldo\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Don\\u2019t Get ObamaCare Scammed\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452278663496.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-09T21:02:16Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"e5b2daa5-628e-4b59-8f66-6e70e2d4cd2e\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is in full swing, which means so are the swindlers.", "dc.identifier": "e5b2daa5-628e-4b59-8f66-6e70e2d4cd2e", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "healthcare,medicare,healthcare", "description": "Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is in full swing, which means so are the swindlers.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Don\u2019t Get Obamacare Scammed", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-08 01:44:19 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is in full swing, which means so are the swindlers.", "title": "Don\u2019t Get ObamaCare Scammed  | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452278663496.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-12-09", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE/Medicare\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\"],\"author\":\"Donna Fuscaldo\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Don\\u2019t Get ObamaCare Scammed\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452278663496.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-09T21:02:16Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/12/09/dont-get-obamacare-scammed.html\",\"post_id\":\"e5b2daa5-628e-4b59-8f66-6e70e2d4cd2e\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Donna Fuscaldo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc15d\"", "article_summary": "That sense of urgency makes them vulnerable to the cons spreading on the Internet no matter that open enrollment lasts until February 15, 2015.\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENTThe bad guys haven\u2019t missed this and responded by launching fake websites for a host of nefarious activities.\nConfusion over how long open enrollment lasts isn\u2019t the only problem with the ACA.\nThere are also third parties that are authorized to sell ObamaCare approved plans including online marketplaces and insurance agents.\n\u201cOpen enrollment is in the news."}
