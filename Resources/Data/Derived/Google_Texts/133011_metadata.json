But some doctors are still charging Americans for these services due to confusion over what counts as a preventative care visit, according to USA Today.\n\nObamacare requires all insurance plans issued after 2010 (when the health law was passed) to cover preventative services deemed important by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) \u2014 a government panel of doctors and scientists \u2014 without a co-payment. Some of the procedures recently added to that list include cancer screenings for heavy smokers, HIV screenings for all Americans aged 15 to 65, and domestic violence screenings for all women aged 14 to 46.\n\nUnfortunately, doctors\u2019 offices and staff \u201caren\u2019t really educated about what is covered,\u201d said Monica Lindeen, Montana\u2019s insurance commissioner and state auditor and vice president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, in an interview with USA Today. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they need to bill for and what they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSeveral doctors have been reported to charge patients for procedures as simple as a blood pressure test on consumer websites. A standard co-pay for that can run as much as $25 to $30.\n\nIn July, over 65 percent of doctors surveyed by the health industry jobs company Locum Tenens said that they were \u201cnot at all familiar\u201d with crucial aspects of the law, such as plan benefits levels, contracted rates with insurers, patient coverage terms, and the claims process.\n\nAlthough these mistakes may eventually be caught by claims processors and insurers or resolve themselves as long as the doctor\u2019s office uses the appropriate billing code, public health advocates stress that doctors and consumers need to take the time to educate themselves about Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Preventative health services are free under Obamacare.
