I want to be able to walk the streets of my city and not think about me being different from my environment,\u201d said Hernandez.\n\nOn March 25, Hernandez and Tapia, both Latino, were knocking on doors in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood on the city\u2019s Southwest Side, to inform residents about the March 31 deadline for the Affordable Care Act. They were stopped by Chicago Police officers, searched, detained and subsequently charged with misdemeanor soliciting unlawful business.\n\nA CPD official told the Chicago Tribune that a resident phoned 911 after seeing the men in the area, which has been experiencing a \u201crash of door-to-door scams.\u201d\n\nWhen officers arrived, Hernandez and Tapia were reportedly unable to produce identification that showed they worked for the Grassroots Collaborative. They were also unable to say who their supervisor was, Adam Collins, a CPD spokesman, told the newspaper.\n\nOn Friday, a judge dismissed the charges. But Hernandez and Tapia will still have the get the arrest expunged from their records.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m glad that the charges against me were dismissed, it is just part of a larger problem of racial profiling. Since I was arrested, how many other Chicagoans have been profiled and criminalized by the Chicago Police Department because they aren't white?\u201d Hernandez said moments after the judge's ruling.\n\nHere's more from Friday's demonstration:\n\nActivists with the Grassroots Collaborative called on the CPD to increase police accountability by collecting more comprehensive data on officers\u2019 use of the stop-and-frisk policy.\n\n\u201cWe ask, why were two young Latino men arrested by four white Chicago Police officers in a white neighborhood of Chicago? How often does CPD stop and frisk people of color in cases that receive no media attention at all?\u201d said Amisha Patel, executive director for the Grassroots Collaborative. \u201cUnfortunately we don\u2019t know the answer to this because the Chicago Police Department\u2019s contact cards are vague and deliberately unsearchable.\u201d\n\nActivists called for reform and compared Chicago\u2019s contact cards with the more detailed contact cards of New York City.\n\nNew York City\u2019s detailed contact cards, Patel said, are key to getting data on instances of racial profiling during police stops.\n\n\u201cThe lack of information [in Chicago] means that our communities don\u2019t know the real story of what\u2019s happening,\u201d Patel said.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in January that the city would settle two class-action lawsuits over police stop-and-frisk tactics and agree to policy reforms after a federal judge ordered police stop tactics in NYC unconstitutional in August.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Chicago residents have the same civil rights as New Yorkers?\u201d Patel asked.\n\nIn April, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department will collect data about stops, searches and arrests nationwide. Funded through $4.75 million in grants, the move is part of a larger effort to analyze and reduce the effects of racial bias within the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cRacial disparities contribute to tension in our nation generally and within communities of color specifically, and tend to breed resentment towards law enforcement that is counterproductive to the goal of reducing crime,\u201d Holder said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile in Chicago, police contact cards are vague and not used exclusively during stops, meaning Chicago\u2019s stop-and-frisk data is not easy to analyze, according to Lindsay Miller, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois (ACLU).\n\n\u201cThe current Chicago Police contact cards are badly flawed,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Chicago, a \u201csmall amount of data\u201d shows that communities of color are disproportionately targeted for stop-and-frisk activity, Miller claims.\n\n\u201cPolice should be forced to answer two very simple questions; why is someone being stopped on the streets of Chicago, and why are they being searched by the police,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the data to get a clear and full picture of the exact number of people being stopped, the number of people being frisked and who is being stopped and frisked.\u201d\n\nMiller said in 30 percent of ACLU analyzed cases, the organization did not have enough information to determine whether the police stop in Chicago was lawful.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU of Illinois calls upon the Chicago Police Department to maintain a separate stop-and-frisk database with thorough documentation that is publicly accessible, so that stop-and-frisk patterns can be tracked,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe record of this database will allow the public to have an open conversation and a transparent discussion in our city about the use and the misuse of this tactic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0eda\"", "article_summary": "New York City\u2019s detailed contact cards, Patel said, are key to getting data on instances of racial profiling during police stops.\n\u201cUnfortunately we don\u2019t know the answer to this because the Chicago Police Department\u2019s contact cards are vague and deliberately unsearchable.\u201dActivists called for reform and compared Chicago\u2019s contact cards with the more detailed contact cards of New York City.\n\u201cWe ask, why were two young Latino men arrested by four white Chicago Police officers in a white neighborhood of Chicago?\nThey were stopped by Chicago Police officers, searched, detained and subsequently charged with misdemeanor soliciting unlawful business.\n\u201cThe current Chicago Police contact cards are badly flawed,\u201d she said."}
