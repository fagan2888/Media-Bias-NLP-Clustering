The headlines continue to reiterate The Economist\u2019s May 2000 cover story, which dubbed Africa the \u201cHopeless Continent,\u201d a region teetering on the brink of collapse with terrorism, disease, corruption and coups the norm rather than the exception.\n\nThe broader reality of Africa today is very different from this seemingly ubiquitous negative narrative. While the deplorable acts by extremists must be given the utmost attention to resolve, they should not be allowed to distort the tremendous success occurring across the continent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn December 2011, The Economist cover story, \u201cThe Hopeful Continent: Africa Rising,\u201d highlighted recent successes on the continent including the rapid growth of many African countries, the increasing education level of the population entering the workforce, the enthusiasm for technology which is boosting growth and attracting the attention of international investors such as China and other non-Western countries.\n\nWhile Africa still faces its share of challenges, it is the missing headlines that are the real story for Africa. And it is a story of opportunity, entrepreneurialism, and hope. \"How many network newscasts have been interrupted to announce that, amongst countries with more than 10 million people, 6 of the world's 10 fastest growing economies in the past decade have been African? Or that 7 of the fastest growing economies for the next five years are expected by the IMF to be from Africa?\"\n\nIf only the less dramatic stories could catch the attention of today\u2019s mile-a-minute viewers and readers: Ugandan woman can afford first cell phone. Nigerian man opens first bank account. Sierra Leone student finds employment. Kenya farmer buys crop insurance. It is these stories and the drivers behind them that excite us as investors. They may not sell newspapers or boost ratings, but they more accurately depict the transformation that is occurring on the African continent.\n\nThe drivers of this growth are numerous throughout the 55 countries that comprise this misunderstood continent. The three C\u2019s of Frontier Markets investing \u2013 consumption, construction, and commodities \u2013 are common drivers of growth throughout the continent. Likewise, technology has had transformative effects on economic growth as well as serving as a force to combat some of the political challenges that plagued the continent for much of the last century.\n\nAfrica is now open for business. For those investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the headline risk, opportunities abound.\n\nLaGuardia is co-founder and managing partner of LR Global, a Frontier Markets investment firm founded in 1997.
