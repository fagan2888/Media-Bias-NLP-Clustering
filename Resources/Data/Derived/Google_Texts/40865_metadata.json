Which was very nice.\"\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Perry performed at several pro-Obama rallies, including one in Milwaukee days before the election. Perry has also lent her support to promoting the Affordable Care Act, which Obama thanked her for via Twitter last summer.\n\nObama won the Badger State with 52.8 percent of the vote, while Romney garnered support from 45.9 percent of the state's voters.\n\nPerry also told GQ that if she has the chance, she'd like to share her views on aliens and astrology with the president.\n\n\"I look up into the stars and I imagine: How self-important are we to think that we are the only life-form?,\" she said. \"I mean, if my relationship with Obama gets any better, I'm going to ask him that question. It just hasn't been appropriate yet.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama With Celebrities Obama With Celebrities\n\n1 of 13 George Clooney & President Obama Actor George Clooney leaves after he spoke to the media March 15, 2012 at the White House in Washington, DC.
