The study covered a total of 63 episodes of RSE, nearly half of which were in women with a mean age of 57 years.Two thirds of these patients had no prior history of epilepsy. Patients had already been given two anti-epileptic drugs but their seizures returned. They were then given intravenous ketamine an infusion rate of 1mg/kg/hour after a loading dose.On average, their RSE duration was 3.01 days.
