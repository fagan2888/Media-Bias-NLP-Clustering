And he nearly picked a fight with Colts place-kicker Lou Michaels in a bar by saying legendary Baltimore quarterback Johnny Unitas was over the hill.\n\nNamath had been uttering verbal jabs because he took offense to oddsmakers listing his Jets as 18-point underdogs to the Colts. And also because, you know, the courage he felt from his good friend, Johnnie Walker.\n\nIt was Thursday, Jan. 9, 1969, and Namath was at the Miami Springs Villas because The Miami Touchdown Club was honoring him with its player of the year award. According to the biography \u201cNamath,\u201d a heckler yelled out \u201cSit down!\u201d in the midst of Nam- ath\u2019s acceptance speech.\n\nThat set up the most famous guarantee in sports history.\n\n\u201cThe Jets will win Sunday,\u201d Namath said. \u201cI guarantee it.\u201d\n\nThe next day, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle renamed \u201cThe Third World Championship Game\u201d as Super Bowl III.\n\nAnd two days later at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Namath completed 17-of-28 passes and led the Jets to a 16-7 victory over the Colts, the greatest upset in the history of professional football.\n\nAt 335 pounds, Terrance Knighton has little resemblance to Joe Namath, although the Broncos defensive tackle does have a goatee and he did make a boastful prediction last week by telling The Denver Post the Broncos were going to hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy at the end of this season, even if it meant going through New England to do it.\n\nEven if he didn\u2019t actually say the word \u201cguarantee,\u201d Knighton is familiar enough with sports history to know he had ventured into sacred \u2014 or should that be un- holy? \u2014 territory.\n\n\u201cYeah, he guaranteed it,\u201d Knighton said of Namath last week. \u201cThey won it. I mean, he\u2019s got a little bit more control of the game than I have.\n\n\u201cBut I believe when you declare guarantees you have to be at a certain level to say that. When you have a top-five defense and a top-five offense, and me being one of the reasons we have a top defense, I feel like I had the forum to say it.\u201d\n\nBacking up braggadocio\n\nMan has been squawking at his fellow man since the beginning of time. Cave man did not craft clubs for animals alone. During organized competitions, however, the 20th-century athlete was largely taught to be respectful of his opponent, humble about oneself.\n\nCassius Clay changed all that. For his heavyweight championship bout against menacing Sonny Liston in February 1964, Clay was an overwhelming underdog. Although an Olympic champion, Clay gained national prominence for his poetic pronouncements before his first fight with Liston.\n\n\u201cI predict that he will go in eight to prove that I\u2019m great,\u201d Clay said. \u201cIf he wants to go to heaven, I\u2019ll get him in seven. He\u2019ll be in a worser fix if I cut it to six.\u201d\n\nListon didn\u2019t answer the seventh-round bell. A nonconformist in a counterculture revolution, Clay took on the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali after that fight and continued to mock the likes of Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman \u2014 and usually backed up his braggadocio in the ring.\n\nAli made self-promotion popular.\n\n\u201cHe was the first one to win before the fight,\u201d Knighton said.\n\nThere have been many other proclamations of grandeur. Tim Tebow didn\u2019t make a guarantee so much as a promise after his Florida Gators were upset by Ole Miss in a 2008 game, spoiling the team\u2019s goal of an undefeated season. In his postgame news conference, Tebow first apologized to Florida fans, before continuing on with what has become succinctly known as The Promise.\n\n\u201cYou will never see someone push the rest of the team as hard as I will push everybody the rest of the season,\u201d Tebow said as he got rolling.\n\nFlorida won its next 10 games, including the national championship.\n\nBefore wide receiver Plaxico Burress accidentally shot away his career, he guaranteed during a Super Bowl media session that his underdog New York Giants would beat the undefeated New England Patriots. The Giants not only stunned the Patriots 17-14 in Super Bowl XLII, Burress caught the game-winning touchdown pass with only 35 seconds remaining.\n\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s easy to make a guarantee when there\u2019s only two teams standing,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere close to the Super Bowl when I made mine.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Broncos have some work to do before they can make a prophet of Knighton, starting with their game Monday night against the 9-4-1 Bengals in Cincinnati. But the most daunting challenge, should the Broncos get the chance to meet it, would be to beat the Patriots in New England, where coach Bill Belichick no doubt will have Knighton\u2019s statement shown on his power point.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if New England doesn\u2019t lose again,\u201d Knighton told The Denver Post after the Broncos defeated the Chargers 22-10 in San Diego last week. \u201cI don\u2019t care where we have to play. I don\u2019t care who our opponent is. We\u2019re not going to be satisfied until we hoist that trophy. So if we\u2019ve got to go to New England and win somewhere we\u2019re not used to winning, we\u2019re going to make it happen.\u201d\n\nThen, in case anyone missed his gist, Knighton said: \u201cWrite that!\u201d\n\nSince that statement, Knighton said 500 to 600 fans of the Patriots have let him have it on Twitter or Facebook. Which Knighton finds rather odd, considering that he grew up loving all of the Boston teams, including the Patriots.\n\n\u201cWe prefer not to incite\u201d\n\nSome guarantees have gone haywire. Before his Super Bowl XX game against the Chicago Bears, Patriots cornerback Raymond Clayborn said: \u201cWe are going to win this game. You can write that down. You can bank on it. The Bears are good, but we are better.\u201d\n\nThe Bears \u2014 and their famed 46 defense \u2014 destroyed the Patriots 46-10 at the Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nAfter Knighton\u2019s pledge, Broncos coach John Fox addressed the team and the individual. The tenor of Fox\u2019s message: Love the confidence, Pot Roast. And no doubt, winning the Super Bowl is the team\u2019s goal. But let\u2019s not distract from the primary focus, which this week is on Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cI think Terrance has a lot of confidence,\u201d said Peyton Manning, the Broncos\u2019 ever obedient quarterback. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good quality about him. As far as me, though, I\u2019m on to Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nTo a man, Knighton\u2019s provocative prediction has drawn support from the Denver locker room. And not just because he can force any one of his teammates to beg for mercy merely by sitting on them.\n\n\u201cThat is T; he does what he wants,\u201d said cornerback Aqib Talib.\n\nJack Del Rio, the Broncos\u2019 defensive coordinator, said he has seen bulletin-board material \u201cwake a guy up and inspire him. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here. I told him this when I was coach in Jacksonville \u2014 I told all our guys \u2014 if you have something to say, put your name by it.\n\n\u201cWe prefer not to incite our opponent. But beyond that, I\u2019m not going to micromanage each guy\u2019s comments.\u201d\n\nKnighton\u2019s pronouncement has made him a target, and if all goes well, he will have to carry around that bull\u2019s-eye for another four weeks \u2014 when the AFC championship game will be played, most likely in Foxborough, Mass.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that I play defense,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m the missile not the target, but it\u2019s an overall consensus in the locker room. Guys might not say it, but we all feel the same way: Super Bowl or bust, really.\u201d\n\nMore than 50 years since the man now called Ali predicted Liston\u2019s demise, and nearly 46 years since Namath guaranteed the Jets would prevail against the Colts, Broncos fans are hoping a man named Pot Roast does not have to eat his words.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Terrance Knighton latest to make bold sports prediction", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Terrance Knighton latest to make bold sports prediction", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/broncos-terrance-knighton-latest-to-make-bold-sports-prediction/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_095310_terrance-knighton.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_095310_terrance-knighton.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T19:32:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:33:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI guarantee it.\u201dThe next day, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle renamed \u201cThe Third World Championship Game\u201d as Super Bowl III.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if New England doesn\u2019t lose again,\u201d Knighton told The Denver Post after the Broncos defeated the Chargers 22-10 in San Diego last week.\nAnd no doubt, winning the Super Bowl is the team\u2019s goal.\nThe Giants not only stunned the Patriots 17-14 in Super Bowl XLII, Burress caught the game-winning touchdown pass with only 35 seconds remaining.\nBefore his Super Bowl XX game against the Chicago Bears, Patriots cornerback Raymond Clayborn said: \u201cWe are going to win this game."}
