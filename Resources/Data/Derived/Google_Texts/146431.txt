LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - Uber and Lyft drivers who work for the ride-sharing mobile apps have been banned from picking up passengers at Louisville International Airport.

The drivers are still allowed to drop off passengers. The mobile apps work by connecting passengers with nonprofessional drivers in several U.S. cities.

The Courier-Journal reports (http://cjky.it/1ClLmZz ) that airport officials recently informed Uber and Lyft that the companies must have permits issued by the state and city government to pick up airport passengers.

Airport spokeswoman Trish Burke says the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet and city of Louisville still need to develop appropriate regulations. Burke says that would probably include fees to operate at the airport.

The Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport also has prohibited pickups by Uber and Lyft.
