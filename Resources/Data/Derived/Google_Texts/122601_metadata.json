Susan Lynn, presidential politics and the ACM awards.\n\nLetters to the editor: letters@tennessean.com (Photo: The Tennessean.com)\n\nFeatured Letter\n\nLynn\u2019s excuses don\u2019t stand up\n\nRe: \"Tennessee lawmaker under heat for distributing anti-Muslim DVD,\" April 5.\n\nAs a resident of state Rep. Susan Lynn\u2019s District 57, I am embarrassed, angry and disgusted with her behavior and lack of sound judgment.\n\nPrior to the distribution of this hateful DVD discriminating against citizens of the great state of Tennessee, Representative Lynn has shown continual disrespect for her fellow citizens by voting against equal pay for equal work. In addition, she has a history of targeting members of the Muslim faith.\n\nLynn has consistently focused her attention on national issues rather than local issues that would help her constituents.\n\nHer excuse for distributing the DVD is reprehensible. She says she didn\u2019t watch it, was only helping out a constituent and, in fact, anyone could watch this on YouTube, according to Lynn. Unbelievable excuse.\n\nDid the dog eat her homework too? Does she plan on distributing a DVD on bomb making or cooking meth, because those are on YouTube too? Where is her integrity?\n\nDistrict 57 needs someone to run against Susan Lynn in the November election because she does not deserve another term based on her judgment and leadership.\n\nJeannette McNeil, Mount Juliet 37122\n\nElecting the least worst\n\nDo you believe in magic? Donald Trump has made lots of promises to deal with terrorism, the economy, immigrants, health care, and many other important issues. In the best style of a magician, he uses distraction, self-promotion and challenges but has little actual substance in his performance.\n\nDo you believe America should be governed by a Christian version of Sharia law? Ted Cruz\u2018s ultra-conservative stance on those of the Muslim faith reflects that, while eliminating access to health care for 13 million poor people through abolishing the Affordable Care Act. Pick him if you don\u2019t believe in our Constitutional freedoms.\n\nDo you believe college and health care should be free and readily available to all? Research shows that people appreciate and take better advantage of opportunities if they have \u201cskin in the game.\u201d If you truly believe Bernie can get his agenda approved by Congress, he\u2019s your man.\n\nDo you believe in continuing the track America has been on through the Obama years that the economy is improving to your satisfaction, that terrorism on our shores is being reasonably well-controlled, that our relationships with other countries are stronger now than ever, and that no secrets were revealed in spite of her poor judgment with her email servers? Hillary Clinton\u2019s your candidate.\n\nDo you believe America will be stronger and more respected in the eyes of the world in spite of the lack of respect the candidates show each other \u2014 and our sitting president?\n\nWho is the least worst of the candidates? Choose wisely.\n\nLes Hutchinson, Nashville 37221\n\nACM lacked 'country' music\n\nI watched the Academy of Country Music Awards show. Forty-five minutes into the program, I realized I had yet to hear a country song.\n\nI enjoy most genres of music. I just don\u2019t like BAD music. Most of the songs and performances I witnessed Sunday night were terrible, no matter what category you put them in.\n\nI understand that music evolves. Nothing stays the same. Although we embrace the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers, we also appreciate the influence they had on Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash and George Jones. They in turn influenced Alan Jackson, George Strait and Allison Krauss. I don\u2019t see that influence in any of the so-called country music of today.\n\nThe current crop of \u201ccountry\u201d singers seem to be influenced by rock and hip hop.\n\nI respect other people\u2019s taste in music, but don\u2019t try to pass off what Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Sam Hunt are doing as country music.\n\nLet\u2019s rename this current music as something other than country and move on.\n\nDennis Bieker, Spring Hill, 37174\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1N2jHmh", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers sound off on Rep.
