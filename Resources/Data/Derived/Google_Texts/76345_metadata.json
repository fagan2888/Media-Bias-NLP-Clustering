Unfortunately, no one knows this more than the world\u2019s children. Drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental death for children under 5. Award-winning photographer Seth Casteel, perhaps best known for his underwater dog photos, wanted to raise awareness about water safety and so produced a new underwater collection \u2014 this time featuring babies.\n\nInfants are not born with a natural ability to swim, but instead have a reflex known as the diving reflex, or bradycardic response, which helps them to appear to be swimming, Popular Science reported. The reflex is meant to help babies survive in water, but they need a bit of help to help cultivate the reflex into an actual skill.\n\nInfant swimming lessons are one of the most effective ways to prevent such an accident, and Seth Casteel\u2019s newest photography collection, \"Underwater Babies,\" hopes to inspire parents to teach their children this essential life skill.\n\n\"I hope these photos inspire a conversation among parents, which may present an opportunity to educate them about the lessons and the associated benefits,\" Casteel told The Huffington Post.\n\nClick \"View Slideshow\" to see his breathtaking photographs of babies ranging from 4.5 to 17 months of age.\n\nCasteel's Underwater Baby Collection is now available for purchase on Amazon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "water safety, child safety, swimming lessons", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Seth Casteel uses breathtaking photography to raise awareness of child water safety.", "title": "Babies Pose Underwater To Promote Swimming Safety [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/water-safety-subject-seth-casteels-underwater-babies-photo-project-328516", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/lorescasteelunderwaterbabies.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seth Casteel uses breathtaking photography to raise awareness of child water safety.", "title": "Babies Pose Underwater To Promote Swimming Safety [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/water-safety-subject-seth-casteels-underwater-babies-photo-project-328516", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/lorescasteelunderwaterbabies.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/lorescasteelunderwaterbabies.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-08T15:43:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-09T10:25:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Seth Casteel uses breathtaking photography to raise awareness of child water safety."}, "article_summary": "Award-winning photographer Seth Casteel, perhaps best known for his underwater dog photos, wanted to raise awareness about water safety and so produced a new underwater collection \u2014 this time featuring babies.\nThe reflex is meant to help babies survive in water, but they need a bit of help to help cultivate the reflex into an actual skill.\nInfant swimming lessons are one of the most effective ways to prevent such an accident, and Seth Casteel\u2019s newest photography collection, \"Underwater Babies,\" hopes to inspire parents to teach their children this essential life skill.\nCasteel's Underwater Baby Collection is now available for purchase on Amazon.\nClick \"View Slideshow\" to see his breathtaking photographs of babies ranging from 4.5 to 17 months of age."}
