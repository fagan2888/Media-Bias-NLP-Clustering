You might call it a classic example of holiday jeer.

Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, facing a tough re-election battle next year, emailed supporters this week with a Christmas-themed audio announcement that takes a few pot shots at his challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes.

The one-minute recording, titled “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas” features McConnell reciting, in sing-song fashion, a rhyming poem about the shortcomings of Democrats, President Obama and Grimes.

“‘Twas the night before Christmas, four years ago. Liberals wanted Obamacare, but Kentucky said no,'” McConnell says in the announcement.

“‘If you like your plan, you can keep it,' they said with a twinkle in their eye. Newspapers now say that was the year's biggest lie. Higher taxes, more spending, sky-high record debt. Obama's war on coal — had enough, yet?”

“So Obama wondered: Who's my Kentucky candidate for these times? And guess who it goes to? Alison Lundergan Grimes,” he adds.

In his southern monotone baritone, the 71-year-old Minority Leader goes on to recite: “The differences are stark and your choice will be clear, you’ll make your decision in November next year.”

The holiday-themed declaration follows the McConnell campaign’s successful “What rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes” YouTube video, from July, which went viral and had politicos across the country singing the short’s catchy hook.

McConnell faces a tight race against Grimes, the 35-year-old Kentucky Secretary of State, to hold on to his seat. A PPP poll released last week shows him up only one percentage point — 43% to 42% — over Grimes.
