Roger Ebert

Magnolia Pictures released a trailer for “Life Itself,” a documentary about the decades-long career and broad influence of the late film critic Roger Ebert.

The film is based on Ebert’s bestselling memoir of the same title and is directed by Steve James, who also directed the seminal 1994 basketball documentary “Hoop Dreams.” Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian are its executive producers. The story covers the ups and downs of Ebert’s life, from his days as a newspaper columnist and novelist to his partnership with fellow critic Gene Siskel on television to revealing his diagnosis with cancer in 2005.

“Life Itself” opens in theaters July4. Watch the trailer.
