Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said ahead of the vote Monday that the NLRB is critical to preserving the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWe need to fill a soon to be open seat to ensure the board continues to function properly,\u201d Harkin said. \"She will be a great asset to the board.\"\n\nMcFerran formerly worked for Harking on the HELP Committee.\n\nMcFerran will replace Nancy Schiffer, whose term expires Dec. 16. Her confirmation ensures that the NLRB will retain the 3-2 Democratic majority.\n\nJeffery Baran was also confirmed Monday on a 52-40 vote to be a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).\n\nAnd the Senate confirmed Ellen Dudley Williams to be director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy at the Department of Energy by voice-vote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Senate confirmed three of President Obama\u2019s executive nominations on Monday, including a member of the National Labor Relations Board.", "description": "The Senate confirmed three of President Obama\u2019s executive nominations on Monday, including a member of the National Labor Relations Board.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Senate confirmed three of President Obama\u2019s executive nominations on Monday, including a member of the National Labor Relations Board.", "title": "Senate Dems confirm NLRB nominee before GOP take over", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/226369-senate-dems-confirm-nlrb-nominee-before-gop-take-over", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-08T18:19:06-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-08T18:19-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/226369-senate-dems-confirm-nlrb-nominee-before-gop-take-over", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-08T18:18-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ramsey Cox", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Ramsey Cox", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Labor Relations Board, Tom Harkin,Lauren McGarity McFerran,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-08T18:18:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T18:19:06-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/226369-senate-dems-confirm-nlrb-nominee-before-gop-take-over", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Senate confirmed three of President Obama\u2019s executive nominations on Monday, including a member of the National Labor Relations Board.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate Dems confirm NLRB nominee before GOP take over"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate Dems confirm NLRB nominee before GOP take over"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc48\"", "article_summary": "And the Senate confirmed Ellen Dudley Williams to be director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy at the Department of Energy by voice-vote.\nThe Senate confirmed three of President Obama\u2019s executive nominations on Monday.\nThe Senate voted 54-40 to confirm Lauren McGarity McFerran to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces federal labor laws.\nChairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said ahead of the vote Monday that the NLRB is critical to preserving the U.S. economy.\nJeffery Baran was also confirmed Monday on a 52-40 vote to be a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)."}
