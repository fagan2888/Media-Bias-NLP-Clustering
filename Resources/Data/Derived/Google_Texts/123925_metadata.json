American Atheists hopes to use the forum to tap into the conservative movement and bring conservative atheists \u201cout of the closet.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as there are many closeted atheists in the church pews, I am extremely confident that there are many closeted atheists in the ranks of conservatives,\" said David Silverman, president of American Atheists.\n\nSilverman said coming to CPAC will be \u201cthe first step of many\u201d in reaching out to Republicans.\n\nFollow @danmericacnn Follow @CNNbelief\n\n\u201cIt is really a serious outreach effort, and I am very pleased to be embarking on it,\u201d Silverman said.\n\nThe group\u2019s inclusion is believed to be the first time that atheists have been involved in the conservative political gathering that has long been associated with Christian conservatives.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Committee, the largest and oldest gathering of conservatives, is run by the American Conservative Union and will be held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor in Maryland from March 6 to 8. Last year, the event brought together thousands of activists to listen to dozens of Republican leaders speak about everything from economics and foreign policy to social issues. The event has long been considered a required stop for Republican presidential hopefuls.\n\nMeghan Snyder, spokeswoman for CPAC, said American Atheists were included in the confab because \u201cconservatives have always stood for freedom of religion and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe folks we have been working with stand for many of the same liberty-oriented policies and principles we stand for,\u201d Snyder said in an e-mail to CNN.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Christian conservative think-tank Family Research Council, doesn't see it that way. In an email to CNN, a rankled Perkins wrote that the atheist group does \"not seek to add their voice to the chorus of freedom.\"\n\n\"CPAC's mission is to be an umbrella for conservative organizations that advance liberty, traditional values and our national defense,\" said Perkins, who spokes at CPAC in 2012. \"Does the American Conservative Union really think the liberties and values they seek to preserve can be maintained when they partner with individuals and organizations that are undermining the understanding that our liberties come from God? Thomas Jefferson warned against such nonsense.\"\n\nThe social conservative leader added: \"If this is where the ACU is headed, they will have to pack up and put away the 'C' in CPAC!\"\n\nIn explaining why the group decided to join CPAC, Silverman cited a 2012 Pew Research study that found 20% of self-identified conservatives consider themselves religiously unaffiliated. While that does not mean they are atheists, Silverman believes learning more about atheism will make it more likely conservatives will choose to identify with those who believe there is no God.\n\n\u201cConservative isn\u2019t a synonym for religious,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cI am not worried about making the Christian right angry. The Christian right should be angry that we are going in to enlighten conservatives. The Christian right should be threatened by us.\u201d\n\nAmerican Atheists paid $3,000 for booth 439 in the event\u2019s exhibition hall. Their booth will be right next to the Republican National Committee's booth, according to the room map.\n\nAmerican Atheists is known as the in-your-face contingent in the world of atheist activists, and the group\u2019s members pride themselves as being the \u201cMarines\" of the atheist movement.\n\nThe group has long targeted Republican lawmakers, although Silverman considers the organization nonpartisan.\n\nIn 2013, American Atheists launched a billboard campaign against three Republican politicians: former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. All three Republicans have spoken at CPAC in the past.\n\nIn one billboard, Santorum is pictured to the left of a quote attributed to him. \u201cOur civil laws have to comport with a higher law. God\u2019s law,\u201d the quote reads. Underneath the graphic is a tagline: \"GO GODLESS INSTEAD.\"\n\nThe group has also prided itself on trying to reach into religious communities and bring people out of the closet. In 2012, American Atheists asked Jews and Muslims to come out of the closet in a targeted billboard campaign.\n\nIn addition to Silverman, Amanda Knief, American Atheist\u2019s managing director, and Dave Muscato, the group\u2019s spokesman, will attend CPAC. Silverman said they will be prepared to respond to questions from conference attendees.\n\nUPDATE: CPAC reversed their decision and will not allow American Atheists to have an exhibition booth at the conservative conference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Dan Merica, CNN Washington (CNN) - American Atheists, an outspoken organization that advocates for atheists nationwide, will have a booth at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Atheists plan conservative outreach with booth at CPAC", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/25/atheists-plan-conservative-outreach-with-booth-at-cpac/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2012/images/03/24/march24.atheism.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Dan Merica, CNN\r\n\r\nWashington (CNN) - American Atheists, an outspoken organization that advocates for atheists nationwide, will have a booth at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference.", "title": "Atheists plan conservative outreach with booth at CPAC"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "atheism, politics,", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/25/atheists-plan-conservative-outreach-with-booth-at-cpac/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4015\"", "article_summary": "UPDATE: CPAC reversed their decision and will not allow American Atheists to have an exhibition booth at the conservative conference.\nBy Dan Merica, CNNWashington (CNN) \u2013 American Atheists, an outspoken organization that advocates for atheists nationwide, will have a booth at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference.\nIn 2012, American Atheists asked Jews and Muslims to come out of the closet in a targeted billboard campaign.\nTheir booth will be right next to the Republican National Committee's booth, according to the room map.\nIn addition to Silverman, Amanda Knief, American Atheist\u2019s managing director, and Dave Muscato, the group\u2019s spokesman, will attend CPAC."}
