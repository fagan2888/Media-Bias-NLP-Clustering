He said the president \"needs to put politics aside\" in dealing with Republican lawmakers. (AP)\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) outlined his priorities at a news conference following the midterm elections that swept many Republicans into Congress. He said the president \"needs to put politics aside\" in dealing with Republican lawmakers. (AP)\n\nRepublicans openly gloated Thursday about their sweeping midterm victories and said they can finally pass legislation long opposed by President Obama and Democrats.\n\nDuring a post-election briefing, Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Senate Democrats hurt themselves during this year\u2019s midterm elections by not using President Obama more on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThey sidelined their best messenger,\u201d he said. The irony, of course, is that Republicans used the hugely unpopular Obama against Democrats in almost every crucial contest.\n\nAnd Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) basked in the glow of what will be the largest House majority in the modern era by laying out his plans to pass legislation that he said would signal \u201ca new start\u201d on Capitol Hill. But nothing he proposed doing is actually new.\n\nAt his first post-election news conference, Boehner said there will be quick action to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, passage of a veterans\u2019 employment bill and proposals to strip apart the Affordable Care Act, including a repeal of a tax on medical devices and an independent review board of medical experts.\n\nBoehner was especially emphatic on immigration, warning President Obama against taking executive action to revamp the nation\u2019s immigration laws. Boehner said that if Obama acted unilaterally, there would be \u201cno chance\u201d for a broader congressional debate on the subject.\n\nTaken together, Boehner\u2019s litany of legislative proposals and his warning to Obama signaled that he saw little need to extend an olive branch to Democrats.\n\n\u201cMy job\u2019s not to get along with the president just to get along with him \u2014 although we actually have a nice relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, my job is to listen to my members and listen to the American people and make their priorities my priorities.\u201d\n\nBoehner conceded that a full repeal of the health law is unlikely given the makeup of the Senate, but he added that, \u201cJust because we may not be able to get everything we want doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try to get what we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate to take some of these issues out of Obamacare,\u201d he added later. \u201cWe need to put them on the president\u2019s desk and make him choose.\u201d\n\nBoehner was notably less conciliatory in his remarks than Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who suggested Wednesday that there might be room for bipartisan agreement on economic issues.\n\nThe victorious political team that orchestrated the Republican Senate wins across the country was talking about more than just its own triumphs, willingly offering critiques about the Democrats\u2019 failed game plan.\n\nCollins, the NRSC executive director, cited Colorado, where Rep. Cory Gardner (R) unseated Sen. Mark Udall (D) and where he said Democrats had failed to talk about how the state\u2019s unemployment rate declined under Obama\u2019s watch. Instead, Udall focused relentlessly on criticizing Gardner\u2019s positions on abortion and contraception.\n\n\u201cThey left their base behind,\u201d Collins said.\n\nCollins and his colleagues said the effectiveness of their get-out-the-vote operation was impressive, especially when compared with the outsize attention paid to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s $60 million, 11-state ground operation code named the \u201cBannock Street Project,\u201d after the location of the Denver field headquarters for the 2010 campaign of Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who chaired the DSCC this year.\n\nNRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring lampooned the Democrats\u2019 turnout, calling it \u201cThe New Coke\u201d of the 2014 cycle.\n\nWard Baker, the NRSC\u2019s political director, said party operatives were especially mindful of their recent history of candidate gaffes.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just win this election on Tuesday. It started a year ago by deciding we couldn\u2019t be Akin\u2019d anymore. No more witches. No more gaffes,\u201d he said.\n\nBaker was referring to Todd Akin in 2012 and Christine O\u2019Donnell in 2010 \u2014 disastrous GOP Senate nominees in Missouri and Delaware, respectively, who sunk the party\u2019s chances of winning states that had been poised to flip.\n\nRepublicans have picked up seven seats thus far and could gain two more. In Alaska, Republican Dan Sullivan leads Sen. Mark Begich (D) as additional votes are still being counted. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) faces a Dec. 6 run-off against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R). Pre-election polls have shown Cassidy in the lead.\n\nThe DSCC confirmed Thursday that it has canceled some of the advertising time it had reserved for Landrieu.\n\nNRSC officials said they will have the funds to compete as needed in Louisiana despite having about $9 million in debt.\n\nJose A.
