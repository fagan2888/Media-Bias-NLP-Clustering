She went into it during a heavy training block designed to build her up to peak at the world championships, Aug. 2-9 in Kazan, Russia.\n\n\u201cIn the collegiate season, you fully taper in March for NCAAs, which as a professional athlete you don\u2019t do,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWe fully tapered in March, and then you have to bring that endurance back up.\u201d\n\nIn an Arena Pro Swim Series meet June 19-21in Santa Clara, Calif., Franklin finished third in three events, sixth in one and eighth in another.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting a whole lot out of Santa Clara,\u201d Franklin said last week. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever raced that tired before, but that was exactly the point. I was only going to have one more meet until worlds; I didn\u2019t need to be winning things there. I didn\u2019t need to be doing my best times there. That being said, it\u2019s still hard not doing that. Getting three third places, I wasn\u2019t happy with that.\n\n\u201cBut I also need to take things into consideration and put things in perspective. My strokes felt strong, I was just exhausted. There was no speed there. But that, to me, shows me how hard I\u2019ve been working. That, in itself, gives me confidence. Now it\u2019s really fun, getting closer to worlds and starting to build up that speed a little bit and feel it in practice.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it might have been a good sign that she raced as well as she did, as tired as she was.\n\n\u201cIt honestly was,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAt the time it didn\u2019t feel like it. To be at that level in any sport, you have that competitiveness, so when you finish like that you\u2019re not happy with it. But over the past couple weeks I\u2019m kind of letting it sit, going back, looking at results. There are some really good things that happened there. It gave me confidence and made me proud that I was working so hard, I was still giving my all in the pool, knowing that there was still a lot there.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Missy Franklin wasn\u2019t happy with Santa Clara pro meet results, but was racing tired", "title": "Missy Franklin wasn\u2019t happy with Santa Clara pro meet results, but was racing tired", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/19/missy-franklin-wasnt-happy-with-santa-clara-pro-meet-results-but-was-racing-tired/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718__franklinp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718__franklinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T09:50:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:11:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Missy Franklin goes into the upcoming world championships having had only one meet since turning pro after the NCAA championships in March, and that meet didn\u2019t go so well.\nShe went into it during a heavy training block designed to build her up to peak at the world championships, Aug. 2-9 in Kazan, Russia.\nI was only going to have one more meet until worlds; I didn\u2019t need to be winning things there.\nI didn\u2019t need to be doing my best times there.\n\u201cIn the collegiate season, you fully taper in March for NCAAs, which as a professional athlete you don\u2019t do,\u201d Franklin said."}
