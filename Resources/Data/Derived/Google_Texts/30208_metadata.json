Diane Black, R-Tenn., who introduced what\u2019s called a \u201cresolution of disapproval\u201d on Monday that, with the support of both chambers of Congress and the president, would override the law in question.\n\n\u201cI hope both chambers of Congress will act swiftly to pass our resolution so that we can stop this ill-conceived law and restore needed protections for those in the pro-life community who call D.C. home,\u201d she said.\n\n>>> Read More: Should Pro-Life Organizations Be Forced to Hire Pro-Choice Employees?\n\nA second bill, called the Human Rights Amendment Act (HRAA), seeks to prohibit religious-affiliated schools from discriminating against gay and lesbian student groups.\n\nConservatives argue this policy would infringe on the ability of private schools to operate according to their religious beliefs. For example, they say it could force a Catholic school to support a student-led gay pride parade despite the school\u2019s stance on homosexuality.\n\nRep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., led the effort against that measure today by introducing a separate resolution of disapproval.\n\n\u201cBy passing this Act, the D.C. City Council has infringed on the fundamental right of religious freedom,\u201d Hartzler told The Daily Signal. \u201cAmericans are protected by the Constitution from being forced by their government to take actions that go against their religious beliefs. Forcing religious schools to go against their beliefs goes directly against our Constitution and shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Study Committee\u2014with its 170 members\u2014is backing both efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that employers should be forced to pay for policies that go against their deeply held religious beliefs, yet that is exactly what the District of Columbia\u2019s legislation would do,\u201d said Rep. Bill Flores, who chairs the committee.\n\nCongress has an obligation to act and exercise its constitutional authority to prevent this flagrant violation of religious freedom. I commend Congressman Black and my colleagues in the Republican Study Committee for joining me in this important fight to preserve and protect our most sacred founding values.\n\nThe power to oversee Washington D.C. legislation was granted to Congress under the U.S. Constitution and the Home Rule Act of 1973.\n\nThe Senate has already introduced resolutions of disapproval for both the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act and the Human Rights Amendment Act under the leadership of Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and James Lankford, R-Okla.\n\n>>> Read More: Cruz, Lankford Move to Protect Religious Freedom of D.C. Private Schools, Organizations\n\nBoth measures were signed into law by Washington D.C.\u2019s Mayor, Muriel Bowser, earlier this year. Her office did not immediately respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment regarding the pushback among Republicans in Congress.\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., who supports both bills, released a press release today calling the Republican attempt to strike down the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act an \u201castonishing infringement of an individual\u2019s right to personal liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe District\u2019s local law supports the local interests of D.C. residents who do not want to answer to their employers or anyone else for their reproductive choices,\u201d she said. \u201cDisapproval of the D.C. bill by Congress would signal that the constitutional right to privacy has come under historic attack.\u201d\n\nNorton has not yet commented on Republicans\u2019 attempt to also kill the Human Rights Amendment Act, although she previously stated that the \u201canti-discrimination legislation\u201d is needed to \u201cprotect students from discrimination for their sexual orientation at their own schools and universities.\u201d\n\nNorton also maintains that with these bills, there is \u201cno intent to violate the rights of others, such as freedom of religion.\u201d\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, believe it is especially important to prohibit these policies given that Washington D.C. is home to some of the largest pro-life and faith-based organizations in the world, including the Susan B. Anthony List, March for Life, the Family Research Council, and the Archdiocese of Washington.\n\nBut even if they are successful in passing both resolutions through Congress, Republicans would still need the president\u2019s signature to prevent them from going into law. Right now, it is unclear whether President Obama would support that effort should they reach his desk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of conservative lawmakers in Congress are attempting to stop what they call \u201cill-conceived\u201d legislation from taking effect in the nation\u2019s capital.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of conservative lawmakers in Congress are attempting to stop what they call \u201cill-conceived\u201d legislation from taking effect in the nation\u2019s capital.", "title": "Conservatives Rally Against DC \u2018Anti-Discrimination\u2019 Bills", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DC_Antidiscrimination_041414.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-15T15:07:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1E0EdPp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of conservative lawmakers in Congress are attempting to stop what they call \u201cill-conceived\u201d legislation from taking effect in the nation\u2019s capital.", "title": "Conservatives Rally Against DC \u2018Anti-Discrimination\u2019 Bills", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/DC_Antidiscrimination_041414.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life,religious freedom", "published_time": "2015-04-14T21:52:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T15:07:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion, laws, dc abortion laws, religious freedom, human rights amendment act, reproductive health non-discrimination act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb839\"", "article_summary": "The power to oversee Washington D.C. legislation was granted to Congress under the U.S. Constitution and the Home Rule Act of 1973.\nForcing religious schools to go against their beliefs goes directly against our Constitution and shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201dThe Republican Study Committee\u2014with its 170 members\u2014is backing both efforts.\nOne bill, called the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act, could force pro-life employers in Washington D.C. to hire individuals whose reproductive health decisions stand in opposition to the organization\u2019s viewpoint.\n\u201cBy passing this Act, the D.C.
