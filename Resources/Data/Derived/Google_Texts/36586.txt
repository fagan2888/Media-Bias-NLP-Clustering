RICHMOND — The Virginia House of Delegates passed emergency legislation Friday to make a widely supported fix to prevent some small businesses from facing higher costs for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

In a 97-0 vote, the House approved a bill to stop businesses with 51 to 100 employees from facing higher premiums by being moved this year into the small group insurance market, which currently applies to businesses with up to 50 employees. Federal lawmakers had already approved the tweak, which President Barack Obama signed into law last year.

House Bill 58, patroned by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, was supported by both the Virginia Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation for Independent Businesses.

“At a time when so many small businesses are struggling, we have to do everything we can to provide relief and certainty,” Speaker of the House Bill Howell, R-Stafford, said in a written statement. “This bipartisan bill will protect small businesses from another premium spike and will ensure their employees can keep their healthcare plans.”

Before the vote, House Minority Leader David Toscano, D-Charlottesville, rose to voice his support.

“It does prove again that occasionally Congress and the president can work together to fix some things that need to get fixed,” Toscano said. “When we focus on trying to fix things as opposed to trying to repeal things willy-nilly, we can get some good things done.”

Other states have been able to enact the fix through executive action. Legislation was required in Virginia because the implementation of the health care law is overseen by the Bureau of Insurance.

The House adjourned for the weekend late Friday morning.
