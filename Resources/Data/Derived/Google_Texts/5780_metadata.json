The Old English mastiff is wearing Voyce, a collar that monitors a pet\u2019s health signs. (Evy Mages/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)\n\nThe International CES expo in Las Vegas, which kicks off Tuesday, has long been the site of new technology announcements and gadget demonstrations. This year, about 55 Washington area companies plan to exhibit at the show, up slightly from last year\u2019s 53.\n\nThe group represents one of the most diverse that the region has sent to Las Vegas, said Jeff Joseph, senior vice president for communications with the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on the show.\n\nProducts to be showcased include dog collars that can \u00admonitor a pet\u2019s heart rate, high-end speakers, speech-recognition software, and apps allowing homeowners to monitor and control appliances in their homes using their smartphones.\n\nHere is a look at seven local companies that are exhibiting at CES.\n\nI4C Innovations\n\nA newly formed subsidiary of Intersections, a software company working to prevent identity theft, i4C Innovations in Chantilly, Va., specializes in pet-related technology. The company plans to show off a collar that can monitor a dog\u2019s health and vital signs, collect analytics about the animal\u2019s behavior, and store it as digital health records.\n\nThe collar \u2014 called \u201cVoyce\u201d \u2014 uses sensors to monitor breathing, heart rate and location, among other data points, which can then be wirelessly sent to an owner or a vet.\n\n\u201cThe premise is [that] dogs suffer from 80 percent of the same diseases people do, and the reality of the situation is dogs can\u2019t talk,\u201d chief executive Jeff Noce said. \u201cWhen they go into a vet, vets are relying upon subjective information about how the dog is doing from the owners.Vets on an annual visit will see them for 20 minutes. When dogs go into a vet clinic, they suffer from \u2018white-coat syndrome,\u2019 so they get very stressed.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to charge a fee for the actual band \u2014 about $299 \u2014 and a monthly subscription fee of about $15 a month.\n\nTelcare\n\nBethesda-based Telcare\u2019s blood glucose monitor sends a patient\u2019s health data into the Internet cloud, accessible through a smartphone app. With the meter, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, users can grant access to their physicians or health-care professionals, who can check the patient\u2019s progress in real time.\n\nXoWi\n\nXoWi (pronounced \u201cZoe\u201d) is a speech-recognition device that users can wear around their necks, translating spoken commands into virtual ones. A user might tell XoWi to send a text, look up an address or make a call \u2014 similar to the Siri feature in iPhones, although XoWi\u2019s platform is open, meaning independent developers can use it to integrate with other apps. XoWi connects wirelessly to smartphones through Bluetooth.\n\n\u201cThe idea is you don\u2019t have to look at it \u2014 the point of speech and voice is you\u2019re able to do things without your hands and eyes,\u201d said Ahmed Bouzid, president and chief executive of McLean-based XoWi. Bouzid said the technology will be especially helpful to visually impaired smartphone users.\n\nBouzid has already established a relationship with a manufacturer in China, but he is holding off on mass production until XoWi raises more funds. Until then, he and his team are refining the prototype. \u201cOur goal [at CES] is to get a reaction from people about the idea itself \u2014 it\u2019s marketing,\u201d he said.\n\nOmniSpeech\n\nOmniSpeech\u2019s software, designed to be embedded in mobile devices and apps, aims to suppress noise and enhance speech and sound quality. Carol Espy-Wilson, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Maryland who developed the software and is chief executive of the College Park company, plans to demonstrate the technology at CES by making an Internet-based voice call, switching Omni\u00adSpeech on and off so listeners can hear the difference in sound quality.\n\nThis will be her first time exhibiting at CES. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping we will establish several business partners as well as customers,\u201d she said. By next year, Espy-Wilson\u00ad said she hopes to embed her technology in hearing aids.\n\nSimpliciKey\n\nWith SimpliciKey, homeowners can remotely control physical locks through their smartphones or computers. The Herndon, Va., company is unveiling new features for its mobile app, called KeyCloud. For instance, users will be able to set doors to lock at the same time every day, check the battery status of SimpliciKey locks, and check the history of who has accessed KeyCloud locks.\n\nGoldenEar\n\nSpecializing in high-end audio speaker systems, GoldenEar Technology plans to present its newest set of speakers, which are called Triton One and cost $5,000 a pair.\n\nLast year, the company demonstrated its least-expensive speakers \u2014 the Triton Seven \u2014 at about $700 a pair, said Sandy Gross, chief executive of the Stevenson, Md.-based company. \u201cOur positioning is we make high-end affordable.\u201d\n\nBut this time, Gross said he plans to show off the more expensive pair with built-in subwoofers to highlight GoldenEar\u2019s signature technology.\n\n\u201cFor us, CES is a very important show to meet with dealers,\u201d he said.\n\nPriceSpotting\n\nBlue Tiger Ventures, based in Northwest Washington, is debuting a new shopping-comparison app that relies on users to help it keep track of the cost of everyday goods at local stores, rewarding them with cash for their participation.\n\nHillcrest Labs:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "onit, CES, international CES, Intersections, dog technology, wearable technology, Telcare, McLean, College Park, Hernon, Consumer Electronics Show", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "This year is one of the storngest historically for representation from Washington-area tech companies.", "title": "What greater Washington has to show at CES 2014", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/washington-area-tech-companies-to-show-off-their-gadgets-at-international-ces/2014/01/05/74b863cc-7237-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/02/National-Economy/Images/_MG_24191388693587.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ravindranize"}, "description": "This year is one of the storngest historically for representation from Washington-area tech companies.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-it/washington-area-tech-companies-to-show-off-their-gadgets-at-international-ces/2014/01/05/74b863cc-7237-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "onit, CES, international CES, Intersections, dog technology, wearable technology, Telcare, McLean, College Park, Hernon, Consumer Electronics Show", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "74b863cc-7237-11e3-8def-a33011492df2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9806\"", "article_summary": "This year, about 55 Washington area companies plan to exhibit at the show, up slightly from last year\u2019s 53.\nGoldenEarSpecializing in high-end audio speaker systems, GoldenEar Technology plans to present its newest set of speakers, which are called Triton One and cost $5,000 a pair.\nI4C InnovationsA newly formed subsidiary of Intersections, a software company working to prevent identity theft, i4C Innovations in Chantilly, Va., specializes in pet-related technology.\n(Evy Mages/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)The International CES expo in Las Vegas, which kicks off Tuesday, has long been the site of new technology announcements and gadget demonstrations.\nHere is a look at seven local companies that are exhibiting at CES."}
