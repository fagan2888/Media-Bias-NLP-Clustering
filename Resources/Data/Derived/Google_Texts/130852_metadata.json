But there was real wisdom in what she said. I mean, her words were illuminating about the nature of tyranny, but wise none-the-less. That\u2019s because when Congress pushed through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the most important thing they did was set up a system with massive amounts of power granted to the administrative state. It is that administrative state that tells us what\u2019s in Obamacare, not Congress. And we\u2019ll be learning all about what\u2019s in Obamacare until it dies or the republic ends.\n\nLet me explain. I know the Constitution is super-old but it\u2019s all about separation of powers. You have the legislature for making laws, the executive for enforcing laws and the judiciary for judging cases, right? Good. So each branch is supposed to watch over the other so as to check abuses of power and what not.\n\nThe administrative state is what happens when you get rid of Constitutional governance on the sly and put all the powers into a single agency. Congress sets up administrative agencies and then gives them the power to issue law-like rules called regulations, enforce these rigorous regulations and judge infractions. Why would Congress give up all its power? Why not? They love the administrative state. They can get the administrative state to grow the government dramatically without ever having to be held accountable for the individual rules limiting liberty. Heck, we have hardly a clue about the regulations pouring out of these (increasingly militarized) agencies every day. The better question is why the people have gone along with it. But we\u2019ll leave that question aside for now.\n\nA great example of this administrative state in action, among the many great examples of this, is the Health and Human Services Department mandate requiring employers to provide birth control for free, including some forms of birth control that can work by ending human life after it\u2019s begun. This was not in the original legislation passed by Congress over the vociferous objections of the people. This was something that came out of an administrative state set-up \u2014 a packed panel that was given authority to recommend certain things that employers would be forced to provide insurance plan coverage of. HHS issued regulations with the requirement and included a religious exemption so minor that Jesus himself wouldn\u2019t have been exempted.\n\nThis mandate has been presented by a slavish and servile media as being necessary to address a crisis of inadequate \u201caccess\u201d to contraceptives in the country. I know that the most important thing many Americans can think of right now is how to make sure women are either deluged with hormones to keep their wombs barren or have surgery in the event they are, in the President\u2019s own words, \u201cpunished with a child.\u201d But the notion that generally inexpensive and beyond-widely available products must be provided by employers at no cost to employees would be silly even if many employers didn\u2019t have serious religious objections. The idea that four abortion-inducing drugs must be covered at no cost to employees but not glasses, insulin, growth hormones or eleventy billion other things is bizarre. Of course, the administrative state probably will get to that point, but for now the contraceptives, sterilization and abortion drugs are just the beginning. And they were the beginning, in all likelihood, because of the political advantage of manufacturing the much-needed War on Women silliness that helped obscure reality in the 2012 election.\n\nBut many employers do have serious objections and they\u2019ve been winning court battles. In late June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a company that had argued the government had violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act by forcing it to fund abortion-inducing birth control drugs. The court said that the government had failed to meet the test of \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d for achieving its goals. And then a non-profit college was given a preliminary injunction against the mandate while its case works its way through the courts.\n\nSo now the Obama administration, in a Friday night document dump, released it\u2019s 8th (!) revision of the mandate in question. Pass the bill to learn what\u2019s in it indeed!\n\nAccording to the very helpful James Capretta, the new rules have two parts:\n\n1) They change the procedure for granting an \u201caccommodation\u201d for religious non-profits. Where the administration had previously tried to call one accounting gimmick an \u201caccommodation,\u201d to the general dismay of religious liberty advocates, they think a new accounting gimmick will solve their quandary. It doesn\u2019t even come close. In both cases the employer has to do the thing it won\u2019t do \u2014 provide drugs that can act as abortifacients. In the previous regime, they had to sign a form saying they objected and then submit it to the insurer, who would then act as if nothing had happened. In this regime, that note would go to HHS and HHS would tell the insurer to go on as before. Big whoop. This does nothing to address the concerns of the Little Sisters of the Poor, Wheaton College, and the 120-some other non-profit plaintiffs suing over this administrative state ruling.\n\n2) Closely-held for-profits could use the same accommodation. There are 193 for-profit plaintiffs suing over the mandate at this time.\n\nThe documents came out on a Friday night, which is telling, but already they seem to be landing with a thud. Religious liberty policy analyst Sarah Torre says \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s latest bureaucratic tweak to the mandate would only replace one bad regulation with another.\u201d Arina Grossu, Director for the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council, says:\n\n\u201cWhat remains an insulting accounting gimmick does not protect the rights of Americans with sincere conscientious objections. It is simply another clerical layer to an already existing accounting gimmick that does nothing to protect religious freedom because the employer still remains the legal gateway by which these drugs and services will be provided to their employees. It\u2019s very disappointing that the Obama administration is doubling down on its plans to punish charities and non-profits that assist the poor and homeless, who in some cases have nowhere else to turn for assistance.\u201d\n\nAnd Lori Windham, Senior Counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty says:\n\nUnder pressure from hundreds of lawsuits, the government continues to retreat. After three losses in the Supreme Court and dozens of losses in courts below, the government continues to confuse the issues. The government issued over 70 pages of regulations, when all it needed to do was read the First Amendment.\n\nThese threats to religious liberty are real and serious. But what makes them even more alarming is that they exist because, as Capretta writes, they \u201cpurposely wrote a coercive and overbearing HHS mandate rule to create a political issue. The president\u2019s campaign team wanted objections to the rule because the objectors could then be demonized as waging a \u2018war on women.\u2019 That would presumably help drive Obama supporters to the polls in 2012.\u201d\n\nAs the administration has lost battle after battle after battle in the courts \u2014 and with legal challenges piling up \u2014 now it\u2019s trying to figure a way out. Capretta says that the administration is trying to come up with a way to tell courts that employers with religious objections no longer have a case while also assuring a left-wing base it hasn\u2019t really backed down since everyone still gets free contraceptives. \u201cMagically, the insurance plans that work with the objecting employers will be required to provide the products and services to the employees \u2014 for free.\u201d\n\nThis rule change would do nothing and one can only suspect that this weak sauce effort is so laughable precisely because the White House wants to remind low-information single female voters about administrative state freebies that come at the expense of religious liberty and a healthy society.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 25 Aug 2014 08:13:25 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "HHS releases 8th revision to legally troubled birth control rule.
