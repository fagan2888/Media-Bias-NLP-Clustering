Below are a sampling of some of the responses--modified to fit a family publication. Have a hearty chuckle.\n\n\n\nFeel free to add your own on this Presidents' Day week end; a holiday for many government workers.\n\nCommunists are red,\n\nPresident Barack Hussein Obama (D) is black.\n\nImpeach him--and his hacks--\n\nTo get freedom--and our health care--back.\n\n\n\nTom Cruz'n \u200f@TinPotDickTator\n\nRoses are red,\n\nViolets are blue,\n\nMore folk have lost their health care insurance\n\nThan have enrolled under you!\n\nGateway Pundit readers had their own reactions.\n\nRoses are red\n\nViolets are blue\n\nObama's a liar\n\nAnd so are you. Roses are red\n\nViolets are blue\n\nObamacare will leave\n\nAmerica black 'n blue Roses are red,\n\nViolets are blue,\n\n5.5+ million have LOST their health plan\n\nand THAT is what's TRUE!\n\n(Yes, that is very true.)\n\nRoses are red, Violets are blue, The uninsured may get healthcare, But their health care will be paid for by me and you.\n\n(Oh, how true. Even the cold hearted New York Times was forced to admit:\n\n\"About four-fifths of those choosing health plans to date qualified for financial assistance to help pay their premiums, administration officials said.\")\n\nRoses are stinky\n\nas they start to rot\n\nI once had insurance\n\nand now I do not. Roses are red.\n\nViolets are blue.\n\nWhat's it gonna take\n\nTo get rid of you?\n\nAs the New York Times further noted,\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Wednesday that many of \"the new enrollees in Obamacare exchange plans are actually folks who were already insured\" or eligible for Medicaid. (snip) Opinion polls show that people who are uninsured disapprove of the health care law at roughly the same rate as people who have insurance. Still attired in his black and blood red plaid pajamas and busy drinking his Valentine and Presidents' Day hot chocolate, Pajama Boy thankfully was finally unable to \"talk about getting health insurance.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/02/the_poetry_of_obamacare.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/blog/assets/iii.jpg", "title": "Blog: The poetry of Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As the New York Times further noted,Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Wednesday that many of \"the new enrollees in Obamacare exchange plans are actually folks who were already insured\" or eligible for Medicaid.\nTom Cruz'n \u200f@TinPotDickTatorRoses are red,Violets are blue,More folk have lost their health care insuranceThan have enrolled under you!\nRoses are red, Violets are blue, The uninsured may get healthcare, But their health care will be paid for by me and you.\n(snip) Opinion polls show that people who are uninsured disapprove of the health care law at roughly the same rate as people who have insurance.\nRoses are redViolets are blueObamacare will leaveAmerica black 'n blue Roses are red,Violets are blue,5.5+ million have LOST their health planand THAT is what's TRUE!"}
