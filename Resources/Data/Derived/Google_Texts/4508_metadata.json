She won Song of the Year for \u201cFollow Your Arrow\u201d at the Country Music Association Awards\u2014Nashville\u2019s biggest night. Musgraves recorded and co-wrote the song, which features the gay-friendly lyrics \u201cKiss lots of boys/or kiss lots of girls/ if that\u2019s something you\u2019re into.\u201d A CMA award is a hearty endorsement from the industry, and the fact that its voters weren\u2019t put off by the lyrics\u2014possibly because they were sung by a straight woman\u2014might have helped ease Ty Herndon\u2019s nerves. Just a couple of weeks later, Herndon became the first mainstream male country star to come out, as he told People magazine, as a \u201cproud gay man.\u201d The 52-year-old artist, who recently walked a red carpet with his partner of five years, inspired country singer and former child star Billy Gilman to post a video announcement of his own coming out the next day. One more and it would have been a trend.\n\nCountry music hasn\u2019t had this exciting of a year in LGBT news since 2010, when Chely Wright became the first mainstream Nashville star to come out. Wright\u2019s coming out was a carefully-orchestrated media circus, complete with a tell-all memoir, chronicled extensively in the 2011 documentary \u201cWish Me Away.\u201d As a trailblazer, Wright weathered criticism, death threats, and a quiet industry freeze-out after her announcement. So far, Herndon and Gilman haven\u2019t faced the same scrutiny.\n\nNashville veteran and outspoken LGBT ally LeAnn Rimes voiced her support for Herndon in a recent interview with GLAAD All-Access, saying that she hopes his and Gilman\u2019s announcements mean that the industry itself is becoming more progressive. \u201cI hope we\u2019re moving forward and not back,\u201d said Rimes.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. Nashville stars now routinely express their support for the LGBT community in the press, even though how they voice that support can still make headlines. When Carrie Underwood cited Christianity as shaping her progressive views on marriage equality in 2012, some right-wing Christian groups were furious. When you scratch the superstar surface, you\u2019ll find LGBT insiders just like in other entertainment industries, including \u201cFollow Your Arrow\u201d co-writers Brandy Clark (whose own new Los Angeles-made album is gathering acclaim) and Shane McAnally, well-known Nashville songwriters who are both out. In a landscape where even a Red State poster boy like Toby Keith can be blas\u00e9 about gay marriage (\u201cI never saw the reasoning behind getting in people\u2019s personal lives.\u201d), it\u2019s clear that being an explicitly outspoken proponent of LGBT rights and issues and being a mainstream country star are not mutually exclusive.\n\nSome of that is surely due to how much has changed just in the last four years. 2010 saw the beginnings of the dismantling of marriage discrimination at the federal level when the Defense of Marriage Act was declared unconstitutional. States began passing civil union laws and striking down same-sex marriage bans. Support for same-sex marriage has now surpassed opposition. In a November column for Out & About Nashville, managing digital editor Joseph Brant wrote that for the most part, the people who make up the country music industry aren\u2019t homophobic.\n\n\u201cThe country industry is a business, and so it directs its product to a target audience, which for a long time has been assumed to be suburban women between 30-45 years old (and only recently has that assumption been changed to Females 18-24),\u201d Brant wrote. \u201cIf those women, in either and both age categories, have been trained to believe their male country stars have to be sex symbols as much as the female country stars have to be non-threatening, then there is conceivably no place for a gay male country performer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Billy Gilman and Ty Herndon announced that they were gay--and Nashville is finally re-evaluating what its fans want", "author": "Erin Keane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Billy Gilman and Ty Herndon announced that they were gay--and Nashville is finally re-evaluating what its fans want", "title": "2014: The year country music came out", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/26/2014_the_year_country_music_came_out/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/herndon_gillman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Billy Gilman and Ty Herndon announced that they were gay--and Nashville is finally re-evaluating what its fans want", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/herndon_gillman.jpg", "title": "2014: The year country music came out", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "2014: The year country music came out", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Billy Gilman, Chely Wright, Country Music, Kacey Musgraves, nashville, Ty Herndon", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She won Song of the Year for \u201cFollow Your Arrow\u201d at the Country Music Association Awards\u2014Nashville\u2019s biggest night.\nTopics: Billy Gilman, Chely Wright, Country Music, Kacey Musgraves, nashville, Ty Herndon, Entertainment NewsIn November, breakout star Kacey Musgraves had a big night.\nIn a November column for Out & About Nashville, managing digital editor Joseph Brant wrote that for the most part, the people who make up the country music industry aren\u2019t homophobic.\nCountry music hasn\u2019t had this exciting of a year in LGBT news since 2010, when Chely Wright became the first mainstream Nashville star to come out.\n\u201cIf those women, in either and both age categories, have been trained to believe their male country stars have to be sex symbols as much as the female country stars have to be non-threatening, then there is conceivably no place for a gay male country performer.\u201d"}
