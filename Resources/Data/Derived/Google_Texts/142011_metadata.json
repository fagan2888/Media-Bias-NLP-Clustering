Well that\u2019s because they\u2019ve upped sticks and packed off to Hawaii together, reports suggest.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the pair are currently holidaying on the paradise island. The First Lady is apparently bunkered down at Oprah\u2019s sprawling luxury estate in Maui.\n\nA source told the US gossip site that SWAT teams and members of the Secret Service are on hand at the 12-bedroom mansion to provide Obama with maximum security for the duration of her stay.\n\nA caravan of black SUVs and Maui police cars were also spotted over the weekend.\n\nHighly Improbable, But Definitely Real, Famous Friendships\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 show all Highly Improbable, But Definitely Real, Famous Friendships\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/12 Barack Obama loves to let his hair down occasionally with a B ball game and a quick blast of hip-hop.

Although Obama denied any involvement in the couple's approval to vacation in the embargoed country.

Press\n\nA Maui local, Paul Meyer, told local publication The Maui News that his usual cycling path was interrupted by police barricades and \u201csecret service agents\u201d.\n\n\u201cTwo young guys were there and Maui police officers, and they said the road is going to be closed for the next week,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cI asked, \u2018Is Michelle Obama in town?\u2019 and the policeman just nodded.\u201d\n\nMichelle was originally on a 17-day holiday to Oahu with president Barack Obama and the couple\u2019s two daughters, Malia and Sasha.\n\nBut the rest of the family flew out of the State on Saturday, apparently leaving the First Lady to enjoy the rest of her stay in Winfrey\u2019s company.\n\nThe vacation is thought to be ahead of celebrations for the First Lady\u2019s 50th birthday next Friday 17 January.\n\nRepresentatives for both Obama and Winfrey are yet to confirm or deny the reports.\n\nWinfrey has long been a supporter of the Obama\u2019s, both politically and personally. The hugely influential chat show host\u2019s backing of Obama\u2019s election campaign in 2008 marked her first ever political endorsement, and she joined the president on his trail from Iowa to New Hampshire, labelling him \u201cthe one\u201d in front of scores of prospect voters.\n\nOff the beaten campaign track, they became close friends, attending intimate dinners and parties together. But reports that the trio had fallen out emerged in July 2013, after a number of observers noted Winfrey\u2019s absence from the president\u2019s second inauguration.\n\nFurther reports in October suggested that Winfrey declined to promote Obamacare medical reform as a result of the couple\u2019s \u201cfailure to bring her in as a confident,\u201d a source close to Winfrey allegedly told the New York Post.\n\nThese reports were later denied by Winfrey\u2019s people, and she was seen in the couple\u2019s company once more during Mandela\u2019s memorial events in December.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wondering where Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey have disappeared to?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Independent", "description": "Wondering where Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey have disappeared to?", "title": "Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey holidaying together in Hawaii", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/michelle-obama-and-oprah-winfrey-holidaying-together-in-hawaii-9043647.html", "image": "http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/07/11/Obama-Winfrey-getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-07T13:28:31+00:00", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/michelle-obama-and-oprah-winfrey-holidaying-together-in-hawaii-9043647.html", "site": "@independent", "description": "Wondering where Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey have disappeared to?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey holidaying together in Hawaii"}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "fb": {"admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Democrats (US), Hawaii, Michelle Obama, News, People, News", "article": {"video_count": 0, "published_time": "2014-01-07T11:53:55+00:00", "section": "News", "embed_count": 0, "author_name": "Jenn Selby", "tag": "Michelle Obama", "word_count": 434, "content_type": "story", "internal_link_count": 1, "image_count": 1, "subsection": "Frontpage", "modified_time": "2014-01-07T13:28:31+00:00", "external_link_count": 0}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5e48\"", "article_summary": "Getty Getty Images7/12 Elton John's a popular man, with one of the most enviable address books in the entertainment industry.\nSo many were surprised to learn that she had forged an unlikely friendship with...
