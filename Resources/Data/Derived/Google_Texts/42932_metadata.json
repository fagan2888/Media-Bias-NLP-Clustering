But it\u2019s also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future\u201d. Clinton \u201cVows to crack down on employers who misclassify workers as independent contractors\u201d, which she says is \u201cwage theft\u201d. Along with globalization and automation, Clinton describes the \u201cSharing Economy\u201d as \u201cconspiring against sustainable wage growth\u201d. The report says \u201cshe will argue that policy choices have contributed to the problem, and that she can fix it.\u201d\n\nSo why does added protectionism of US workers help offshore and nearshore outsourcing?\n\nWhile the open attack on innovative business models is in itself mind-boggling, the less obvious impact of her focus here is to discourage service providers and enterprises from hiring US talent to provide business support services. As service delivery becomes increasingly focused on higher value needs, such as organizational design, analytics modeling and supporting complex apps development across multiple environments, the opportunity for local US talent to be leveraged is huge.\n\nIn addition, the way in which new generation As-a-Service providers want to engage with talent needs to be more \u201cAs-a-Service\u201d to be competitive. Virtual support models are becoming critical for BPaaS support functions where clients need quick, on-tap support, and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 the new generation of service provider isn\u2019t simply looking to stock up hoards of full time employees in a call center somewhere in the Midwest \u2013 they are also seeking to engage talent which prefer a flexi-model and do not demand entitlements such as healthcare, 401K etc. Isn\u2019t that what things like ObamaCare are for? Just look at how the new class of Workday service providers, such as Collaborative Solutions, Meterorix, and OneSource Virtual, all of whom are upending the old guard of \u201cWas-a-Service\u201d providers, clinging to costly legacy models that have already been disrupted. These firms are all employers of local US talent in support of innovative As-a-Service delivery. Does Hillary really want to discourage these firms from flexing up with more staff locally as they grow, or would she prefer them to invest more in India, South America etc where talent is more fungible and flexible to manage? Because that is what will happen if more protectionist employment laws are put through.\n\nWhy not make it easy and fluid to hire local talent to scale up \u2013 as and when needed? Why not support our service-driven businesses to be more agile and cost-effective with their delivery? Because if services firms and enterprises are being strong-armed into hiring fulltime employees (many of whom don\u2019t even want to be fulltime employees), they are going to evaluate alternative talent models to deliver their services, such as hiring more local people part-time, or outsourcing to service providers which can provide talent from across the globe.\n\nBottom-line: The US is an increasingly unattractive place to do business. Let\u2019s not make it even worse\n\nFor starters, the US has stayed at the lead of the global economy ever since Winston Churchill stuck two fingers in the air because their leadership has embraced innovation in technology and life sciences \u2013 and supported their leading firms and academia in the process. Now, rather than staying ahead of the curve and realizing the future of work doesn\u2019t look anything like the past, we are seeing the leading Presidential candidate come down heavily in support of protectionism in order to win a few cheap votes from taxi drivers who overcharge us. Aren\u2019t our wage costs, payroll taxes, healthcare contributions etc already off the scale? Why not give our innovative employers a chance to be successful so they can create new jobs for the future, as opposed to discouraging them from hiring in this country at all? It\u2019s not as if there is a huge unemployment problem in the US these days\u2026\n\nUber is an easy target for Hillary as it has to rely on local contract workers to be effective and the government can step in to interfere. However, what about all the tech start-ups, As-a-Service providers, major enterprises which can leverage fungible labor from anywhere across the globe to fulfil their needs? Don\u2019t bite off your nose to spite your face Mrs Clinton \u2013 protecting a few taxi drivers who overcharge us would have much broader impacts on the attractiveness of US talent at large. Let\u2019s just hope this is a minor aberration as she realizes the consequences of this bewildering campaigning and quickly corrects course to avoid being seen as a dated, legacy politician.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Horses for Sources", "description": "The US is an increasingly unattractive place to do business.
