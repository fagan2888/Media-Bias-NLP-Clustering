(Photo: Channel 4 via AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNSA leaker Edward Snowden delivered a Christmas message on British television urging viewers to question government surveillance programs. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nI find it unbelievable that USA TODAY would put the pope, the queen and Edward Snowden in the same headline (\"Pope, queen and Snowden deliver holiday messages,\" News, Dec. 26). Snowden is a traitor, not a whistle-blower. He is not a good person like the pope and the queen.\n\nWhistle-blowers don't flee the country with secrets in tow. Whistle-blowers don't hide in China then Russia. Whistle-blowers don't offer to sell themselves to another foreign country or take a victory lap on a media site. He should be brought to justice.\n\n\u2014 Jim Steckel\n\nSnowden is my hero! Love him or hate him, he showed the world just how vulnerable people are to snooping by the Americans.\n\n\u2014 Heather Ann Czerniak\n\nHe is a traitor. It is despicable that his actions are celebrated.\n\n\u2014 Tricia Beals\n\nA patriot would have found a reputable source in his own country to work with him in revealing perceived transgressions on domestic liberties . Then he would have shown the courage of his convictions by standing up to those he had accused.\n\n\u2014 David Hoeltje\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nWhile I agree National Security Agency intelligence gathering needs more oversight, I also think it's important to national security for the NSA to keep and have immediate access to national phone metadata. These data cover only who called whom, and when, and do not include call content. It's important in connecting the dots when a suspected foreign terrorist calls someone in the United States.\n\nI don't want the NSA delayed in uncovering a threatening plot. I consider it a minor and worthwhile sacrifice of my personal privacy for my safety and that of my fellow citizens.\n\nJack James; Vilas, N.C.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1cmIWqh", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "NSA leaker Edward Snowden delivered a Christmas message on British television urging viewers to question government s...", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "NSA leaker Edward Snowden delivered a Christmas message on British television urging viewers to question government s...", "title": "Punish Edward Snowden, don't praise him: Your Say", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/01/01/punish-snowden-dont-praise-him-your-say/4277645/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NSA leaker Edward Snowden delivered a Christmas message on British television urging viewers to question government s...", "title": "Punish Edward Snowden, don't praise him: Your Say", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/331b487a2bb93bef7a99c6b4c803ee15752b9b6b/c=264-0-2736-1860&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/National Security Agency", "gci-categories": "Organizations/National Security Agency", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Punish Edward Snowden, don't praise him: Your Say", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d783e7692a7cfd0135dc5405965ab23196861367/c=804-0-2202-1860/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1ed0fc3b1cc11475df16be63a66d7fbf6f62e1e/c=264-0-2736-1860/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1ed0fc3b1cc11475df16be63a66d7fbf6f62e1e/c=264-0-2736-1860/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3c22a7e4b769c717eef5817d6e20e15edded54b9/c=0-84-3000-1776&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-01T13:38:11-05:00", "shorthed": "Punish Snowden, don't praise him: Your Say", "articleid": 4277645, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7070f600411ca3b082b663a2fc964fd124f77f77/c=0-84-3000-1776/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/afb6fe3053978fd9a7dfee812d8f3036b5557b77/c=978-0-2022-1860/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/01/01//1388601227000-A01-SNOWDEN-26.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Edward Snowden, National Security Agency, NSA, privacy, government overreach, Fourth Amendment, personal liberty, freedom"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7de5\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Channel 4 via AFP/Getty Images)NSA leaker Edward Snowden delivered a Christmas message on British television urging viewers to question government surveillance programs.\nNSA leader Edward Snowden delivered a Christmas message on British TV.\nWhistle-blowers don't offer to sell themselves to another foreign country or take a victory lap on a media site.\nComments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:I find it unbelievable that USA TODAY would put the pope, the queen and Edward Snowden in the same headline (\"Pope, queen and Snowden deliver holiday messages,\" News, Dec. 26).\nWhistle-blowers don't hide in China then Russia."}
