This left millions of Americans that enrolled on Heathcare.gov vulnerable to possible fraudulent activity \u2013 risks that continue to this day for the more than 6.5 million federal enrollees. Although the Obama administration knew about the security risks, the site was launched anyway.\n\nTo determine the safety of Healthcare.gov, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit, in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), against the Department of Health and Human Services to obtain all records related to security. This came after HHS officials failed to comply with requests in 2013 for these documents.\n\nThe FOIA request found countless problems in the initial months of exchange which verify the administration\u2019s knowledge of risks:\n\nSeptember 21, 2013- The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Information Security officer, Tom Schankweiler, expressed concern to the Healthcare.gov project manager Henry Choa stating there was 17 initial \u201cmoderate\u201d security issues and two \u201chigh\u201d security issues within the Obamacare website. These concerns included issues with contractors, staff shortages, and software malfunctions. This resulted in CMS Security Officer, Teresa Fryer, denying Healthcare.gov the authorization to operate.\n\nSeptember 30, 2013- Just one day before the site\u2019s launch, a private contractor testing the security of Healthcare.gov found that the site did not have the proper ability to handle \u201cspecially crafted messages \u2013 warning that this would likely cause the site to crash and furthered the lack of security.\n\nOctober 1, 2013- Healthcare.gov launched even though it was not authorized to operate by government IT security officers. As a result, the website crashed on day one as millions of Americans tried in vain to sign up for healthcare.\n\nNovember 6, 2013- The chief of technology officer of CMS was reminded that Healthcare.gov was in service without the authorization to operate \u2013 This posed a serious issue that \u201crepresents a high risk to the agency\u201d.\n\nNovember 6, 2013- An email correspondence between a CMS security testing officer and a federal programmer for the site, there detailed a warning: \u201cit is possible for anyone to run a brute force attack against Healthcare.gov to obtain the results of their eligibility.\u201d This meant that personal information of enrollees such as household income, social security numbers, wage and tax statements, home and mailing addresses, was at risk.\n\nIn the months following, the Obama Administration contracted various groups in an attempt to remedy the quality assurance issues of Healthcare.gov. Despite spending a further $2.14 billion in taxpayer dollars, they failed to fix some of the most serious security concerns.\n\nTwo years later, and after persistent and detailed warnings were directed to administration officials, Healthcare.gov was hacked by an outside source.\n\nThis latest news comes after multiple alarms were raised regarding the site\u2019s safety measures including the ability of Healthcare.gov to safeguard personal documents and legitimacy of citizenship. Today, the site continues its service without \u201cauthorization to operate\u201d from agency information security. Anyone currently enrolled on the Obamacare website may be subject to these risks.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "The federal Obamacare website launched in 2013 without authorization to operate and against the judgment of security agency officials.\u00a0 This left millions of Americans that enrolled on Heathcare.gov vulnerable to possible fraudulent activity \u2013 risks that continue to this day for the more than 6.5 million federal enrollees.", "title": "Judicial Watch: Obamacare Website Launched Despite Security Official\u2019s Warnings", "url": "https://www.atr.org/judicial-watch-obamacare-website-launched-despite-security-official-s-warnings-0", "image": "https://www.atr.org/sites/default/files/security-265130_1280.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 21200647, "pages": 8127889355}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1969\"", "article_summary": "The federal Obamacare website launched in 2013 without authorization to operate and against the judgment of security agency officials.\nThis resulted in CMS Security Officer, Teresa Fryer, denying Healthcare.gov the authorization to operate.\nToday, the site continues its service without \u201cauthorization to operate\u201d from agency information security.\nAlthough the Obama administration knew about the security risks, the site was launched anyway.\nOctober 1, 2013- Healthcare.gov launched even though it was not authorized to operate by government IT security officers."}
