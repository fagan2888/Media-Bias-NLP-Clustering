VRONDADOS, Greece (AP) — It’s pure rocket science, and residents of this Greek island village love it.

While church bells ring in Orthodox Easter, thousands of homemade rockets streak across the night sky of the Aegean island of Chios as rival Vrontados parishioners target each other’s church towers in a traditional, once-a-year mock war.

Incredibly, severe injuries are rare and dozens of brave souls even attend late-night services inside the churches of Aghios Markos and Panaghia Erithiani, which — together with surrounding homes — are ringed in defensive veils of chicken wire. Police keep a discreet distance as hundreds of people man batteries of wooden rocket launchers, awaiting the air raid siren that marks the start of hostilities.
