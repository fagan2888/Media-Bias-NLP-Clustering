At the center of the debate over costly drugs is a hepatitis C treatment that costs $84,000.

Gilead's blockbuster drug Sovaldi has become a lightning rod in the debate over rising specialty drug prices. The one thing is indisputable, for patients the drug works remarkably well.

Four weeks into treatment with Sovaldi, 55-year old Michelle Carver of New York said she feels better than she has in years.



"I'd stopped doing everything because I thought, my liver was failing," she said. Like so many with the virus, she had felt constant fatigue. "Now, I feel so much better. I'm in the gym. I'm eating."

Carver said she doesn't know how she acquired hepatitis C, which is most common in the U.S. among baby boomers exposed before testing for the virus was developed in the early 1990s. Her best guess is that she might have been exposed from a blood transfusion during an operation, or when she got a tattoo, years ago.
