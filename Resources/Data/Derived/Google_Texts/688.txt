Tesla has been fighting a running battle with car dealer groups around the country, many of whom have pushed against the company’s decision to sell its vehicles directly to customers through its own showrooms, rather than the traditional option of going through a dealer.

In many states, the dealer groups have appealed to legislators claiming the company is breaching franchise laws that require cars to be sold through dealers, a claim Tesla rejects.

That battle has led both to victories and defeats, but until now, one major player was neutral and on the sidelines: the big car companies themselves. But as of today, the car industry has taken a side, and it’s not Tesla’s.

From the WSJ’s Mike Ramsey:

The trade group that represents most of the big auto makers in the U.S. is for the first time weighing in on the running dispute between Tesla Motors and franchised auto dealers, urging Pennsylvania lawmakers not to give the Silicon Valley car maker a way to avoid state franchise laws that control retailing operations. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers is opposing legislation, which was introduced Monday, that would allow Tesla to operate its direct-sales model, but disallow other manufacturers from bypassing franchised dealers. The bill was proposed by Republican state Sen. John Rafferty Jr. , the chairman of the Transportation Committee. The senator couldn’t immediately be reached for comment because he was in a legislative session.

Car makers don’t have the same problem as the dealers, who worry that if Tesla succeeds in cutting out the middle man, its much larger competitors might be tempted to try the same. Instead, the auto companies are opposing Tesla receiving special treatment that they say would exempt it from state franchise laws.
