One of the most important things they learned was how to dream big.\n\nPlaying college football has been the goal since they played Coeur d\u2019Alene Warrior flag football 10 years ago. Tucker, an 18-year-old senior, saw his dream come true this year when he was offered a scholarship to play at Idaho State University in Pocatello, Idaho. The 6-foot-1, 168-pound quarterback was the 5A Inland Empire League\u2019s co-most valuable player. He passed for 1,320 yards and 13 touchdowns, and rushed for eight more.\n\nJerry, a 17-year-old junior slot receiver/tailback, caught eight TD passes, ran for seven more, and returned a punt for a score this season. He still has another year of high school ball, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before the second-team all-state selection attracts his own college scholarship offers.\n\nBehind all this is a story of one family\u2019s commitment to each other.\n\nThe Louie-McGees were living in the reservation town of Worley, Idaho (population 360), where the local high school has 126 students and an 8-man football program. Wade McGee, Cherokee, and his wife Debbie, Coeur d\u2019Alene, knew they had a choice to make regarding the future of their sons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never forced my kids to live my dreams. I wanted them to have their own dreams,\u201d said Wade, who holds seven football records at Haskell Indian Nations University. \u201cI\u2019m not just some proud dad. I\u2019m a trainer and I could see, even in elementary school, they had huge potential. So I went to the sweathouse and prayed. \u2018What do I need to do for my boys?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe answer that came to him was to leave the reservation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brothers Tackle Football Dreams", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/27/brothers-tackle-football-dreams-while-keeping-their-medicine-close-153773", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/jerry_louie-mcgee.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Brothers Tackle Football Dreams While Keeping Their Medicine Close"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-27T13:08-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/27/brothers-tackle-football-dreams-while-keeping-their-medicine-close-153773", "dc": {"title": "Brothers Tackle Football Dreams While Keeping Their Medicine Close"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Brothers Tackle Football Dreams While Keeping Their Medicine Close"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ac9\"", "article_summary": "Playing college football has been the goal since they played Coeur d\u2019Alene Warrior flag football 10 years ago.\nTucker and Jerry Louie-McGee learned many things as brothers growing up on the Coeur d\u2019Alene reservation in north Idaho.\nI wanted them to have their own dreams,\u201d said Wade, who holds seven football records at Haskell Indian Nations University.\nWade McGee, Cherokee, and his wife Debbie, Coeur d\u2019Alene, knew they had a choice to make regarding the future of their sons.\n\u2018What do I need to do for my boys?\u2019 \u201dThe answer that came to him was to leave the reservation."}
