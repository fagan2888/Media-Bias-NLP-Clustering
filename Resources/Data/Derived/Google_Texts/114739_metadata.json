REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\n(Reuters Health) - While some smokers consider electronic cigarettes a potential aid in quitting, some people who have already quit see them as a temptation to resume a habit they fought hard to ditch, a small study suggests.\n\nResearchers in Scotland interviewed 64 smokers and found little consensus about the potential benefits and harms of e-cigarettes, which may reflect division in the medical community on the appropriateness of promoting e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to the real thing, the authors note in the journal Tobacco Control.\n\n\u201cBecause e-cigarettes are relatively new products we are only beginning to learn about the health risks,\u201d senior study author Amanda Amos, a researcher at the Center for Population Health Sciences at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, said by email.\n\nE-cigarettes are designed to mimic the real thing, with a glowing tip that emits a cloud of vapor. There\u2019s a battery and heating element inside as well as a cartridge that holds nicotine and other liquids or flavorings.\n\nBecause part of what makes cigarettes harmful is the tobacco smoke, it\u2019s possible that e-cigarettes might be safer because they don\u2019t actually burn tobacco. Even so, the nicotine inside e-cigarettes is still addictive.\n\nAmos and colleagues conducted 12 focus groups and 11 individual interviews with current smokers and people who had quit smoking within the past year.\n\nMost participants viewed smoking as a form of addiction and believed willpower played a strong role in quitting. Almost all of them had tried e-cigarettes at least once.\n\nThey generally viewed e-cigarettes as distinct from other nicotine replacement products like patches or gum that are designed to help people quit. Because general practitioners give nicotine alternatives to smokers trying to quit, the study participants tended to think of these as medical products.\n\nWith e-cigarettes, however, people were less clear about what their intended purpose or correct use might be, though they were seen as less directly tied to smoking cessation than patches or gum.\n\nSome people saw e-cigarettes as a more satisfying replacement to smoking, while others viewed them as less desirable or even as a threat to smoking cessation.\n\n\u201cThis paper shows that the public\u2019s view of e-cigarettes is far from being clear, with a great deal of ambiguity around the product and its intended use,\u201d Dr. Ricardo Polosa, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Catania in Italy.\n\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s not complicated at all,\u201d Polosa, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cE-cigs are a much safer alternative to smoking and are intended for smokers who are unable to quit using other methods.\u201d\n\nWhile the study is too small to draw many conclusions about public perception of e-cigarettes, it highlights widespread confusion among consumers that has been observed in many countries, said Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos, a researcher at Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the end result is that smokers are discouraged from using e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking,\u201d Farsalinos, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cFor those smokers who cannot switch with, or do not want to use the pharmaceutical medications, e-cigarettes can really be life-saving.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1eMb7bO Tobacco Control, online June 8, 2015.\n\n(By Lisa Rapaport)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "consumers, unclear, about, risks, or, benefits, e, cigarettes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "While some smokers consider electronic cigarettes a potential aid in quitting, some people who have already quit see them as a temptation to resume a habit they fought hard to ditch.", "title": "Consumers Unclear About Risks Or Benefits Of E-Cigarettes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/consumers-unclear-about-risks-or-benefits-e-cigarettes-340222", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/27/e-cigarettes.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While some smokers consider electronic cigarettes a potential aid in quitting, some people who have already quit see them as a temptation to resume a habit they fought hard to ditch.", "title": "Consumers Unclear About Risks Or Benefits Of E-Cigarettes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/consumers-unclear-about-risks-or-benefits-e-cigarettes-340222", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/27/e-cigarettes.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/27/e-cigarettes.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-27T11:11:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-27T11:07:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "While some smokers consider electronic cigarettes a potential aid in quitting, some people who have already quit see them as a temptation to resume a habit they fought hard to ditch."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dbb\"", "article_summary": "Most participants viewed smoking as a form of addiction and believed willpower played a strong role in quitting.\nThey generally viewed e-cigarettes as distinct from other nicotine replacement products like patches or gum that are designed to help people quit.\nAmos and colleagues conducted 12 focus groups and 11 individual interviews with current smokers and people who had quit smoking within the past year.\nBecause part of what makes cigarettes harmful is the tobacco smoke, it\u2019s possible that e-cigarettes might be safer because they don\u2019t actually burn tobacco.\nE-cigarettes are designed to mimic the real thing, with a glowing tip that emits a cloud of vapor."}
