Many best-selling brand-name products doubled in price between 2007 and 2014. And according to a recent U.S. Senate committee report, generic medications have followed suit.\n\nMaine\u2019s first-in-the-nation importation law sailed through the Legislature in 2013. It was challenged later that year, though, when groups \u2014 including the Maine Pharmacy Association, the Retail Association of Maine and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \u2014 filed suit in federal court.\n\nThey claimed that allowing Maine patients to buy medications from outside the country posed a risk to public safety, because international pharmacies aren\u2019t regulated as closely as their U.S. counterparts.\n\nBut Canada, a major source of imported drugs, has its own regulatory system, with procedures found to be just as rigorous as those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And the Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act \u2014 a proposal introduced for the second year in a row by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. \u2014 calls for tight oversight of purchases from Canadian pharmacies.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also has signed on to the measure, which would allow Americans with a valid prescription from a U.S.-licensed physician to order up to a 90-day supply of medicines from a licensed Canadian pharmacy. Prescription drugs would have to have the same active ingredients, dosage form and potency as medicines that are approved by the FDA.\n\nThis measure won\u2019t resolve the bigger issue: that the United States \u2014 unlike other countries \u2014 doesn\u2019t negotiate with drugmakers. So our federal government misses out on an opportunity to reach the best deal for U.S. taxpayers, who fund prescription coverage for people on Medicare. And uninsured consumers wind up paying the full cost for the drugs that they\u2019ve been prescribed, because they don\u2019t have big insurers advocating on their behalf.\n\nBut passage of the Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act would be a good first step toward ensuring some relief for some patients, and it deserves to be discussed and debated in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill before the Senate addresses some of the issues that derailed Maine's importation law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "A bill before the Senate addresses some of the issues that derailed Maine's importation law.", "title": "OUR OPINION: Congress should help ease high drug costs - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/371628_shutterstock_109343126.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2015-02-27T16:41:36-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/02/28/our-opinion-congress-should-help-ease-high-drug-costs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/371628_shutterstock_109343126.jpg", "description": "A bill before the Senate addresses some of the issues that derailed Maine's importation law.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "OUR OPINION: Congress should help ease high drug costs - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "ouropinion", "published_time": "2015-02-28T04:10:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T16:41:36-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Prescription drugs would have to have the same active ingredients, dosage form and potency as medicines that are approved by the FDA.\nBut a bill authorizing prescription drug importation from Canada was introduced in the U.S. Senate recently and should receive serious consideration as a sound \u2014 although temporary \u2014 solution to a longstanding problem.\nAdditional Images Many best-selling brand-name prescription drugs doubled in price between 2007 and 2014, and the cost of generic medications is climbing as well.\nAnd the Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act \u2014 a proposal introduced for the second year in a row by Sens.\ntxking/Shutterstock.com Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192The rising expense of medication is driving state and national efforts to allow drug imports."}
