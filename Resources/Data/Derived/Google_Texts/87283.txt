A house in North Dallas was destroyed in a two-alarm fire late Friday.

About 10:30 p.m., firefighters were dispatched to the 7700 block of Midbury Drive, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said in a news release.

The fire had engulfed the attic and flames were coming out of the roof.

No injuries were reported. The home’s four occupants weren’t home at the time.

Because it was dark, investigators weren’t able to look through the home to determine a cause of the fire and planned to return Saturday, Evans said.

As of late Saturday, the cause was still under investigation, but investigators determined the fire originated in a back bedroom of the house, he said.
