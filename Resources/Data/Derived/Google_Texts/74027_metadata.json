Since the IRS permits businesses to deduct \u201call excise taxes that are ordinary and necessary expenses\u201d of a business, Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimates that the net tax effect is about 1.5 percent \u2014 not the full 2.3 percent.\n\nThe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says the tax is expected to raise about $29 billion in the first 10 years.\n\nThe tax is imposed on clinical medical devices \u2014 such as CAT scan machines, stents, defibrillators and other devices sold to hospitals and other health care providers. It makes no difference if the device is manufactured abroad or in the U.S., since the tax is added to all sales in the U.S. The tax does not apply to consumer medical devices, which are those purchased directly by consumers \u2014 such as hearing aids, wheelchairs and contact lenses.\n\nBoehner addressed the impact of the tax in floor remarks on the eve of a government shutdown and a day after the House voted to amend the Senate budget resolution and repeal the medical device excise tax.\n\nBoehner, Sept. 30: The House has done its work. We passed a bill Saturday night, sent it to the United States Senate, that would delay Obamacare for one year and would eliminate permanently the medical device tax that is costing us tens of thousands of jobs that are being shipped overseas.\n\nThere are two claims here that we will review: that the tax is costing the United States \u201ctens of thousands of jobs\u201d and those jobs are being \u201cshipped overseas.\u201d\n\nWe asked Boehner\u2019s office what evidence he has that U.S. medical device companies are shipping tens of thousands of jobs overseas, but we received no response.\n\nHowever, Boehner and other critics of the medical device excise tax have pointed to an industry study written by Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, and her husband, Harold, who is a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. The study, released in September 2011, said that \u201cthe tax could result in job losses in excess of 43,000.\u201d It also said that U.S. manufacturers \u201cwill be more likely to close plants in the United States and replace them with plants in foreign countries.\u201d\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at the number of jobs that may have been affected so far. It may be that the law results in the loss of \u201ctens of thousands of jobs\u201d in the U.S., but there is no evidence that that is the case now \u2014 even from the tax\u2019s most ardent critics.\n\nWe contacted the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed, which is lobbying to repeal the tax. A spokeswoman from the industry trade group \u2014 which frequently cites the Furchtgott-Roth study warning of 43,000 job losses \u2014 told us it had no hard data on the impact of the law so far.\n\nIn an email to us, AdvaMed spokeswoman Wanda Moebius wrote: \u201cGiven the size of the industry (more than 5,000 companies) and the fact that 73 percent of them have fewer than 20 employees, it\u2019s really hard to capture that number. \u2026 The fact that so many device companies are small, not publicly traded companies makes it very hard to get that kind of data.\u201d\n\nMoebius did, however, provide us with a package of news articles about the \u201ceffects of the device tax.\u201d\n\nWe reviewed the clips sent to us by AdvaMed, and a list of companies affected by the law that was compiled by the Republican National Committee\u2019s research team. The RNC posted its list Sept. 30 \u2014 the day that Boehner made his remarks. Even at face value, the two lists combined don\u2019t add up to even 10,000 jobs, let alone \u201ctens of thousands,\u201d as Boehner said.\n\nThe lists show that 12 large companies announced that they have or will eliminate at most a total of 8,725 positions \u2014 but not all of the jobs are in the U.S. and some positions are unfilled. Also, most of the companies did not blame the workforce reductions entirely on the tax, and, in a few cases, there was no mention of the tax as a reason at all for the layoffs. There are many factors at play that cause companies to restructure their operations \u2014 from consolidating operations after acquisitions to dealing with new market forces unleashed by a new federal law that puts increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments.\n\nOne company on AdvaMed\u2019s list denied the tax is the cause of either layoffs or moving operations overseas. Covidien announced in September of last year that it would close a South Carolina plant and move its operations to Costa Rica, resulting in 595 layoffs at the U.S. plant. Columnist George Will last year and, more recently, Sen. Kelly Ayotte on the Senate floor in March of this year blamed the tax.\n\nHowever, Covidien issued a statement in 2012 that read: \u201cWhile we believe the medical device tax may hurt investment in innovation and research and development, Covidien has never cited the device tax as a reason for laying off employees or transferring production to other locations.\u201d Covidien spokeswoman Lisa Clemence told us in an email that \u201cthere has been no change in our position since that statement was issued.\u201d\n\nIn another case, the announced job losses were more than offset by large job gains elsewhere in the company because of continued growth.\n\nFor example, AdvaMed and the RNC both list Stryker Corp. as laying off 1,000 employees in 2012. The RNC links to a Nov. 12, 2012, story in the Kalamazoo Gazette that carried the headline, \u201cStryker Corp. to complete planned layoffs of 1,000 workers by end of 2012.\u201d AdvaMed quoted a Dec. 18, 2012, blog post on the conservative Heritage Foundation website about the medical device tax that said, \u201cFor instance, Stryker Corporation of Kalamazoo, Michigan, announced it will lay off about 1,000 workers \u2014 about 5 percent of its workforce \u2014 because of the tax.\u201d\n\nBut Stryker didn\u2019t solely blame the tax for its restructuring plans and layoffs. And, nearly two years later, Stryker has actually increased its workforce \u2014 not reduced it \u2014 by 13 percent.\n\nWhen it announced the plans in November 2011, the company said: \u201cThe targeted reductions and other restructuring activities are being initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth despite the ongoing challenging economic environment and market slowdown in elective procedures.\u201d It also said there would be a 5 percent reduction in its \u201cglobal workforce,\u201d not just in the U.S.\n\nSo, the reductions were not all in the U.S., and there were other reasons for the decision, including freeing up capital for investments in growth areas.\n\nThe new business strategy apparently is paying off.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual reports filed this and last year show that it had 21,241 employees as of Dec. 31, 2011, and approximately 22,010 employees as of Dec. 31, 2012. In an email, Stryker spokeswoman Jo Johnson told us it now has 24,000 employees -\u2013 which is 2,759 employees more than it had as of Dec. 31, 2011, a month after the layoffs were announced. Johnson said the \u201c5% workforce reduction described in our press release in November 2011\u2033 was completed in 2012. Asked about the increase in employees, she said, \u201cAs our global business continues to grow, we do grow our workforce to support the needs of our broad customer base.\u201d\n\nStryker did not disclose in November 2011 where the layoffs would occur, and Johnson did not answer our question about the impact that the restructuring had on its U.S. workforce. It did close two plants in western New York that it had acquired from Gaymar Industries in 2010. According to Buffalo Business First, a business website, the plant closings resulted in 107 layoffs \u2014 which the company disclosed in notices filed with the state in compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN). But Stryker filed no such notices in its home state of Michigan, state officials told us in an email and phone call.\n\nShipping Jobs Overseas?\n\nThere is also no evidence for the second part of Boehner\u2019s claim \u2014 that the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of U.S. jobs \u201care being shipped overseas.\u201d\n\nIt is true that some U.S.-based multinational companies, including Boston Scientific, are making major investments in foreign countries that will create jobs abroad, even as they announce workforce reductions in the U.S. The overseas investments are not a direct result of the tax, although there could be an indirect impact.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the tax is imposed on all clinical medical devices sold in the U.S., whether those devices are manufactured in India or Indiana. Having said that, if a company sells more devices in India than the United States, then less of its revenues will be subject to the additional tax. As Moody\u2019s explained, companies that will be the least affected are those with \u201crelatively strong free cash flow\u201d and \u201clower percentages of affected US revenues.\u201d Conversely, those most affected would be those with weak cash flow and a higher percentages of U.S. sales.\n\nThe incentive to increase sales abroad comes at a time when the industry is trying to capitalize on \u201cemerging markets\u201d known collectively as BRIC \u2014 that is, Brazil, Russia, India and China. So it is hard to separate the impact of the tax from the impact of natural market forces.\n\nAn industry trade magazine called Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry said in a July blog post: \u201cIt is becoming ever more apparent that the importance of the BRIC nations comes not only from their sheer geographical size, but also from their large populations and the high annual growth rates of their respective medical device markets.\u201d\n\nJP Boyle & Associates, an executive search consulting firm, says the industrialized markets, including the U.S., will continue to grow \u2014 but not as fast as the emerging markets. \u201cBy all estimates these [industrialized] markets will continue to grow due to an aging global population. However this growth will be at rates that are much slower than those of emerging markets.\u201d\n\nSo, the focus on expanding facilities abroad has to do in large part with business opportunities in these emerging foreign markets \u2013 not simply an effort to flee a new U.S. tax.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Boston Scientific \u2014 which both AdvaMed and the RNC cite as an example of companies laying off workers because of the medical device excise tax.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the company has announced two waves of workforce reductions since 2011 as part of a restructuring of the company, according to the Associated Press story cited by the RNC. The AP says the company announced an elimination of 1,200 to 1,400 positions in 2011 and then an additional 900 to 1,000 positions in January of this year. That\u2019s a total of, at most, 2,400 positions, the most of any company on the lists provided by AdvaMed and the RNC. AP said the reductions \u201cwill include layoffs as well as the elimination of unfilled positions,\u201d and the company hadn\u2019t decided where the reductions would occur. As of Dec. 31, 2012, the Massachusetts-based company had 14,000 U.S. and 10,000 international employees for a total of 24,000, and about half of its net sales were in foreign countries.\n\nThe AP article also said the workforce reductions would \u201creduce annual operating expenses, before taxes, by about $340 million to $375 million by the end of this year\u201d \u2014 far more than the excise tax will cost the company this year. Boston Scientific reported in its latest annual report filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission in February that it expects to pay about $80 million this year as a result of the excise tax. What will the company do with the savings, besides pay the medical excise tax? The AP says, \u201cThe company expects to reinvest a big portion of that savings in areas where it expects future growth, like the emerging markets of China and Brazil.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the company on July 27, 2011, announced that it would invest $150 million over five years to build a manufacturing plant and training center in China. The company said it \u201cestimates that its target market in China currently exceeds $1 billion and is growing approximately 20 percent annually.\u201d It also noted \u201cthe Chinese government\u2019s commitment to spend $125 billion on its healthcare system in the next five years. We think the time is right to make additional investments to help fuel our growth, help us win global share, gain access to diverse talent and bring our less-invasive therapies to more patients in China.\u201d\n\nElsevier Business Intelligence, a trade website, published a June 2012 report called \u201cMedical Device Growth in Emerging Markets: Lessons From Other Industries\u201d that singled out Boston Scientific\u2019s announced plans for China as an example of smart business practices. \u201cOther players need to quickly follow suit to build their local commercial presence in a way that attracts and retains talent,\u201d the report said.\n\nSo, is it accurate to say that the medical device excise tax has forced Boston Scientific to build in China? No. But that\u2019s what Republican Sen. John Barrasso did in a floor speech on May 17, 2012, emphasizing the fact that the company is located in Boston, Mass., as if the decision to build abroad was foreign to a multinational company that already has six international plants and manufactures nearly 60 percent of its products abroad. He said of Boston Scientific: \u201cThey\u2019re building a $150 million factory \u2014 it\u2019s called Boston Scientific \u2014 in China. That\u2019s the result of what we see with this health care law, and the impact of what this administration is doing to jobs in America.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s simply wrong.\n\nWe don\u2019t mean to minimize the loss of any U.S. jobs, and we certainly don\u2019t take a position on whether the tax should be repealed. But Boehner and Barrasso are both exaggerating the impact of the tax to date. Boston Scientific itself told its investors in its most recent annual report that it is \u201cunclear what the full impact will be from the law.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "So, is it accurate to say that the medical device excise tax has forced Boston Scientific to build in China?\nBoehner addressed the impact of the tax in floor remarks on the eve of a government shutdown and a day after the House voted to amend the Senate budget resolution and repeal the medical device excise tax.\nThe 2.3 percent medical device excise tax went into effect Jan. 1, 2013, so it has been in effect for less than a year.\nLet\u2019s look at Boston Scientific \u2014 which both AdvaMed and the RNC cite as an example of companies laying off workers because of the medical device excise tax.\nHowever, Boehner and other critics of the medical device excise tax have pointed to an industry study written by Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, and her husband, Harold, who is a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute."}
