Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday night he would the oppose the Iran agreement. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nThe White House aggressively struck back Friday after Sen. Charles E. Schumer announced his opposition to President Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, suggesting the New York Democrat could lose support to become \u00adparty leader in the Senate in 2016 if he helps block the accord.\n\nThe response was the latest \u00adexample of the president\u2019s \u00adtake-no-prisoners approach to ensuring the survival of a pact he views as a legacy-defining achievement that could help remake the security situation in the turbulent Middle East.\n\n[The historic nuclear deal with Iran: How it works]\n\nThe White House and its allies expressed confidence that Schumer\u2019s opposition would not be enough to derail the Iran deal. Senate Democratic aides said 15 members of the caucus have expressed support, and Schumer is the only one to publicly oppose it.\n\nBut both sides acknowledged that the debate is now headed into a period of uncertainty as Obama leaves town for a two-week vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Congress breaks for its six-week summer recess. As lawmakers head home to their districts, some are expected to be confronted by constituents who oppose the deal, and several influential Jewish American groups have launched multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns against it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Schumer indicated that he would not actively encourage others to vote against the Iran deal, the White House moved to marginalize his position, citing his support for the Iraq war in 2003 as part of a long-standing tendency to disagree with Obama on foreign policy and the use of American power.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Schumer\u2019s stance, saying it is \u201cnot particularly surprising to anybody here at the White House, even if it was disappointing.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s position \u201cdoesn\u2019t change our confidence that we\u2019ll be able to mobilize a substantial majority of Democrats,\u201d Earnest said, but he suggested lawmakers should question whether Schumer is fit to become the party\u2019s leader in the Senate, saying members may want to \u201cconsider the voting record of those who want to lead the caucus.\u201d\n\nClose White House allies made similar arguments.\n\n\u201cSenator Schumer siding with the GOP against Obama, [Hillary] Clinton and most Democrats will make it hard for him to lead the Dems in \u201916,\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, who served as Obama\u2019s senior political adviser until leaving in February, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe base won\u2019t support a leader who thought Obamacare was a mistake and wants War with Iran,\u201d he wrote in another tweet.\n\nSchumer has previously criticized the timing of passing Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as a political mistake. Despite the White House reaction, Schumer maintains broad support among his colleagues, and there is no indication that his expected ascension to Senate minority leader is in jeopardy.\n\nSchumer, who is Jewish, said he had decided not to support the agreement out of concern that it would strengthen Iran by boosting its economy and ultimately may not prevent the country from developing a nuclear bomb.\n\nObama publicity blitz\n\nThe attacks on Schumer were part of a forceful campaign by Obama to defend the Iran deal.\n\nThe president has pledged to veto any bill rejecting the accord, which would lift economic sanctions against Iran and require the country to dismantle much of its nuclear infrastructure.\n\nHe has bluntly confronted his opponents, including Republicans, Jewish American leaders and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stating that they would prefer war over a diplomatic solution to contain Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nObama has also launched a publicity blitz that has included a major speech at American University, a private two-hour session at the White House with two-dozen Jewish American leaders, and an on-the-record chat with nine \u00adforeign-policy columnists. It will culminate with an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria that will air Sunday.\n\nRepublicans have chided Obama for his harsh tone, and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Friday said Obama\u2019s attacks on opponents amounted to \u201cslander.\u201d\n\nBut Earnest stood by Obama\u2019s contention that Republicans had made \u201ccommon cause\u201d with Iranian hard-liners who opposed the deal.\n\n\u201cIt was a statement of fact,\u201d Earnest said this week. Asked whether Democrats who are calling on Obama to seek a better deal with Iran are \u201cpursuing a fantasy,\u201d as Obama had accused Republicans, Earnest replied: \u201cThe suggestion that there is a better deal is a fantasy. The president stands by those remarks entirely.\u201d\n\nObama has countered that his critics have used unfair and misleading arguments to rally opposition. During the private White House meeting with Jewish American leaders, the president suggested that his opponents tone down their rhetoric if they wanted him to do the same, according to several participants. Obama was particularly irked by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s $20 million ad campaign against the plan.\n\nOne participant, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation, said Obama argued \u201cthat this would not be as big an issue and as big a fight if basically the pro-Israel community was not making it into a big fight. . . . So essentially the takeaway was that he was broadly asking the organizations to consider stepping back.\u201d\n\nSeeking a close victory\n\nSchumer is expected to take over from retiring Sen. Harry M. Reid (Nev.) as the leader of the Senate Democrats after the next election cycle. His independence from the West Wing has made him a target at times for liberal activists. But he is a respected figure inside the Democratic caucus and clinched the race to succeed Reid within hours of the leader\u2019s announcement that he would retire.\n\nSchumer\u2019s long wait to announce his opposition to the Iran deal \u2014 more than three weeks after it was formally sent to Congress \u2014 left an opening that was filled by a steady stream of announcements of support from other senior Democrats. Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday became the 14th and 15th members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate to publicly support the deal.\n\nSens. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Barbara Boxer (Calif.), the most senior Jewish Democrats in the Senate, both backed the deal. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) had been a target for opponents of the accord, in part because his state is home to powerful Jewish figures. Instead, in a floor speech Tuesday, Nelson embraced the pact.\n\nThe deal has also won critical backing from a new generation of Democrats who have raised their profile by focusing on global \u00adaffairs: First-term Sens. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.), a potential vice presidential pick for 2016, and Chris Murphy (Conn.).\n\nIn addition to Schumer, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) has been highly critical and is expected to oppose the deal.\n\nThe administration will be happy if it gets just enough support to be able to uphold a veto and is not seeking a large margin, a White House official said. The aide said that a close victory would suffice and that the administration is not trying to get enough votes to filibuster and prevent a Senate vote.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), who is the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence and who announced his support for the deal last week, said Schumer\u2019s decision \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the dynamic that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only surprise may have been the timing,\u201d Schiff said.\u201cI think many people thought he may have waited longer than he did.\u201d\n\nThe timing will allow well-funded deal opponents to tout Schumer\u2019s opposition in a month\u2019s worth of television ads. But there is little sign thus far that Schumer himself intends to participate in a broader public relations campaign against the deal.\n\n\u201cThere are some who believe that I can force my colleagues to vote my way,\u201d Schumer said in a statement Thursday. \u201cIn my experience with matters of conscience and great consequence like this, each member ultimately comes to their own conclusion.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis and Steven Mufson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some Obama allies said Schumer may lose support to become the Senate Democratic leader in 2016.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.kane.3367", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Some Obama allies said Schumer may lose support to become the Senate Democratic leader in 2016.", "title": "Sen.
