A freakish 2006 car crash in Wisconsin killed 18-year-old Natasha Weigel and Amy Rademaker, 17, and left the 17-year-old driver of the car, Megan Phillips, with serious brain damage.\n\nThe young women were traveling in a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. The popular compact was one of six models recently recalled by General Motors because of a serious defect \u2013 a hypersensitive ignition switch liable to shut off and immobilize the steering and brake system and prevent the car\u2019s airbags from deploying.\n\nRelated: GM\u2019s Mounting Killer Car Problem\n\nPolice investigating the Wisconsin tragedy found that the Cobalt\u2019s ignition switch had mysteriously shifted from \u201crun\u201d to the \u201caccessory position\u201d before the Cobalt froze up and slammed into a telephone pole and two trees without triggering the airbags. Just a year earlier, a Maryland teenager named Amber Marie Rose was killed in a similar accident when the Chevrolet Cobalt she was driving slammed into a tree and the airbag failed to deploy.\n\nA lawsuit filed on behalf of Phillips and the families of Weigel and Rademaker is seeking more than $50,000 in damages from GM and the Minneapolis dealership that sold the car, but other lawyers are bringing a class action suit against the automaker that potentially could involve hundreds of millions of dollars or more in damages.\n\nIronically, while GM already has acknowledged a link between the faulty ignition switch and 12 deaths and 31 crashes, the car manufacturer may never have to pay a dime in damages to any victims and their families. That\u2019s because of a glaring loophole in the federal bankruptcy law.\n\nRelated: How a Watchdog Blew the Lid off the GM Recall Scandal\n\nGM has told federal regulators that it was alerted to problems with the ignition switch as early as 2001. Twice the automaker told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration that it had explored corrections to the switch in 2004 and 2005 but didn\u2019t follow through.\n\nYet the accidents all occurred before GM emerged from an historic Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 \u2013 a legal and financial process that shielded the restructured manufacturer from any liabilities of the \u201cold\u201d GM.\n\nHarvey R. Miller, a New York lawyer who represented GM in the bankruptcy proceedings, said Monday that the terms of the bankruptcy order are very clear: Any liabilities incurred before the bankruptcy petition was filed on June 1, 2009, are the obligations of the former GM \u2013 while any incurred afterward are the responsibility of the \u201cnew\u201d GM.\n\n\u201cIf they [the liabilities] occurred before the bankruptcy and the injury was manifested before the bankruptcy, then it would be a pre-petition claim and subject to the discharge under the bankruptcy code,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe critical date is the date of the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases, and under the general bankruptcy law, that\u2019s a day of demarcation.\u201d\n\nDouglas C. Bernstein, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., lawyer who specializes in bankruptcy and creditors\u2019 rights, said GM will have difficulty taking advantage of the shield against the claims if it can be shown that the manufacturer hid information about the car defects during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe bankruptcy law allows an honest debtor to get a fresh start, whether it\u2019s a corporation or an individual,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the price of admission is full disclosure. So you don\u2019t get the relief of being rid of your obligations by not being honest.\u201d\n\nRelated: Did the Obama White House Protect GM?\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) yesterday urged Attorney General Eric Holder to immediately intervene to force GM to establish a fund to compensate victims and to warn current owners of the recalled cars of the dangers of continuing to drive them.\n\n\u201cLike many Americans, I was appalled and astonished by GM\u2019s recent admission that it knew of these disabling defects and their disastrous effects well before the 2009 reorganization,\u201d Blumenthal said in a letter to Holder. \u201cTheir deliberate concealment caused continuing death and damage and it constituted a fraud on the bankruptcy court that approved its reorganization.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal added that GM had \u201ccriminally deceived\u201d the federal government and the public.\n\nLawyers for some of the plaintiffs in the recall case are going to court to try to force GM to issue a \u201cpark it\u201d order to the owners of the 1.6 million or more cars that have been recalled.\n\nThe New York Times reported yesterday that GM and its engineers nearly five years ago \u201claid to rest\u201d any doubt that a fatal defect existed in hundreds of thousands of its cars, yet subsequently told the families of accident victims and other customers that it did not have enough evidence of any defect in their cars.\n\nRelated: Deadly GM Defect Has Some Consumers \u2018Petrified\u2019\n\n\u201cIn one case, G.M. threatened to come after the family of an accident victim for reimbursement of legal fees if the family did not withdraw its lawsuit,\u201d the newspaper reported, based on interviews, letters and legal documents.\n\nFederal bankruptcy laws are designed to give debt-ridden and poorly managed corporations the opportunity to negotiate settlements with creditors, jettison losing operations, reorganize the management team and move on as a newly restructured entity.\n\nUnder the 2009 restructuring agreement that helped GM emerge from the auto industry crisis, the company was divided into old and new corporate entities \u2013 with the old GM saddled with all the bad assets, such as closed assembly plants, while the new GM inherited the best of the company. Any claims pending against the company were settled and paid from a limited pool of money.\n\nWith its recall of 1.6 million cars, GM will be on the hot seat as the Justice Department, congressional committees and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigate why the automaker kept the defects secret for more than a decade before first announcing them last month\n\nGM officials haven\u2019t indicated yet whether they will utilize the shield and fight the lawsuits \u2013 or whether they might attempt to reach a settlement with plaintiffs to limit the public relations damage to the company.\n\nRelated: General Motors Hits Reverse on Its Public Relations\n\nBeginning in mid-February, the company issued recalls for model year 2005-2007 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s with faulty ignition switches. It added 842,000 Ion compacts (model years 2003-2007), Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007) to the list of cars being recalled for the problems as well.\n\nMary Barra, GM\u2019s new president and CEO, said recently, \u201cThere are certain cases where liabilities prior to bankruptcy are \u2013 I don\u2019t know the right word \u2013 they\u2019re with the previous company. But I would say right now, our focus 100 percent is on the customers, on fixing their vehicles \u2013 getting the parts, fixing their vehicles and supporting them through that process.\u201d\n\nSome lawyers for the victims of the fatally flawed automobiles believe it can be shown that GM intentionally sat on information about the ignition and airbag problem during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nA GM timeline of events that the company gave to NHSTA showed that there were numerous reports and inquiries into concerns about the ignition switches being out of position in almost every year since 2003 except 2008, when the company\u2019s survival was in doubt and GM was seeking a government bailout.\n\n\u201cThe truth is they knew they had this recall [coming],\u201d Shelby Jordan, a Corpus Christi, Tex., lawyer involved in the recall controversy, told the Detroit Free Press last week. \u201cThere is no question GM knew that this was a problem. They even told their dealers privately about it\u201d before the bankruptcy.\n\nMiller, the GM bankruptcy lawyer, said yesterday, \u201cI don\u2019t recall it being specifically brought up, but there were all kinds of issues about tort claimants resulting from accidents, manufacturing defects, etc. And that\u2019s why the plan was structured in the way it was, to deal with the successor liability issue.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated Tuesday, March 25 at 11:30 am.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After its recall of 1.6 million cars, General Motors will be on the hot seat in explaining to the Justice Department, Congress and regulators why it kept secret for more than a decade defects in an ignition switch that may have contributed to hundreds of fatalities.
