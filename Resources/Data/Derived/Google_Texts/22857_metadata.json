CSU hit just 18-for-56 (.321) from the field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to play when you\u2019re not making shots,\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cBut we took it to the wire. I\u2019m so proud of my guys.\u201d\n\nA Moby Arena crowd of 5,592 held its breath as CSU junior guard Daniel Bejarano took an inbounds pass with 6.1 seconds remaining and the Rams down by two points.\n\nBejarano, who would finish with a team-best 21 points, dribbled the remaining length of the court and tossed a floater toward the basket with a second to go. But the ball caught the edge of the backboard and bounced away as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the play we wanted,\u201d Eustachy said.\n\nDespite cold shooting, CSU (12-8, 3-4) traded leads with New Mexico for much of the game by hustling for loose balls and grabbing 12 offensive rebounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing; we were right there,\u201d Bejarano said.\n\nNew Mexico (15-4, 6-1) became the first Lobos team since 1984 to win its first four conference road games. The Lobos were without injured 7-footer Alex Kirk (left leg). But two seniors, 6-4 guard Kendall Williams ( 23 points) and 6-9 forward Cameron Bairstow (19), carried the load. Eustachy predicted all three Lobos stars will play in the NBA.\n\nWilliams hit 1-of-2 free throws with 6.1 seconds remaining to make it 68-66.\n\nEustachy argued that a mistake by the shot clock operator penalized his team. New Mexico got the ball with 40 seconds remaining after a CSU miss. Eustachy shouted at his players not to foul, hoping for a missed shot by the Lobos. But the 35-second shot clock was not reset, and instead became synchronized with the game clock.\n\nThe CSU bench frantically ordered the Rams\u2019 players to foul, and Williams made a free throw with 10.1 seconds left for a 67-64 lead. CSU\u2019s Jon Octeus hit two free throws with seven seconds left, but the Rams had to foul Williams again.\n\n\u201cAs Coach (Eustachy) says, we can\u2019t let the game come down to officiating or the clock,\u201d CSU guard Joe De Ciman said.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New Mexico narrowly edges out Colorado State 68-66", "title": "New Mexico narrowly edges out Colorado State 68-66", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/25/new-mexico-narrowly-edges-out-colorado-state-68-66/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140125_052330_larry-eustachy.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140125_052330_larry-eustachy.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-25T16:29:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:44:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad10\"", "article_summary": "New Mexico got the ball with 40 seconds remaining after a CSU miss.\nWilliams hit 1-of-2 free throws with 6.1 seconds remaining to make it 68-66.\nThat\u2019s why Eustachy couldn\u2019t be upset after a 68-66 loss Saturday to the Lobos, the defending Mountain West champions.\nCSU\u2019s Jon Octeus hit two free throws with seven seconds left, but the Rams had to foul Williams again.\nNew Mexico (15-4, 6-1) became the first Lobos team since 1984 to win its first four conference road games."}
