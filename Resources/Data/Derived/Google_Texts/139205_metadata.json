Rather, they thought the case should not have been heard.\n\nThe ruling clears the way for expansion of the program that provides health insurance to low income Ohioans to proceed.\n\nThe expansion will allow families with incomes of up to 138 percent of the poverty line to obtain Medicaid coverage beginning in 2014. The state estimates 275,000 people now without coverage could be added to the Medicaid program in the next three years.\n\nThe lawmakers and abortion opponents, in a suit filed with the court in October, had sought a writ of mandamus from the court to stop the expansion. They argued that the state\u2019s controlling board had overstepped its authority when it voted 5-2 to accept federal funding needed to pay for the expansion.\n\nThe lawmakers -- Ron Young of Leroy Township, Matt Lynch of Aurora, Ron Hood of London, John Becker of Union Township in Clermont County, Andy Thompson of Marietta and Ron Maag of Lebanon -- and the right-to-life organizations in Cleveland and Cincinnati argue that the action is contrary to the intentions of the General Assembly and therefore illegal.\n\nLanguage in the state budget bill that was sent to the governor included a specific prohibition against expansion. But Gov. John Kasich vetoed that language. Another section on the bill, meanwhile, authorized the state\u2019s director of Medicaid to expand the program.\n\nThere was no attempt in the General Assembly to override the governor\u2019s line-item veto.\n\nThat was noted by Ohio Chief Justice Maureen O\u2019Connor, who authored the opinion. She was joined by Justices Paul Pfeifer and William O\u2019Neill. Justice Judith Ann Lanzinger concurred.\n\nThe legislators\u2019 argued that their intent was ignored because the bill, as it passed the General Assembly, included the prohibition. The appropriate time for determining the intent of the law, O\u2019Connor wrote, was after the governor signed the final version.\n\n\u201cThe Ohio Constitution expressly confers upon the governor authority to excise any item or items in an appropriation bill, and such disapproved items \u2018shall be void,\u2019 \u201c O\u2019Connor wrote. To operate otherwise \u201cwould operate as a statutory negation of the governor\u2019s constitutional powers.\u201d\n\nThe General Assembly\u2019s remedy, she wrote, is to override the governor\u2019s veto. \u201cThe legislature cannot circumvent this constitutional option by obtaining a writ from this court that forbids the Controlling Board to comply with the law, as that law is modified by the governor\u2019s veto.\u201d\n\nJustice Terrence O\u2019Donnell wrote a dissent arguing the case should have just been dismissed. He was joined by Justices Sharon Kennedy and Judith French.\n\nO\u2019Donnell argued that the case involved a political issue, not a legal issue for the court to hear.\n\n\u201cThe General Assembly has both the incentive to protect its prerogatives and the institutional mechanisms to do so. This case involves an impermissible judicial foray into the province of the legislature and raises a political question that is not justiciable and which we ought not to answer.\u201d\n\nThe ruling removes any doubt about whether the state will expand Medicaid. It already has been signing up new enrollees. The insurance coverage is to be available beginning Jan. 1.\n\nThe Kasich administration has estimated that at least half of the newly covered people already hold jobs, but do not get health care insurance through their employers. About 26,000 are veterans.\n\nThe administration's reaction was brief.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re pleased with the Court\u2019s ruling and glad that Ohio can now move forward,\u201d Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said.\n\nRandy Cole, the president of the Controlling Board, said its members had been comfortable in the belief that they acted with proper authority and that he was please with the decision.\n\nThe 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, whose lawyer Maurice Thompson represented the lawmakers and right to life groups, made no comment. A spokeswoman there said the decision was still being reviewed.\n\nKasich lobbied for Ohio to expand its Medicaid program since he unveiled his budget plans in early February. Thousands of Ohioans echoed those calls. A poll in June found 63 percent supported expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe money to pay for the expansion is authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It commits the federal government to pay 100 percent of the costs of expansion for three years. That figure gradually reduces to 90 percent of the costs by 2020. Ohio would be in line to receive an estimated $13.5 billion over that time.\n\nMajor hospitals and physician organizations, coalitions of churches, health care advocacy groups, labor unions and business organizations like the Ohio Chamber of Commerce all joined him in calling for expansion.\n\nBut the governor\u2019s fellow Republicans in the Legislature steadfastly refused to go along. Some cited opposition to such a major expansion of a public support program. Others expressed concern about size of the national debt. General opposition to health care reform, commonly called Obamacare, also was a reason.\n\nOhio law requires that before money can be spent, it must be formally be appropriated. Typically that is done through a vote of the General Assembly. But the Controlling Board also has the authority to adjust appropriations as additional reveneus become available.\n\nThe Controlling Board's vote on Oct. 21 gave the state's Department of Medicaid authority to spend newly received federal money earmarked to pay for expansion. That vote is what triggered the action in the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "john-kasich,maureen-oconnor,medicaid-expansion,medicaid-reform,ohio-supreme-court", "title": "Ohio Supreme Court rejects efforts to halt expansion of Medicaid to cover working poor", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ohio Supreme Court rejects efforts to halt expansion of Medicaid to cover working poor\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/12/ohio_supreme_court_rejects_eff.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/11917705-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11861888\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-20T21:57:01Z\", \"author\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"tags\": [\"john-kasich\",\"maureen-oconnor\",\"medicaid-expansion\",\"medicaid-reform\",\"ohio-supreme-court\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/11917705-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@RHiggsPD", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The court rejected legislators' arguments that expansion violated intent of General Assembly.
