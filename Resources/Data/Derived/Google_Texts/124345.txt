CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) — One of the world’s most famous motorcycles — the star-spangled “Captain America” chopper from “Easy Rider” — is hitting the auction block.

Or not.

As the skeptical Billy from the 1969 counterculture cult film might have asked: “What’s the reality, man?”

The red, white and blue, chromed-out Harley-Davidson to be auctioned off late Saturday in Calabasas comes with certificates of authenticity, according to the auction house, Profiles in History.

More than one version of the bike was built for the movie but according to the auction catalog, the one for sale is the only one that survived.

According to the catalog, it was used in the climactic crash sequence at the end and restored by Dan Haggerty, who had a bit part in the film and vouched for its authenticity. Peter Fonda, who played Wyatt and rode the bike in the movie, also vouched for its authenticity, according to the auction house.

The seller, Michael Eisenberg, also has a letter from the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, which displayed the bike for 12 years, saying Eisenberg’s is the only surviving “Captain America” bike.

But another collector, Gordon Granger of Texas, says he owns the authentic chopper and also has a certificate signed by Haggerty to prove it.

Haggerty acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1sQi3b6 ) this week that he authenticated and sold two “Captain America” bikes.

Now Haggerty says just one of the bikes is legitimate, and it’s Eisenberg’s — the one going up for sale with a $1 million minimum.
