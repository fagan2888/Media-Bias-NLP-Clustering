It did not elaborate.\n\nRussia and Iran are key allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government.\n\nMoscow and Washington have been trying to negotiate a cease-fire in Syria that they can take to their respective allies on the ground. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier Sunday that a \"provisional agreement\" had been reached, without elaborating.\n\nRussia also has a contract with Iran to deliver long-range S-300 air defense missiles, and Tehran has expressed interest in other Russian weapons such as Su-30 fighter jets.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nSyrian state TV says the death toll from three blasts in a Shiite suburb of Damascus has reached 50, with more than 200 wounded.\n\nIt says the bombings on Sunday targeted a vegetable market in the afternoon during rush hour.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a triple blast in Sayyida Zeinab, saying two IS fighters set off a car bomb before detonating their explosive belts.\n\nResidents said the attack was about a kilometer (0.6 mile) from one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines and did not damage it.\n\nA triple explosion in Sayyida Zeinab killed 45 people last month.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nThe Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a triple blast in a Damascus suburb that killed at least 22 people.\n\nThe Aamaq news agency, which is affiliated with the group, said two IS fighters detonated a car bomb before blowing up their explosive belts in Sayyida Zeinab, a Shiite neighborhood.\n\nResidents said the attack was about a kilometer (0.6 mile) from one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines and did not damage it.\n\nHezbollah's Al-Manar TV said the blasts killed 22 people, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 31 were killed and dozens wounded.\n\nDifferent figures are not uncommon in the chaotic aftermath of such attacks.\n\nA triple explosion in Sayyida Zeinab killed 45 people last month.\n\n___\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nHezbollah's Al-Manar TV says explosions in a suburb of the Syrian capital killed 22 people and wounded dozens.\n\nAl-Manar said Sunday's blasts were caused by a car bomb and two suicide attackers. Hezbollah is fighting alongside Syrian government forces and maintains a large presence in the Sayyida Zeinab area, where the blasts took place.\n\nSyrian state TV showed still images of people running, damaged homes and billowing smoke. It provided no death toll. State TV earlier said two of the blasts were car bombs while the other two were suicide attackers on foot.\n\nSayyida Zeinab is home to one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines.\n\nThe blasts came hours after two explosions in the central city of Homs killed and wounded scores of people.\n\nA triple explosion in Sayyida Zeinab killed 45 people last month.\n\n___\n\n5 p.m.\n\nSyrian state TV says four explosions went off in a predominantly Shiite suburb of the capital Damascus.\n\nThe TV had no immediate details but the pro-government Ad-Dunya TV station says the blasts on Sunday in Sayyida Zeinab killed and wounded a \"large number\" of people.\n\nThe Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV says the blasts occurred near a Shiite hospital in the suburb just south of Damascus. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV reports two blasts near al-Sadr hospital, saying they inflicted casualties.\n\nSayyida Zeinab is home to one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines.\n\nThe blasts came hours after two explosions in the central city of Homs killed and wounded scores of people.\n\nA triple explosion in Sayyida Zeinab killed 45 people last month.\n\n___\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nSyrian state TV says two blasts in the central city of Homs have killed 14 people and wounded 29.\n\nThe TV report said Sunday's blasts struck in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa - a frequent target for similar explosions.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first blast was caused by a vehicle rigged with explosives. It said it was not immediately clear if the second was caused by a car bomb or a suicide attacker wearing an explosive belt.\n\nHoms, once dubbed the capital of the Syrian revolution, has been hit with a wave of explosions in recent months, killing and wounding scores of people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has told Russia's defense minister that the Syrian conflict can only be resolved through a political process", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has told Russia's defense minister that the Syrian conflict can only be resolved through a political process", "title": "The Latest: Iran, Russia discuss Syria conflict", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160221/news/302219938/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160221/news/302219938/EP/1/1/EP-302219938.jpg&updated=201602211301&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has told Russia's defense minister that the Syrian conflict can only be resolved through a political process", "title": "The Latest: Iran, Russia discuss Syria conflict", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160221/news/302219938/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160221/news/302219938/AR/0/AR-302219938.jpg&updated=201602211301&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Nation/World, Associated Press", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2016-02-21", "modified_time": "2016-02-21T17:01:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Syrian state TV showed still images of people running, damaged homes and billowing smoke.\nState TV earlier said two of the blasts were car bombs while the other two were suicide attackers on foot.\nThe Latest: Iran, Russia discuss Syria conflicthelloIn this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian citizens gather at the scene where two blasts exploded in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa, in Homs province, Syria, Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016.\n___10:25 a.m.Syrian state TV says two blasts in the central city of Homs have killed 14 people and wounded 29.\nA triple explosion in Sayyida Zeinab killed 45 people last month."}
