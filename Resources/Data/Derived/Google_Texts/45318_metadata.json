He wrote:\n\n[I]f America is going to be the world\u2019s policeman, on some scale or another, that has to be backed by a supportive culture among the citizenry. And that culture is not going to be \u201cHans Morgenthau\u2019s foreign policy realism,\u201d or \u201cGeorge Kennan\u2019s Letter X,\u201d or even Clausewitz\u2019s treatise On War. Believe it or not, those are too intellectual for the American public. And so it must be backed by\u2026a fairly martial culture amongst the American citizenry. And that probably will mean a fairly high level of gun ownership and a fairly high degree of skepticism about gun control.\n\nIf you think America can sustain its foreign policy interventionism, or threat of such, without a fairly martial culture at home, by all means make your case. But I am skeptical. I think it is far more likely that if you brought about gun control, and the cultural preconditions for successful gun control, America\u2019s world role would fundamentally change and America\u2019s would no longer play a global policeman role, for better or worse.\n\nThis is a pretty novel argument, I admit, whose best feature is that it eschews the religious faith that liberals put in the ability of government regulations to reduce gun ownership (let alone violence). Just because there is a ban on something doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t find a way of getting it. (A little meth anyone?)\n\nStill, to use Cowen's own words, I am skeptical.\n\nFor starters, if Cowen doesn\u2019t believe that gun restrictions would actually deter people from acquiring guns, how precisely will they change the culture? Perhaps he thinks, as many conservatives do, that rules and regulations, even when ineffective in achieving their intended purpose, can be useful signaling mechanisms of other things. For example, anti-cussing laws (which still exist), may not stop people from cussing, but they communicate social disapproval of cussing. But such laws usually mirror \u2014 not mold \u2014 cultural attitudes and so expecting anti-gun laws to change gun attitudes seems to put the cart before the horse. In other words, even if Cowen is right that support for gun rights leads to foreign policy adventurism, gun regulations won't actually change that. To stop foreign policy adventurism one just has to make the case to stop foreign policy adventurism, not engineer a cultural shift.\n\nMore fundamentally, I note in my column at The Week, as far as libertarians are concerned, to the extent that there is a connection between gun rights and foreign policy, it runs in the direction opposite to what Cowen suggests:\n\nThe central political problem for conservatives is maintaining virtue; for liberals equality; and for libertarians liberty \u2014 or avoiding government tyranny. This requires not just maintaining a balance of power \u2014 or checks and balances \u2014 among the three branches of government, but also between the government and the citizenry. Libertarians fear that a government that disarms its citizens while arming itself to the hilt shifts the balance of power and precludes the possibility of any serious resistance.\n\nThis vastly increases the danger that the government will conscript them without their consent for its overseas adventurism.\n\nGo here to read the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A response to Tyler Cowen", "title": "Does the Libertarian Support for Gun Rights Lead to U.S. Foreign Policy Adventurism?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/15/does-the-libertarian-support-for-gun-rig", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1450192460649.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1450192460649.jpg", "description": "A response to Tyler Cowen", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Does the Libertarian Support for Gun Rights Lead to U.S. Foreign Policy Adventurism?"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2015-12-15T15:36:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/shikha-dalmia"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "To stop foreign policy adventurism one just has to make the case to stop foreign policy adventurism, not engineer a cultural shift.\nIn other words, even if Cowen is right that support for gun rights leads to foreign policy adventurism, gun regulations won't actually change that.\nTyler Cowen made the interesting point last week that libertarians\u2019 support for gun rights was at odds with their disdain for America\u2019s foreign policy adventurism.\nAnd that culture is not going to be \u201cHans Morgenthau\u2019s foreign policy realism,\u201d or \u201cGeorge Kennan\u2019s Letter X,\u201d or even Clausewitz\u2019s treatise On War.\nBut such laws usually mirror \u2014 not mold \u2014 cultural attitudes and so expecting anti-gun laws to change gun attitudes seems to put the cart before the horse."}
