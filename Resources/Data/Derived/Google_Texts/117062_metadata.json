She claims they fought and he threw her to the ground, severely injuring her knees.\n\nMark claimed she was just a woman scorned and broke into his place, attacked him and he just defended himself. She sued for sexual battery.\n\nThe case settled Monday, in the middle of trial. The sexual battery claim was dropped and the only thing Mark admitted to was negligently causing her to fall and injure herself.\n\nNow this is where it gets bizarre. They agreed to her damages:\n\n-- Past medicals $64,155\n\n-- Future medicals $666,000\n\n-- Past non-economic damages $180,000\n\n-- Future non-economic damages (pain and suffering) $1.8 million\n\nGrand total: $2,710,155\n\nBut under the settlement, she agreed to ONLY go after Mark's insurance company to get payment -- NOT Salling.\n\nWe're told the insurance company -- State Farm -- already rejected the claim, but now there's a settlement signed by a judge.\n\nAnd get this ... under the settlement, Salling gets a cut of whatever Gorzela gets from State Farm. Yes, in case that didn't compute with you, Salling will get a cut because he believes State Farm owes him something for rejecting his initial claim in bad faith.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "TMZ.COM", "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Former \"Glee\" star Mark Salling has just agreed to pay a woman more than $2.7 million for knocking her to the ground in a furious fight over an alleged\u2026"}, "categoryID": "f2cb2570-104e-4c13-e20e-9186a7708dac, 911254cf-061f-4a3e-ff94-a87ffff56211, f261d39e-f751-4ecb-f12d-4d386e61929e, eb69ed93-1d5c-4d11-aa21-6409c005a774, 1cfd0b15-3a91-4db4-945c-9e49cfd58818, 707a644d-7c92-49ca-afb7-8acc73521a70, 54641d14-de0f-45ac-e5bc-cec47a4960de", "msapplication-task": "name=Celebrity Directory;action-uri=http://www.tmz.com/celebrity-directory;icon-uri=http://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/favicon.png", "news_keywords": "Mark Salling, Exclusive, TV, CELEBRITY JUSTICE \u2122, Money, Glee, Crime, Fights", "generator": "Crowd Fusion 2.0-enterprise", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#CF0000", "celebrityID": "2765f386-2822-436f-f85b-5412f7299e40", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "description": "Former \"Glee\" star Mark Salling has just agreed to pay a woman more than $2.7 million for knocking her to the ground in a furious fight over an alleged\u2026", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "robots": "all", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.tmz.com?adid=IE9pin", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "http://www.tmz.com", "description": "Former \"Glee\" star Mark Salling has just agreed to pay a woman more than $2.7 million for knocking her to the ground in a furious fight over an alleged\u2026", "title": "'Glee' Star Mark Salling Settles with Former GF in Fight Over Sexual Encounter", "url": "http://www.tmz.com/2015/03/25/mark-salling-settles-lawsuit-girlfriend-sexual-fight-insurance-money/", "image": "http://ll-media.tmz.com/2015/03/25/0325-mark-salling-roxanne-gorzela-03-1200x630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "articleID": "378ce47a-d341-11e4-914e-30342d324647", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3474\"", "article_summary": "'Glee' Star Mark Salling Settles with Former GF In Fight Over Sexual EncounterEXCLUSIVEFormer \"Glee\" star Mark Salling has just agreed to pay a woman more than $2.7 million for knocking her to the ground in a furious fight over an alleged sexual encounter ... and the settlement is absolutely bizarre.\nAnd get this ... under the settlement, Salling gets a cut of whatever Gorzela gets from State Farm.\nMark claimed she was just a woman scorned and broke into his place, attacked him and he just defended himself.\nWe're told the insurance company -- State Farm -- already rejected the claim, but now there's a settlement signed by a judge.\nThe sexual battery claim was dropped and the only thing Mark admitted to was negligently causing her to fall and injure herself."}
