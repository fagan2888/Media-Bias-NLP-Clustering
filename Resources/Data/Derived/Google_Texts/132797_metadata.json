He said his mother took offense when criticism came his way, but because of her illness, \u201cshe can\u2019t read about this stuff.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI grew up in the neighborhood where Eric Garner died,\u201d Mr. Donovan noted. \u201cNo one knows that about me.\u201d He recalled being raised \u201cnot knowing prejudice\u201d in a diverse, working-class apartment building in the neighborhood, Tompkinsville.\n\n\u201cA Puerto Rican family lived downstairs,\u201d he said. \u201cA black family lived across from us. And downstairs, was the Jewish family. My mother\u2019s Polish, my dad was Irish. I grew up knowing nothing different.\u201d\n\nContrary to suggestions that he steered the grand jury, Mr. Donovan said he never entered the grand jury\u2019s chambers and never met a single witness of the 50 who appeared. The case was handled by eight lawyers on his staff in whom Mr. Donovan said he has \u201cunwavering confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did everything proper,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent an extraordinary amount of resources.\u201d He urged the public to show greater deference to the grand jury\u2019s deliberations: \u201cPeople can disagree with it, but people ought to respect it.\u201d\n\nThe Garner family and an array of legal advocates, including the New York Civil Liberties Union and the office of the New York City public advocate, have filed suit to obtain transcripts of the grand jury proceedings. Mr. Donovan has opposed that suit, though he said he had sought permission from a court to share more information about the proceedings than he was ultimately allowed to release.\n\nHe said he was unable to characterize what additional information he asked the court to disclose.\n\nMr. Donovan warned that certain proposed changes to the system could undermine due process and the separation of powers. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Jonathan Lippman, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, have each proposed measures that would give extra scrutiny to cases involving police officers.\n\nWithin days of the Garner decision, Mr. Donovan said, \u201canother grand jury on Staten Island refused to indict a young African-American man for assaulting a public servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s asking to reveal those grand jury transcripts,\u201d he continued. \u201cNobody\u2019s saying that the system was broken then.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked for additional information about that case, a spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan said he was unable to speak further about a sealed matter.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe race in Mr. Grimm\u2019s congressional district, the 11th, which includes Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, has taken shape slowly. Mr. Donovan has not started to campaign in earnest, and only on Friday did the governor\u2019s office schedule the vote for May 5. Democrats are still choosing their candidate from a list that includes Councilman Vincent J. Gentile.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Donovan\u2019s powerful allies in the city elite have quietly reassured him that he can count on their support. For instance, at the wake for former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in January, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered his help. (Mr. Donovan recalled Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want to do this, but I\u2019ll support you in anything you do.\u201d)\n\nRobert M. Morgenthau, the retired Manhattan district attorney in whose office Mr. Donovan began his prosecutorial career, defended him as a \u201cman of integrity.\u201d A pillar of the city\u2019s Democratic establishment, Mr. Morgenthau offered a forceful character endorsement for his Republican prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll faithfully represent his constituents without fear or favor,\u201d said Mr. Morgenthau, who also opposes overhauling the grand jury system. Of the Garner case, Mr. Morgenthau said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would have voted, but I\u2019m confident that Donovan played it right down the middle.\u201d\n\nShould Mr. Donovan prevail, he would represent a contrast with Mr. Grimm, a volatile official who once threatened to hurl a reporter off a balcony in the United States Capitol. Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, said Mr. Donovan had told leaders in Washington that he would not \u201cembarrass the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nAmong his vices, Mr. Donovan included the New York Times crossword puzzle and infrequent trips to the movies.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Victor A. Brown, pastor of Mt. Sinai United Christian Church, where the Garner family often attends services, said he had never seen evidence of dishonesty or racial bias in Mr. Donovan, though the preacher said he felt consternation as to \u201cwhy the grand jury in the Garner case came back with the decision it came back with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDan Donovan has not done anything to demonstrate to me that he\u2019s anything other than an honest man,\u201d the preacher said. He declined to say if he believed Mr. Donovan could properly represent the members of his predominantly black congregation.\n\nWhile Mr. Grimm came to Congress in 2011 vowing to roadblock President Obama\u2019s agenda and to repeal the health care law enacted the previous year, Mr. Donovan said he favored an approach to the Affordable Care Act that would \u201cpiece by piece, tweak it so that it works better.\u201d\n\nMr. Donovan said that he took a traditional view of marriage, but that he expected same-sex marriage to become legal nationally and called himself \u201cvery respectful of people\u2019s privacy.\u201d\n\nHe offered only hesitant criticism of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who is an unpopular figure on Staten Island: \u201cThere were some missteps taken by the mayor, that I believe now he\u2019s very much trying to rectify.\u201d Mr. Donovan added he would gladly go golfing with the president, and counts Edward I. Koch and Robert F. Kennedy among his idols, along with Ronald Reagan.\n\nAlthough he opposes Mr. Obama\u2019s recent executive action on immigration, Mr. Donovan called it a \u201cterrible idea\u201d to impede the policy by blocking funding for the Department of Homeland Security, as some conservatives in Congress have done. Alluding to the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Donovan said, \u201cWe know the importance of having homeland security in this district.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150224192050, "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Donovan is the favorite to replace Representative Michael G.
