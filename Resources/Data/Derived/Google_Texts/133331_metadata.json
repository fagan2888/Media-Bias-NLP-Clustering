For example, Novant Health's Thomasville Medical Center in North Carolina cut its MRSA infection rates by 53 percent as the result of implementing a hand-hygiene protocol. The center implemented an internal communical campaign that included screen savers and yard signs to educate hospital workers about the importance of proper hand-washing. Hand-hygiene compliance increased 49 percent to 99 percent as a result of the campaign, according to the article.\n\nOther research indicates that the types of surfaces, not just the cleanliness of them, play a role in preventing HAI rates. When copper surfaces were added to intensive care units in three test hospitals, FierceHealthcare previously reported, HAI infection rates dropped by as much as 60 percent, taking researchers by surprise.\n\nFor MRSA in particular, implementing infection risk-assessment procedures as well as an alert system in the event of an infection is an effective strategy to combat its spread in clinical settings.\n\nBeyond the implications for patient health, it makes good business sense for hospitals to be ever-vigilant about reducing infection rates. One survey found that HAI rates are a major factor that patients consider when they decide where to receive care in a non-emergency situation.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the study (.pdf)\n\n- read the Becker's article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n7 strategies for preventing MRSA\n\nICU infections plunge 60% with copper surfaces\n\nHospital-acquired infections influence patients' hospital selection\n\nHospitals vs. MRSA: Pros and cons of screening all patients", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although proper hand-washing procedures are the best way to\u00a0reduce methicillin-resistant\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus\u00a0(MRSA)\u00a0while treating patients, a new study reveals hand hygiene itself is only one piece of the puzzle when combatting the infections in hospitals.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although proper hand-washing procedures are the best way to\u00a0reduce methicillin-resistant\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus\u00a0(MRSA)\u00a0while treating patients, a new study reveals hand hygiene itself is only one piece of the puzzle when combatting the infections in hospitals.", "title": "Hand-washing helps control MRSA, but may not be enough", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hand-washing-helps-control-mrsa-may-not-be-enough/2014-12-01", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,HAI-reduction programs,Hand Hygiene,handwashing,methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "For example, Novant Health's Thomasville Medical Center in North Carolina cut its MRSA infection rates by 53 percent as the result of implementing a hand-hygiene protocol.\nBeyond the implications for patient health, it makes good business sense for hospitals to be ever-vigilant about reducing infection rates.\nOther research indicates that the types of surfaces, not just the cleanliness of them, play a role in preventing HAI rates.\nOne survey found that HAI rates are a major factor that patients consider when they decide where to receive care in a non-emergency situation.\nThe report, published by the Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control Journal, reviews the substantial amount of research done on the link between clinical hand hygiene and the reduction in MRSA infections while admitting that unanswered questions remain."}
