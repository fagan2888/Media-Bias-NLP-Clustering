Anthony List v. Driehaus, in which the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a challenge to the Ohio ban on false statements in election campaigns; that was followed by a district court decision holding that law unconstitutional.\n\nBut there\u2019s another half to the Driehaus / Susan B. Anthony List litigation: a simple libel lawsuit that he had brought against the List based on its allegedly false statements. Friday, a 6th Circuit panel held that the statements likely weren\u2019t false after all \u2014 and at least that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence that the defendants knew they were false or likely false \u2014 and therefore threw out Driehaus\u2019s lawsuit. Here is the court\u2019s reasoning, with the factual details (long but readable):\n\nLeading up to the vote [on the Affordable Care Act], there had been significant debate over many aspects of the bill, including the possibility that it included taxpayer funding for abortion. Several anti-abortion advocates raised these concerns during that debate. In fact, then-congressman Steven Driehaus was one such advocate.\n\nDriehaus was a first-term U.S. Representative from Ohio\u2019s 1st Congressional District and an anti-abortion Democrat. He became an outspoken advocate of the \u201cno taxpayer funding for abortion in the PPACA\u201d movement, gave numerous interviews, and appeared on national television to insist that he would not vote for the PPACA without inclusion of the Stupak\u2013Pitts Amendment. The proposed Stupak\u2013Pitts Amendment added language to the PPACA expressly forbidding the use of taxpayer funds \u201cto pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion\u201d except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother.\n\nThe bill was brought to a vote on March 21, 2010, without the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and, despite his earlier statements, Driehaus voted for the PPACA anyway. Because the PPACA, as voted on and passed, contained no language to restrict taxpayer funding of abortions, several other congressmen denounced it as including taxpayer funding for abortion.\n\nThree days after the vote, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13535 (Mar. 24, 2010), in which he explained that \u201cit is necessary to establish an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that [f]ederal funds are not used for abortion services, (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a longstanding [f]ederal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment.\u201d The parties dispute the meaning and effect of this Order, but acknowledge that executive orders do not amend statutes. Debate continues as to whether the PPACA includes federal funding for abortion. But back in 2010, Driehaus was a first-term Congressman who had very publicly opposed the PPACA on his belief that it included taxpayer funding for abortion and then voted for it anyway.\n\nSBA List is an anti-abortion public-advocacy organization that also opposed the PPACA based on its own belief that the PPACA included taxpayer funding for abortion. See http://www.sba-list .org/ legislation/pro-life (last visited Feb. 27, 2015) (announcing its \u201ctwo main legislative priorities [as] ending all federal funding of abortion and ending taxpayer funding to Planned Parenthood\u201d). SBA List was not a political candidate; specifically, SBA List was not Driehaus\u2019s political opponent, nor has Driehaus asserted that SBA List supported or was in any way affiliated with his particular political opponent for his Ohio 1st Congressional District seat.\n\nWhen Driehaus campaigned for re-election in 2010, SBA List publicly criticized him, among other congressmen, for his vote on the PPACA on the basis that in doing so he had voted for \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d Four particular statements by SBA List are pertinent here.\n\n(1) In an August 9, 2010, press release, SBA List said that Driehaus \u201cvoted for a health care bill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\n\n(2) On September 28, 2010, SBA List purchased billboard space to say \u201cDriehaus voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion,\u201d but when Driehaus threatened the billboard company with a lawsuit, it refused to post the ad.\n\n(3) In an October 7, 2010, print advertisement, SBA List said: \u201cIt is a fact that Steve Driehaus has voted for a bill that includes taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d\n\n(4) In a radio ad that began running on October 19, 2010, SBA List said: \u201cSteve Driehaus voted for taxpayer funding of abortion when he cast his vote for the health care reform bill\u2026. Driehaus voted for taxpayer funding of abortion.\u201d\n\nGiven that Driehaus had campaigned as, and won his seat as, an anti-abortion candidate, this was a problem for his re-election prospects and it angered him. Despite his earlier concerns with the PPACA, Driehaus no longer viewed a vote for the PPACA as a vote for taxpayer-funded abortion. Therefore, he considered SBA List\u2019s statements about his vote to be untrue\u2026.\n\n[T]he district court [rejected the libel claim, reasoning] that: \u201c[A]s a matter of law, associating a political candidate with a mainstream political position, even if false, cannot constitute defamation.\u201d \u2026The district court\u2019s broad First Amendment proclamation is a misstatement of First Amendment defamation law and the grant of summary judgment based on that misstatement is clearly incorrect\u2026.\n\n[Nonetheless, u]nder Ohio law, \u201cit is for the court to decide as a matter of law whether certain statements alleged to be defamatory are actionable or not.\u201d \u2026 \u201cTo establish defamation, the plaintiff must show (1) that a false statement of fact was made, (2) that the statement was defamatory, (3) that the statement was published, (4) that the plaintiff suffered injury as a proximate result of the publication, and (5) that the defendant acted with the requisite degree of fault in publishing the statement.\u201d \u2026\n\n[1.] Ohio courts \u201cha[ve] defined a false statement as a statement that sets forth matters which are not true or statements without grounds in truth or fact. A statement is not a \u2018false statement\u2019 if, even though it is misleading and fails to disclose all relevant facts, the statement has some truth in it. Moreover, a statement that is subject to different interpretations is not \u2018false.\u2019\u201c \u2026 \u201cIt is sufficient [in defending a defamation action] to show that the imputation is substantially true, or as it is often put, to justify the \u2018gist,\u2019 the \u2018sting,\u2019 or the substantial truth of the defamation.\u201d \u2026\n\nDriehaus argues that the statements were false because the PPACA contains no \u201cappropriation\u201d for funding elective abortion anywhere in its text and therefore does not \u201cprovide\u201d federal funding for abortion. SBA List, on the other hand, points out that in its actual statements it used the word \u201cincludes\u201d and never used the word \u201cprovides\u201d or \u201cappropriation.\u201d Based solely on Driehaus\u2019s construction of his claim and SBA List\u2019s response, the true substance of these statements appears to be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nMoreover, given the debate prior to passage of the PPACA as to whether it includes taxpayer funding for abortion, the gist or sting of the statements appears to have at least some truth, to be substantially true, or to be subject to differing interpretations. Driehaus vocally opposed the PPACA because of his concerns about federal funding for abortions but he then voted for it anyway despite the absence of his desired language (the Stupak-Pitts Amendment) in the final version. The Executive Order adds language, but is not part of the PPACA and does not alter the statutory text. In fact, debate continues over the meaning and effect of the PPACA.\n\nDue to the low threshold we have here for a finding of \u201ctruth,\u201d we need not resolve this debate at a higher level of specificity. For SBA List to overcome Driehaus\u2019s defamation claim, it is enough that the statements had some truth, were substantially true, or were subject to differing interpretations. Driehaus\u2019s own change of position demonstrates that they were\u2026.\n\n[2.] For a public official to prove fault, he must satisfy the actual-malice standard; he must prove that the defendant made the statement \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard [for] whether it was false or not.\u201d \u2026\n\nEven if Driehaus could prove that the PPACA does not include any taxpayer funding of abortion, thus making SBA List\u2019s statements actually or technically false, we can find no evidence to support Driehaus\u2019s claim that SBA List \u201cknew\u201d the statements were false or \u201centertained serious doubts as to their truth.\u201dRather, all of the evidence supports a finding that SBA List did then, and does now, believe emphatically that the statements are true: that the PPACA includes taxpayer funding for abortions. Moreover, given that SBA List\u2019s mission is \u201cending all federal funding of abortion,\u201d SBA List would have no cause to criticize or campaign against either the PPACA or Driehaus if it did not believe that the PPACA included taxpayer funded abortions. Rather, one would expect SBA List to support an anti-abortion candidate, particularly one who had been as outspoken as Driehaus had been in opposing federal taxpayer funding of abortion.\n\nDriehaus cannot show any basis by which we could find actual malice. Consequently, SBA List is entitled to summary judgment on this defamation claim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The libel half of the case; the other half, which dealt with a challenge to the Ohio false statements law, went to the Supreme Court in 2014.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The libel half of the case; the other half, which dealt with a challenge to the Ohio false statements law, went to the Supreme Court in 2014.", "title": "Former Rep.
