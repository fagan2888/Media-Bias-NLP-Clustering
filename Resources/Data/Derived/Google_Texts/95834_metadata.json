It depends on who you ask.\n\nThe issue gained traction after Michelle Rouillard, director of the California Department of Managed Health Care, sent a letter to Anthem Blue Cross and several other insurance firms in August warning providers that state law requires insurers to not deny woman abortions. \u201cThus, all health plans must treat maternity services and legal abortion neutrally,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRouillard wrote that state law provides an exemption for religious institutions.\n\n\u201cAlthough health plans are required to cover legal abortions, no individual health care provider, religiously sponsored health carrier, or health care facility may be required by law or contract in any circumstance to participate in the provision of or payment for a specific service if they object to doing so for reason of conscience or religion,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cNo person may be discriminated against in employment or professional privileges because of such objection.\u201d\n\nHowever, two legal groups have filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, alleging the California rule puts faith-based organizations in a position to violate their conscience.\n\nThe August letter followed protests by mostly non-Catholic faculty at two Jesuit schools, Loyola Marymount University and Santa Clara University, over the schools\u2019 plans to drop abortion coverage from their employee insurance plans.\n\nEarlier this month, California\u2019s Catholic bishops filed a federal civil rights complaint over the state requirement, claiming that the DMHC discriminated against those morally opposed to abortion, and requested an investigation.\n\n\u201cIt is a flagrant violation of their civil rights and deepest moral convictions, and is government coercion of the worst kind,\u201d said a statement from Bishop Robert McElroy, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of San Francisco and chairman of the Institutional Concerns Committee of the California Catholic Conference.\n\nSeven churches in California received notifications from their insurers that elective surgical abortion coverage would be required as part of their employee health plans, according to Casey Mattox, an attorney with the Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nOn Oct. 9, ADF and the Life Legal Defense Foundation filed a complaint with HHS saying the California abortion-coverage mandate violated the 2004 Weldon Amendment, a measure passed every year, which prohibits funding from the HHS, Labor and Education departments going to states that don\u2019t allow conscience exemptions to abortion coverage requirements.\n\nIn a statement, the California agency says it only regulates \u201chealth plans,\u201d not the \u201cpurchasers\u201d of health coverage.\n\nThe churches\u2019 complaint suggests the state receives an estimated $40 billion from Labor Department funding each year. \u201cCalifornia accepted those funds with full knowledge of the requirements of the Weldon Amendment, but it has chosen to ignore this law,\u201d they wrote in their complaint.\n\nNonetheless, the insurance plans have the burden to cover abortion, said Maggie Crosby, senior staff attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has not required churches \u2014 or any other employers \u2014 to cover abortion,\u201d Crosby said in a statement. \u201cIt has clarified long standing law which regulates commercial insurance plans.\u201d\n\nThat requirement has been in place since 2002, built on a state law passed in 1975, according to the August letter.\n\n\u201cBecause insurers must offer comprehensive care, an employer can\u2019t use a subpar health plan to deny a woman the full range of reproductive health care options,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cIf an employer wants to deny its employees the comprehensive coverage required, it can self-insure.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether abortion should be covered under health insurance was raised during debates over Obamacare. HHS crafted an accommodation to its contraception mandate for some religious employers that would require third-party administrators to pay for birth control services, but ongoing litigation focuses on whether the accommodation is sufficient.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU didn\u2019t ask for such an accommodation in California and DMHC didn\u2019t create one,\u201d Mattox said in a statement. \u201cACLU asked DMHC to require every health care plan in the state to include elective abortion coverage as \u2018basic healthcare.\u2019 DMHC agreed.\u201d\n\nA similar dispute is brewing in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nOn Thursday (Oct. 23), ADF and six other organizations sent the City Council of the District of Columbia a letter arguing that a proposed bill violates federal law by forcing the groups to provide abortion coverage through their insurance plans.\n\nThe group argues that the District\u2019s proposed Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees for any reproductive health decision, including abortion, which would require employers to provide health insurance for abortions regardless of the employers\u2019 beliefs or convictions.\n\nThe letter argues that the bill would violate the law since the Hobby Lobby ruling earlier this year, when the Supreme Court ruled that the Hobby Lobby chain and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of the birth control mandate.\n\nClashes between the government and religious groups have intensified over health care related to women in recent years. More than 100 for-profit and nonprofit groups have sued over the contraceptive coverage required under the federal Affordable Care Act; the Supreme Court ruling only applied to for-profit businesses.\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RNS-ABORTION-CHURCHES, California, United States, North America, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, American Civil Liberties Union, United States government, Abortion, Human rights and civil liberties, Religion, Workplace discrimination, Political ethics, Religious issues, Social affairs, Social issues, Women's health, Health, Financial services, Industries, Business, Industry regulation, Government business and finance, Government and politics, Government regulations, Health care industry, Christianity, Personnel, Labor issues, Legislation, Legislature, Political issues, National courts, National governments, Courts, Judiciary", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Religious groups are battling the state of California over whether employee health insurance plans require them to pay for abortions and some forms of contraception that some find immoral.", "title": "Is California forcing churches to pay for abortions?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/is-california-forcing-churches-to-pay-for-abortions/2014/10/24/60b10e7a-5ba6-11e4-9d6c-756a229d8b18_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/is-california-forcing-churches-to-pay-for-abortions/2014/10/24/60b10e7a-5ba6-11e4-9d6c-756a229d8b18_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "RNS-ABORTION-CHURCHES, California, United States, North America, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, American Civil Liberties Union, United States government, Abortion, Human rights and civil liberties, Religion, Workplace discrimination, Political ethics, Religious issues, Social affairs, Social issues, Women's health, Health, Financial services, Industries, Business, Industry regulation, Government business and finance, Government and politics, Government regulations, Health care industry, Christianity, Personnel, Labor issues, Legislation, Legislature, Political issues, National courts, National governments, Courts, Judiciary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "60b10e7a-5ba6-11e4-9d6c-756a229d8b18", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Religious groups are battling the state of California over whether employee health insurance plans require them to pay for abortions and some forms of contraception that some find immoral."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd590e\"", "article_summary": "Religious groups are battling the state of California over whether employee health insurance plans require them to pay for abortions and some forms of contraception that some find immoral.\nIn a statement, the California agency says it only regulates \u201chealth plans,\u201d not the \u201cpurchasers\u201d of health coverage.\nClashes between the government and religious groups have intensified over health care related to women in recent years.\nSo is the state forcing churches to pay for abortions?\nRouillard wrote that state law provides an exemption for religious institutions."}
