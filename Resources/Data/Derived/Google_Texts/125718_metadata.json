We joined millions of other Americans whose individual market health plans died after Democrats lied about our ability to keep the plans and doctors we liked. President Obama tried to \u201cfix\u201d the mess he created. But as usual, the federal government\u2019s solutions have made things even worse.\n\nConfusion and chaos reign not just in our household, but across the country.\n\nAs I reported last fall, our letter from Anthem BlueCross BlueShield of Colorado informed us that we could no longer keep our high-deductible PPO plan with a wide doctor network because of \u201cchanges from health care reform (also called the Affordable Care Act or ACA).\u201d The ObamaCare engineers determined that the affordable plan we liked was \u201csubstandard,\u201d forcing us to enter the ObamaCare health insurance exchange, purchase a severely limited HMO plan or seek some other alternative in the shrinking private marketplace.\n\nWe reluctantly took steps to sign up with the exchange, spending hours on Colorado\u2019s busted Web site, hours on the phone with shady reps and weeks waiting for some proof that we were in fact \u201cenrolled.\u201d\n\nThen, a few months later, we received another letter from Anthem informing us that we could keep our current plan until November 2014. We signed a form stating that we wanted to do so and took steps to cancel our pending ObamaCare enrollment. Next, we got another letter stating that our current Anthem plan would be canceled on May 1, 2014.\n\nThen, last week, Obama announced by administrative fiat that we could keep our plan for another two years.\n\nSimple question: Will our plan be canceled on May 1, or will we have it for another two years? Or what?\n\nWe called the number on our Anthem health-insurance card last week. Nobody picked up the phone after waiting on hold for nearly an hour.\n\nSecond try: Twenty minutes on hold. Then, we were transferred to another number. Another 20-minute wait. Finally, a human being came on the line. After explaining our situation and posing our simple question, the rep put us on hold again. The eventual answer: He didn\u2019t know.\n\nAfter taking special note of our lengthy correspondence file, the rep then proceeded to give us the same number we had initially contacted in the first place.\n\nIn response to our question about the contradictory information from his company and from the government, he informed us that Anthem has received \u201cmillions of calls\u201d that it couldn\u2019t process and apologized. He repeated the old phone number for us to call so we could fatten our lengthy correspondence file even more. And then: Click.\n\nThe left will blame the insurance companies, as always. But at the center of the current mess are Obama\u2019s desperate and now almost weekly Democratic face-saving decrees to \u201cfix\u201d a fundamentally broken government racket.\n\nHalf of the nation\u2019s state insurance commissioners rejected the original \u201cfix\u201d for noncompliant plans last fall. Several still haven\u2019t made decisions on that first \u201cfix,\u201d let alone the new ones for 2015 or 2016. Nobody can count on any state that went along with the original \u201cfix\u201d to sign on to the subsequent ones.
