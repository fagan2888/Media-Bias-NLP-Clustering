Leah: Imagine having 24/7 access to your doctor without

needing insurance - that's a medical model Dr.

David Sachs is trying out.

So the usual patient experience is that they call...

3 VO/MINI-DISCW2 55

3 SOTW3 43

....and then they come to the waiting room and they

fill out forms...

4 VO/MINI-DISCW4 53

- and a lot of empty desk space.

But at Platte Medical Clinic, that's the point.

4 SOTW5 44

...and this will be quite different from usual patient

experience.

1 VO/MINI-DISCW6 55

No paperwork or insurance politics here - because,

Doctor Brian Sachs doesn't acccept it.

1 SOTW7 44

You can think of it like a 24-hour gym and in exchange

you get to access me as much as you need or want to.

2 SOTW8 43

It's essentially a pay for service - except instead

of buying an insurance policy, you're buying a membership.

3 VO/MINI-DISCW9 55

It's called 'direct primary care' - where patients

pay a flat monthly fee for anytime-access to their

doctor - and experts say it could be cheaper in the

long-run.

3 SOTW10 45

The research shows that if patients had had access

to primary care before they got into a more complicated

situation, the costs of delivering healthcare overall

would be less.

4 SOTW11 44

We're getting tired of the insurance game.

1 VO/MINI-DISCW12 55

Dr.

Sachs says the model means less politics for patients

-

1 SOTW13 44

I didn't go into medicine to work for them.

I went in to be able to take care of the patient.

2 VO/MINI-DISCW14 55

- and cleaner countertops, too.

2 SOTW15 43

Phenomenally less paperwork, yeah.

Leah: Platte Medical officially opens Aug.

The clinic has already signed up 50 patients, with

the goal of eventually reaching 500.

In Platteville, I'm LL for WISC N3.
