(AP) - Immigrants living in the state illegally will soon be able to obtain a driver\u2019s license under a new program designed to teach the rules of the road to people who likely have been behind the wheel for years anyway.\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles is expecting thousands of immigrants to begin taking the steps needed to obtain a new state-issued driver\u2019s license or learning permit. Beginning at noon Dec. 1, immigrants 16 years and older can begin making online appointments on the DMV\u2019s website to schedule a written test for a Drive Only License. Appointments can only be made online.\n\nThe program, approved by the General Assembly in 2013, officially begins Jan. 2 and could affect tens of thousands of drivers who cannot establish their legal presence in the U.S. or may not have a Social Security number.\n\nEight states already offer such licenses, according to the DMV. The number will grow to 10 when Connecticut and California begin issuing them in January.\n\nConnecticut officials have been preparing nearly two years for the new program by upgrading outdated Spanish versions of the written test and driver\u2019s manual and creating new tests in French, Polish, Portuguese and Italian. There are also plans to develop a test in Mandarin Chinese. The DMV has also been meeting with immigrant advocacy groups to train them in how to help their clients study the driver\u2019s manual and learn where to take the required eight-hour, safe driving practices course.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make this work as easily as possible for our undocumented residents who may have been waiting a long time to obtain this credential, which can open many doors for them,\u201d said DMV spokesman William Seymour.\n\nThe license will be stamped with the words \u201cnot for federal identification.\u201d If immigrants pass the test, there\u2019s a three-month practice driving time before the road test is administered, Seymour said.\n\nSome immigrant advocacy groups estimate that as many as 200,000 eligible immigrants live in Connecticut without legal permission, Seymour said.\n\nWerner Oyanadel, executive director of the state\u2019s Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission, estimates that about 65,000 people could seek Drive Only Licenses. But that number could change depending on whether President Barack Obama\u2019s new executive order on immigration will allow parents of drivers who\u2019ve obtained regular licenses under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to also acquire regular licenses.\n\nOyanadel sees the program as a way to ensure public safety and improve the lives of these immigrants and their families.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is people are driving back-and-forth from work to home,\u201d Oyanadel said, adding that the difference now is that they\u2019ll be properly trained. Like other drivers, they must register their vehicles and prove they have purchased insurance.\n\nParticipants must bring two forms of identification when they apply for a Drive Only License and two pieces of mail from different sources to prove they\u2019re living in Connecticut.\n\nWhen they schedule an appointment for the written test, they must also sign an affidavit indicating they will file an application to legalize their immigration status when eligible. The DMV also plans to check the applicants\u2019 criminal history. If they have a Connecticut felony, they will not be eligible for a Drive Only credential.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Immigrants living in the state illegally will soon be able to obtain a driver's license under a new program designed to teach the rules of the road to people who likely have been behind the wheel for years anyway.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/26/connecticut-gearing-up-for-immigrant-licenses/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Immigrants living in the state illegally will soon be able to obtain a driver\u2019s license under a new program designed to teach the rules of the road to people who likely have been behind the wheel for years anyway.", "title": "Driver\u2019s licenses to be issued to immigrants soon"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Immigrants living in the state illegally will soon be able to obtain a driver's license under a new program designed to teach the rules of the road to people who likely have been behind the wheel for", "card": "summary", "title": "Driver\u2019s licenses to be issued to immigrants soon"}, "Author": "SUSAN HAIGH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The Department of Motor Vehicles is expecting thousands of immigrants to begin taking the steps needed to obtain a new state-issued driver\u2019s license or learning permit.\nWhen they schedule an appointment for the written test, they must also sign an affidavit indicating they will file an application to legalize their immigration status when eligible.\nBeginning at noon Dec. 1, immigrants 16 years and older can begin making online appointments on the DMV\u2019s website to schedule a written test for a Drive Only License.\nWerner Oyanadel, executive director of the state\u2019s Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission, estimates that about 65,000 people could seek Drive Only Licenses.\nHARTFORD, Conn.
