Barry W. Lynn. \u201cState officials simply can\u2019t get into the business of deciding that some unpopular messages are \u2018offensive\u2019 and must be banned.\u201d\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based organization dedicated to eradicate all traces of Christianity from the public square insists that the Satanic Temple proclaims itself to be \u201ca religious organization dedicated to principles of empathy, personal autonomy and empirical reasoning.\u201d\n\nAUSCS also justifies the inclusion of the temple\u2019s display on the state capital\u2019s rotunda by saying that last year, a wide array of themes were accepted, while the Satanic Temple\u2019s was not.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, the rotunda housed a nativity scene, an atheist-themed message, a \u2018Festivus Pole\u2019 and a rendering of the Pastafarian Flying Spaghetti Monster \u2014 yet the Temple was denied access on the grounds that the proposed display was \u2018grossly offensive.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor years, the rotunda has been designated as an open forum for private speech where private groups are allowed to erect holiday-themed displays at their own expense every December. Because eligibility for space is determined by the Department of Management Services (DMS), AUSCS decided to get ahead of the game this year months before submissions were made by writing a letter to the agency on behalf of the Satanic Temple, arguing that a rejection of its display would violate its client\u2019s freedom of religion, freedom of speech and right to equal protection under the law.\n\nAfter AUSCS received the decision it was looking for \u2014 gaining the admission of the temple\u2019s proposed display \u2014 it pressed its plea further, threatening the DMS that its failure to omit the \u201coffensive\u201d label from the Satanic Temple\u2019s display would result in legal action alleging a violation of the temple\u2019s constitutional rights. The department backed down and will not post the written warning on the Satanic Temple\u2019s display mocking Christianity, come December 22.\n\nDespite the victory, AUSCS attorneys argue that such offensive displays mocking Christmas must be allowed so that everyone\u2019s voice can be heard, whether appropriate or not.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are pleased that the state has finally agreed to allow the Satanic Temple\u2019s display, our clients should not have been forced to find legal counsel and plan a lawsuit just to get access to an open forum,\u201d AUSCS Senior Litigation Counsel Gregory M. Lipper contended.\n\nAs offensive as they want to be?\n\nLipper also insists that the government doesn\u2019t have the right to censor any expression having to do with religion at the rotunda \u2014 even when it is intended to mock or denigrate another religion. This is opposed to the motivation behind Christian Christmas displays, which is primarily to express faith-based messages about the holiday and its significance.\n\nHowever, Lipper believes that denigrating another religion is equivalent to expressing one\u2019s religious beliefs, asserting that the First Amendment supports free speech regardless of how offensive or inappropriate the message is.\n\n\u201cThe state can\u2019t give itself the authority to decide whether certain religious messages are \u2018offensive\u2019 \u2013 it needs to allow everyone\u2019s speech or no one\u2019s speech,\u201d Lipper continued.\n\nChristian displays not a statement \u2026 a message of love\n\nAddressing one of AUSCS\u2019s frequent arguments around Christmastime every year that nativity scenes have constituted the government\u2019s establishment of religion, Florida Prayer Network President Pam Olsen says Florida is no different from the rest of the country when it comes to Christmas displays and that Christian themes signify a freedom of expression, not an establishment of religion.\n\n\"There's a lot of state capitols besides ours that are having Nativity scenes,\" Olsen declared. \"It's not government-sponsored religion, it's freedom of religion, which makes America great.\u201d\n\nOlsen insists that the intention behind Christian Christmas displays is not to stir up controversy over state-sponsored religion, but simply to wish everyone a merry Christmas through a Christian message of hope and love.\n\n\u201cOur heart is not to cause any contention \u2014 it's simply to say, \u2018Merry Christmas,\u2019\u201d Olsen concluded. \u201cIt's really important that people understand that.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "With annual lawsuits contesting the constitutionality of Christian Christmas displays around government buildings becoming as much of a winter staple as Black Friday and photos booths at the local mall with Santa, many are finding the decision of officials from Florida\u2019s state capitol confounding, which allows the Satanic Temple to erect a \u201choliday display\u201d in Tallahassee\u2019s rotunda.", "og": {"url": "http://onenewsnow.com/legal-courts/2014/12/14/fl-state-capital-oks-satanic-christmas-display", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "With annual lawsuits contesting the constitutionality of Christian Christmas displays around government buildings becoming as much of a winter staple as Black Friday and photos booths at the local mall with Santa, many are finding the decision of officials from Florida\u2019s state capitol confounding, which allows the Satanic Temple to erect a \u201choliday display\u201d in Tallahassee\u2019s rotunda.", "title": "FL state capital OKs Satanic Christmas display"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "description": "With annual lawsuits contesting the constitutionality of Christian Christmas displays around government buildings becoming as much of a winter staple as Black Friday and photos booths at the local mall with Santa, many are finding the decision of officials from Florida\u2019s state capitol confounding, which allows the Satanic Temple to erect a \u201choliday display\u201d in Tallahassee\u2019s rotunda.", "site": "@onenewsnowcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "FL state capital OKs Satanic Christmas display"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "America,atheist temple prime real estate,AUSCS Executive Director,AUSCS Senior Litigation Counsel,Barry W.
