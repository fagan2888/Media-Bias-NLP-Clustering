I'm still reaching out to a few of the attendees to get their take but, in the meantime, here's a readout of the meeting just sent to the White House's press list:\n\nToday, Secretary Sebelius, CMS Director Marilyn Tavenner, Valerie Jarrett, Chris Jennings and Denis McDonough met with health insurance executives to discuss open enrollment and ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The administration is committed to working in partnership with the insurers so we can successfully meet the great demand people have shown for the affordable health care coverage at the heart of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSpecifically, we are collaborating closely with the insurers to address problems we have witnessed in what are called \u201c834\u201d forms and in direct enrollment. To that end, we have worked with the insurers and the \u201calpha teams\u201d we jointly established made up of insurers\u2019 technology experts and CMS technology experts, to iron out kinks in the both the 834 forms and in direct enrollment. These \u201calpha teams\u201d are working side-by-side to correct challenges as soon as we see them. The teams have been meeting virtually with CMS and CGI and with tech teams associated with operations leaders on the industry.\n\nDrawing on the industry techs\u2019 experience in this way is a part of the \u201ctech surge\u201d that is incrementally improving performance at HealthCare.Gov. Today\u2019s announcement is another way we are ensuring that we are doing everything possible to address the technical issues to ensure that all the American people who need it can purchase the affordable health care coverage made available as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAttendees included:\n\n\u2022 Mark Bertolini, CEO, Aetna\n\n\u2022 Bruce Broussard, CEO, Humana\n\n\u2022 Chet Burrell, CEO, CareFirst\n\n\u2022 Patrick Geraghty, CEO, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida\n\n\u2022 Jay Gellert, President & CEO, Health Net, Inc.\n\n\u2022 Patricia Hemingway Hall, President & CEO, Health Care Services Corporation\n\n\u2022 Daniel J.
