Hospitals with buildings that have significant structural deficiencies or a probability of collapse during an earthquake greater than the threshold set by the state are required to remove those buildings from service by 2020 or be retrofitted.\n\nThe more stringent requirement that starts in 2030 requires all acute care hospitals to be deemed safe and reasonably capable of providing services to the public following an earthquake. The seismic activity laws were toughened in 1994 after the Northridge earthquake damaged or rendered unusable 10 hospitals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost 90 percent of acute care hospital buildings in California are ready to meet a state hospital earthquake safety requirement that goes into effect in 2020, but in 2030 the law gets even stricter.", "csrf-token": "NPxvNK58rFPm1gHbH1naRw1pnNfhx9z2aTQp7hscIwA=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Trends4_190x127.jpg?1448315760", "description": "Most hospitals are ready for California's seismic standards, but what about the next round?", "card": "summary", "title": "California Hospitals Nearly Ready for 2020 Earthquake Requirements"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Trends4_190x127.jpg?1448315760", "type": "Article", "description": "Most hospitals are ready for California's seismic standards, but what about the next round?", "title": "California Hospitals Nearly Ready for 2020 Earthquake Requirements"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "2020 hospitals earthquake, hospital facilities temblor, hospitals seismic readiness, hospital buildings earthquake readiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce73b\"", "article_summary": "While hospitals that fail to meet the seismic safety requirement after 2020 will face losing their licenses, David is optimistic that won\u2019t happen.\nClose to 90 percent of acute care hospital buildings in California are ready to meet a state hospital earthquake safety requirement that goes into effect in 2020, but in 2030 the law gets even stricter.\nThe seismic activity laws were toughened in 1994 after the Northridge earthquake damaged or rendered unusable 10 hospitals.\nThe more stringent requirement that starts in 2030 requires all acute care hospitals to be deemed safe and reasonably capable of providing services to the public following an earthquake.\nHospitals with buildings that have significant structural deficiencies or a probability of collapse during an earthquake greater than the threshold set by the state are required to remove those buildings from service by 2020 or be retrofitted."}
