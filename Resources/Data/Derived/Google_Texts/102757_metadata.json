Yet a recently publicized video of remarks he made at a panel in 2013, along with 2 other videos in the same vein, has now made him the poster child of the elitist progressives\u2019 contempt for the American people, and their sacrifice of prudence and reason to raw political power.\n\nIn the video Gruber explains the spin and lies the Dems used to give cover to their Congressmen so they could vote for Obamacare. Especially important was avoiding the \u201ct-word.\u201d So, Gruber crows on the video, \u201cThis bill was written in a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.\u201d He also explained how the bills\u2019 writers covered up the obvious redistributionist core of the legislation, which to work has to take money from the healthy young to pay for health care for the sick and old. \u201cIf you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in \u2014 you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.\u201d\n\nThen this handsomely paid consultant to the \u201cmost transparent administration in history\u201d revealed the foundational contempt progressives have for the \u201cpeople\u201d whose champions they claim to be: \u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201d As David Horowitz tweeted, \u201cProgressive totalitarianism: We know what's good for you and will lie, cheat and then compel you to agree with us.\u201d\n\nThis modern version of the Platonic \u201cguardians,\u201d who possess superior knowledge but who must camouflage their tyrannical rule with lies, is now over 100 years old, and has become deeply embedded in our politics. It was the fundamental assumption of American Progressivism, which argued that modern technology and social change had rendered the old constitutional order a dangerous relic. The native common sense and wisdom of ordinary people to know their own interests and pursue them primarily at the local and state levels were now replaced by the allegedly scientific knowledge of \u201cexperts,\u201d who alone could solve the problems created by the modern world. As Progressive Theodore Roosevelt said in 1901, the \u201cvery serious social problems\u201d confronting the nation could no longer be solved by \u201cthe old laws, and the old customs,\u201d especially the power given to state governments and laws, which \u201care no longer sufficient.\u201d Woodrow Wilson agreed, complaining in 1913 that \u201cthe laws of this country have not kept up with the change\u201d of economic and political circumstances. To achieve \u201csocial justice\u201d and eliminate income inequality, the \u201claws,\u201d particularly the Constitution, had to change.\n\nBut to effect such change, the old order of conflicting and balancing \u201cpassions and interests,\u201d as James Madison described the political order, had to be transformed in order to create a more collectivist people united in their \u201ccollective purpose\u201d to achieve a \u201cvigorous social program,\u201d particularly the redistribution of property. As Progressive Frank Johnson Goodnow wrote ominously in 1916, \u201cChanged conditions . . . must bring in their train different conceptions of private rights if society is to be advantageously carried on.\u201d Individual rights, especially property rights, \u201cmay become a menace when social rather than individual efficiency is the necessary prerequisite of progress. For social efficiency probably owes more to the common realization of social duties than to the general insistence on privileges based on individual private rights.\u201d\n\nIn practical terms, these goals of \u201csocial efficiency\u201d and \u201csocial duties\u201d required more power centralized in the federal government and executive at the expense of the states and the people. The most important Progressive theorist, Herbert Croly, wrote in 1909, \u201cUnder existing conditions and simply as a matter of expediency, the national advance of the American democracy does demand an increasing amount of centralized action and responsibility.\u201d Woodrow Wilson agreed, and envisioned a cadre of elites to address the national \u201ccares and responsibilities which will require not a little wisdom, knowledge, and experience,\u201d as he wrote in his 1887 essay \u201cThe Study of Administration.\u201d As such, administrative power lies beyond politics, and should be insulated from the machinery of participatory government. And much like today\u2019s progressives, Wilson\u2019s ideas were based on contempt for the people who lack this specialized knowledge and so cannot be trusted with the power to run their own lives. Thus Wilson envisioned federal administrative bureaucracies \u201cof skilled, economical administration\u201d comprising the \u201chundred who are wise\u201d empowered to guide the thousands who are \u201cselfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? From these early Progressive theorists to MIT Professor Gruber and the Democrats the line is direct, based on the same flawed and illiberal assumptions. The masses cannot be allowed, as envisioned by the Constitution, the autonomy to pursue their interests through local and state governments closest to them, their conflicts regulated by the balance of power, mixed government, and federalism, which prevent any one faction from amassing enough power to tyrannize the rest. Rather, administrative elites must be empowered to override those many interests in order to \u201csolve problems\u201d and achieve \u201csocial justice.\u201d This in turn means growing the size and scope of the federal government into the bloated Leviathan it is today.\n\nBut as Wilson complained, \u201cThe bulk of mankind is rigidly unphilosophical, and nowadays the bulk of mankind votes.\u201d Since the citizens still have the vote and can exercise it every 2 years, they must be tricked into doing the \u201cright thing,\u201d as defined by the technocratic elite. One of the most chilling statements by an American president was made by Woodrow Wilson in his essay on administration: \u201cWhoever would effect a change in modern constitutional government must first educate his fellow-citizens to want some change. That done, he must persuade them to want the particular change he wants. He must first make public opinion willing to listen and then see to it that it listen to the right things. He must stir it up to search for an opinion, and then manage to put the right opinion in its way.\u201d What else has \u201cincome inequality,\u201d \u201cwar on women,\u201d \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that,\u201d and all the other slogans of this administration been other than the attempt to get the voters to \u201clisten to the right things\u201d and form a \u201cright opinion\u201d? Listen again to Wilson, from his essay \u201cLeaders of Men\u201d: \u201cOnly a very gross substance of concrete conception can make any impression on the minds of the masses; they must get their ideas very absolutely put, and are much readier to receive a half-truth which they can promptly understand than a whole truth which has too many sides to be seen all at once.\u201d Is this not the spirit of Professor Gruber\u2019s remarks on his \u201cvery clever basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter\u201d in designing the Obamacare legislation?\n\nThe politics of today\u2019s progressives all have their roots in the old Progressive assumptions\u2013\u2013that enlightened elites know better than the people what is good for them, and that the people, being such unenlightened clods, need to be manipulated and lied to for their own good. Most important, the freedom and autonomy of the people must be limited by intrusive federal agencies and regulations in order for these utopian goals to be achieved.\n\nOr to put it in other terms, this set of progressive beliefs\u2013\u2013which we have seen acted on for the last six years by the president and practically every government agency\u2013\u2013is totalitarian at its core. Not the brutal despotism of Italian fascism or Soviet communism or German Nazism, but Tocqueville\u2019s \u201csoft despotism,\u201d the kinder, gentler Leviathan which undermines self-reliance and self-government by taking responsibility for the people\u2019s comfort and happiness, and financing its largess by the redistribution of property. But no matter how comfortable in the short-term, such a condition is nothing other than servitude. And as Tocqueville warns, \u201cNo one will ever believe that a liberal, wise, and energetic government can spring from the suffrages of a subservient people.\u201d\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nSubscribe to Frontpage's TV show, The Glazov Gang, and LIKE it on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "A glimpse into the true heart of the Left.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "A glimpse into the true heart of the Left.", "title": "Obamacare Architect Exposes Progressive Totalitarianism", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/245191/obamacare-architect-exposes-progressive-bruce-thornton", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:05-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/245191/obamacare-architect-exposes-progressive-bruce-thornton", "description": "A glimpse into the true heart of the Left.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Architect Exposes Progressive Totalitarianism"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-12T19:55:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:43:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b92\"", "article_summary": "It was the fundamental assumption of American Progressivism, which argued that modern technology and social change had rendered the old constitutional order a dangerous relic.\nIn the video Gruber explains the spin and lies the Dems used to give cover to their Congressmen so they could vote for Obamacare.\nFrom these early Progressive theorists to MIT Professor Gruber and the Democrats the line is direct, based on the same flawed and illiberal assumptions.\nHe must first make public opinion willing to listen and then see to it that it listen to the right things.\nAs Progressive Frank Johnson Goodnow wrote ominously in 1916, \u201cChanged conditions ."}
