(AP) \u2014 Nick Saban\u2019s coaching legacy extends well beyond the Southeastern Conference and national championships and NFL draft picks. It sometimes stretches all the way to the opposing sidelines, in fact.\n\nNo. 2 Alabama\u2019s 64-year-old coach now has former underlings leading three SEC East schools and, coincidentally, the Crimson Tide\u2019s semifinal opponent, No. 3 Michigan State. Another, Florida State\u2019s Jimbo Fisher, won a national title in 2013.\n\nLongtime Tide defensive coordinator Kirby Smart recently joined the club after taking over alma mater Georgia a day after the SEC championship game win over Florida and ex-Alabama offensive chief Jim McElwain.\n\n\u201cI think the growth you get from working at a place like Alabama and with a program under Nick Saban, it helps me immensely,\u201d said Smart, who\u2019s running Alabama\u2019s defense through the playoffs. \u201cA lot of people have said why not take a smaller school head job? I honestly feel my growth was better being in a large program, being around coach Saban and learning how to manage a lot of the tough situations you deal with in the media.\u201d\n\nClearly there are benefits to working for the demanding Saban, beyond even the big salaries. Smart was making $1.5 million a year.\n\nThe same day he was introduced, South Carolina trotted out its new hire, former Saban assistant Will Muschamp. The two erstwhile defensive coordinators are each making more than $3 million annually.\n\nWorking for Saban clearly can pay off bigtime for his top assistants. McElwain was SEC coach of the year in his debut season at Florida, winning the East after returning to the league following a stint as Colorado State head coach. He was offensive coordinator of two Tide national championship teams.\n\nSaban hired Muschamp away from Division II Valdosta State at LSU in 2001, and the ex-Florida coach is on his second stint as an SEC East head man. Muschamp was Auburn\u2019s defensive coordinator last season, facing his former boss in the regular season finale.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be standing here if it weren\u2019t for the opportunities he gave me a long time ago at LSU,\u201d Muschamp said before the Iron Bowl.\n\nSaban also hired Mark Dantonio at Michigan State, where the Spartans head man worked as his secondary coach from 1995-99. Now, the two will face off with a national championship shot on the line.\n\nSaban, who has lavished praise on Dantonio\u2019s performance leading that program, is careful not to take too much credit when asked if he takes pride when his assistants land head coaching jobs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for them. I\u2019m happy for their families,\u201d Saban said. \u201cI\u2019m happy and have a tremendous amount of respect for the great job that they did for long time in helping our program be successful. One of the reasons they\u2019ve worked is because of the goals and aspirations that they had, so you\u2019re very, very proud for them that they now have an opportunity that they worked so hard for.\u201d\n\nDallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett worked under Saban for two seasons with the Miami Dolphins. Garrett likens working for a successful coach to learning under a top heart surgeon or a leader in any field.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saban\u2019s growing coaching tree joins titles as part of legacy", "title": "Saban\u2019s growing coaching tree joins titles as part of legacy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Saban\u2019s growing coaching tree joins titles as part of legacy", "title": "Saban\u2019s growing coaching tree joins titles as part of legacy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/26/sabans_growing_coaching_tree_joins_titles_as_part_of_legacy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/alabama-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saban\u2019s growing coaching tree joins titles as part of legacy", "title": "Saban\u2019s growing coaching tree joins titles as part of legacy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/alabama-football.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Zenor", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "McElwain was SEC coach of the year in his debut season at Florida, winning the East after returning to the league following a stint as Colorado State head coach.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsTUSCALOOSA, Ala.
