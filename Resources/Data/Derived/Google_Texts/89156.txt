Wall, SD

A 51-year-old Oklahoma man is dead after crashing his vehicle out in the Badlands over the weekend.

The victim, whose name has not been released, was driving on Highway 240 south of Wall Saturday afternoon when his pickup truck drove off the roadway, went over a curb and down a steep embankment. He was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle. Authorities pronounced him dead at the scene.

The Highway Patrol says alcohol was a factor in the crash, but the investigation continues. No other vehicles were involved in the accident.
