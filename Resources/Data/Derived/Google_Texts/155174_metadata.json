Barry leans back in his chair at a candidate forum April 1 during the straw poll for Ward 8\u2019s open city council seat at Ballou High School in Washington. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe ghosts of mayors past and present are haunting every step of the District\u2019s Ward 8 council race.\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) showed up at a barbecue for LaRuby May ahead of a straw poll earlier this month; former mayor Vincent C. Gray appears side by side with his endorsed candidate, Sheila Bunn, on fliers; and just about everyone invokes the name of the late D.C. legend Marion Barry as they place calls and go door-to-door.\n\nAs Bowser\u2019s pick, May has attracted high-profile business endorsements and raised more money than anyone \u2014 four times as much as Gray\u2019s pick \u2014 ahead of the April 28 vote.\n\nBut whether May, whom opponents have labeled a big-money \u201coutsider,\u201d can capture the vote of the District\u2019s poorest ward and lure residents away from a long tradition of personality politics tied for years to one familiar face remains unclear.\n\n\u201cLaRuby is perceived as the front-runner because she has so much money,\u201d said Bunn. \u201cBut as we know in politics, money does not always win you a race.\u201d\n\nIn a rapidly gentrifying city where pricey restaurants and yoga studios have sprung up on what were once the District\u2019s most destitute avenues, Ward 8 is still referred to as the \u201cforgotten ward.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the city\u2019s largest swath of land, across the Anacostia River in the District\u2019s southeast quadrant. Yet it was the last to acquire a grocery store.\n\nIt is the \u201cdumping ward\u201d for the rest of the city, as one voter described it, the section of the nation\u2019s capital with the highest proportion of families living in poverty and the place where city authorities once tried to put a private prison.\n\nBarry, as the city\u2019s longest-serving mayor and council member, was a symbol of the politics and priorities of Ward 8\u2019s underclass. But the area was Barry\u2019s turf for so long \u2014 up until his death in November \u2014 that no one seems sure about how residents will vote when the \u201cmayor for life\u201d is no longer on the ballot.\n\nThe evidence of that uncertainty may lie in the sheer number of candidates \u2014 13, more than any Ward 8 race in nearly 20 years \u2014 but also in the variety of sales pitches they make as they talk to voters and huddle over campaign strategy meetings in their neighborhood headquarters.\n\nEugene Kinlow tells voters that he has big dreams of development, including expanding commercial real estate at the Anacostia Metro station, while May has echoed the campaign promises of her backer and D.C.\u2019s rising star Bowser to fight for city resources so that \u201chardworking families have a pathway to the middle class.\u201d\n\nBunn argues that she has the most experience, having served as the chief of staff to the District\u2019s non-voting congressional representative, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D). She is banking partly on the ward\u2019s loyalty to her own backer, Gray, who lost to Bowser in last year\u2019s mayoral race but won Ward 8.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to folks in the ward, they don\u2019t really know who LaRuby May is,\u201d said Bunn, whose father was a community business mainstay and whose campaign office is housed on the ground floor of the \u201cBunn building,\u201d a family legacy.\n\nAnd yet everywhere you go in the ward, where campaign signs adorn lawns, street corners and telephone poles, the May signs loom the largest. The funding is palpable. And at the end of the day, the guiding factor in who wins may still be one that Barry excelled at: busing the largest number of people to the polls.\n\nOn Friday evening, a team of campaign workers clad in May\u2019s campaign color, purple, canvassed Woodland Terrace, a public housing project, urging people to get in a van they had ready to ferry them to the city\u2019s central early-voting location downtown, where voting began April 13.\n\nThese workers have been helping Ward 8 residents register to vote for five months. They cheered when people accepted the offer of a ride, and they handed out fliers for a free barbecue and concert on Saturday, which coincided with the opening of early voting in the ward.\n\nMay, who hit the pavement with her team, greeted some residents by name and snapped selfies with residents. When purple-shirted workers ran into more of their own, they broke into a call-and-response chant: \u201cVote LaRuby May\u201d\u2014\u201cSo Eight may rise!\u201d\n\nNearly all of the candidates have taken aim at May\u2019s Florida upbringing, her ties to Bowser and her endorsements from key business and labor power brokers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good not to have all your money coming from the mayor,\u201d said Marion C. Barry, the late mayor\u2019s son and another candidate who argued that Bowser\u2019s support would make May \u201cbeholden to a political machine.\u201d\n\nMay, who runs a local housing nonprofit group and two day-care centers and whose pledges of affordable housing and community policing sound much like her competitors\u2019 campaigning, dismissed such labels as baseless.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working hard in the ward for the past 15 years to build infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cThere definitely can be benefits of being a legacy child,\u201d she said of Bunn and Barry. \u201cBut I know there are also benefits of hard work.\u201d\n\nCharlie Dunn, a Ward 8 resident who was standing with friends at Woodland Terrace Friday night, said that Bunn lives nearby but that only May has visited.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t met any other candidates who\u2019ve come through this neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cI have one who lives right next door to me, and she hasn\u2019t knocked on my door.\u201d\n\nAll of the candidates, including Barry, Trayon White and Natalie Williams, the president of the Ward 8 Democrats, say they will improve education and foster opportunities for youths and ex-offenders.\n\nBut for them, the funding has been thinner.\n\nKinlow set out to knock on doors last week with only one staffer in tow. Bunn set out with only a few more, targeting the doors of men and women who had proven voting records, many of them senior citizens.\n\nOne elderly widower told Bunn that he\u2019d vote for her if he \u201ccan keep it in my mind to vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Bunn said, making a note of it, \u201cI will remind you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Ward 8 candidates hit the streets in Southeast Washington ahead of the April 28 special election.", "title": "Nothing is certain in the fight for Marion Barry\u2019s D.C.
