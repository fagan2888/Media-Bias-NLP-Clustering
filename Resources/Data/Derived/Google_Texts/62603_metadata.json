(Whether Obama meant \u201ctight\u201d in the sense of the early-aughts slang word or as a reference to the effort's cohesiveness, he\u2019s correct.)\n\nThis is the latest entry in the long history of the angry-Obama description relayed by the press, offered by his aides or articulated by the man himself. Other politicians can and do get \u201cvisibly angry,\u201d but not everyone has a reputation for being devoid of emotion. Obama has long been characterized as cold and aloof, so when he does try to paint a different picture, people tend to take notice \u2014 even after six years of watching the president get upset by understandably upsetting events, like nurses catching Ebola.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not tight.\u201d President Barack Obama\n\nDec. 7, 2010: One of the first visibly angry moments of Obama\u2019s presidency happened in late 2010, when the president responded to liberal critics of his compromise with Republicans to extend the Bush tax credits. \u201cThe image of a visibly irritated \u2014 if not outright angry \u2014 Obama was a stunning contrast to cool, calm and collected persona that he has long cultivated,\u201d Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post wrote.\n\nPresident Obama leaves a press conference on the budget deficit in 2011.

Obama gave a press conference that day that forever set the bar for visible anger.\n\n\u201cA visibly angry President Obama \u2026 demanded that Congressional leaders come to the White House on Saturday morning,\u201d The Times reported, a characterization The New Yorker dissected later. \u201cA visibly angry Obama criticized Republicans\u2019 opposition to tax increases, saying that was the reason for the breakdown,\u201d wrote The Daily Caller. The New Republic noted that the most shocking part of the press conference was Obama\u2019s tone, and the fact that he \u201cseemed visibly angry with\u201d Boehner.\n\nNov. 11, 2012: A close second for angriest angry Obama might be when Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said that then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice wasn\u2019t qualified to be secretary of State because of comments she made after the Benghazi attacks. Obama was not having it and was \u201cvisibly angry,\u201d according to The Atlantic and Breitbart. New York Magazine was slightly less convinced, and wrote that Obama \u201cflashed what was either genuine anger or a convincing imitation of it.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama during a press conference on the failed gun background checks bill in 2013.

From The Daily Beast: \u201cA visibly angry President Obama, reacting to the defeat of an exceedingly modest gun control measure, called it \u2018a pretty shameful day for Washington.\u2019\u201d Time Magazine went with \u201cstoned faced and curt,\u201d which is a less lazy way to say visibly angry.\n\nMay 15, 2013: Sometimes the press doesn\u2019t take the bait, and the president has to tell them that he\u2019s angry. This is a tactic usually reserved for political scandals that could hurt the administration. When Obama addressed the IRS scandal, he said \u201cit's inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.\u201d\n\nNov. 14, 2013: Or his aides tell the press. When the glitchy black hole called Healthcare.gov \u201claunched,\u201d Obama was forced to admit either he wasn\u2019t following its progress closely enough or that he built a bad site. He said he didn\u2019t know the site wouldn\u2019t work, but was mad that it didn\u2019t. \u201cAs the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds, senior administration aides tell me that the President is \u2018mad, frustrated and angry,\u2019\u201d wrote CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger. The fact that those three words mean more or less the same thing only amplified the sentiment.\n\nAngry Obama descriptions also work for photo captions.

You have to be seen doggedly and persistently pushing for answers.\u201d\n\nIf the angry-Obama routine has been any indication over the years, looking pissed helps, too.\n\nAlso on Bloomberg Politics: Are You Overly Concerned About Ebola?
