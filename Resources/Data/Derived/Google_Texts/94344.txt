Just under 10 million consumers paid for insurance plans they bought on the federal and state health care exchanges by the end of June, the Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday.

HHS estimated it would have 9.1 million people enrolled by the end of this year.

About 84%, or more than 8.3 million consumers, were receiving a tax credit to pay for their premiums. The average tax credit for these people was $270 a month.

There were 7.2 million consumers who paid for their plans and live in the 37 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov exchange and 2.7 million through the remaining state exchanges.

“Consumers from coast-to-coast are continuing to show how important health coverage is to their families,” said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell.

HHS said the 10 states with the highest rate of consumers who received tax credits were: Mississippi (95.4%), Wyoming (92.2%), North Carolina (91.6%), Florida (91.3%), Alabama (90.9%), Louisiana (90.7%), Georgia (90.0%), Arkansas (90.0%), Wisconsin (89.6%) and Alaska (88.8%). The states with the lowest rate of consumers who received credits are: District of Columbia (10.2%), Minnesota (54.8%), Colorado (55.3%), Hawaii (61.4%), New Hampshire (62.8%), Vermont (64.2%), Utah (65.6%), Kentucky (69.8%), Maryland (70.7%) and New York (71.4%).
