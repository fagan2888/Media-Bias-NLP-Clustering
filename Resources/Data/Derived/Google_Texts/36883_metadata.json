Ted Kennedy\u2019s seat in Massachusetts by 30 points, Brown rode a wave of Tea Party fervor and anti-establishment sentiment to defeat Coakley by a five-point margin. The loss of the liberal lion\u2019s seat hit Democrats hard, but the party knew it would have a much better chance of ousting Brown in 2012, when the seat\u2019s full six-year term was up for election. Democrats scored a major coup when progressive champion and Wall Street foe Elizabeth Warren tossed her hat into the ring. After a hard-faught campaign, Warren bested Brown by eight points.\n\nFew observers expected Brown to abandon electoral politics upon leaving office. He joined a corporate law firm and scored a gig as a Fox News contributor, ensuring he\u2019d remain a familiar face to the conservative activists who\u2019d prove crucial in his future endeavors.\n\nSpeculation surrounding his political ambitions never lurked far beneath the surface. Brown passed on the opportunity to run in the special election to replace Sen. John Kerry, who left to become President Obama\u2019s secretary of state. A far better prize awaited him on Beacon Hill. After eight years of Democratic control under Gov. Deval Patrick, observers had several to believe that Bay Staters would return the governorship to a Republican in 2014. (And they did, narrowly electing businessman Charlie Baker over Coakley.) Indeed, some speculated that the very reason Brown passed on the race to fill Kerry\u2019s seat was that he\u2019d rather run for governor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lose Senate election; join Fox.
