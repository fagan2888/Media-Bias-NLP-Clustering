Terry McAuliffe's efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, he decided to remain with his job in banking, according to two people who were familiar with his decision. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss his decision.\n\nIt's not clear whether the criticism fueled his decision, and Puckett did not confirm it in a statement he released to the public late Monday afternoon. In the statement, Puckett said that reports that he had resigned his seat to accept a paid job with the commission were \"untrue.\" He confirmed that one factor was helping his daughter secure a state judgeship, but without offering details, he said that additional, personal factors were at work.\n\n\"My family is dealing with several difficult issues that need our attention,\" Puckett wrote. \"These are private matters, and I ask that you respect our privacy in working through them as a family.\n\nPuckett also reiterated his support for Medicaid expansion and questioned the premise that his resignation would throw the Senate's support of the measure in jeopardy.\n\n\"My resignation now leaves that vote at 22-17, and remains as a favorable status for the budget and Medicaid Expansion in the Senate,\" Puckett wrote. \"It is my heartfelt prayer that the General Assembly will be able to close the gap for healthcare coverage for all Virginians.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Mark Herring, D, issued a statement decrying the appearance of \"political gamesmanship\" but claiming no investigative role for his office \u2014 despite numerous accusations of wrongdoing and calls for investigation from fellow Democrats.\n\n\"The Attorney General is a strong supporter of bringing our federal tax dollars home to cover up to 400,000 more Virginians,\" Herring's office said in a statement. \"It's common sense, so perceived political gamesmanship is understandably frustrating. That said, we do not see an investigative role for our office. Should evidence arise suggesting criminal wrongdoing, local police, the Virginia State Police, or appropriate federal authorities would investigate.\n\nA fellow senator, Frank Ruff, R-Mecklenburg, said at a public meeting Monday that Puckett would not join the tobacco commission after all, according to someone with knowledge of his statement but not authorized to discuss it.\n\nRuff seemed to walk the comment back a bit after someone in the audience asked about his statement. In response, Ruff said that Puckett was resigning from the Senate for personal reasons, planned to stay at his bank job, and that he is \"probably\" not going to join the commission, the person said.\n\nRuff also said that, in the aftermath of the uproar caused by the news of Puckett's resignation, there was a desire not to diminish Puckett's legacy.\n\nAdditionally, Shortly before 1 p.m. Monday, Tim Pfohl, interim executive director of the commission, cancelled its Wednesday meeting. The only item that had been on the agenda was \"discussion and consideration of a prospective candidate for employment,\" according to an email Pfohl sent to executive committee members.\n\nPuckett's resignation became official Monday, one day after he cleaned out his Senate office in Richmond and handed a resignation letter to Senate Clerk Susan Clarke Schaar.\n\nHis exit is still expected to allow his daughter to gain a judgeship \u2014 and give Republicans an instant 20-19 advantage in the Senate.\n\nVirginia politics-watchers have seen this one before: A long-serving Democrat from an increasingly red district gives up his Senate seat to take a state job, handing control of the evenly divided chamber to the GOP.\n\nIt happened 1997, when then-Governor James Gilmore, R, turned a Democratic senator from Loudoun, Charles Waddell, into his deputy transportation secretary and thereby gave the GOP a 20-19 edge.\n\nThen as now, Democrats were furious. \"Job Offers Called GOP Plot,\" a headline in The Washington Post said at the time.\n\nBut the reaction seemed particularly sharp given that state legislators, reeling from a gifts scandal involving former Governor Robert McDonnell, R, went into this year vowing to improve ethics in Richmond.\n\nMcDonnell and his wife, Maureen, are scheduled to go to trial next month on federal corruption charges stemming from their acceptance of more than $165,000 in loans and luxury gifts from Richmond-area businessman Jonnie Williams, whose dietary supplement they helped promote. The McDonnells have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"I am dismayed by news today that my Republican friends have offered Senator Puckett an unseemly, shady, backroom deal that benefits both himself financially, and reportedly ensures the appointment of his daughter to the bench,\" House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mark Sickles, Fairfax, said in a written statement late Sunday. \"While the former Governor's relationship with Mr. Jonnie Williams has stained Virginia's good government reputation, whatever access Governor McDonnell traded, he did not buy a job or trade away a judicial appointment.\"\n\nSickles continued: \"I hope the Republicans and Senator Puckett will rethink their actions in light of the image we once treasured of our State, an image that is now further tarnished, and a new shroud of doubt cast, but that we can start restoring tomorrow by rejecting this type of inappropriate and unbecoming exchange.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "After outcry over resignation, former Virginia senator won't take tobacco board job", "Description": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Amid a firestorm of criticism regarding his resignation from the Virginia Senate, Democrat Phillip Puckett is withdrawing his name from consideration for a job with the state tobacco commission, according to two people with knowledge of the decision.
