Bobby Jindal for approval.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see the state legislature fund this important healthcare program, and we're hopeful the governor will sign it into law in the coming days,\" said a statement from Susan Todd, executive director of 504HealthNet, a network of 19 nonprofit and governmental organizations who participate in the program.\n\nContinued funding for the clinics this year was not assured, with current year money due to end in August.

But Jindal and many state lawmakers have opposed expanding that federal health care program in Louisiana. The governor has argued that a Medicaid expansion would shift too many patients from private to public insurance, and would cost the state too much.\n\nRebecca Catalanello can be reached at rcatalanello@nola.com or 504.717.7701.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2014 legislature,bobby jindal,br-homepage,health,health care,homepage,state budget", "title": "Louisiana lawmakers fund Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Louisiana lawmakers fund Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2014/06/legislators_approve_funding_fo.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/tpphotos/photo/2014/05/15075502-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13117108\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-05T19:49:51Z\", \"author\": \"Rebecca Catalanello, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"2014 legislature\",\"bobby jindal\",\"br-homepage\",\"health\",\"health care\",\"homepage\",\"state budget\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nola.com/tpphotos/photo/2014/05/15075502-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@RCatNola", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary", "description": "Louisiana lawmakers have approved funding to continue the Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection, a network of 40 community clinics serving the area's uninsured.
