Either way, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll get with your $15 order:\n\nOnce your order is processed an anonymous package will be sent to your target containing 2 things; A 5oz bag of delicious gummy candy penises, and a note exclaiming \u2018EAT A BAG OF DICKS\u2019. Nothing More. Nothing Less. You will remain anonymous and silently chuckle to yourself for years to come as you picture them slowly degrading into a shell of the person they once were, always questioning their lives \u201cWho sent this to me?\u201d, \u201cAre there more dicks on their way?\u201d and \u201cWhy does this keep happening to me?!\u201d. Yes their slow decent into madness will be much tastier than the bag of candy dicks you sent to them.\n\nIt\u2019s counterintuitive spending $15 worth of candy on someone you hate, but then again hatred is rarely rational and the phrase is \u201csweet revenge.\u201d Although that $15 might be better spent shipping your enemies a spring loaded glitter bomb or resolving your anger issues with a therapist, the idea of awful ex-bosses and shitty ex-lovers opening a bag of dicks at their home or office does make us smile in an immature middle-school kind of way.\n\nThe owners of DicksByMail also have this gentle reminder for those who take their service way too seriously: \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be a threat or a way to bully. If you are sending this with the intent to ruin someones day, then maybe its you who needs to eat a bag of dicks.\u201c", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "It's counterintuitive spending $15 to send candy to someone you supposedly hate, but then again hatred is rarely rational and the phrase is \"sweet revenge.\"", "generator": "WPML ver:3.3.7 stt:1,4,3,47,2,43,59;", "og": {"site_name": "Unicorn Booty", "description": "It's counterintuitive spending $15 to send candy to someone you supposedly hate, but then again hatred is rarely rational and the phrase is \"sweet revenge.\"", "title": "You Can Now Literally Mail Your Enemy A Bag Of Dicks To Eat | Unicorn Booty", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 772, "identifier": "https://unicornbooty.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/you-can-now-literally-mail-your-enemies-a-bag-of-dicks-to-eat-th2.jpg", "height": 368}, "updated_time": "2015-12-18T16:55:32-07:00", "url": "https://unicornbooty.com/you-can-now-literally-mail-your-enemy-a-bag-of-dicks-to-eat/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "284b2477c9211b594c09c3512eb37031"}, "fb": {"admins": 10152477147446642, "app_id": 1566706946942719}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/unicornbooty/", "section": "OMGWTFLOL", "tag": "Revenge", "published_time": "2015-03-19T09:16:07-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T16:55:32-07:00"}, "OBKey": "TeFLOZ+QmuZ4RK/xaEG4Hw==", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "candy, nsfw, revenge"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f82\"", "article_summary": "Well thanks to the magic of the internet, you no longer have to just tell your enemies eat a bag of dicks \u2014 you can literally mail them a bag of edible dicks to make your insult a reality!\nYes their slow decent into madness will be much tastier than the bag of candy dicks you sent to them.\nIf you are sending this with the intent to ruin someones day, then maybe its you who needs to eat a bag of dicks.\u201c\nEither way, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll get with your $15 order:Once your order is processed an anonymous package will be sent to your target containing 2 things; A 5oz bag of delicious gummy candy penises, and a note exclaiming \u2018EAT A BAG OF DICKS\u2019.\nDicksByMail appears to be owned by fratty, anti-ObamaCare, straight guys who send dick pics to women they meet at church."}
