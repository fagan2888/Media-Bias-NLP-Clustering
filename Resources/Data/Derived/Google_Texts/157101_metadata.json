Fiore died Saturday May 31, 2014 at his home in Warrington. He had lost his battle with addiction. He was 24,\u201d the first lines of his obituary read.\n\nPeople are not accustomed to reading causes of death in obituaries, especially when a person as young as Anthony dies of a heroin overdose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s talked about,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s allowed for a stigma to grow around addiction, like \u2018addicts are bad people, they\u2019re weak, they make bad choices.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere is a general perception, according to Fiore, that heroin is an inner-city problem with little relevance in the suburbs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true,\u201d he said, firmly.\n\nHe knows it\u2019s a problem that reaches the suburbs, because it\u2019s something that reached inside his own home. Now, he and his wife Valerie are pushing to break the stigma on a national level.\n\nFiore started an online petition to amend the Affordable Care Act to provide for a minimum of 90 up to a maximum of 180 days per year for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment at a certified facility. The proposal is called Anthony\u2019s Act and, as of last week, it garnered nearly 23,000 signatures on http://www.MoveOn.org.\n\nThis is something that Fiore believes needs to be addressed immediately. The United States has reached a point where there is awareness that heroin addiction is a prominent problem.\n\nA study released in October 2014 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that deaths from heroin overdose doubled across the 28 participating states from 2010 to 2012.\n\nFiore wants to put the 90-day question in front of politicians to see if anyone will be moved to action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position to put a little pressure on these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got at least 23,000 people interested in knowing the answer.\u201d\n\nHe has reached out to several politicians for meetings, including U.S. Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-8) and Brendan Boyle (D-13), but nothing has been set yet.\n\nOf course, mandating coverage for 90-day care does not ensure that recovering addicts will stay that long.\n\nAnthony went into treatment three times: the first lasted 28 days, the second lasted 21 days and the third lasted seven days.\n\n\u201cIf Anthony\u2019s Act had been around when Anthony was still alive, we would have been hard-pressed to get him to do 90 days,\u201d Fiore said. \u201cHe wanted to do it his way.\u201d\n\nBut with the 90-day system, Fiore believes, those working at the facilities could convince a person of the importance of staying longer.\n\n\u201cEvery life saved is a life saved,\u201d Fiore said. \u201cNinety days is a start.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2008 LA Times article, the 28-or-30-day recovery period has no basis in actual medical evidence.\n\nWhen the U.S. Air Force established the first addiction treatment programs in the 1970s, 30 days was placed as the standard because those in treatment would have to be reassigned if they were away from their duty for more than 30 days.\n\nFiore said that insurance companies embrace this standard because providing for a longer treatment period means higher costs for them.\n\nBut the real problem isn\u2019t the length of treatment, it\u2019s the drug itself and the general misconception of people suffering from addiction. This is something Fiore has spoken about before, most prominently in Anthony\u2019s eulogy.\n\n\u201cHe loved candy. He loved his car. He loved his brother. He loved his mother. He loved the Lord. And he loved heroin,\u201d Fiore began. \u201cLord, how he loved heroin.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a video of the eulogy on YouTube, which has sinced gained several thousand views. It touches on Anthony\u2019s life, showing him as a good kid with a devastating problem. Addiction blinded him from realizing that he wasn\u2019t just hurting himself \u2014 he was hurting everyone around him.\n\nFiore has gotten a lot of response to this video. One 23-year-old called it her \u201cbreaking point\u201d and sought recovery immediately, others share it, knowing that an open, unobscured reaction to another death by heroin is exactly what some people need to see.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons he started a Facebook group called \u201cThe Left Behind.\u201d Here, people can privately share thoughts and feelings on addiction and the loss that comes with being left behind by someone else\u2019s overdose.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never recovered, you\u2019re always in recovery,\u201d Fiore said.\n\nWith Anthony\u2019s Act, he hopes to ensure that for those who seek it, proper, affordable treatment will be there when they\u2019re ready.\n\nTo sign the online petition for Anthony\u2019s Act, visit www.petitions.moveon.org/sign/anthonys-act.\n\nTo join The Left Behind forum, visit www.facebook.com/groups/1458604797714992/.\n\nTo view Cris Fiore\u2019s eulogy for Anthony, visit www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PwFV3-0FcU.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Midweek Wire", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Loss matters: Bucks family seeks support for ACA amendment to benefit addicts in recovery | The Midweek Wire on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Midweek Wire", "description": "Matt Schickling, the Wire Cris Fiore decided almost immediately after the death of his stepson that the loss had to count for something. \u201cAnthony P.
