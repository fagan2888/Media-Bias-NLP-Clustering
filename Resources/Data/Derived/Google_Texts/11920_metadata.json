While we may not know exactly why religion appeared and grew in the way that it did, a new study suggests an interesting association with not being religiously affiliated.\n\nAccording to the Baylor University study, counties in the U.S. with more beautiful weather and scenery have lower rates of membership and affiliation with religious organizations.\n\n\u201cBeautiful weather, mountains, and waterfronts can serve as conduits to the sacred, just like traditional religious congregations,\u201d said lead author Todd W. Ferguson, a doctoral candidate in sociology in Baylor\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences, in a press release.\n\nThe research, scientists say, is not necessarily suggesting that enjoying nice weather tempts people away from going to a place of worship, or that they create a new organized religion because of nature.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not claiming that residents in areas richer with natural amenities are more likely to create a \u2018Church of nature,\u2019\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nResults suggest more that natural resources can act as a spiritual resource on their own. They could, in a way, compete with organized religious groups, providing a way to explore spirituality without identifying as a member of any group.\n\n\u201cWhen a person hikes in a forest to connect with the sacred, that individual may not feel a need to affiliate with a religious group because spiritual demands are being met,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nAnother perk to fulfilling spiritual needs by connecting with nature is that the outdoor world has no time constraints \u2014 religious organizations and congregations meet only at specific times throughout the week, said researchers.\n\nThe study utilized data from the Religious Congregations and Membership Study, United States Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Census Bureau. Looking at data from 3,107 U.S. counties, they examined cross-sectional differences between areas using rates per 1,000 people. The study defined adherence as all members of a religious organization, including the children of members, and estimated the number of other participants who regularly attended services but were not considered members.\n\nStudy co-author Jefferet A. Tamburello said they also examined USDA data about environmental preferences, gauging if people liked things like winter sun, a temperate summer, topographical variation, and water areas.\n\nThe authors said that scholars are beginning to explore how activities that use natural features \u2014 backpacking, SCUBA diving, surfing \u2014 may be viewed as religious experiences.\n\n\u201cScholars also need to explore whether the relationship between natural amenities and religion adherence rates is just an American phenomenon, or whether it also exists in areas such as Western Europe, which have lower rates of religious adherence,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nSource: Ferguson T, Tamburello J.
