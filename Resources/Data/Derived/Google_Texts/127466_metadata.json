Biden's oldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer last year.Obama cited a $2 billion funding increase for the National Institutes of Health as part of a spending bill passed last month. It's the largest raise the agency has seen in 12 years.Obama also said the country is \u201con track to end\u201d HIV/AIDS and could do the same with malaria.In an early part of the speech calling for Congress to work on bipartisan efforts that could be passed this year, Obama mentioned legislation to fight prescription drug and heroin abuse.He also touted the successes of the Affordable Care Act, which he said was about \u201cfilling the gaps in employer-based care.\u201d The law has slowed healthcare inflation and helped create jobs, he said. The former claim has been refuted by some experts. Obama also acknowledged, however, that politicians \u201cwon't agree on healthcare any time soon.\u201dIn the Republican response, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley countered that the ACA is \u201cdisastrous\u201d and has made health insurance and doctors less available.Still, the next year could see some strides in some of Obama's parting wishes.The NIH could get a further boost from a bill that the Senate's Health Committee has vowed will be a priority this year. The 21st Century Cures Act would increase funding to the NIH and the U.S Food and Drug Administration in an effort to better equip the agencies to speed up the approval process for new medical devices and drugs.The bipartisan bill sailed through the House last summer, but the committee hasn't presented a bill to the full senate, partly because the bill doesn't yet have a pay-for.U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI), who sponsored 21st Century Cures quickly released a statement after the address, saying that he'd met with Biden, who Upton says expressed commitment to getting bipartisan reforms through the Senate.\"We welcome every voice, including the president\u2019s and vice president\u2019s to the conversation, as we work to get 21st Century Cures across the finish line. The clock is ticking for every family facing an incurable disease - let\u2019s get the job done,\u201d Upton said.Biden's efforts could likewise be aided by the White House's plan to create and manage a database containing the medical records of 1 million or more Americans with the hope the information would enable clinical trials of targeted therapies.Obama unveiled his precision medicine initiative in his State of the Union Address last year. The president earmarked $130 million for this project for fiscal 2016.The project's guidelines were released last fall. Volunteer participants are expected to begin enrolling in the cohort this year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "In his final State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama also said the country is on track to end HIV/AIDS and malaria.", "title": "Obama calls for moonshot approach to cure cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "In his final State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama also said the country is on track to end HIV/AIDS and malaria.", "title": "Obama calls for moonshot approach to cure cancer", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160112/NEWS/160119951", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160112/NEWS/160119951/AR/0/Barack-Obama-2016-State-of-the-Union.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "In his final State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama also said the country is on track to end HIV/AIDS and malaria.", "title": "Obama calls for moonshot approach to cure cancer", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160112/NEWS/160119951/AR/0/Barack-Obama-2016-State-of-the-Union.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160112/NEWS/160119951", "published_at": "2016-01-12", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160112/NEWS/160119951/AR/0/Barack-Obama-2016-State-of-the-Union.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"We welcome every voice, including the president\u2019s and vice president\u2019s to the conversation, as we work to get 21st Century Cures across the finish line.\nObama also acknowledged, however, that politicians \u201cwon't agree on healthcare any time soon.\u201dIn the Republican response, South Carolina Gov.\nThe president earmarked $130 million for this project for fiscal 2016.The project's guidelines were released last fall.\nBiden's oldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer last year.Obama cited a $2 billion funding increase for the National Institutes of Health as part of a spending bill passed last month.\nVolunteer participants are expected to begin enrolling in the cohort this year."}
