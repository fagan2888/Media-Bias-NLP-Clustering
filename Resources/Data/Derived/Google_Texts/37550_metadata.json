Board members represent specific districts, but are elected countywide.\n\nIn Seat 2 of the Central District, retired utility executive Joseph J. DeVirgilio Jr. \u2014 who was appointed to the board by fellow members in May 2013 \u2014 was elected to his first full term, defeating Michael A. Sutphin, a former security guard for the hospital.\n\nRichard C. Merritt, on the board for seven years, was returned to Seat 1 of the Northern District. His challenger was Stefan Butz, a hearing aid specialist who has served on the Sarasota County Charter Review Board since 1996.\n\nRobert K. Strasser, a board member since 1994, successfully defended Seat 2 in the Northern District against John \u201cJack\u201d Brill, a sales executive who is active in the local Republican Party.\n\nDarryl W. Henry, elected to the hospital board in 2010, won a second term in Seat 1 of the Southern District against former North Port City Commissioner David Garofalo, who said he sought the position as a way of returning to public service after a re-election defeat in 2012.\n\nIn the race for Seat 2 of the Southern District, Gregory A. Carter \u2014 on the board since 2002 \u2014 defeated challenger Lydia Tower, a registered nurse, in the closest race of the night.\n\nThe nine board members oversee a $540 million budget for the public health care system, with just over $40 million of that coming from county property taxes. The other four seats will come up for election in 2016.\n\nThis year, the five incumbents ran on a nearly nine-year record of financial stability and steady expansion. In July, the board unanimously promoted David Verinder as the health system\u2019s new CEO.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc319\"", "article_summary": "His challenger was Stefan Butz, a hearing aid specialist who has served on the Sarasota County Charter Review Board since 1996.\nThe nine board members oversee a $540 million budget for the public health care system, with just over $40 million of that coming from county property taxes.\nBoard members represent specific districts, but are elected countywide.\nRichard C.
