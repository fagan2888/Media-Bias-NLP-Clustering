A larva of this species in the brain of a 26-year-old Napa man caused a life-threatening coma. ( Wikipedia )\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it past the headline, you deserve to know more.\n\nThat\u2019s right, a 26-year-old Napa man went to the Queen of the Valley Medical Center ER with an awful headache and nausea, went into a coma and when he woke up was told there was a tapeworm larva living in his brain. (I tend not to use italics, but it seemed like emphasis was needed in this case.)\n\nThe Associated Press picks up the story:\n\nCollege student Luis Ortiz, 26, of Napa said doctors told him he needed immediate surgery to remove it. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe something like that would happen to me. I didn\u2019t know there was a parasite in my head trying to ruin my life.\u201d The surgery and the aftermath have greatly impacted his life, Ortiz said. He had to drop out of school, move back home and find a temporary place for his dog. He can\u2019t drive or work. \u201cMy memory is like a work in progress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets better from therapy,\u201d but he has to remind himself to do his memory exercises and other daily tasks. Ortiz\u2019s neurosurgeon, Dr. Soren Singel, said Ortiz was lucky he arrived at the hospital when he did. The worm was forming in a cyst that was blocking the flow of water to chambers in his brain, \u201clike a cork in a bottle,\u201d Singel told the Napa Valley Register. Another 30 minutes of that blockage, and \u201che would have been dead,\u201d Singel said. \u201cIt was a close call.\u201d Ortiz said his headaches began in late August and he didn\u2019t think much of it at first. \u201cI just ignored it,\u201d said Ortiz, who was attending California State University, Sacramento. During the first days of September, Ortiz had been skateboarding on a warm day when the pain increased. When he arrived at his mother\u2019s house, he appeared disoriented and began to vomit. She rushed him to the hospital.\n\nBy now I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering how a tapeworm larva got to Ortiz\u2019s brain in the first place.\n\nHere\u2019s how he did not get it: He did not get it from eating undercooked pork.\n\nEating undercooked pork can only give you an intestinal tapeworm, the Centers for Disease Control says, and then only if it is also infected with tapeworm larva. The larva mature in the intestine and give you a tapeworm. The tapeworm spews eggs but they do not travel through the body. They end up in the toilet.\n\nProfessor Ray Kuhn at Wake Forest University is an expert on parasites. \u201cThe only way you can get the [tapeworm] larva is for the person to actually eat the eggs of the tapeworm, and that is only found in human fecal material.\u201d That\u2019s how pigs get infected as well.\n\nHow do we get it? \u201cIt\u2019s possible that people preparing foods will have the tapeworm and don\u2019t use good bathroom sanitation and go back to preparing food,\u201d Kuhn says.\n\nYet another reason why good hand-washing is so important.\n\nThis post has been updated with more information about how the larvae are spread.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 26-year-old man had been suffering from headaches.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Doctors Find Tapeworm Larva in Napa Man's Brain\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/04\\/doctors-find-tapeworm-larva-in-napa-mans-brain\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-04 11:11:11\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-05 22:56:46\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":103255,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-05-at-10.52.21-PM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The 26-year-old man had been suffering from headaches.", "title": "Doctors Find Tapeworm Larva in Napa Man\u2019s Brain", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/04/doctors-find-tapeworm-larva-in-napa-mans-brain/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-05-at-10.52.21-PM-1440x1080.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By now I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering how a tapeworm larva got to Ortiz\u2019s brain in the first place.\nEating undercooked pork can only give you an intestinal tapeworm, the Centers for Disease Control says, and then only if it is also infected with tapeworm larva.\nA larva of this species in the brain of a 26-year-old Napa man caused a life-threatening coma.\n\u201cThe only way you can get the [tapeworm] larva is for the person to actually eat the eggs of the tapeworm, and that is only found in human fecal material.\u201d That\u2019s how pigs get infected as well.\nThe Associated Press picks up the story:College student Luis Ortiz, 26, of Napa said doctors told him he needed immediate surgery to remove it."}
