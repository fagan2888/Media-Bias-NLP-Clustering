Sources said Cowboys officials were not allowed to view the photos, several of which were under a protective order, before Hardy signed with the club on March 18.\n\nWhile the club was not granted access to visual evidence, sources stressed the Cowboys were aware of the photos and had an understanding of what was depicted. Owner Jerry Jones, executive vice president Stephen Jones and head coach Jason Garrett have said repeatedly that the organization did its due diligence before signing Hardy. The club\u2019s stance: the Cowboys understand the serious nature of domestic violence but also believe in second chances.\n\nJerry Jones reiterated that stance in a statement released Friday evening.\n\n\u201cWhile we did not have access to the photos that became public today, we were and are aware of the serious nature of this incident,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe as an organization take this very seriously.\n\n\u201cWe do not condone domestic violence. We entered into the agreement with Greg fully understanding that there would be scrutiny and criticism. We have given Greg a second chance. He is a member of our team and someone who is grateful for the opportunity he has been given to move forward with his life and his career.\u201d\n\nHardy is expected to play in Sunday\u2019s home game against the Eagles.\n\nLatest on Greg Hardy and image reveal\n\nReport reveals graphic images, interview details from recently expunged assault case against Cowboys\u2019 Greg Hardy\n\nTumultuous timeline of Greg Hardy\n\nReaction\n\nGosselin: Greg Hardy\u2019s ex-girlfriend revelation makes me shudder, but Cowboys will do nothing\n\nHardy is a bad dude, but how many other women are cowering from domestic abusers tonight?\n\nLatest evidence: Dallas Cowboys are America\u2019s Team of free passes to troubled players\n\nPhilly radio host: \u2018Screw Greg Hardy;\u2019 station helps raise over $10,000 for Dallas women\u2019s shelter\n\nReaction from former NFL players: Has Cowboys\u2019 Greg Hardy played his last game?\n\nEx-NFL punter posts Cowboys public relations number, blasts NFL for Greg Hardy\n\nMedia reaction: Sickening, disgusting and vile; Greg Hardy should never play another down\n\nHardy\u2019s in-game outburst\n\nMoore: Amid this drama, why would Jerry Jones talk about an extension for Hardy?
