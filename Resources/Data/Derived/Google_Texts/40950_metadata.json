That\u2019s a violent reaction that the immune system does to get rid of the tumors,\u201d says June.\n\nDoug Olson agreed to try the procedure. The re-engineered cells were infused into his compromised immune system. And he came down with what felt like the world\u2019s worst case of the flu \u2013 to the point it was shutting down some of his organs. But then, after suffering for a week, his symptoms suddenly disappeared and his doctor walked in with the test results.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Doug, we can\u2019t find a cancer cell in your body. Your bone marrow is completely clean.'\u201d\n\nAnd now, a report released at a medical conference in New Orleans confirms the procedure has produced complete remission in a significant number of patients whose cancer was considered incurable \u2013 patients like Doug Olson, who didn\u2019t waste any time.\n\n\u201cMy wife picked me up from the hospital, we drove straight to the Indianapolis Boat Show and we bought a sailboat,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has been cancer free for three years.\n\nInternational clinical trials will start next year \u2013 and Dr. June says the procedure is so promising that instead of the 12 years it usually takes to get approval, he expects it to take three or four.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. June developed a way to re-engineer a patient's own white cells to target a specific cancer not just once, but forever.", "og": {"site_name": "MyNorthwest.com", "description": "Dr. June developed a way to re-engineer a patient's own white cells to target a specific cancer not just once, but forever.", "title": "Has cancer just been cured?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 384, "identifier": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/apimage/813/07a6f266-06d8-4902-89ee-66279499a7f4.jpg", "height": 512}, "updated_time": "2013-12-09T09:26:00-07:00", "url": "http://mynorthwest.com/2897/has-cancer-just-been-cured/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/apimage/813/07a6f266-06d8-4902-89ee-66279499a7f4.jpg", "description": "Dr. June developed a way to re-engineer a patient's own white cells to target a specific cancer not just once, but forever.", "card": "summary", "title": "Has cancer just been cured?"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "MyNorthwest.com - Seattle news, sports, weather, traffic, talk and community., Home,MyNorthwest.com", "article": {"section": "Dave Ross", "published_time": "2013-12-09T06:50:49-07:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T09:26:00-07:00"}, "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In 1996 Doug Olson was diagnosed with cancer: a form of Leukemia.\nDr. June developed a way to re-engineer a patient\u2019s own white cells to target a specific cancer not just once, but forever.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Doug, we can\u2019t find a cancer cell in your body.\nHe has been cancer free for three years.\n'\u201dAnd now, a report released at a medical conference in New Orleans confirms the procedure has produced complete remission in a significant number of patients whose cancer was considered incurable \u2013 patients like Doug Olson, who didn\u2019t waste any time."}
