He is also the man behind the @SCOTUSblog Twitter handle, which garnered a lot of news coverage this week for the snarky way it responded to people who thought the online publication was actually that of the Supreme Court.\n\nGoldstein, a lawyer, was in charge of responding to the inundation of angry people who directed vitriol and profanity at the blog on Monday, the day of the highly controversial 5-4, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision in which the court sided with the craft store chain and said family-owned companies with religious objections cannot be required to pay for birth control for employees under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe commenters apparently were unaware that SCOTUSblog\u2019s Twitter feed was connected to an award-winning publication that has covered the Supreme Court since 2002, thinking instead that their responses might go directly to the source of their ire \u2014 the five justices who backed Hobby Lobby. It was okay with Goldstein, though, because it happens at the end of each Supreme Court session, and he was prepared with some zingers that got the attention of online media, from Vox.com to BuzzFeed and Gawker, which described the online verbal storm as an \u201coutraged Twitter mob.\u201d\n\nIn one exchange, a Twitter user directed a public message to SCOTUSblog, saying it was a \u201cdisgrace to our system.\u201d Capitalizing on the multiple meanings of the word \u201csystem,\u201d SCOTUSblog replied, \u201cSystem? Windows 8?\u201d\n\nIn another instance, a user with some apparent spelling deficiencies told the blog on Twitter, \u201cNigtmare will follow your decision.\u201d SCOTUSblog replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tink so.\u201d\n\nIn yet another exchange, a Twitter user accused SCOTUSblog of making the worst decision of its history. SCOTUSblog replied that another terrible decision was \u201ceating the cheap Kung Pao Chicken.\u201d\n\nSystem? Windows 8? MT @hotpan10 @SCOTUSblog you are a disgrace to our system. #letdown \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) July 1, 2014\n\nDon\u2019t tink so RT @ienoty12@SCOTUSblog nigtmare will follow your decision. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) July 1, 2014\n\nOr eating the cheap Kung Pao Chicken MT @NYCPainter1: Of all the bad decisions @SCOTUSblog made the last few years, #HobbyLobby is the worst \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 30, 2014\n\nAJR talked to Goldstein, (who doesn\u2019t use his own personal Twitter account) about Twitter, trolls, and the aforementioned Chinese dish. This interview has been condensed and edited.\n\n\n\nSo you\u2019re the man in charge of all the tweets on the day of the Supreme Court birth control ruling. How did you come to take that on? I am the publisher of the blog, and I am the person who principally does our Twitter feed.\n\nYour tweets were seriously funny. How did you do that? That\u2019s very kind of you. I think that the context is what makes them funny. They don\u2019t have to be hilarious because people look stupid.\n\n[In the below tweet, someone, thinking they were speaking to the Supreme Court, said the blog\u2019s method of highlighting opposition to the birth control decision wasn\u2019t \u201cfunny.\u201d]\n\nGlass half full? MT @folkpants: @SCOTUSblog, your RTs aren\u2019t funny. You\u2019re laughing at causing half the population to fear their futures. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) July 1, 2014\n\nWhat was the process? Did you fire these off as soon as they came to your head? Did you draft some of them? I did them just on the fly. We were down at the court reporting on the decisions for the first couple of hours, and I was just doing it on my cellphone, then I came back into the office and just kind of kept it up. Then this morning I\u2019ve just been marking tweets, and now I have a Google doc in front of me working on the next generation.\n\nHow many responses in total have you written so far? Probably around 20 and probably got another 20 to go.\n\nHow many people have tweeted at SCOTUSblog thinking that it was SCOTUS? We are probably catching around half of them. I really don\u2019t know. Sometimes our feed moves so fast that we miss them. Also we only do the mean ones. We aren\u2019t trying to embarrass people; we are trying to troll the trolls.\n\nHas this confusion ever happened before? Yes. It happens at the end of the year, every year, in the big big cases.\n\nHave you ever responded like that before? We did it a little bit last year, but never on a sustained basis.\n\nWhat was the most outrageous tweet you saw yesterday? There were some with just unbelievable profanity that I wouldn\u2019t ever repeat on the phone.\n\nWhy did you respond in the manner that you did? The only way to deal with trolls is to let them embarrass themselves. They aren\u2019t people you can have an actual conversation with. This is a way to engage the readership. When I do this, hellfire rains down on them, we now have 180,000 followers. If it was just us responding to them, that would be one thing, but if they are sufficiently abusive they could get hundreds of things directed at them.\n\nWhat message were you trying to get across? Just to take a minute and be more civil and think about what you are doing rather than blasting off.\n\nHow would you characterize your responses? As trolling the trolls.\n\nAre there any tweets you sent out that you regretted? The only one time I regret is when people aren\u2019t being mean\u2013I think there was one where someone was just confused. Then, some of our readers made fun of her and I do regret causing that reaction.\n\nWhy do you think it was meaningful to highlight the tweets that you did? Because there\u2019s such broad frustration with trolls on the Internet. People just hate them and don\u2019t have a way of dealing with them.\n\nI noticed that some people criticized your retweets, and you highlighted these people as well. Why did you decide to do that? Only people who criticized us as the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d for retweeting them. They refused to get it. They refused to look at our Twitter bio. They were being stupid about someone being stupid.\n\n[Here, a Twitter user sent a tweet to SCOTUSblog, saying its government is being passive aggressive. SCOTUSblog replied, \u201cDrops mic,\u201d referencing what rappers and comedians do when finished with an act, signifying they have just put on an amazing performance.]\n\nDrops mic. RT @sayyeslena: Have y\u2019all seen what @SCOTUSblog is tweeting? #MyGovernmentIsBeingPassiveAggressive #Awkward \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 30, 2014\n\nWhat was your favorite tweet from yesterday? Probably there\u2019s one that says, \u201cYou disgust me,\u201d and we say back, \u201cbut you complete us.\u201d Yeah. Just because of the elegant simplicity.\n\nDid you get a lot of new followers as a result from doing this? We got 20,000 new followers, but that\u2019s still only about 15 percent of our followers.\n\nWas it frustrating to you that so many people thought SCOTUSblog was SCOTUS? No. People thought that maybe we were taking it hard because people were being so mean to our account, but these people are being thoughtless and that doesn\u2019t bother me a bit. It gives us a great opportunity.\n\nWhat happened when you ate the cheap Kung Pao Chicken? There was no actual cheap Kung Pao chicken, I regret to say. That was a fictional tweet.\n\nWhat value do you see in Twitter as a platform to drive interaction and traffic to SCOTUSblog? It\u2019s not very deep. A lot of people miss it. A tweet goes by and people don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s not nearly as good as actual visits to the blog, but it\u2019s a good quick information distribution tool. It\u2019s good for breaking news, for example.\n\n[Here, a Twitter user accused SCOTUSblog, again, thinking it was speaking to the Supreme Court on Twitter, of being run by an angry 14-year-old boy.
