At least not immediately.\n\nIn a school board meeting held Friday, McKendrick retracted the request he made at Tuesday\u2019s board meeting to extend his contract. He instead suggested that the board consider his request at its first meeting in June 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK with it being pushed back until June because I\u2019m focused on children, engaging the community and developing a good relationship with the board,\u201d McKendrick told the board. \u201cNothing should come before the board that detracts from that.\u201d\n\nThe board unanimously approved that the issue be taken up in June.\n\n\u201cThough some may argue this, I\u2019m not sure you have a stauncher supporter than me,\u201d said Kelly Horwitz, the outgoing District 4 board member. \u201cBut I was concerned coming into this meeting because of your extension request. If I was forced to vote on it today, I could not have given you my vote. This is an issue the new board should take up.\u201d\n\nMcKendrick asked for a two-year extension to his contract after the board released the results of his first evaluation, which he received high marks on.\n\nThe request also fell on the last school board meeting that the current board was in power.\n\nOn Monday, three new board members \u2014 Lee Garrison, Norman Crow and Cason Kirby \u2014 will be sworn in.\n\nThe board didn\u2019t immediately respond to McKendrick\u2019s extension request Tuesday, but later that evening they called a meeting for 7:30 a.m. Friday to discuss or approve it.\n\nThe actions apparently caused some controversy. McKendrick said that a few people accused him and the board of slipping in a deal before the current board\u2019s term expired.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to give the appearance that this was a back-door deal,\u201d McKendrick told the board. \u201cIt just fell on the (board\u2019s) last day because that\u2019s when my evaluation was reported.\u201d\n\nSome board members said McKendrick\u2019s contract extension request caught them off-guard.\n\n\u201cI echo what Kelly said, but I have to say that I was caught completely unaware by this,\u201d said Marvin Lucas, a board member who represents District 6.\n\nLucas asked outgoing board chairman Dan Meissner if he knew about the request for a contract extension before McKendrick made it. Lucas told Meissner that if he did, Meissner should have told the rest of the board. Lucas said it was unfair to the board, the community and to McKendrick for the issue to be sprung on them.\n\n\u201cIt was awkward to have it come up the other night and not everyone knew about it,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nMeissner admitted that he did know about the request before Tuesday\u2019s meeting, but said he mistakenly didn\u2019t tell the other board members about it because he assumed McKendrick would have told them himself. He said he didn\u2019t think it was his place to advocate for McKendrick\u2019s extension.\n\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d Meissner said.\n\nMcKendrick said after the meeting that he and Meissner discussed extending his contract a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThis just didn\u2019t come about on Tuesday when I walked in,\u201d McKendrick said. \u201cIt was just perceived that way.\u201d\n\nMcKendrick said his request wasn\u2019t about money as some people in the city have been saying since his request became public.\n\nHe said he requested an extra two years because he wants to bring stability to the system. He said he doesn\u2019t think the two and a half years he has left in his contract is enough time to position the system where he\u2019d like it to be.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, we\u2019ll have had six new principals,\u201d McKendrick said. \u201cWe added a new principal at Woodland Forrest Elementary, Skyland Elementary and Southview Middle last year. Right now, we don\u2019t have a full-time principal at Paul W. Bryant High (where former assistant superintendent Dorothy Richardson is serving as interim principal), and we\u2019ll be bringing in new principals at University Place Elementary School and Northridge High School. We\u2019re looking at Nov. 8 as being the last day for Dr. (Deron) Cameron at University Place.\n\n\u201cWe need stability and school systems without steady principals don\u2019t do well,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the changes going on, including with Common Core and the new ACT+ exam, we have to train everyone.\u201d\n\nBoard vice chairwoman Earnestine Tucker said McKendrick\u2019s done a good job raising the system\u2019s academic rigor, but she would like to see him do more before they add another two years to his contract.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years just trying to get rid of some things we needed to get rid of,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know Dr. McKendrick. We don\u2019t know what he can do beyond get us out of where we were. He\u2019s been a moving target since he\u2019s been in the system. We haven\u2019t really dissected him.\n\n\u201cI believe he can do well, but we\u2019re under a microscope and can\u2019t afford to make any mistakes. ... The next three years will be important.\u201d\n\nIncoming board members Garrison and Crow, who both attended the Friday meeting, said they think the board made the right choice by pushing the vote on McKendrick\u2019s contract extension back to June.\n\nThe contract extension request \u201cwas a surprise to me,\u201d Garrison said, \u201cbut the right decision was made. As I said to Dr. McKendrick yesterday, I look forward to working with him and seeing constant and never-ending improvement of the system on a daily basis. When the contract extension conversation comes around in June, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to discuss it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul McKendrick\u2019s five-year contract as superintendent of the Tuscaloosa City School System will not be extended for an additional two years.
