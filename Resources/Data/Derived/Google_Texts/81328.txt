Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) accused President Barack Obama of rewriting the Constitution during a Tuesday appearance on Fox News.

Bachmann's accusation came amid criticism of the Affordable Care Act, which she's slammed in the past.

“He has rewritten the Constitution for himself as a part of his effort to fundamentally transform the United States of America,” Bachmann said Tuesday.

Bachmann called the recently announced delay of online enrollment for small businesses "political management."

“What are these delays about, what do they have in common? They all put off the very negative effects of Obamacare until the next election. That’s what this is all about," Bachmann said. "This is all political management. But we believe the constitution has to be respected."

Bachmann has considered taking action against Obamacare before, saying in November that she and several of her GOP colleagues in the House of Representatives were considering suing Obama for allowing plans canceled under the Affordable Care Act to be extended through 2014.
