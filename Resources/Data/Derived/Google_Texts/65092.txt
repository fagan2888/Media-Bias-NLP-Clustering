Republican National Committee Statement On Federal ObamaCare Ruling

By RNC // May 15, 2016

Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus released the following statement in response to House Republicans’ victory in federal court over the Obama Administration’s unlawful implementation of ObamaCare:

“This ruling is a victory for the rule of law and another rebuke by the courts to a president who has routinely flouted the Constitution,” said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.

“ObamaCare has proven to be an unpopular, unworkable train wreck that has delivered one broken promise after another, made our weak economy even worse, and disrupted the lives of millions of Americans.”

“While Hillary Clinton and the Democrats want to expand this failed law and give Washington more control over Americans’ health care, the Republican Party is united in our resolve to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered reforms that will actually lower costs and expand access to care.”
