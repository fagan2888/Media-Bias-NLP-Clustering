But is this \u201ccommonplace\u201d observation rooted in our brains? Is it even true?\n\nThe paper, \u201cDifferences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology,\u201d by lead author John R. Hibbing of the University of Nebraska, answers yes to both questions. It advances three successive waves of evidence, which combine to show that conservatives differ from liberals by having stronger, more intense reactions to negative aspects of the environment \u2014 such as physical threats, or potential sources of disease \u2014 which are ultimately physiological. At the same time, with multiple forms of mass hysteria going on at once, American conservatives seem dead set on proving the scientists right, and underscoring the importance of the work they\u2019re doing.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: The scientists themselves insist that \u201cciting differences in the psychological and physiological traits of liberals and conservatives is not equivalent to declaring one ideology superior to the other.\u201d While this may be true in an abstract sense, and a mix of psychological tendencies makes a society more robust in the long run \u2014 balancing needs for caution and self-preservation with needs for exploration, innovation and renewal \u2014 in 21st century America, things look strikingly different.\n\nConservative fears of nonexistent or overblown boogeymen \u2014 Saddam\u2019s WMD, Shariah law, voter fraud, Obama\u2019s radical anti-colonial mind-set, Benghazi, etc. \u2014 make it hard not to see conservatism\u2019s prudent risk avoidance as having morphed into a state of near permanent paranoia, especially fueled by recurrent \u201cmoral panics,\u201d a sociological phenomenon in which a group of \u201csocial entrepreneurs\u201d whips up hysterical fears over a group of relatively powerless \u201cfolk devils\u201d who are supposedly threatening the whole social order. Given that conservatism seems to be part of human nature \u2014 just as liberalism is \u2014 we\u2019re going to need all the help we can get in figuring out how to live with it, without being dominated, controlled and crippled by it.\n\nConsider the recent wave of hysteria over Central American children turning themselves in at the border. There were the hordes of angry demonstrators protesting busloads of children, like it was Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. There was the congressman/doctor Phil Gingrey\u2019s warning letter to the CDC, claiming that the children might be carrying the Ebola virus \u2014 a disease unknown outside Sub-Saharan Africa. There was the ludicrous myth of the \u201c$50 million illegal alien resort spa.\u201d But above all there was the most basic, fundamental fact that the children were turning themselves in at the border \u2014 it was anything but a failure of border protection, although that\u2019s what the right-wing hysteria portrayed it as.\n\nPut simply, none of what conservatives have been doing in the recent \u201cborder crisis\u201d moral panic makes any sense in terms of pragmatic problem-solving. But it all makes perfect sense in terms of expressively defending a threatened group identity \u2014 and that is very much in line with what researchers have found to be the defining characteristics of conservatism.\n\n\u201cI think immigration is a perfect example of some of the things we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hibbing told Salon. \u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t frame it, I probably wouldn\u2019t use the phrase \u2018moral panic,\u2019\u201d he qualified \u2014 sometimes psychologists and sociologists don\u2019t see eye-to-eye \u2014 \u201cand I wouldn\u2019t frame it necessarily as just threat,\u201d he added, quickly going on to explain, \u201cA lot of the adverse to immigration could be traced to a disgust reaction as well, which is another negative stimulus being used a lot. A lot of the language that one hears, even now with the kids on the border, is fear of disease and impurities, things like that. So it\u2019s not just threat \u2014 or it\u2019s threat, in a way, but not like \u2018a bad guy with a gun.\u2019 It\u2019s fear of pathogens as well,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cSo anyway, I think that is a perfect example of how these kinds of basic orientations to negative and positive stimuli can then translate themselves into political positions on issues of the day; in this case, a really important one like immigration.\u201d\n\nCould all the differences between liberals and conservatives really come down to something as simple as differences in responses to perceived threat? In a word, no. Just as the title of his paper says, the research Hibbing and others have done shows that differences in threat bias underlie variations in political ideology; they do not explain all the variation, just a good chunk of it. Yet, that in itself is a tremendous advancement.\n\nTo understand what Hibbing and his colleagues have achieved, it\u2019s useful to compare their work to a 2003 paper, \u201cPolitical Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition,\u201d by John Jost and colleagues, which made a more modest, but related claim that conservatism could be understood as an ensemble of tendencies within a unified framework. That paper focused on psychological survey data \u2014 information gleaned from conscious questioning in 88 separate studies across decades of research in 12 countries. It did not claim that motivated reasoning was limited to conservatives, or that motivated reasoning was necessarily false, although many of its initial critics in Congress and elsewhere jumped to those conclusions (and some even threatened to defund the entire field of research into political psychology). But the paper\u2019s abstract did say that \u201cAnalyzing political conservatism as motivated social cognition integrates theories of personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism\u2013intolerance of ambiguity), epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification).\u201d\n\nWhile alarmed conservatives thought they saw a sinister plot afoot, those familiar with some of the studies cited probably saw something else: an intriguing array of diverse yet interrelated factors, crying out for some sort of simplifying insight that could explain how and why they all fit together in some relatively simple, straightforward manner. Like the chemical elements before Mendeleev, or the subatomic particles in the pre-quark era, scientists in the field faced a too-complicated picture for their sense of order and simplicity to abide. They had their own sort of motivated cognition, you see.\n\nBut that earlier paper was relatively tame compared to the new one by by Hibbing\u2019s team, which also wrote the book \u201cPredisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences.\u201d Where \u201cPolitical Conservatism\u201d talked about psychology, Hibbing\u2019s work also talks about brain structure and function. It burrows much more deeply into who we are, and by surfacing the far-reaching power of a single unifying factor \u2014 differences in threat bias \u2014 it achieves a dramatic simplification of the overall picture of the field.\n\nHibbing is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, which has a political physiology lab \u201cdedicated to exploring the relevance of individual-level biological variations to political orientations and behaviors,\u201d which may well be the only one of its kind \u2014 so far. But the evolution from political psychology to political physiology in recent years has many collaborators, and the paper appeared with comments from 26 researchers or research teams, with similar expertise, the vast majority of whom (\u201c22 or 23\u201d by Hibbing\u2019s count) basically accepted the general idea of the findings, though with varying degrees and kinds of qualification.\n\nThe authors note that approaches based on trying to explain political attitudes based on genetics or on parents\u2019 political views have not produced clear, substantial results, which is why they propose to focus on an intermediate level, between pure biology and explicit political influence \u2014 that of physiological responses to experience, the realm in which threat bias emerges.\n\nThe findings of a 2008 paper from Hibbing\u2019s team provide a concrete illustration of what they have focused on in their own work, which in turn informs their evaluation of the work of others. Forty-six individuals with strong political attitudes were exposed to three threatening images mixed among 30 neutral ones, and their physiological responses (changes in skin conductance level) were compared to their political attitudes on 18 issues related to \u201cprotecting the interests of the participants\u2019 group, defined as the United States in mid-2007, from threats.\u201d The more conservative \u201cgroup protective\u201d participants showed \u201can increase in skin conductance when threatening stimuli were presented,\u201d while those who were more liberal, less \u201cgroup protective\u201d were \u201cmostly unaffected by those same stimuli\u201d \u2014 a difference that was statistically significant.\n\nThe threatening images included \u201ca very large spider on the face of a frightened person, a dazed individual with a bloody face, and an open wound with maggots in it.\u201d The policy issues were \u201csupport for military spending, warrantless searches, the death penalty, the Patriot Act, obedience, patriotism, the Iraq War, school prayer, and Biblical truth; and opposition to pacifism, immigration, gun control, foreign aid, compromise, premarital sex, gay marriage, abortion rights, and pornography.\u201d The researchers themselves did not label them as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d \u201cbecause we measure only one aspect of ideologies and exclude other aspects such as positions on economic issues.\u201d However, the relationship between conservatism and group protection is self-evident, even if not all-encompassing.\n\nIn the current paper, the authors\u2019 argument proceeds in four stages. First, an examination of \u201cliberal-conservative psychological differences as reflected in (survey) self-reports,\u201d which was established in Jost\u2019s 2003 meta-analysis, and has been expanded on since. They note that two of the five core personality traits \u2014 known as the Big Five \u2014 correlate consistently with political orientation \u201cacross a broad range of studies\u201d \u2014 conservatives score higher on conscientiousness while liberals score higher on openness to new experiences. (The other three traits are agreeableness, extraversion and emotional stability). Second, they review \u201cpsychological differences that are not fully accessible to the participants themselves,\u201d such as differences in responding to negative imagery. Third, they describe evidence of \u201cphysiological differences between liberals and conservatives,\u201d including differences in brain structure and function. Fourth, they present a synthesis of the research \u201carguing that many of the correlations described are tied together by the common thread of differences in response patterns to negative stimuli.\u201d They point out that \u201cGood evolutionary reasons exist for negativity bias given that negative events can be much more costly in fitness terms than positive events are beneficial; to state the obvious, infection, injury, and death curtail reproductive opportunities.\u201d\n\nHowever, what matters for political psychology is not the existence of negativity bias, \u201cbut that it varies so much from individual to individual,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThat some people are more attuned to potential threats, more sensitive to sources of contagion, and more desirous of in-group protections is known intuitively and amply demonstrated by a large research literature,\u201d and this variation in heightened negativity bias is significantly correlated with conservatism. Indeed, the authors state, that there is no known published study indicating the opposite.\n\nThe connection between heightened negativity bias and conservatism is not hard to make, the authors note, \u201cIt is not surprising that those attuned to the negative in life might take steps to avoid it, perhaps by refraining from taking chances with the unknown, by following instructions, and by sticking to the tried and true.\u201d (Indeed, erring on the side of caution is one of the non-political meanings of the word \u201cconservative,\u201d as in a \u201cconservative investment\u201d or a \u201cconservative estimate.\u201d) Elaborating further, they note:\n\n[N]ot only do political positions favoring defense spending, roadblocks to immigration, and harsh treatment of criminals seem naturally to mesh with heightened response to threatening stimuli but those fostering conforming unity (school children reciting the pledge of allegiance), traditional lifestyles (opposition to gay marriage), enforced personal responsibility (opposition to welfare programs and government provided healthcare), longstanding sources of authority (Biblical inerrancy; literal, unchanging interpretations of the Constitution), and clarity and closure (abstinence-only sex education; signed pledges to never raise taxes; aversion to compromise) do, as well. Heightened response to the general category of negative stimuli fits comfortably with a great many of the typical tenets of political conservatism.\n\nSumming up, they conclude:\n\nThus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that individuals who are physiologically and psychologically responsive to negative stimuli will tend to endorse public policies that minimize tangible threats by giving prominence to past, traditional solutions, by limiting human discretion (or endorsing institutions, such as the free market, that do not require generosity, discretion, and altruism), by being protective, by promoting ingroups relative to out-groups, and by embracing strong, unifying policies and authority figures\n\nThis is not to say the authors think there are no outstanding problems or challenges that remain to be fully explained or resolved. In particular, they focus on three major concerns. First, the problem of causal order, \u201cDo physiological and broad psychological traits shape political dispositions, or might political dispositions actually shape physiological and broad psychological traits?\u201d Second, the problem of messiness: that political orientations do not necessarily organize themselves neatly onto a single left/right continuum. Third, the problem of ultimate causes: \u201c[I]f negativity bias leads to the adoption of certain personality traits, basic values, moral foundations, and bedrock political principles, what causes variation in negativity bias in the first place?\u201d\n\nRegarding the problem of causal order, they note that resolving the issue \u201crequires either longitudinal or experimental data,\u201d and that although such studies are few, they all point to politics as resulting from physiological and psychological traits, rather than causing them, although questions were subsequently raised by commentators. It certainly seems plausible that causation could flow both ways, and more studies are clearly called for to illuminate this.\n\nThe messiness question is a good deal messier. On the individual level, people often have views on one or more subjects that are at odds with the overall positions of others who share their ideology. As groups, there are various intra-ideological cleavages as well \u2014 as shown in Pew\u2019s political typologies, for example. There are also questions raised by political moderates, and those who shy away from politics altogether. More generally, there is the question of dimensionality: Is there really only one dimension to political beliefs, or are there two\u2014social and economic \u2014 or more? This was a subject of considerable debate among commentators as well, but in the response section, the authors noted:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phony WMD, Benghazi, birthers, truthers -- turns out there's a scientific explanation for deniers and Tea Partyers", "title": "Secrets of the right-wing brain: New study proves it \u2014 conservatives see a different, hostile world", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Phony WMD, Benghazi, birthers, truthers -- turns out there's a scientific explanation for deniers and Tea Partyers", "title": "Secrets of the right-wing brain: New study proves it \u2014 conservatives see a different, hostile world", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/29/secrets_of_the_right_wing_brain_new_study_proves_it_conservatives_see_a_different_hostile_world/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/rand_paul_brain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Phony WMD, Benghazi, birthers, truthers -- turns out there's a scientific explanation for deniers and Tea Partyers", "title": "Secrets of the right-wing brain: New study proves it \u2014 conservatives see a different, hostile world", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/rand_paul_brain.jpg", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, Conservatives, Editor's Picks, Gaza, right wing, Tea Party, Ukraine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc346\"", "article_summary": "Third, they describe evidence of \u201cphysiological differences between liberals and conservatives,\u201d including differences in brain structure and function.\nFirst, an examination of \u201cliberal-conservative psychological differences as reflected in (survey) self-reports,\u201d which was established in Jost\u2019s 2003 meta-analysis, and has been expanded on since.\nSecond, they review \u201cpsychological differences that are not fully accessible to the participants themselves,\u201d such as differences in responding to negative imagery.\nHeightened response to the general category of negative stimuli fits comfortably with a great many of the typical tenets of political conservatism.\nThe paper, \u201cDifferences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology,\u201d by lead author John R.
