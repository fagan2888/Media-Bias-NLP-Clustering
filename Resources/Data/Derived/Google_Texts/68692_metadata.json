(5/14/16) \u2014 Kentucky\u2019s Insurance Commissioner filed a lawsuit yesterday in Franklin Circuit Court against the company originally hired to process and pay claims for the now-defunct Kentucky Health Cooperative.\n\nThe suit contends that CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. was grossly negligent in processing and paying claims and that it breached the contract it had with the Co-op.\n\nThe Co-op was created in 2012 under provisions of the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance coverage to Kentuckians. After suffering severe financial losses, the Co-op was placed in rehabilitation in 2015 and, after further investigation, was placed into liquidation early this year when it was determined that the Co-op would never recover from its deep deficit.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Brian Maynard filed the lawsuit in his capacity as the co-op\u2019s court-appointed liquidator. \u201cWe have a duty to investigate the causes of the Co-op\u2019s collapse and to hold responsible those individuals who caused the collapse,\u201d Maynard said. \u201cThis includes recovering funds from responsible parties so that the doctors, nurses, and hospitals that treated Kentuckians insured by the Co-op are fairly compensated for their services. Today\u2019s action is a step toward this goal.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky Co-op is one of a dozen Obamacare co-ops that failed after only two years. Eight of the 11 co-ops that remain open in other states are also reported to be in serious financial situations.\n\nSurfKY News\n\nInformation provided by Ricki Gardenhire\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2008 - 2016 SurfKY News Group, Inc.
