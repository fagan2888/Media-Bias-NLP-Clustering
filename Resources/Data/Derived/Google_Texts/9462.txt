LAS VEGAS â€” The brawler versus grappler match-up went to the technician.

Denver native Brandon Thatch was caught by a clean two-punch combination that sent him to the mat less than two minutes into his PPV debut against Gunnar Nelson.

A minute later Nelson got Thatch to submit via a rear-naked choke at 2:54 of round one.

Thatch, who is a stiker at heart, could not get back to his feet once Nelson gained an advantageous position on the ground.

Thatch fell to 11-3 with his second straight loss, both via rear-naked choke submissions.
