Schwalb of Star Partners and Bob Farnsworth of Hummingbird. The duo are aiming to get the movie into theaters for the 2015 holiday season. Karolyn Grimes, who played George Bailey\u2019s daughter \u201cZuzu\u201d in the original, will return for the \u201cWonderful Life\u201d sequel as an angel who shows Bailey\u2019s unlikeable grandson (also named George Bailey) how much better off the world would have been had he never been born. \u201cThe new film will retain the feeling of the original, and it simply must be shared,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cI\u2019ve probably read close to 20 scripts over the years suggesting a sequel to \u2018It\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u2019 but none of them were any good. The script by Bob Farnsworth and Martha Bolton was wonderful, and I wanted to be involved with his version of the film immediately.\u201d\n\nThe moral of the original is that a good man has everything to live for, as he enriches the people around him in ways he\u2019ll never fully grasp. The moral of the sequel is that a bad man \u2026 should kill himself, I guess? Or no, rather, that it\u2019s never too late for him to mend his ways and become the good man that lives within him. Great news: If you\u2019re into Christmas-themed parables about a miserable bastard finding redemption, have I got a book for you.\n\nIs there any way to make a sequel to IAWL that wouldn\u2019t end up being a schmaltzy desecration of the original? I can think of two, arguably. One: Go full A-list on the cast. That wouldn\u2019t make the movie \u201cgood,\u201d exactly, but it\u2019d make it an event, and that at least would give it some modicum of stature. The very justifiable fear among IAWL fans (i.e. everyone) is that unless you have serious talent on a project like this, it\u2019s going to end up drowning in a sea of treacle and bad acting. The concept has \u201cdirect to DVD\u201d written all over it. Don\u2019t let it happen. Two: Do something subversive with it. If it\u2019s nothing more than a standard-issue Christmas heartwarmer with some stunt casting, it\u2019ll pale dismally in comparison to the original. If you use it as, say, a vehicle for comparing small-town American life then and now, it could be interesting in its own right depending upon how subtle the social commentary is. Odds are it\u2019ll be excruciatingly heavy-handed and cornball; young George will be some sort of Potter-esque corporate raider, bulldozing low-income housing so that he has a place to polo or whatever. Oh, and he\u2019ll drive a convertible sports car, of course. Of course.\n\nActually, I can think of a third option: Get Dana Carvey and do this movie right. Exit question: Am I wrong in thinking that \u201cMr. Smith Gets Primaried\u201d would be a fantastic movie?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Destruction.", "title": "Endgame: Hollywood sequel in the works to \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/18/endgame-hollywood-sequel-in-the-works-to-its-a-wonderful-life/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-18T22:21:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T21:29:07+00:00"}, "keywords": "it's a wonderful life, sequel, variety, zuzu,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a00\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve probably read close to 20 scripts over the years suggesting a sequel to \u2018It\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u2019 but none of them were any good.\nOr no, rather, that it\u2019s never too late for him to mend his ways and become the good man that lives within him.\nActually, I can think of a third option: Get Dana Carvey and do this movie right.\nThat wouldn\u2019t make the movie \u201cgood,\u201d exactly, but it\u2019d make it an event, and that at least would give it some modicum of stature.\nIs there any way to make a sequel to IAWL that wouldn\u2019t end up being a schmaltzy desecration of the original?"}
