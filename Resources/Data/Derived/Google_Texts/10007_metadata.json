Mark Warner and Tim Kaine (D-VA) recommended to the White House for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench, is \u201cpro-life and pro-gun\u201d \u2014 and those are his own words from a campaign ad he ran in 2011. His campaign website touted his \u201c\u2018A\u2019 Rating from the NRA.\u201d Meanwhile, he had a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. Armstrong voted for unconstitutional legislation purporting to nullify Obamacare. And he ran a campaign ad attacking his opponent for \u201ccomparing me to Barack Obama.\u201d The same ad touted his opposition to \u201cthe Cap and Trade Bill.\u201d\n\nArmstrong, who served as a state lawmaker when Warner was Virginia governor and as state House Minority Leader during Kaine\u2019s time in the governor\u2019s mansion, is one of two names the senators submitted to the White House for a judgeship on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. The White House typically defers to recommendations from home-state senators regarding federal district court nominations, especially when those recommendations come from President Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats, so Armstrong has a strong chance of becoming the president\u2019s nominee.\n\nThe former Virginia lawmaker\u2019s voting record, however, puts him very much at odds with President Obama\u2019s policies. Armstrong, for example, voted for TRAP legislation classifying abortion clinics as \u201ca category of \u2018hospital.\u2019\u201d This legislation led the state Board of Health to \u201crequire existing clinics to meet the same strict building standards as new hospital construction,\u201d an expensive new requirement that often forces clinics to close because they cannot afford the added expense.\n\nOn guns, Armstrong supported a bill allowing concealed handguns to be carried in restaurants and bars that serve alcohol, although the bill did also prohibit people with concealed firearms from drinking alcohol at these establishments. On immigration, he voted for legislation \u201cprohibiting the enrollment of an individual determined to be not lawfully present in the United States\u201d in state schools. On health care, he backed a state law claiming to nullify parts of the Affordable Care Act. A year later, a federal appeals court held that this law \u201creflects no exercise of \u2018sovereign power,\u2019 for Virginia lacks the sovereign authority to nullify federal law.\u201d\n\nArmstrong also cast anti-gay votes during his time as a state lawmaker, although he has since recanted many of his past views on gay rights and come out in favor of marriage equality. Prior to this evolution, however, Armstrong backed a state constitutional amendment restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples. He also supported legislation providing that state \u201csingle-family mortgage loans may be made to more than one person only if the persons to whom the loan is to be made are related by blood, marriage or adoption.\u201d Had this legislation become law, it would have prevented gay couples from obtaining such loans together.\n\nBeyond his legislative record, Armstrong made a sexual joke about a fellow lawmaker in 1998 while speaking on the house floor. During a playful discussion of a basketball game between lawmakers, Armstrong quipped that Del. Jeannemarie Devolites, then a freshman Republican lawmaker, was \u201ccoming over to my place later\u201d to \u201cgo over the playbook.\u2019 At a post-game party, Armstrong reportedly added that Devoiltes was \u201c\u2018no Monica Lewinsky,\u2019 but that she had potential.\u201d He later apologized for these comments, saying that \u201cto the extent that some members may have been offended by my remarks, I wish to extend an apology. \u2026 I was merely trying to bring a little levity to the process.\u201d\n\nShould Obama choose to nominate Armstrong, it is likely that he will face opposition from many of his traditional allies. Late last year, the president nominated Judge Michael Boggs, a conservative Georgia judge and former lawmaker, as part of a deal with Republican Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. Like Armstrong, Boggs cast several votes targeting abortion rights and opposing gay rights while he was a state lawmaker. Boggs\u2019 nomination is opposed by several prominent liberal groups, as well as by a list of Democratic senators that includes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).\n\nBoggs, however, was recommended by Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators, and they were able to pressure Obama into nominating this conservative judge due to a Senate Judiciary Committee practice that allows home-state senators to veto anyone nominated to a federal judgeship in their state. Both of the Virginia senators who recommended Armstrong, by contrast, are Democrats.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Ward Armstrong, a former Democratic Virginia lawmaker that Sens.
