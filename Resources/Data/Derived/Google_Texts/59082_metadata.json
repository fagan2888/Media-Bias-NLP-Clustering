It was smaller, more subdued, and more disorganized than Comic Con. It was poppier and noisier than a book festival. It was a refreshing opening-up of what BEA has always been \u2014 a trade show. (There were less charitable descriptions, mostly on Twitter.) To organizers, though, it felt a little like the rollout of Obamacare: bumpy, glitchy, and easy to mock, but ultimately redeemed by a last-minute surge.\n\nIn this case, the surge itself caused the chaos \u2014 fire-code violations, closed-off sections, guards barking orders, and hours-long lines snaking through the basement cafeteria. BookCon only uses one wing of the convention rooms and a sliver of the floor space at Javits \u2014 the rest is for BEA. Only 7,000 had bought tickets a week out from the show, but by Friday night, they\u2019d hit the limit of 10,000 \u2014 a thousand of them in the last 24 hours, according to show manager Brien McDonald. \u201cAt midnight, we had people back in Connecticut prepping sold-out messages.\u201d\n\nIt was a good thing because, as McDonald says, \u201cit was hairy today with ten. Believe me, we have a lot of work to do for next year.\u201d Fans took their cues from shows like Comic Con, lining up so early for panels that organizers quickly lost control. By 10:45 a.m., the lower level was cordoned off. From the escalators above, the group waiting to see Stan Lee looked like a refugee camp. McDonald regrets front-loading most of the big stars and putting them in too-small conference rooms. \u201cYou want to fire the cannon right away,\u201d he says, \u201cbut maybe next year there\u2019ll be a little more staggering.\u201d\n\nThings eased up later in the day, but in front of the main events hall \u2014 host to Amy Poehler and Martin Short, followed by a slate of blockbuster children\u2019s authors and the biggest draw, The Fault in Our Stars author John Green \u2014 the line turned into a roped-off swarm. Screaming teenage girls knocked over a barricade. Parents crowd-surfed out while the children remained. \u201cIt\u2019s got to improve,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cBut who wants to keep doing the same thing and not get better at it?\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll definitely get their chance. ReedPop, the subsidiary of Reed Exhibitions that set up BookCon, will propose splitting next year evenly between BEA and BookCon, with two days per show. (This year it was two-and-a-half days for the trade and one for consumers.) That might appease attendees who seemed to feel the event would have been great \u2014 if not for all the kids, or all the movie stars, or the cramped space, or the long lines (everyone agreed on the last one). The most satisfied customers were those who had come in (from as far away as Rhode Island and Virginia) to see one major author worth waiting three hours for.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d says McDonald, \u201cinstead of going home and saying, \u2018Do we do this next year?\u2019 we\u2019re saying, \u2018What is the expansion plan?\u2019 Two days is the obvious answer; there\u2019s no doubt from what I saw with my eyes.\u201d ReedPop is also looking to partner with retailers to sell books on a major scale.\n\nIt might help alleviate the long lines for galley giveaways \u2014 a concept that works at BEA but not so much at Comic Cons. Several people told me they\u2019d come packing plenty of cash. \u201cScholastic could have made $500 from me, and more later,\u201d said one schoolteacher, miffed that publishers seemed ill-equipped to engage customers. You only had to cross over from breathing-room-only BookCon floor to the vast BEA space, nearly deserted on its last half-day, to see that there was an imbalance.\n\nReedPop is doubling down not only on the show but on the Comic Con values they\u2019d hoped to infuse into it. Early complaints around New York Comic Con, which ReedPop manages, didn\u2019t dissuade fans from returning, and neither will this year\u2019s hairier moments. A couple of attendees may have tweeted #neveragain, but everyone I talked to planned on coming back. And almost all of them were excited about the notion that books matter this much to so many people \u2014 even if books sometimes took a backseat to celebrities, and literary fare lost out to genre giants.\n\nMcDonald says he personifies the point he\u2019s trying to make, which is that a bigger fair will have more room for all kinds. \u201cI was personally psyched to have [Cloud Atlas author] David Mitchell here,\u201d he says. \u201cI was also psyched to get Jason Segel,\u201d the actor who\u2019s got a children\u2019s book out in the fall. \u201cSegel\u2019s a storyteller in all fashions. He\u2019s onscreen, he writes beautifully, and he\u2019s a screenwriter, and that\u2019s the perfect BookCon panelist.\u201d\n\nMaybe next year, it\u2019ll be easier for fans to get in to see him. \u201cBut you see what we\u2019re going for,\u201d McDonald told me as we made one last walk across Javits in the closing minutes of the show. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a book festival.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "description": "There were lots of kids, movie stars, and long lines at the book industry's Comic Con.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Vulture", "description": "There were lots of kids, movie stars, and long lines at the book industry's Comic Con.", "title": "BookCon\u2019s Debut Was Chaotic, But Promising", "url": "http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/bookcons-debut-was-chaotic-but-promising.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/06/02/02-bookcon-amy-poehler-martin-short.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@vulture", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2014/06/02/02-bookcon-amy-poehler-martin-short.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "There were lots of kids, movie stars, and long lines at the book industry's Comic Con.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "BookCon\u2019s Debut Was Chaotic, But Promising"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Vulture", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "bookcon, books, book expo america, book expo 2014", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture", "tag": "bookcon,books,book expo america,book expo 2014", "published_time": "2014-06-02T14:40:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, bookcon, books, book expo america, book expo 2014", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc13\"", "article_summary": "Attendees at Saturday\u2019s sold-out BookCon, the new Comic Con\u2013styled consumer day at Book Expo America, grasped for comparisons while assessing their experience.\nYou only had to cross over from breathing-room-only BookCon floor to the vast BEA space, nearly deserted on its last half-day, to see that there was an imbalance.\nReedPop is doubling down not only on the show but on the Comic Con values they\u2019d hoped to infuse into it.\nBookCon only uses one wing of the convention rooms and a sliver of the floor space at Javits \u2014 the rest is for BEA.\nEarly complaints around New York Comic Con, which ReedPop manages, didn\u2019t dissuade fans from returning, and neither will this year\u2019s hairier moments."}
