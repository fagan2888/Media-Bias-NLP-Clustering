(John Locher/AP)\n\nFormer New York governor George Pataki suspended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday, after a campaign that appeared doomed almost from the start by both his long stretch out of the national spotlight and the mismatch between his moderate politics and a party turning harder to the right.\n\nPataki announced the suspension of his campaign in a two-minute message that aired on NBC affiliates in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. He secured the free air time through an \u201cequal time\u201d request made after GOP front-runner Donald Trump hosted the network\u2019s popular \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d program.\n\nSeated in front of a fireplace, Pataki said that the country needs to elect a president who can do three things: \u201cconfront and defeat radical Islam, shrink the size and power of Washington, and unite us again in our belief in this great country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident we can elect the right person. Someone who will bring us together and who understands that politicians \u2014 including the president \u2014 must be the people\u2019s servant and not their master,\u201d he said.\n\nPataki, 70, once was an impressive figure in Republican politics: He upset a Democratic legend, then-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in 1994 and won reelection twice in a famously liberal state. Pataki flirted with a presidential run three times before, in 2000, 2008 and 2012.\n\nBut each time, he withdrew. For one reason or another, Pataki said, the moment wasn\u2019t right.\n\nThen this year, he flirted again \u2014 and actually ran.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready. I know that the need to change Washington is as big as [it has] been in my lifetime. I know the need to have a vision for the future of this country is absolutely essential. I have that vision. My life has prepared me for this moment,\u201d he told The Washington Post and the TV station NH1 when he announced his candidacy May 28.\n\nBut, as it turned out, his moment had already passed.\n\nPataki has not held office since 2006, and his name recognition has eroded sharply since then; when \u201cJeopardy!\u201d contestants were shown his picture earlier this year, none of them could supply his name. The key moments of Pataki\u2019s political biography were even further in the past: the trying days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the stupendous defeat of Cuomo in 1994.\n\nAt times, too, Pataki\u2019s platform seemed out of a different time and aimed at a different Republican Party. Pataki supports abortion rights and had signed a strict gun-control measure in New York. He also told voters that true governance required compromise and that he\u2019d learned how to share power with Democrats in Albany.\n\n\u201cI understand that to change Washington you have to understand government as well. You can\u2019t just be an outsider. You can\u2019t just be someone who throws stones at Washington,\u201d Pataki said in the Oct. 28 \u201cundercard\u201d debate. \u201cYou have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines.\u201d\n\nThat was the wrong message for this year\u2019s GOP, in which many primary voters believe their leaders already turn to compromise far too eagerly, and far too soon. They blame Republican leaders in Washington for capitulating to President Obama and for being unable to deliver victories like sharp cutbacks in spending and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. This year, in fact, compromise was getting even longtime leaders like House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) pushed out of Washington.\n\nIt was certainly not any Republican\u2019s ticket in.\n\nAt times, Pataki seemed bewildered by the campaign he\u2019d entered, led by outsiders who portrayed themselves as insurgents, with theatrical gestures of disdain for Washington and its current occupants.\n\n\u201cIt is turning the American presidency into a reality gong show, and that\u2019s not right,\u201d Pataki said last month, lamenting the influence of Donald Trump on the campaign. So even his jokes were old: The original \u201cGong Show,\u201d an absurdist TV variety show, broadcast its last new episode in 1980.\n\nIn national polls, Pataki rarely made it above 1 percent. Even in New Hampshire \u2014 the key moderate-leaning state that Pataki visited dozens of times \u2014 his best showing was 2 percent. And that was back in July. In more recent months, Pataki was polling at 1 or zero percent even in the Granite State, where he was overshadowed by better-known politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who are aiming at the same bloc of moderate voters.\n\nPataki never made the main stage at any GOP debate. Once, he even failed to make the undercard event.\n\nOver the summer, Pataki tried a gambit that others \u2014 including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal \u2014 had attempted and failed. He attacked GOP front-runner Donald Trump, calling the bombastic billionaire \u201cidiotic\u201d for his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country now.\n\nBut Pataki had brought a knife to an artillery barrage.\n\nTrump blasted Pataki on social media and in speeches, lambasting the former governor \u2014 someone Trump had once praised \u2014 as a terrible politician.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got nothing. He was a terrible governor of New York. He couldn\u2019t have been elected dogcatcher,\u201d Trump said in a rant in Iowa in November. \u201cThen he didn\u2019t even make the child\u2019s stage [at the debate] two days ago! And I hear he\u2019s still not quitting! He\u2019s got zero chance.\u201d\n\nFor Pataki, this tactic didn\u2019t work. Trump stayed up. He stayed down.\n\nBy late August, it was clear that the prize Pataki had flirted with for so long would elude him \u2014 even Pataki\u2019s own political mentor and closest ally in politics, former New York senator Alfonse D\u2019Amato (R), gave up on him.\n\nD\u2019Amato endorsed another presidential candidate instead: Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a friend. He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s articulate,\u201d D\u2019Amato said of Pataki, according to Newsday. \u201cBut there is no way he can carry Ohio.\u201d\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe in Keene, N.H., contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The move effectively ends the former New York governor\u2019s longshot GOP bid", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The move effectively ends the former New York governor\u2019s longshot GOP bid", "title": "Pataki suspends presidential bid", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pataki-suspends-presidential-bid/2015/12/29/961ba1c6-a27f-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/29/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Debate-04d08-3213.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "daveweigel"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pataki-suspends-presidential-bid/2015/12/29/961ba1c6-a27f-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "961ba1c6-a27f-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433"}, "article_summary": "George Pataki speaks during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the in Las Vegas earlier this month.\nYou can\u2019t just be someone who throws stones at Washington,\u201d Pataki said in the Oct. 28 \u201cundercard\u201d debate.\nPataki, 70, once was an impressive figure in Republican politics: He upset a Democratic legend, then-New York Gov.\nPataki flirted with a presidential run three times before, in 2000, 2008 and 2012.\nTrump blasted Pataki on social media and in speeches, lambasting the former governor \u2014 someone Trump had once praised \u2014 as a terrible politician."}
