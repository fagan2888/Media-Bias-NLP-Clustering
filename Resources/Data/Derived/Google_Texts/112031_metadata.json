Tate Schroeder was on an airplane, preparing to fly from Florida to Wisconsin to check out the women\u2019s tennis program in Madison.\n\nThe first of Schroeder\u2019s four official college visits further supported her decision to transfer from Centennial\u2019s Arapahoe High School to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. She made the move in 2014 following her sophomore year at Arapahoe, after winning the Class 5A No. 1 singles title.\n\n\u201cEveryone excels at their sports at IMG, so it\u2019s kind of like going from a big fish to a small pond to a bunch of big fish in an even bigger pond,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a really competitive atmosphere, but ultimately it makes everyone be a better athlete and makes you want to exceed even more.\u201d\n\nSchroeder began her senior year of high school last week at IMG, where she produced a 3.90 grade-point average as a junior. She is ranked 59th among 2016 college recruits and hopes to turn pro after college.\n\nIMG Academy recruits the best of the best in nine sports, including tennis, and Schroeder has become a five-star college recruit. The 17-year-old \u2014 the daughter of prominent Denver-area singer Jake Schroeder, formerly of the band Opie Gone Bad \u2014 also will take official visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State and Missouri. Ohio State is making a big push too.\n\n\u201cTate is keeping all her options open,\u201d said Dave Shear, her stepfather and longtime personal coach. \u201cShe\u2019s developed a pro-style ground stroke \u2014 offensive, very aggressive \u2014 so her game is a more physical brand and more conducive to certain coaches, certain schools. She wants a big program that can develop her game.\u201d\n\nShear is a retired Denver police officer who moved to Florida with Tate and her mother before the 2014 school year. Teresa Shear, Tate\u2019s mother, is the director of alumni relations at IMG. Teresa used to be an executive with the Broncos.\n\nIdeally, Teresa would like her daughter to sign with Colorado or the University of Denver; both have solid tennis programs.\n\n\u201cShe still talks to CU and DU and feels the hometown connection with those schools,\u201d Teresa said. \u201cAnytime a coach reaches out to her, she responds and sees if there\u2019s any kind of rapport there. She\u2019s got a lot of great opportunities. It\u2019s a good time for her.\u201d\n\nJake Schroeder, the executive director of the Denver Police Activities League, said Teresa\u2019s work with IMG balances out the financial burden of sending a child to the elite academic and athletic institution. Tate is on a partial scholarship at the school she wanted to attend since picking up tennis at age 8.\n\nA school year at IMG costs about $70,000, depending on the sport, and includes tuition, equipment, boarding and meals.\n\n\u201cAs a little kid, she wrote IMG a letter and basically said, \u2018I\u2019ll sweep floors or whatever it takes to go to school there.\u2019 So she\u2019s always wanted to go there, and her mom was able to make it work,\u201d Jake Schroeder said. \u201cThey really uprooted their lives, and I\u2019m very appreciative of what they\u2019ve done. I couldn\u2019t have done it, with my ties in the community, my work and having two other children. So I\u2019m grateful that her mom and stepdad could do all that.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nGreat Tate\n\nTate Schroeder\u2019s key numbers\n\n1 Finish among 2014 Class 5A girls No. 1 singles players\n\n3.90 Grade-point average last school year at IMG Academy\n\n25 Strength-of-schedule ranking among 2016 college freshmen\n\n59 Ranking among 2016 college freshmen\n\nMike Chambers,The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tate Schroeder feeling A-OK about her transfer to IMG", "title": "Tate Schroeder feeling A-OK about her transfer to IMG", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/06/tate-schroeder-feeling-a-ok-about-her-transfer-to-img/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150906__BN20150907_B2_BNSP07TENSCHROEDERp1.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150906__BN20150907_B2_BNSP07TENSCHROEDERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T22:06:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:23:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Prep boys tennis, Prep girls tennis"}, "article_summary": "Tate Schroeder was on an airplane, preparing to fly from Florida to Wisconsin to check out the women\u2019s tennis program in Madison.\n1 singles players3.90 Grade-point average last school year at IMG Academy25 Strength-of-schedule ranking among 2016 college freshmen59 Ranking among 2016 college freshmenMike Chambers,The Denver Post\nIMG Academy recruits the best of the best in nine sports, including tennis, and Schroeder has become a five-star college recruit.\nIdeally, Teresa would like her daughter to sign with Colorado or the University of Denver; both have solid tennis programs.\nTate is on a partial scholarship at the school she wanted to attend since picking up tennis at age 8."}
