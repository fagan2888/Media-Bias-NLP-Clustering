A map that was front and center on that day\u2019s newspaper showed green dots covering a handful of neighborhoods that might be converted to parkland.\n\nHarvey Bender, a laid-off city worker from New Orleans East, seemed to speak for the crowd.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you, Joe Canizaro, but I hate you,\u201d Bender growled, addressing the banker and developer whom Nagin had charged with crafting the land-use recommendations. \u201cI\u2019m going to suit up like I\u2019m going to Iraq and fight this.\u201d\n\nTen years later, Bender\u2019s comments resonate as the opening salvo in an argument that has continued in various forums ever since.\n\nIt was a debate that went beyond the notion of shrinking the city\u2019s footprint. An unprecedented disaster posed unprecedented opportunities to build the city anew. Popular ideas for how to revitalize the country\u2019s declining, post-industrial cities could be put to the test in a place where many of the usual stubborn obstacles had been wiped from the landscape.\n\nAnd right away it made people angry. Most New Orleanians could concede that low-lying neighborhoods were still at risk. Few would argue that local services like health care for the poor, public housing or education had been anything like adequate before the storm. But they were clearly unwilling to be anyone else\u2019s \u201cblank slate.\u201d\n\nBottom line: They resented the idea of being experimented upon.\n\nNagin would ultimately reject any official delay in rebuilding and announce that \u201cmarket forces\u201d would decide which parts of town came back. The city\u2019s \u201cfootprint\u201d would look much as it did on Aug. 28, 2005.\n\nBut in other ways, New Orleans really was \u2014 in fact \u2014 remade after the storm. The green dots would never become a reality, but the city\u2019s public schools, its vast system of low-rise public housing complexes and its Charity Hospital system would be transformed in ways that have attracted both glowing accolades and fiery resentment.\n\nIf ambitious reforms always inspire disagreement, the fact that so much of what has changed in New Orleans in the past 10 years had its origins in the city\u2019s darkest hour has left profound scars. Every discussion about whether the changes have been for the best, whether the reforms are working or not, is colored by the fact that a catastrophe made them possible. In a way, this is the storm\u2019s most enduring impact.\n\n\u2018A completely different way\u2019\n\nPerhaps the first inkling that a full-scale do-over might be in store for New Orleans came in the form of a story that appeared on the front page of The Wall Street Journal less than two weeks after the storm, with much of the city still underwater.\n\nBusinessman Jimmy Reiss \u2014 whom Nagin had appointed to oversee the Regional Transit Authority before the storm \u2014 said he had been talking with the city\u2019s business leaders and there was a consensus about what should happen next.\n\n\u201cThose who want to see this city rebuilt want to see it done in a completely different way: demographically, geographically and politically,\u201d Reiss told The Journal. \u201cI\u2019m not just speaking for myself here. The way we\u2019ve been living is not going to happen again, or we\u2019re out.\u201d\n\nThose comments cast a long shadow over the debate that unfolded over the next few months, as planners from the Urban Land Institute and elsewhere arrived in New Orleans, eager to start talking about how best to rebuild a city that suffered from a host of well-diagnosed problems.\n\nKatrina presented an opportunity to take on some big, vexing issues. Why would you rebuild an exact replica of a city so dysfunctional?\n\nThere was talk of clustering development along light rail or streetcar lines, of fast trains to Louis Armstrong International Airport and Baton Rouge. In October, citing the city\u2019s precarious financial position, Nagin proposed a Vegaslike casino district downtown, to collective groans.\n\nFor a while, the footprint debate commanded center stage. Proponents of shrinking the city had two persuasive arguments. First, not everyone was likely to return, meaning that if every neighborhood was rebuilt, the result would be a \u201cjack-o\u2019-lantern effect\u201d \u2014 that is, many blocks would be pocked with the empty homes of those who didn\u2019t return. And if not everyone was going to come back, why not avoid resettling the most flood-prone areas altogether?\n\nIn other words, why not gather everyone who did want to come back into healthier, safer neighborhoods, less prone to blight and on higher ground?\n\nThis idea had well-meaning backers. It also stirred racial and class animosities. Reiss, in his comments to The Journal, left the impression that the city\u2019s well-heeled, white elite wanted a whiter, wealthier city. Canizaro, the man who had first traced those green dots, had conservative leanings and close ties to the George W. Bush White House, neither of which endeared him much to the city\u2019s black majority, which had started to wonder if the whole planning process was aimed at keeping them permanently scattered.\n\nThe green dots, after all, fell on neighborhoods where mostly poor, black people lived. There did not seem to be a plan to relocate them.\n\nNot that the idea was beloved in the largely white, middle-class neighborhood of Lakeview, where a building moratorium was proposed. After Bender declared war on the plan, Jeb Bruneau, the head of Lakeview\u2019s civic association, got up to the microphone and told Nagin, \u201cWe want to be able to go down to City Hall and get permits. We have the means to help ourselves, so don\u2019t get in our way.\u201d\n\nJeff Thomas, a lawyer who wound up working in the city\u2019s recovery office, said the \u201cbig reimagining\u201d of New Orleans was never realistic in the first place and not just because of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThe idea of shrinking the footprint was just a nonstarter under constitutional law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have required using eminent domain on thousands of properties.\u201d\n\nWith the forces of Big Planning in retreat after the Sheraton meeting, New Orleanians set about putting their city back together, mostly the way it had been.\n\nAnyone looking at the history of major urban disasters would not have been surprised. Rob Olshansky, an urban planning professor at the University of Illinois who wrote a book on post-storm planning in New Orleans, said that while catastrophes \u201calways provide some opportunities for improvement ... most things end up being rebuilt as they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think perhaps some people hoped that the city could take the opportunity to not rebuild the lowest areas and to cluster developments to save money on infrastructure,\u201d Olshansky wrote in an email. \u201cBut it was never realistic to think of the city as a blank slate, because disaster-struck cities never are: land tenure, social networks and memories prevent that.\u201d\n\nHousing overhaul\n\nStill, even as the footprint debate raged in the foreground, other changes were unfolding that would fundamentally remake several key aspects of New Orleans\u2019 civic life.\n\nThose storylines had begun well before Katrina formed off the coast of Florida. Cities \u2014 especially old cities with large populations of poor people \u2014 were increasingly seen as doomed in the 1980s, and poorly performing school districts, dangerous public housing complexes and badly designed health care systems were all cited as symptoms of the onrushing decline.\n\nIn the 1990s, the decade that saw President Bill Clinton sign a bipartisan welfare reform bill, Democrats increasingly began to come to a consensus that these failed urban systems needed radical fixes. The HOPE VI program, launched in 1992, aimed to change the face of public housing by tearing down dense old complexes and replacing them with mixed-income communities.\n\nThe thinking was that large housing projects had become incubators of urban ills, ranging from poverty to drug-selling, and that poor people would benefit from having a broader range of neighbors.\n\nNew Orleans got its first taste of HOPE VI in the years prior to Katrina, when the old St. Thomas complex was redeveloped into what was rechristened River Garden. While the new townhouses were mostly greeted approvingly, the redevelopment raised questions that would recur after Katrina.\n\nThe major critique was that most of the poor people who had lived in the St. Thomas complex had simply been moved to some other part of town, though they continued to receive rent assistance at a similar level through the Section 8 program or at other Housing Authority of New Orleans complexes. So while the River Garden neighborhood \u2014 where there are now twice as many market-rate apartments as public housing units \u2014 might have been spruced up, it was difficult to measure to what extent its ills had simply been shuffled around.\n\nSimilar overhauls were soon undertaken at the Guste, Florida, Desire and Fischer housing projects.\n\nThe floods presented a bigger opportunity. The remaining \u201cBig Four\u201d developments \u2014 Lafitte, St. Bernard, C.J. Peete and B.W. Cooper, which together contained about 60 percent of the remaining public housing in the city \u2014 all received some damage, though its extent was hotly debated. Controversially, most residents were not allowed to reoccupy their apartments.\n\nBecause of corruption and chronic mismanagement, HANO at the time was under federal control. And nine months after the storm, Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson announced that the 5,100 units in the four complexes were too damaged to be repaired and that the federal government would demolish and redevelop them.\n\nThat was far from the end of the story \u2014 there were lawsuits, protests and a rancorous City Council meeting in December 2007 at which the council unanimously voted to grant demolition permits after hours of fiery testimony. But the die was cast.\n\nMore recently, the Iberville complex, the last of the large traditional public housing developments remaining, has been undergoing its own transformation.\n\nAct 35 opens door\n\nFor years, the debate over urban public education had boiled down to this: Liberals, often seen as working hand in glove with teachers unions, would argue that failing urban school districts simply needed more resources.\n\nConservatives would counter that if liberals really cared about kids, they\u2019d support vouchers that would allow inner-city kids attending lousy schools to go to private schools \u2014 usually parochial ones \u2014 instead.\n\nAdvocates for years had been casting about for a Clintonian \u201cthird way\u201d that would produce better results without abandoning the fundamental notion that everyone should be entitled to a decent public education. Autonomous charter schools \u2014 free from the central-office meddling and incompetence often blamed for city schools\u2019 woes \u2014 were increasingly seen as the best hope.\n\nIn 2003, the Legislature had created something called the Recovery School District, a state agency that would be a repository for the city\u2019s worst schools.\n\nBut bigger changes portended. In 2005, the local school district\u2019s authority was further usurped when its shoddy financial controls, including contracting and some personnel decisions, were handed over to a contractor. By the time Katrina struck, five of the city\u2019s roughly 130 schools had been transferred to the control of the new recovery district and converted to charters.\n\nAfter the floods, with the entire city evacuated and most schools damaged, the Legislature passed Act 35, which suddenly put about four-fifths of the district\u2019s schools into the RSD, with the idea that most would be chartered as well. The School Board, meanwhile, fired all of its employees \u2014 roughly 7,000 of them \u2014 and announced it was shutting down for the 2005-06 school year. The RSD overrode the latter decision, opening a smattering of schools, most of them charters, after the Christmas break.\n\nThe upstart RSD suddenly had become the vehicle for a nearly complete reset of public education. Today, all but six of the city\u2019s schools are charters, an educational experiment of astonishing breadth.\n\nOver the last few years, a massive physical transformation of the school landscape, while not as audacious as the administrative changes, has begun to take shape.\n\nThe Stafford Act, which governs how the feds pay for disaster recovery, tends to encourage the rebuilding of exactly what was lost. Traditionally, the act has fully covered only one-to-one replacements of government buildings, which tends to discourage creative rethinking.\n\nBut with schools, local and federal officials came to a global agreement after years of haggling: The feds would give New Orleans $1.8 billion to build new schools and renovate old ones as it saw fit. The number of campuses and their location would be up to Louisiana officials.\n\nThe result, in the end, should be a system of new and renovated schools, fewer in number but right-sized to the district\u2019s population of students. It\u2019s a huge leap forward for a system that was in shockingly poor shape in 2005.\n\nCharity makeover\n\nThe storm also gave officials a long-desired window to build a new public hospital to replace Charity, the hulking, outmoded edifice completed in 1938.\n\nAs with schools and public housing, the plan was aimed partly at a physical upgrade for a building seen as anachronistic, but it also entailed a philosophical shift. The idea was to rethink Louisiana\u2019s system of charity hospitals for the poor, both privatizing their management and also trying to discourage uninsured patients from using the hospital for basic medical care, rather than emergencies.\n\nAt the same time, there was heady talk of creating a world-class biomedical district with the new hospital and a brand-new VA facility next door that would help bring the city\u2019s economy out of the doldrums.\n\nSkeptics argued that Charity was eminently fixable and that the state government\u2019s plan would take too long, cost too much, demolish a historic neighborhood and leave old Charity a blighted mess.\n\nThose concerns were mostly brushed aside, although the plan hardly sailed through. There was endless haggling over the extent of the damage from the flood. As with public housing, it was unclear that the damage was catastrophic. But there was an important distinction. The federal government was driving the plan to redevelop the Big Four and also was in charge of determining how bad the damage was \u2014 and thus how much repair money would be available.\n\nEventually, the state got its way when an arbitration panel awarded the state $475 million, roughly three times what the feds had offered, which allowed officials to close on financing. Almost 10 years after the storm, the new University Medical Center will open in August, under the management of LCMC Health, which owns and manages Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nWhile the new hospital has been under construction, emergency care has been provided by the much smaller Interim LSU Hospital.\n\nRoutine and primary medical care, such as management of hypertension, which in the past often fell to Charity to provide, has mostly been farmed out to a system of neighborhood-based clinics whose expansion into the void has been supported by federal and state aid.\n\nThat system has been mostly lauded but is under constant threat of cuts from the state Legislature.\n\nJury out; scars remain\n\nWhether the seismic changes wrought in these systems wound up benefiting New Orleanians \u2014 especially the city\u2019s poor, who depended upon them \u2014 will be debated far into the future. So, too, will the effect that the slow and painful process of knocking down and rebuilding these bedrock institutions had on people\u2019s decisions to return.\n\nIt\u2019s still early to render clear verdicts: The new hospital is just preparing to open its doors, though the new model of health care delivery has been in place for years now. HANO is still in the middle of its redevelopments, and while the school system has been thoroughly remade structurally, that structure is ever-changing, while the bricks-and-mortar side is still far from complete.\n\nThere is no shortage of opinions about how well things are going, however. Charter school proponents, for instance, say it\u2019s impossible to argue with their results: substantial across-the-board gains in key metrics like graduation rates and LEAP test passage rates.\n\nBut skeptics, even those who acknowledge there are positives in the new systems, say the real story is that the government is simply throwing in the towel \u2014 admitting it can\u2019t properly educate poor children, house their families or deliver them suitable health care \u2014 and jobbing the work out to private or semi-private contractors that may or may not do better but that are surely less accountable to the public.\n\n\u201cCertainly some would say that all three systems are much better than they were before,\u201d said Bill Quigley, director of the Gillis Long Poverty Law Center at Loyola University and an outspoken opponent of the changes. \u201cBut others would say, \u2018I lost my house, I lost my school and I lost my clinic.\u2019 \u201d\n\nQuigley gives the theoretical example of a family who before Katrina lived in the Lafitte project, within walking distance of low-wage work in the tourist economy and also near their children\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re back in New Orleans, they\u2019re probably living in Section 8 or with relatives in New Orleans East, and who knows where their kids are going to school?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a much tougher life than living within walking distance of school and work.\u201d\n\nFormer City Councilman Arnie Fielkow, who was outspoken in his support of the HANO overhaul \u2014 and who has since moved away from New Orleans \u2014 said it\u2019s impossible to track the myriad ways thousands of individual lives were changed by the reforms. But in his view, it\u2019s simply impossible to argue that the systems have not been improved.\n\n\u201cI think these were landmark changes from what existed before Katrina. And they were really the byproduct of the community recognizing that this was a great city but being honest that it had deficiencies that had to be cured if New Orleans was ever going to grow into the city it wanted to be,\u201d Fielkow said.\n\n\u201cI recognize all parties don\u2019t agree with the reforms that have taken place. But if you look at it with an objective eye, I think the schools have improved; it\u2019s certainly a much better public housing situation. ... For all concerned, I think New Orleans has made tremendous strides \u2014 due in large part to tremendous citizen input and resiliency on the part of a great citizenry.\u201d\n\nWhile it may take another decade or more for history to render its verdict on the changes, it\u2019s likely that some of the wounds inflicted in the post-Katrina battles may never heal. There is persistent anger among some skeptics that the city\u2019s elites wielded their power to fundamentally make over systems that primarily serve the powerless at a moment when those people were still reeling.\n\nLeslie Jacobs, a former state school board member who helped devise the schools takeover, is an unabashed supporter of the reforms, which has made her a controversial figure. She is fully aware of how much rancor remains.\n\n\u201cIn the taking over of the schools, a lot of people had pain,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cTeachers lost their jobs; the rules of the game had changed. This happened while they were evacuated. \u2026 You can\u2019t talk about success because everybody is walking on eggshells out of respect for the pain. And I\u2019m not clear how we move on from that.\u201d\n\nFollow Gordon Russell on Twitter, @gordonrussell1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Orleans, LA /Katrina/: I t was standing-room-only in the big hall at the Sheraton Hotel, and the mood was tense.
