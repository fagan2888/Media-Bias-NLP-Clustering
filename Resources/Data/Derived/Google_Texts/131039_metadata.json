In this economic turmoil, America needs a thoughtful, cool-headed optimist who envisions a bright future for all citizens. After several years in which worldwide respect for America has been diminished, our great nation needs a new leader who can inspire confidence at home and abroad. Obama is that leader. As Gen. Colin Powell said last week, Obama is the president America needs now \u201cbecause of his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities. \u2026 He has both style and substance.\u201d\n\nIn their reversal today, the Billings Gazette editorial board does not stop with Iraq. The laundry list of their disappointments is wide and deep: Obama\u2019s un-American surveillance state, the Bowe Bergdahl swap, the mishandling of the VA, the \u201cboondoggle\u201d of ObamaCare, and the administration\u2019s many sins against the media.\n\nWithout even getting to the economy, the editors sum it up with, \u201c[T]aken in completely, these demonstrate a disturbing trend of incompetence and failure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newspaper Reversal: 'We Were Wrong' -- Obama Worse than Bush", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Newspaper Reversal: 'We Were Wrong' -- Obama Worse than Bush", "title": "Newspaper Reversal: 'We Were Wrong' - Obama Worse than Bush - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Barack%20and%20Michelle/halo-obama-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/06/27/newspaper-reversal-we-were-wrong-obama-worse-than-bush/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Newspaper Reversal: 'We Were Wrong' -- Obama Worse than Bush", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Barack%20and%20Michelle/halo-obama-AP.jpg", "title": "Newspaper Reversal: 'We Were Wrong' - Obama Worse than Bush - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Iraq, John McCain,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "John McCain", "published_time": "2014-06-27T09:14:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In this economic turmoil, America needs a thoughtful, cool-headed optimist who envisions a bright future for all citizens.\n\u201c[W]e were wrong,\u201d the editorial page notes,\u201dWe said things couldn\u2019t get much worse after the sub par presidency of George W.
