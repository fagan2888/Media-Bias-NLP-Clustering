Teenagers rock to a local band. Huge screens showing sports from around the country, and celebrities signing autographs.\n\nA fair or theme park? Try MetLife Stadium before an NFL game.\n\nMany hardcore NFL fans prefer watching at home or in sports bar, where they can watch multiple games on huge screens and keep track of their fantasy stats or gambling results. The league is trying to bring more people to stadiums by turning games into all-day events.\n\n\u201cWe have a tremendous TV product and it has been getting better over a long period of time, so the great news for the NFL is to be competing with ourselves,\u201d says Brian Lafemina, the league\u2019s senior vice president of club business development. \u201cTeams have been innovating and creating better game-day experience over the past several years. We\u2019ve stopped thinking about programming a football game and instead we\u2019re focusing on making it a five-to-six-hour, driveway-to-driveway experience.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly important families who want to get their money\u2019s worth out of expensive tickets.\n\n\u201cThis is a great draw to come in to the stadium early; it will motivate people to want to do more than tailgate and then go into the game,\u201d says Jets fan Duane Tomaszewski of Albertson, New York. \u201cMeeting ex-Jets, the playground for kids, it\u2019s sure better than having them dodging cars in the parking lot.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey stadium used by the Jets and Giants was built with the fans in mind. Between the parking lot and the seats, fans walk through MetLife Plaza, where they can eat, play, dance and watch big screens.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge parking area where the fans tailgate, some of them right until game time, and that\u2019s always been a big part of the experience,\u201d Jets President Neil Glat says.\n\n\u201cBut we encourage them to spend time in the plaza, particularly if they are bringing along children. We have the kids\u2019 area, ESPN broadcasts, food sampling of all kinds.\u201d\n\nThe other 30 NFL teams are trying to create similar experiences.\n\nBaltimore has the Ravens Walk, which has become so popular that some fans without tickets will come to the stadium simply to take part, then head elsewhere to watch the game. Fans can talk to cheerleaders, listen to bands or get a photo \u201cPoe\u201d the mascot. Sponsors set up booths, including Verizon so fans can recharge their devices and stay connected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really special to a lot of us who endured life without football for 13 years, and to now have this game-day experience we didn\u2019t have for those years,\u201d says Ravens season ticket holder Francis Preroff of Towson, Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s like a celebration of football, with music, vendors, activities.\u201d\n\nWhen Baltimore plays a late game, the Ravens will put earlier contests on jumbo screens.\n\n\u201cI was speaking with one of our fans on Saturday,\u201d says Brad Downs, the Ravens\u2019 vice president of marketing. \u201cHe and a group of people make the three-hour drive from Ocean City, and they arrive early and it\u2019s become a ritual to be a part of what we have.\u201d\n\nSince 2013, Jacksonville fans have enjoyed the \u201cProwl.\u201d The team walks through a wall of fans from the locker room to the field for pregame introductions.\n\nOnce fans get inside any of the NFL\u2019s 31 stadiums, they obviously want their team to win. But they want much more on the way to that victory. Even in Dallas, with an innovative stadium and one of the biggest screens in the world, fans always expect more.\n\n\u201cHow do we create an authentic, unique experience that can\u2019t be replicated at home?\u201d asks Charlotte Jones Anderson, the Cowboys\u2019 executive vice president and chief brand officer. \u201cOur big board did most of that for us, it really reinvented the way you experience a game as an engaging interactive. But our programming we start from the time you park your car. We even direct you to avoid the traffic and to the best location for your parking area with our app.\u201d\n\nOnce parked, fans have plenty of choices. A music corral with live bands, a play area and, of course, the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.\n\nThe players control the outcome of the game, but team officials want fans to enjoy the day no matter what the score.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely focused on the best experience in our stadium, but the first thing the fans want is to see a Giants win,\u201d says Giants vice president of sales and marketing Kevin Frattura. \u201cWe can\u2019t control that, but we can control what is available around the stadium, what they are doing during breaks and timeouts, and before they come through the gates.\u201d\n\nThis summer, before preseason games and even prior to a Jets evening practice, MetLife Plaza was packed well before kickoff. Perhaps the most popular spot was the Snoopy statue, where fans stopped to take photos.\n\nScott and Kathleen Riker of Hawthorne, New Jersey, and daughters Alexa and Melissa have created a tradition by using Snoopy as a measuring stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched her grow up with the team and the stadium,\u201d mom says of 9-year-old Alexa. \u201cEvery year, she takes a picture with Snoopy and we can see how much she is growing.\u201d\n\nFrattura watches such sights with a wide smile.\n\n\u201cWhatever we can provide as an enhancement that is part of the tradition of the Giants, we do,\u201d Frattura says, \u201cso that the fan, young or adult, asks, \u2018When can we come back?\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Little kids bounce around on inflatables.
