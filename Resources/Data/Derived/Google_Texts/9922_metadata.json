And a new study published in the journal Psychological and Cognitive Sciences may have figured out how to get more women involved.\n\nAccording to the study authors, most people believe women who back out of a STEM major as an undergraduate do so for \u201cindividual differences,\u201d when the switch might account more for \u201csubtle cues in achievement contexts;\u201d the biggest one being sex composition, or the proportion of men to women in a classroom. Men-dominated classrooms seem to lower women\u2019s motivation, participation, and overall career aspiration.\n\nBut the authors find studies conducted on this difference focus mostly on the fact there is a difference, not so much data-driven solutions. These studies also go to the extreme when considering the number of men and women in STEM groups, such as a group that has all women or only 25 percent (or less) women. They don\u2019t typically look at sex parity or groups with equal men and women. So the present study made a point to change that.\n\nOver 100 women majoring in engineering were recruited to participate in the study, and then randomly assigned to one of three, four-person groups: groups that had 75 percent women, 50 percent women, or 25 percent women. Students first met with their group before spending some time alone in a cubicle to look over their task and indicate how worried or eager they were to figure it out with their group. After students returned back to their group to complete the task, they returned to their cubicle and assessed personal measures, such as level of confidence and career aspirations.\n\nThe results showed sex composition had a large effect on the students. Namely, women in groups with 75 percent or 50 percent women felt less anxious than women in groups with 25 percent women. Women also participated more in groups with more or even amounts of women compared to groups with lesser women. What\u2019s more are the groups of lesser women made students feel less confident in themselves and their career aspirations.\n\nThis goes to show same-sex peer groups can enhance a student\u2019s confidence and general liking for STEM fields, which is different from expert groups (also proven to boost confidence and STEM liking).\n\n\u201c\u2026unlike experts who are successful and advanced relative to young students, peers are at the same stage of development, making their social influence psychologically different,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cFemale peers may be less effective because they have not reached high levels of success as experts. Alternatively, peers may be more effective because of their greater similar to young students.\u201d\n\nResearchers added these peer groups function as a \u201csocial vaccine,\u201d inoculating students against \u201cnoxious stereotypes.\u201d More research needs to be done to determine if these benefits persist in a larger group setting.\n\nSource: Dasgupta N, et al.
