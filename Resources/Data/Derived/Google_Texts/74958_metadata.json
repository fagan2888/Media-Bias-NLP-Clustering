The ads didn\u2019t mention that the Affordable Care Act bars insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing health problems.\n\nCallers were falsely told the policies were comprehensive insurance plans that complied with Obamacare rules, the division said. In fact, they were limited indemnity policies that would only pay up to $50 toward the cost of some medical services.\n\n\u201cWhile limited benefit plans have a place in the market, the plans are usually designed to supplement health coverage,\u201d Commissioner Nick Gerhart said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will not tolerate any insurance sales which misrepresent the benefits, advantages, conditions and limitations of the insurance plans being offered.\u201d\n\nDonald Pinansky, Marc Sporn and his son, Dylan Sporn, agreed to settle the administrative charges filed against them by the Insurance Division. The division said Pinansky and Marc Sporn had previously been convicted of federal fraud charges and sentenced to prison. Their subsequent participation in the insurance business was illegal, the division said.\n\nDylan Sporn had his state insurance license revoked, and the other two men were ordered not to transact any insurance business in Iowa.\n\nMarc Sporn\u2019s daughter, Bryana Sporn, has not settled a case filed against her, but she has been barred from transacting any insurance business in Iowa, Gerhart\u2019s office said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1FmLw5f", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Three Florida men accused of peddling phony \u201cObamacare\u201d health-insurance policies to Iowans have agreed to pay $52,500 to settle the allegations.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Three Florida men accused of peddling phony \u201cObamacare\u201d health-insurance policies to Iowans have agreed to pay $52,500 to settle the allegations.", "title": "Phony", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/09/25/phony-obamacare-policies-draw-52500-settlement/72816486/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three Florida men accused of peddling phony \u201cObamacare\u201d health-insurance policies to Iowans have agreed to pay $52,500 to settle the allegations.", "title": "Phony \"Obamacare\" policies draw $52,500 settlement", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/23215a811785c5561f9fb98363057d620a179ab3/c=0-33-398-431&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "title": "Phony \"Obamacare\" policies draw $52,500 settlement", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bc6ae1cabf492b3e0bbea71f08536bbd2413dca9/c=12-0-387-500/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46c18b1f6d42f29ccd0fb3660b7e0fb19b54ccfa/c=0-33-398-431/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec4b7c32b00287067bcbf382369c3d132fb62778/c=0-52-398-351/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68b3b9f347bbb9c8478f40dec24f687a51460cbf/c=0-96-398-321&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-25T16:13:09.460000-05:00", "shorthed": "Phony \"Obamacare\" policies draw penalty", "articleid": 72816486, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec89001a25538078a439163e35c5eabecd497dc8/c=0-96-398-321/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9ccfb16582c8a72dd1673015b43b143e49ac90a/c=59-0-339-500/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/07/B9315777577Z.1_20150107193406_000_GDD9K4SH7.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Callers were falsely told the policies were comprehensive insurance plans that complied with Obamacare rules, the division said.\nBuy Photo Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart (Photo: Register file photo)Buy PhotoThree Florida men accused of peddling phony \u201cObamacare\u201d health-insurance policies to Iowans have agreed to pay $52,500 to settle the allegations.\nDylan Sporn had his state insurance license revoked, and the other two men were ordered not to transact any insurance business in Iowa.\nThe ads promised to help people obtain health insurance, \u201ceven if you have current health issues or if you have pre-existing conditions,\u201d the division said.\nTheir subsequent participation in the insurance business was illegal, the division said."}
