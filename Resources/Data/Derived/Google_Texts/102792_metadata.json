The New York Daily News (hat tip: Legal Insurrection ) headlines:\n\nThat newspaper\u2019s Adam Edelman writes:\n\nOwe, no!\n\n2016 hopeful Scott Walker has tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, owing money to a list of banks and stores including Sears and Barclays, a new report alleges.\n\nThe Wisconsin conservative Republican governor owes between $10,000 and $100,000 to credit card companies, The Daily Beast reported Wednesday, which cited Walker\u2019s latest state financial disclosure forms, filed in January.\n\nAmong Walker\u2019s cards with debt listed, according to the forms, were a Sears MasterCard and a BarclayCard. (snip)\n\n...the revelations about Walker\u2019s less-than-stellar personal finances \u2014 which suggest he hasn\u2019t been able to adequately manage his own expenses, and possibly those of the state he runs \u2014 could make trouble for his all-but-certain presidential campaign.\n\nThe first thing to note is that Walker\u2019s debit could be as low as $10,001, given the reporting range, So \u201ctens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt\u201d could be a serious exaggeration.\n\nThe second thing to note is that Mitt Romney was demonized for being financially successful. Now, Walker is being demonized for outing purchases on a credit card. Could someone please tell me what the acceptable financial stats of a GOP presidential contender is? Maybe a net worth limit? Oh, and be sure to apply that same standard to Democrats like Hillary Clinton. For example, when she and Bill were \u201cdead broke\u201d after leaving the White House, were they guilty of the same offense as Walker is supposed to be? Is she no \u201cfiscal conservative,\u201d or does peddling influence make up for that misbehavior?\n\nThe Walker camp\u2019s response at the very bottom of Edelman\u2019s article is telling:\n\n\u201cOver the years, the governor has given $370,000 of his salary back to taxpayers,\u201d AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Walker\u2019s Our American Revival PAC said. \u201cHe has two kids in college, parents who live with him, a mortgage, car payments, and small credit card use. All in all, pretty ordinary stuff.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say \u201cpretty ordinary\u201d is the right phrase. Here is a guy meeting his family obligations, buying stuff at Sears (kitchen appliances needing replacement?) and using credit card debt to tide himself over. I\u2019d say that qualifies him as a pretty average American, and most definitely not the type of politician who enriches himself in office. The kind of guy his neighbors all admire.\n\nBetsy Woodruff of The Daily Beast (another hat tip to LI) gets it:\n\nThe Boston Globe noted that Walker has the lowest net worth of any serious presidential contender: -$72,500. That\u2019s vastly lower than the next lowest, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who clocks in at $330,507. (snip) Frugality is a part of his political identity, which places him in stark contrast to Mitt Romney. (snip) When the folksy Wisconsinite ran for governor in 2010, he started a \u201cBrown Bag Movement\u201d to highlight the importance of fiscal responsibility.\n\nEver since Barack Obama took office, the public has been treated to the spectacle of his and his wife\u2019s fondness for lavish living and celebrity friends, as stories of federal employees partying on the taxpayers\u2019 dime have come in succession. Middle America is hard-pressed, and I am certain would welcome a presidential candidate who would lead by example, and impose frugality, even austerity, on the federal government.\n\nAll that\u2019s missing is elitist sneers at Walker\u2019s patronizing Sears instead of Bloomingdales. But hey, it\u2019s early, so just you wait.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/05/hey_liberals_keep_those_attacks_on_scott_walker_coming.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Hey liberals, keep those attacks on Scott Walker coming"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b9f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe has two kids in college, parents who live with him, a mortgage, car payments, and small credit card use.\nand using credit card debt to tide himself over.\n2016 hopeful Scott Walker has tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, owing money to a list of banks and stores including Sears and Barclays, a new report alleges.\nNow, Walker is being demonized for outing purchases on a credit card.\n2016 hopeful Scott Walker has tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt despite reputation as fiscal conservative: reportYet another attack on Scott Walker is only adding to his appeal to those people Hillary Clinton calls \u201ceveryday Americans,\u201d as his critics from the left reveal their own snobbery."}
