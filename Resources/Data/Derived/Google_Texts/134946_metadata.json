Jeb Bush, who has persistently trailed Donald Trump and Ben Carson in the Republican presidential polls, is questioning the accuracy of them showing him way behind.\n\n\u201cThese polls really don't matter,\u201d Bush said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThey don't filter out the people that aren't going to vote. It's just\u2026an obsession, because it kind of frames the debate for people for that week.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHis comments aired Sunday, as a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll of Republicans who say they\u2019re likely to vote in next year\u2019s GOP caucuses and primaries showed him lagging in a distant fifth behind Trump, the real estate developer and entertainer, and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, who were tied for first \u2013and trailing (but statistically tied with) Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nBush told Fox host Chris Wallace that he\u2019s taking a long view on the race and expects his poll numbers to rebound as he runs television ads. And, he said, he\u2019s confident of his campaign\u2019s ground game in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cLook, it is a marathon, and we just started advertising. I'm confident we get good response,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe've got a great ground game in these early states. \u2026 I'm confident I can win New Hampshire for sure. I'm going to work really hard at it.\u201d\n\nBush also sought to tamp down some backlash to controversial comments he made when he suggested last week that Republicans who hope to connect with African-American voters should emphasize their message isn\u2019t about giving them \u201cfree stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make our case to\u2026to African-American voters and all voters that an aspirational message, fixing a few big complex things, will allow people to rise up,\u201d Bush said, blaming \u201cthe left\u201d for taking his remarks out of context. \u201cThat's what people want. They don't want free stuff. That was my whole point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe spend a trillion dollars a year on poverty programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the net result is the percentage of people in poverty has remained the same.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;They don't filter out the people that aren't going to vote.&quot;", "title": "Jeb Bush: Early polls 'really don't matter'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/jeb-bush-polls-trump-carson-214112", "image": "http://static.politico.com/19/66/c945e79e461cb02f9735a6f9264f/150923-jeb-bush-1160-gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;They don't filter out the people that aren't going to vote.&quot;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Getty Jeb Bush: Early polls 'really don't matter'Former Florida Gov.\n\u201cThese polls really don't matter,\u201d Bush said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThey don't filter out the people that aren't going to vote.\nJeb Bush, who has persistently trailed Donald Trump and Ben Carson in the Republican presidential polls, is questioning the accuracy of them showing him way behind.\n\u2026 I'm confident I can win New Hampshire for sure.\nI'm confident we get good response,\u201d Bush said."}
