The obesity crisis is over. A world of thinness, health, and vibrant living awaits \u2014 all thanks to your federal government. The Food and Drug Administration has just issued new rules requiring pretty much all of the restaurants we frequent \u2014 which is to say, chains \u2014 prominently post the calorie count of the dishes and drinks they serve.\n\nHere\u2019s a safe bet. Ten years from now, we\u2019ll all be just as fat as ever. Or if not, the FDA\u2019s new calorie-counting regulations will have nothing to do with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what you\u2019re saying: \u201cBut Tom, I had no idea that a Friendly\u2019s Forbidden Fudge Brownie Sundae has 970 calories! Until the FDA came along, I thought it was dietetic.\u201d\n\nExactly. You knew the calorie count was up there. And you ordered it anyway. You just didn\u2019t care, or perhaps you figured that you\u2019d work it off with those supposedly daily trips to the gym that somehow occur at best once a week.\n\nAnd if you did care, you didn\u2019t need the feds to tell you. Many chains happily provide nutritional information and even if they don\u2019t, a simple Internet search will give you the answers. The biggest impediment to eating right, quite frankly, isn\u2019t that we\u2019re ignorant about the facts.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, though, that sometimes calorie counts can surprise. New York City was one of the first jurisdictions to require restaurants display calories on their menu. I remember tucking into a steak and salad at a Manhattan Morton\u2019s (and no, I wasn\u2019t paying). A half-pound porterhouse? About 640 calories. But my iceberg lettuce salad? 770.\n\nThat\u2019s when I gave up vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FDA\u2019s rules \u2014 required by Obamacare, by the way \u2014 come after a protracted process that saw more than a thousand comments and numerous revisions. Chains are covered, as well as movie theaters, vending machines, and grocery stores. Calories have to be posted. Other nutritional information needs to be available on request.\n\nThose in favor of the new rules argue that with the information in front of them, consumers will make better decisions. I may walk into McD\u2019s planning on a Bacon Clubhouse Burger, but when I see it has 720 calories, I\u2019ll recoil, picking instead, say, a 480-calorie Grilled McWrap Chicken and Bacon.\n\nNice theory. But it doesn\u2019t appear to happen.\n\nIn 2009, a year after New York began requiring labeling, researchers examined buying habits at restaurants in mostly low-income neighborhoods. More than a quarter of those surveyed said the food labeling law \u201cinfluenced their choices.\u201d Hurrah! But then they looked at what people actually bought, and nothing had changed. In other words, folks were lying! As the report drily observed, \u201cCalorie information on menus appears to increase awareness of calorie content, but not necessarily the number of calories people purchase.\u201d A second study came to the same conclusion \u2014 \u201cno overall decline in calories purchased\u201d \u2014 but, oddly, did find cuts at some chains (such as KFC) while at others (Subway) calorie consumption actually increased.\n\nNew York\u2019s no outlier, either. After Seattle started to require nutrition labeling, researchers from Duke University examined purchases from a chain called Taco Time, concluding the \u201caverage calories per transaction were unaffected by the menu labeling.\u201d On the other hand, a study for the National Bureau of Economic Research did find that Starbucks customers, at least, appeared to cut their calories \u2014 but by only 6 percent.\n\nWhy, you wonder, don\u2019t people do what\u2019s good for them? It\u2019s the old clich\u00e9: \u201cYou can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make it drink.\u201d Couple that with two other factors. First, after a while we become inured to information. Sulfites in wine? Tobacco causes cancer? Now we just ignore those warnings. Then too, one wonders whether calorie counting is a little bit last decade. Isn\u2019t it carbs that really matter? No big deal. It\u2019s not like we\u2019d pay attention to those labels either.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 11/25: Prepared-food sellers must soon post calorie counts\n\n\u2022 7 changes to expect with the new calorie label law\n\n\u2022 Editorial: Is that soda worth a 5-mile walk?", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.498884210", "eomportal-id": 488305, "description": "Good news!
