If the doctors are forced to work in especially unsafe conditions\u2013 such as those sent to Sierra Leone to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began last year\u2013 they may not be allowed to return to their families.\n\nThe situation has created a mass exodus of doctors from Cuba, all fleeing illegally, as Cubans are not allowed to move out of the country without special permission from the communist government. Supporters of the Castro regime have condemned doctors who do so. Last year, the New York Times derisively wrote about how Cuban doctors are not \u201cthe world\u2019s neediest refugees and persecuted people\u201d and the United States should reject them when attempting to defect.\n\nLargely in response to the extensive list of misconceptions common about Cuban doctors around the world, Juan Afonso, a Cuban-born doctor who defected to Chile, tells the Panamerican Post that he would like to tell his story, living on $18 a month in the early 1990s and being awoken at midnight by hunger pangs. He says the decision to leave by any means necessary is a simple one to make: \u201cIf you are starving in your own country, and they [the regime] are having a laugh at your expense \u2014 with low wages, no chance for a raise, and unpaid shifts \u2014 what are you going to do?\u201d\n\nCondemning the \u201cleeches and bureaucrats\u201d who live off of the money generated by medical work abroad, Afonso explains that \u201cthe government has been making fun of us for a long time now\u201d and that he found himself needing to leave Cuba because \u201cI wasn\u2019t born to be a slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left because I could barely afford to buy a single egg to eat a day,\u201d he says, adding that, as a doctor, he found himself routinely lacking necessary medical supplies. The lack of basic medical tools in Cuba has led many doctors to find themselves unable to work in well-stocked hospitals when sent to travel the world. The nation of Tuvalu, for example, expelled its Cuban doctors from the country for \u201cincompetence\u201d following a number of malpractice incidents.\n\n\u201cMany of us would wake up around midnight from hunger pains, and no one ever gave us anything; maybe a slice of bread, at the most,\u201d Afonso adds.\n\nHe attributes his decision to defect partially to beginning to listen to Radio Mart\u00ed, a publicly-funded American news network that broadcasts news of interest to Cubans and the exile community out of Miami. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed are often the only non-state-controlled media outlets that Cuban nationals can access, and a main source of unbiased information from the United States.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine, who happens to be a prosecutor, told me I should stop [criticizing the regime], because they would put me in jail,\u201d Afonso recalls. Instead of silencing himself, he found a way to leave.\n\nThe Castro regime has made clear it fears the influence of Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. On multiple occasions following President Obama\u2019s decision to issue a number of diplomatic concessions to the Castro regime in December 2014, Ra\u00fal Castro has called for President Obama to censor the Mart\u00ed broadcasts, which would require him to violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCuban doctors no longer make what they did when Afonso worked there\u2013 the Castro regime recently gave them a pay raise to $64 a month\u2014 and it may soon be possible that, thanks to President Obama, they will be less welcome in the United States. The 2006 Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program allows doctors to legally reside in the United States following their defection elsewhere and expedites the exile process. It has long irked media supporters of the regime, like the New York Times, whose editorial board has called the program unfair to the Castro regime. A report this week in Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds indicates that the White House is considering a way to eliminate the program entirely on the request of the Castro regime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Cuban doctor living in Chile tells the Panamerican Post doctors could not afford to buy \"an egg a day\" to feed themselves.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A Cuban doctor living in Chile tells the Panamerican Post doctors could not afford to buy \"an egg a day\" to feed themselves.", "title": "Exiled Dr: 'I Could Not Afford an Egg a Day' in Cuba", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Cuban-Doctors-Defected-Reuteres.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-20T14:14:47-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/10/20/exiled-doctor-i-could-not-afford-an-egg-a-day-in-cuba/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Cuban doctor living in Chile tells the Panamerican Post doctors could not afford to buy \"an egg a day\" to feed themselves.", "creator": "@francesmartel", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Cuban-Doctors-Defected-Reuteres.jpg", "title": "Exiled Dr: 'I Could Not Afford an Egg a Day' in Cuba", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Cuba, doctors, raul castro,Medicine, National Security,Cuba", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-20T10:40:28-07:00", "section": "Medicine", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T14:14:47-07:00", "tag": "raul castro", "categories": "National Security,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb513\"", "article_summary": "The nation of Tuvalu, for example, expelled its Cuban doctors from the country for \u201cincompetence\u201d following a number of malpractice incidents.\nIt has long irked media supporters of the regime, like the New York Times, whose editorial board has called the program unfair to the Castro regime.\nThe 2006 Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program allows doctors to legally reside in the United States following their defection elsewhere and expedites the exile process.\nA report this week in Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds indicates that the White House is considering a way to eliminate the program entirely on the request of the Castro regime.\nSupporters of the Castro regime have condemned doctors who do so."}
