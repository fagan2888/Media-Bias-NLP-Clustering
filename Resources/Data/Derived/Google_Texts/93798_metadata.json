When Gryphon sold the company in 2005, it had more than 250 locations and $350 million in revenues, and when Bilt and Schmidt left (they stayed on after Gryphon's sale), Smile Brands had more than 400 locations and $500 million in revenues.\n\nGryphon, headquartered in San Francisco, focuses on investing in middle market companies in connection with experienced management teams. The firm has about $1.4 billion in equity commitments, and generally invests $35 million to $100 million per portfolio company. In October, the firm picked up C.B. Fleet Co., the owner of over-the-counter health care products, including the Summer's Eve brand.\n\nDentist groups and related services have been attracting dealmaker attention because the industry is fragmented.

In March, Cressey & Co. LP invested in Dental Services Group.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/healthcare/gryphon-investors-partners-with-dental-execs-to-form-onesmile-256538-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/dentist.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Gryphon Investors Partners with Dental Execs to Form OneSmile"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d6e\"", "article_summary": "Gryphon Investors Partners with Dental Execs to Form OneSmileThe PE firm previously partnered with Steven Bilt and Bradley Schmidt to build Smile Brands, which was sold in 2005Private equity firm Gryphon Investors is joining forces with dental industry veterans Steven Bilt and Bradley Schmidt to form OneSmile LLC, a dental services organization.\nIn March, Cressey & Co.
