Employers aren’t the only ones with skepticism about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. The public is less interested in buying health coverage through the public exchanges during the law’s second enrollment period, with likelihood of consumers buying PPACA plans dropping 19 percentage points from last year, according to a new poll by the Morning Consult.

The new data follows findings out last week from consulting firm Towers Watson that found virtually all of the 349 HR professionals at mid- and-large-sized companies surveyed — 99.5 percent — said there was no way they were going to move all their employees over to a public exchange.
