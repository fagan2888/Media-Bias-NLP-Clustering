The White House, though, has said Obama will not negotiate over the nation's borrowing limit, insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt-limit hike.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, also said he was not ready to give up on a fight that could force a government shutdown next week.\n\nThe House passed a continuing resolution that funds government until mid-December but strips money from Obamacare. That measure is dead on arrival in the Democratically-controlled Senate, and Obama has vowed to veto any bill that cuts funding for his health care reforms. The Senate is likely to pass a continuing resolution without cuts to Obamacare.\n\nAsked if the Senate bill would receive a House vote, Boehner said, \u201cI do not see that happening.\u201d\n\nBoehner said Republicans intended to force Obama to the budget table.\n\n\u201cThe president says 'I'm not going to negotiate.' Well, I'm sorry, but it doesn't work that way,\u201d the speaker said.\n\nAt an event in Maryland to tout healthcare reform earlier Thursday, President Obama accused Republicans of trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d him.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "09-26-13", "dc.format": "text/html", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "09-26-13", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2013/09/26/jay-carney-calls-gop%E2%80%99s-defunding-effort-%E2%80%9Cextortion-game%E2%80%9D", "type": "article", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/jay%20carney%20ap.jpg", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "title": "Jay Carney Calls GOP\u2019s Defunding Effort an 'Extortion Game'"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/jay%20carney%20ap.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Jay Carney Calls GOP\\u2019s Defunding Effort an 'Extortion Game'\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2013\\/09\\/26\\/jay-carney-calls-gop%E2%80%99s-defunding-effort-%E2%80%9Cextortion-game%E2%80%9D\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/jay%20carney%20ap.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-26T19:24:18-04:00\",\"identifier\":\"57313\"}", "prism.section": "nation", "dc.date": "2016-05-25", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Jay Carney Calls GOP\\u2019s Defunding Effort an 'Extortion Game'\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2013\\/09\\/26\\/jay-carney-calls-gop%E2%80%99s-defunding-effort-%E2%80%9Cextortion-game%E2%80%9D\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/jay%20carney%20ap.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-26T19:24:18-04:00\",\"post_id\":\"57313\"}", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "dc.language": "en-US", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "Jay Carney Calls GOP\u2019s Defunding Effort an 'Extortion Game'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7322\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe cannot agree to an extortion game when they attach everything on their Republican wish list or they will blow up the economy,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.\nHouse Republican leaders earlier Thursday said they would insist on a number of conditions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling in October.\nThe White House, though, has said Obama will not negotiate over the nation's borrowing limit, insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt-limit hike.\nAt an event in Maryland to tout healthcare reform earlier Thursday, President Obama accused Republicans of trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d him.\nAsked if the Senate bill would receive a House vote, Boehner said, \u201cI do not see that happening.\u201dBoehner said Republicans intended to force Obama to the budget table."}
