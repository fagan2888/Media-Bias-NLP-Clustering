[Stockopedia FTSE All-Share Value Screen]\n\nWe have included today\u2019s income yield on each stock, although it is worth noting that investors are buying these stocks because the price is good value, not for the income which could fall.\n\nQuite often these are bombed out stocks. Tesco is the highest profile example, buffeted by a price battle with bigger rivals and discounters.\n\nArgos-owner Home Retail also makes the list with concerns about its business model and shares in TUI Travel, owner of First Choice and Thomson, are also unloved.\n\nOne strong theme is the proliferation of insurance companies \u2013 Amlin and Catlin \u2013 and life insurers \u2013 Phoenix, Legal & General and Friends Life.\n\nThe life sector, has been battered by bad news, in particular Treasury plans to improve access to pensions.\n\nThis raises a crucial point. Namely that the \u201cvalue\u201d test does not detect changes going on in the real world. So while a company could be making decent profits today, a change in its fortunes could be around the corner, and may be the reason other investors are steering clear.\n\nIt should also be noted that value stocks can have spells of underperformance, as also happens with income and growth stocks. This year, for instance, Stockopedia's value index has underperformed the FTSE All-Share.\n\nEd Page Croft, chief executive of Stockopedia.com, said: \u201cWarren Buffett said 'Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.\u2019\n\n\u201cValue investors have to learn to go against the crowd and venture into contrarian and often unpopular sectors in order to generate outperformance. But they do have to beware of 'value traps\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Stockopedia FTSE All-Share Value Screen\n\n\u2022 A list of the cheapest \u201cvalue\u201d Aim stocks\n\n\u2022 Investment tips every week by email \u2013 sign up here", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "personalfinance", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03014/Value_index_3014630a.PNG"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@andrew_oxlade"}, "keywords": "Share tips, Warren Buffett, value shares, cheapest shares, stock tips, FTSE 100, FTSE All-Share, Shares,Investing,Personal Finance,Finance", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Home;Finance;Markets;Insurance;Oil_and_Gas;Personal_Finance;Investing;Shares;FTSE_100;Shares_and_Stock_Tips;Andrew_Oxlade;Experienced_Investors;Finance_Headlines", "DCSext.Channel": "finance", "DCSext.MLC": "/finance/personalfinance/investing/shares", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "description": "The wisdom of Ben Graham and Warren Buffett suggests these are the cheapest \n  stocks on the FTSE All-Share", "WT.cg_n": "finance", "title": "The 10 cheapest 'value' shares to buy today", "section-id": 3226, "GSAGenre": "investing", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "finance-personalfinance-investing-shares", "GSAMLC": "finance/personalfinance/investing/shares", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 11049523, "WT.cg_s": "personalfinance", "news_keywords": "Share tips, Warren Buffett, value shares, cheapest shares, stock tips, FTSE 100, FTSE All-Share", "tmgads.channel": "finance", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "personalfinance", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-23", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "finance-personal_finance-investing-shares", "last-modified": "2014-08-23", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "Finance", "wordcount": 478, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Andrew Oxlade", "tag": "Finance Headlines", "subsection": "Shares", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 10, "imagecount": 3, "externallinkcount": 3}, "DCSext.articleId": 11049523, "tmgads.articleid": 11049523, "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"The 10 cheapest \\u0027value\\u0027 shares to buy today \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/shares/11049523/Share-tips-The-10-cheapest-value-stocks-on-the-FTSE-All-Share.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03014/Value_index_3014630a.PNG\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11049523\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-23T07:03:03Z\",\"section\": \"Personal Finance\",\"authors\": [\"Andrew Oxlade\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"Home\",\"Finance\",\"Markets\",\"Insurance\",\"Oil and Gas\",\"Personal Finance\",\"Investing\",\"Shares\",\"FTSE 100\",\"Shares and Stock Tips\",\"Andrew Oxlade\",\"Experienced Investors\",\"Finance Headlines\"]}", "GSAChannel": "finance", "GSAChannelName": "Finance", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "The wisdom of Ben Graham and Warren Buffett suggests these are the cheapest   stocks on the FTSE All-Share", "title": "The 10 cheapest 'value' shares to buy today", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/shares/11049523/Share-tips-The-10-cheapest-value-stocks-on-the-FTSE-All-Share.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03014/Value_index_3014630a.PNG", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "investing", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "finance.personalfinance.investing.shares", "DCSext.author": "Andrew Oxlade", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-08-22 14:52"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee5b\"", "article_summary": "But they do have to beware of 'value traps\u2019.\u201d\u2022 Stockopedia FTSE All-Share Value Screen\u2022 A list of the cheapest \u201cvalue\u201d Aim stocks\u2022 Investment tips every week by email \u2013 sign up here\nUsing these scores, Stockopedia ranks stocks and concludes the 10 (below) to be the cheapest on the FTSE All-Share today.\nIt should also be noted that value stocks can have spells of underperformance, as also happens with income and growth stocks.\nThis year, for instance, Stockopedia's value index has underperformed the FTSE All-Share.\nWhile the FTSE 100 has turned \u00a31,000 into \u00a31,258 since the start of 2012, \u201cvalue\u201d stocks would have grown your money to \u00a31,717, as the chart, above, shows."}
