This past week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act. In Zubik v. Burwell, a group of religious nonprofits is challenging the government’s accommodation for employers who don’t want to have anything to do with providing birth control to their workers. Dahlia speaks with former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, who argued the case for the plaintiffs, and to former acting U.S. Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, who supports the government’s position.

This week’s excerpts from the Supreme Court’s public sessions were provided by Oyez, a free law project at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, part of the Illinois Institute of Technology.
