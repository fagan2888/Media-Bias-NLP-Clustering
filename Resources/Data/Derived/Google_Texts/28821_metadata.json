But I\u2019m beyond grown up \u2014 I\u2019m growing old. So it\u2019s time to think a bit before I buy.\n\nI have to give Post credit for trying to cram most of my daily health needs into my morning meal. Great Grains has 7 grams of fiber to keep me full until lunch, active cultures to help with digestion, whole grains and lots of vitamins. And the taste, miraculously, isn\u2019t bad. It isn\u2019t magically delicious, but it isn\u2019t cardboard, either. The Berry Blend is better than the Vanilla Graham, but both are flavorful enough.\n\nMy one complaint is that some of the flakes are so small, they remind me of what\u2019s usually in the bottom of the box when you throw it away. Those tend to get soggy \u2014 and who wants soggy cold cereal?\n\nOther than that, though, this is a good choice for a grown-up breakfast. What is magical about Great Grains is that even on the first day, all that fiber and good bacteria didn\u2019t cause any stomach drama.\n\nKim Franke-Folstad", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 22 Mar 2014 01:01:00 -0400", "Description": "Vanilla Graham and Berry Blend", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Vanilla Graham and Berry Blend", "title": "We Tried It: Great Grains Digestive Blend Cereal", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/we-tried-it-great-grains-digestive-blend-cereal-20140322/", "image": {"width": 284, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140322/ARTICLE/140329783/AR/0/AR-140329783.jpg", "height": 384}, "updated_time": "2014-03-21T18:15:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Vanilla Graham and Berry Blend", "title": "We Tried It: Great Grains Digestive Blend Cereal", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140322/ARTICLE/140329783/AR/0/AR-140329783.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-22T01:01:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T18:15:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7e6\"", "article_summary": "Great Grains has 7 grams of fiber to keep me full until lunch, active cultures to help with digestion, whole grains and lots of vitamins.\nWhat is magical about Great Grains is that even on the first day, all that fiber and good bacteria didn\u2019t cause any stomach drama.\nBut the experts keep reminding us that it\u2019s important to think beyond convenience for the most important meal of the day.\nVanilla Graham and Berry BlendAvailable at Wal-Mart and other stores that sell groceries; price for a 12.5-ounce box varies by storeThe pitch: \u201cGreat Grains Digestive Blend cereal blends whole grain, fiber and active cultures \u2014 three key ingredients to help support a healthy digestive system.\nThe skinny: Cold cereal is so easy \u2014 quick to fix, eat and clean up \u2014 it\u2019s no wonder most Americans eat it for breakfast."}
