They also affect the federal budget, because the federal government subsidizes most premiums\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014at a cost of roughly $300 billion in fiscal year 2016,\u201d the CBO said.\n\nThe nonpartisan agency and the staff of Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation projected that in 2016, \u201cthe average premium for an employment-based insurance plan will be about $6,400 for single coverage and about $15,500 for family coverage.\u201d\n\nBy 2025, they predict, average premiums for employment-based coverage will cost about 60 percent more than this year under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nAverage premiums for individually purchased coverage aren\u2019t expected to be as high, \u201cmostly because nongroup coverage is less extensive and thus requires enrollees to make higher out-of-pocket payments when they receive care,\u201d according to the Feb. 11 report.\n\nThe CBO, a nonpartisan agency, produces \u201cindependent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the congressional budget process.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the exemptions, the [individual] mandate significantly reduces average premiums \u2026 by encouraging healthier people to obtain insurance, which lowers average spending on health care among the insured population,\u201d the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation found.\n\nHowever, the report says Obamacare regulations still will \u201cincrease premiums noticeably in the nongroup market,\u201d and those affected represent only a small fraction of the private insurance market.\n\nA 2009 analysis by the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation found that regulations similar to those of the Affordable Care Act would increase nongroup premium costs by 27 percent to 30 percent this year, \u201calthough other provisions would have reduced premiums.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was their stance in 2009 and little has changed, as we observe increased premiums in the [insurance] exchanges and rising deductibles in many types of insurance,\u201d Drew Gonshorowski, a senior health policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThe CBO again reaffirms that regulations within the [Affordable Care Act] drive up premiums,\u201d Gonshorowski said.\n\nThe report also notes that the increase in premiums will cause employment-based insurance tax exemptions to cost more than $250 billion in fiscal year 2016 and about $40 billion for those who buy on Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges.\n\nGonshorowski and Ed Haislmaier, Heritage\u2019s senior research fellow in health policy, noted in a study that premiums jumped by 9 percent on average because of the health care law\u2019s benefit mandates\u2014which cover \u201cessential health benefits\u201d and \u201cpreventive services.\u201d\n\nIf Congress eliminated the benefit mandates and requirements, the researchers estimated, \u201cpremiums for younger adults could be reduced by as much as 44 percent, and premiums for preretirement-age adults could decrease by about 7 percent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By 2025, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, average
