Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing related to the videos.\n\nThose videos, produced by the Center for Medical Progress, sparked calls to defund the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider of the $528 million it receives in federal funding.\n\nRuiter pointed out that among those still on Arizona\u2019s list of eligible non-profits is Alliance Defending Freedom, which is a pro-life Christian legal fund that has actively called to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nRuiter told Phoenix New Times that Planned Parenthood Arizona \u201ctypically receives between $7,000 and $8,000 annually\u201d from state employee donations.\n\nJodi Liggett, another Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, told the Associated Press that some of that money goes to fund abortions.\n\n\u201cSo the individual donations coming through the [State Employee Charitable Campaign] do in part pay for abortions,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, many of our donors specifically want to fund this service knowing that women in dire circumstances may not have the financial means to pay for a needed abortion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona will no longer allow the nation's largest abortion provider to receive donations from state employees on the government\u2019s dime.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Arizona will no longer allow the nation's largest abortion provider to receive donations from state employees on the government\u2019s dime.", "title": "Arizona Blocks State Employee Planned Parenthood Donations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Arizona_PP_1511105.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-04T19:38:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NskFGM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Arizona will no longer allow the nation's largest abortion provider to receive donations from state employees on the government\u2019s dime.", "title": "Arizona Blocks State Employee Planned Parenthood Donations", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Arizona_PP_1511105.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-11-04T14:52:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T19:38:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "planned parenthood, abortion, planned parenthood abortion, abortion, fetal tissue donation, cecile richards letter, arizona"}, "article_summary": "Arizona\u2019s State Employee Charitable Campaign features more than 400 organizations that are eligible for state employee donations.\nRuiter told Phoenix New Times that Planned Parenthood Arizona \u201ctypically receives between $7,000 and $8,000 annually\u201d from state employee donations.\nRepublican Governor Doug Ducey, who serves as the chairman of the State Employee Charitable Campaign, \u201cabsolutely supports\u201d the move to remove Planned Parenthood from the program, called the State Employee Charitable Campaign, which allows state employees to make donations through payroll deduction or a one-time payment.\n\u201cSo the individual donations coming through the [State Employee Charitable Campaign] do in part pay for abortions,\u201d she said.\nArizona has cut the umbilical cord off Planned Parenthood, no longer allowing the organization to receive donations from state employees on the government\u2019s dime."}
