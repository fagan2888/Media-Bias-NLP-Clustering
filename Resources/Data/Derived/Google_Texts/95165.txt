According to ex-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), avoiding another government shutdown makes Republican lawmakers comparable to domestic abusers, The Hill reported.

“We can’t hide the black eyes any more. The whole neighborhood knows,” Palin wrote in an op-ed for Breitbart.com published on Saturday. “The Democrats are gloating. Obama thanked Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) effusively — and why shouldn’t he? Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) couldn’t have given him more.”

The former vice-presidential candidate was upset that Ryan and his fellow House Republicans backed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will keep the government operational through September 2016 without blocking federal funding for either Planned Parenthood or the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. To Palin, that constituted another broken promise from non-Tea Party GOP legislators.

“They did it again. But like a battered wife, we keep going back because every four years they bring us flowers, beg our forgiveness, and swear they’ll never hit us again,” she stated.

Palin also criticized the House Freedom Caucus, the group of conservative lawmakers who vocally opposed former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), saying that they gave Ryan a pass.

“If we’re lucky, maybe they’ll call 911 for us when the beating starts up again,” she wrote.

However, she added, her supporters should not abandon the GOP.

“It’s time to kick our abusers out of the House, change the locks, and keep a loaded shotgun next to the bed,” she wrote.
