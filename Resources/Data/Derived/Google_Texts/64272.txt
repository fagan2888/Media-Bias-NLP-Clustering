Kansas Rep. Lynn Jenkins filed paperwork Thursday to seek a fifth term in the U.S. House.

A statement from Jenkins's campaign mentioned several key issues. They include putting "spending on the right fiscal track," repealing mandates in the Affordable Care Act, tax reform and improving national security.

Jenkins is the fifth highest-ranking Republican in the House, as Conference Vice Chair.

The Secretary of State's office indicates Jenkins is currently unopposed in the Republican primary. Two Democrats have filed for the District 2 seat: Britani Potter of Ottawa and Mike Pryor of Lawrence.
