Ted Cruz\u2019s ambitions are clear. He\u2019s a frequent visitor to Iowa and New Hampshire. He\u2019s building a campaign staff.\n\nBut to make a serious White House bid takes serious money \u2014 at least $20 million by the time the first ballots are cast in early 2016. And that could be a challenge.\n\nAlthough the Texas Republican is popular at conservative gatherings, Cruz has shown only modest success as a fundraiser. Like Ron Paul and Sarah Palin, he can probably count on showers of cash from enthusiastic legions of small-dollar donors, and that\u2019s an important start.\n\nBut many major GOP donors and bundlers want nothing to do with a tea party agitator \u2014 particularly business interests dismayed by the federal-spending brinkmanship Cruz has advocated. That could limit his ability to elbow aside well-funded rivals.\n\n\u201cThere are very few people I\u2019ve seen inspire the grass roots like Ted Cruz,\u201d said Eytan Laor, a Miami Republican who runs a political action committee that backed about 100 conservative federal candidates this year. But \u201che has a rap on him from people who don\u2019t know him \u2014 the government shutdown, not electable, etc. It\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nMuch of the party\u2019s donor class is rooting for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush or, at the least, waiting to see whether he makes a move.\n\n\u201cThe big elephant in the room is Jeb Bush,\u201d said Ray Washburne, a Dallas developer and national finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, who is neutral in the race. \u201cDonors are all waiting to see what Jeb\u2019s move is.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the first mover to Ted Cruz or Rand Paul if Jeb ends up running. Everyone wants to get behind whoever they think is going to win.\u201d\n\nWashburne figures it will take at least $10 million to be viewed as \u201ca legitimate candidate\u201d by the time of the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary in early 2016. And $20million would be better. The contest could be over by mid-April, and the nominee likely will be someone who raked in at least $50 million by then, though fundraising tends to snowball for the winner of early contests.\n\nCruz raised about $15 million in his insurgent Senate run in 2012. That was enough to shove aside Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, with the help of a wave of tea-party support in the GOP primary. Federal campaign records show that in the last two years, he\u2019s raised $7.3 million for his Senate fund; his Jobs Growth and Freedom Fund political action committee; and a \u201cvictory\u201d fund that has made transfers to those other entities.\n\nIndividual donors, as opposed to political committees, account for two-thirds of the revenue.\n\nAs an indication of his drawing power, after his overnight Senate talkathon against the Affordable Care Act last year, Cruz raked in more than $200,000 in a single week. And other help is available: Last month, Cruz\u2019s roommate and debate partner from Princeton, David Panton, created a super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited sums to support a candidate. The group is called Stand for Principle.\n\n\u201cI would like him to run for president,\u201d Panton said. \u201cWe need strong, moral principles and conservative leadership in America that I think Ted offers.\u201d\n\nSuper PACs cannot directly coordinate with a candidate or his campaign. But they can aim at the same goals.\n\n\u201cHe is someone I have known a long time, and someone I trust implicitly,\u201d Cruz said of Panton, an Atlanta investor.\n\nMaria Zack, an Atlanta-based GOP operative who served as a top aide in Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 campaign, chairs the super PAC. Her goal is to raise $50 million by March 2016. The finance committee held its first conference call a week before Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cWe are building a team,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think money will be an issue at all. \u2026 He is brilliant and he inspires people and our phones will ring off the hook.\u201d\n\nThere are other routes to financial success in presidential campaigns, besides direct fundraising. Having a megadonor as a patron is a nice shortcut.\n\nIn 2012, Wyoming investor Foster Friess pumped more than $2 million into former Sen. Rick Santorum\u2019s effort. Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate, gave $20million to a super PAC that backed Gingrich, a former House speaker. Although no donor can give more than a few thousand dollars directly to a campaign, the advent of super PACs means there\u2019s no limit on what an individual can spend on behalf of a candidate or cause.\n\nAdelson has met with Jeb Bush and others. Cruz sat beside Adelson at a pro-Israel dinner last month in New York, and they met privately for two hours the next day. So far, the \u201cAdelson primary\u201d has yielded no endorsement.\n\nAfter the Adelson meeting, Cruz shared lunch with a small group of other Jewish leaders.\n\nAccording to the New York Observer, he lamented that donors will rally to \u201cmoderate establishment\u201d candidates such as Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and perhaps Mitt Romney who, in his view, would lose. \u201cA lot of donors will rush to write them checks. And yet if the nominee comes from that bucket, the same voters who stayed home in 2008 and 2012 will stay home again,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz ally Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action for America, which supports conservative candidates, said the senator is one of many candidates who will be able to raise the resources needed.\n\n\u201cI know tons of people who would write checks to Ted Cruz, and that goes from the person who can give a one-dollar bill to people who can write much larger checks,\u201d he said. \u201cTed has inspired millions of people and will have the support to do whatever he wants to do next.\u201d\n\nConservative leader Gary Bauer, who sought the GOP nomination in 2000, dismissed the idea that Cruz would be too polarizing. He noted the defeats of Romney and Sen. John McCain in the last two presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThey were good men but did not excite the base,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way you can win is if you\u2019re an outspoken conservative.\u201d\n\nLaor, the Florida Republican, met Cruz a few years ago and quickly became a fan. He predicted that the Texan will win over skeptics as he barnstorms the country but said that doesn\u2019t alter his huge disadvantage when it comes to fundraising.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush definitely has a great political machine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got an army of donors and other political operatives that he\u2019s worked with over the years.\u201d\n\nFollow Todd J.
