On June 30 \u2013 the final day of the term \u2013 the high court released its decision in the Hobby Lobby case, ruling that some for-profit corporations have religious rights and can opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nThe U.S. public is evenly split in its view of the decision, according to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Roughly half of Americans (49%) say they disapprove of the ruling, while a similar share (47%) approve. Neither side seems to feel more strongly than the other: Most people say they feel either \u201cdisappointed but not angry\u201d (35%) or \u201csatisfied but not enthusiastic\u201d (35%), and fewer feel \u201cangry\u201d (12%) or \u201centhusiastic\u201d (11%) about the ruling.\n\nWomen are slightly more likely than men to disapprove of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (53% vs. 46%), but there are significantly bigger gaps between political parties and religious groups. Many more Democrats disapprove of the decision (70%) than Republicans (27%), and a far greater share of people with no religious affiliation disapprove of the Hobby Lobby ruling (67%) than do white evangelical Protestants (29%). Catholics, with 49% disapproving, and white mainline Protestants, 43% of whom disapprove, fall in between.\n\nKaiser found a high degree of public interest in the case. Roughly six-in-ten Americans report following news of the decision either very closely (29%) or fairly closely (30%). That\u2019s significantly more attention than was given to other recent Supreme Court rulings, including a decision striking down buffer zones around abortion clinics.\n\nThe survey also asked respondents about the impact of the ruling \u2013 including whether it will lead employers to attempt to deny coverage for other health care services on religious grounds. A majority of Americans \u2013 58% \u2013 say it is either very likely (32%) or somewhat likely (26%) that this will happen.\n\nTopics: Religion and Government, Religion and U.S. Politics, Religious Beliefs and Practices, Supreme Court", "article_metadata": {"description": "Public views are split on the Supreme Court decision that some for-profit corporations can opt out of the health care law\u2019s contraception mandate on religious g", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/01/kaiser-americans-views-of-hobby-lobby-ruling-are-evenly-divided/", "site_name": "Pew Research Center", "type": "article", "description": "Public views are split on the Supreme Court decision that some for-profit corporations can opt out of the health care law\u2019s contraception mandate on religious grounds.", "title": "Kaiser: Americans\u2019 views of Hobby Lobby ruling are evenly divided"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/01/kaiser-americans-views-of-hobby-lobby-ruling-are-evenly-divided/", "site": "@pewresearch", "description": "Public views are split on the Supreme Court decision that some for-profit corporations can opt out of the health care law\u2019s contraception mandate on religious grounds.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kaiser: Americans\u2019 views of Hobby Lobby ruling are evenly divided"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"Religion\"}", "theme-color": "#231f20", "projects": "Religion", "date": 20140801, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2014-08-01T11:11:41+00:00"}, "topics": "Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. Supreme Court often issues some of its most controversial decisions at the very end of its term, and this year was no different.\nRoughly half of Americans (49%) say they disapprove of the ruling, while a similar share (47%) approve.\nA majority of Americans \u2013 58% \u2013 say it is either very likely (32%) or somewhat likely (26%) that this will happen.\nThat\u2019s significantly more attention than was given to other recent Supreme Court rulings, including a decision striking down buffer zones around abortion clinics.\nThe U.S. public is evenly split in its view of the decision, according to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation."}
