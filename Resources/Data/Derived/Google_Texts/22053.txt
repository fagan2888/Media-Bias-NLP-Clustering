Nearly 690 animals were adopted from the Humane Society of Eastern Carolina in 2015, but this year officials hope to exceed that number.

Volunteer coordinator, Gina Dunn, says they currently have countless cats and nearly 20 dogs available for adoption.

Dunn is hopeful that in 2016 the Humane Society will provide 700 animals with their forever homes.

The Humane Society received enough donations in 2015 to update their facility, which Dunn says has improved operations and allowed them to care for more animals.

Dunn says, "Always come out and adopt, always come look. You never know when you're going to find your next best friend."

HSEC is open for adoptions from 1-5 p.m. Friday through Sunday.
