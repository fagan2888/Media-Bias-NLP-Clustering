Ostensibly, the holding is narrow: Only companies that the Court calls \"closely held\" can claim a sincerely held religious belief, and the case is meant only to apply to birth control, not other medical care that might conflict with an employer\u2019s religion. The legacy of the Court\u2019s reasoning remains to be seen, but White House spokesperson Josh Earnest told reporters that President Obama believes women \u201cshould make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their bosses deciding for them.\u201d But contraception extends well beyond a woman\u2019s decision whether and when to conceive, and access to reliable family planning goes deeper than a woman\u2019s personal wellbeing. It plays a pivotal role in the financial, physical and emotional health of children, and data suggest that effective contraception and positive social outcomes are mutually reinforcing. In the end, empowering women\u2014regardless of socioeconomic status\u2014with more options to control pregnancies has benefits for everyone.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Guttmacher Institute review of more than 66 studies, spanning three decades, reliable contraception allows women to be better parents. Among the findings: couples who experience unintended pregnancy and unplanned childbirth are more likely to have depression and anxiety\u2014while adults who plan their children tend to be happier. Relationships are more likely to dissolve after an unplanned birth than a planned one. And those who are unprepared to be parents are more likely to develop a poor relationship with their child. \u201cWhen you support individuals and families making the right decisions for themselves, we are all better off,\u201d said Adam Sonfield, Guttmacher Institute senior public policy associate and lead author of last year\u2019s report on the social and economic benefits of contraception. \u201cIt all starts with educational attainment that leads to greater economic stability for women and their families.\u201d Last year, the Guttmacher Institute concluded that access to birth control significantly increases a woman\u2019s earning power and narrows the gender pay gap. \u201cYou would think we would want to go out of our way to support everyone in avoiding unintended pregnancies.\u201d Given all the data, it\u2019s still nearly impossible to separate these benchmarks of a woman\u2019s welfare from family health and societal gains at large. Though, there are distinct benefits that accrue to children in homes with reliable birth control. Using census data, a recent article in CESifo Economic Studies provides new evidence linking family planning programs of the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s with a decrease in the share of U.S. children and adults living in poverty today. As such, the study concludes, family planning programs may be an effective way to improve children\u2019s economic resources. Embedded in the conversation about birth control access is a cycle of poverty. As income inequality grows families without access to reliable contraception are potentially at a greater disadvantage. Poorer children experience more health problems, live in more dangerous neighborhoods and have higher rates of delayed academic development. Those from poorer households in the long run, have lower test scores, are less likely to complete high school or college, limiting their earning potential as adults .\n\nUniversity of Michigan economics professor and co-author of the CESifo article, Martha Bailey puts the findings in context. \u201cFamily planning programs also allow people to delay marriage and childbirth until they find the right partner. We know that the presence of two adults in a household helps both the parents\u2019 economic situation and also the children\u2019s,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cCheaper and more reliable contraception allows parents to delay childbearing, to invest in their own human capital and have children when their incomes are higher.\u201d Though contraception is not simply about avoiding pregnancy. Access to reliable birth control also allows women to space births which has measurable outcomes for their own health and that of their babies, according to Jennifer Reich, professor of sociology at the University of Denver and co-editor of the forthcoming book, Reproduction and Society. Multiple studies have shown the adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes related to closely spaced pregnancies, ranging from placenta abruption to lower birth weight. Maternal deaths associated with childbirth, Reich points out, are on the rise in the US. While the reasons are not entirely clear, the increase in the number of pregnant women who have diseases that contribute to higher-risk pregnancies\u2014 like hypertension and diabetes\u2014 may be partially to blame. \u201cPregnancy can exacerbate existing [health] conditions,\u201d said Reich, \u201call reasons why women should be able to choose if and when to become pregnant and deserve to receive high quality affordable care in making that decision.\u201d Consider also the following savings for government health programs: for every public dollar spent on contraception, Sonfield explains, $5.68 is saved in Medicaid spending. \u201cFor a variety of reasons, half of the pregnancies in this country are unintended, partly because women are not using optimal contraception for their lifestyle. Many in the field believe that IUD\u2019s are underutilized by the medical community,\u201d says Dr. Carol S. Weisman, a distinguished professor of public health sciences and obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State College of Medicine. \u201cWe do know that costs associated with unexpected pregnancies are high.\u201d In addition, Weisman explains, when a pregnancy is planned, a mother is more likely to get appropriate prenatal care and abstain from unhealthy activities like smoking, so the overall health outcomes tend to be better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why providing women more options to control pregnancies is in the interest of everyone", "author": "Jacoba Urist", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Why providing women more options to control pregnancies is in the interest of everyone", "title": "Birth Control Benefits Everyone", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/AP669505003733/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-broader-benefits-of-contraception/373856/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8279\"", "article_summary": "According to a 2013 Guttmacher Institute review of more than 66 studies, spanning three decades, reliable contraception allows women to be better parents.\nAs income inequality grows families without access to reliable contraception are potentially at a greater disadvantage.\nThough, there are distinct benefits that accrue to children in homes with reliable birth control.\nIn the end, empowering women\u2014regardless of socioeconomic status\u2014with more options to control pregnancies has benefits for everyone.\n\u201cCheaper and more reliable contraception allows parents to delay childbearing, to invest in their own human capital and have children when their incomes are higher.\u201d Though contraception is not simply about avoiding pregnancy."}
