ICE!\u201d protesters chanted outside the entrance to the detention center.\n\nAt least two detainees have died this year in the 1,600-bed detention center, prompting an investigation by ICE in May. The Associated Press referred to the deaths as \u201capparent suicides.\u201d\n\nHundreds of activists also protested in front of the Phoenix ICE office, where they uploaded images to Twitter of the banners they placed on the office\u2019s entrance.\n\nvamos a quebrar el hielo #not1more pic.twitter.com/npv5Nl7dsd \u2014 NDLON (@ndlon) October 14, 2013\n\nthe doors at @wwwicegov in phoenix have a new sign #shutdownice #not1more pic.twitter.com/qm9sOfjBsk \u2014 NDLON (@ndlon) October 14, 2013\n\nProtesters pointed a finger at President Barack Obama, arguing that he could use his executive authority to scale down deportations.\n\n\u201cToday we are here to shut down ICE,\u201d one organizer said during a livestream of the Phoenix protest. \u201cThis here is a manifestation of the president\u2019s immigration policy\u2026 We are approaching 2 million deportations and that ain\u2019t no hope and that ain\u2019t no change and that ain\u2019t something we\u2019re going to vote for.\u201d\n\nThe protests were the latest in a series of increasingly audacious demonstrations from activists across the country frustrated with the high rate of deportation and government inaction on immigration reform.\n\nImmigrant activists chained themselves around the wheels of a bus carrying roughly 70 immigrant detainees to a Tucson courthouse on Friday to protest Operation Streamline, an immigration enforcement program that slaps undocumented immigrants with an illegal entry conviction and jail time before deportation. The protest resulted in the cancellation of the detainees\u2019 court appearance. By Friday they had been deported, but without the criminal conviction, according to the Arizona Daily Star.\n\nThe Arizona protests came on the heels of two unique demonstrations staged by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance. In July, three undocumented immigrant youths traveled to Mexico and returned to the United States through a legal port of entry at Nogales, Ariz., gathering a group of six other people who had once lived in the United States as undocumented immigrants along the way.\n\nNIYA organized a similar demonstration this month, with nearly three dozen people who had once resided in the United States without authorization crossing through the port of entry at Laredo, Texas, and asking for either humanitarian parole or asylum.\n\nObama made immigration reform a campaign issue in both elections, but reform remains elusive. The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with bipartisan support in June. But the bill, which contains a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented and pours more than $40 billion into ramping up border security, stalled in the House before Congress shut down the government in the wake of Republican efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration has wracked up a record-setting 1.7 million deportations.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Latino Books Once Banned In Arizona Latino Books Once Banned In Arizona\n\n1 of 7 Occupied America: A History of Chicanos, by Rodolfo Acu\u00f1a The most successful book written by professor Rodolfo Acu\u00f1a, \"Occupied America\" represents all that Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne opposed in the Mexican-American Studies program when he launched the attack against it. Horne viewed the curriculum as separatist and ethnically divisive. HB 2281, the law used to ban TUSD's Mexican American Studies program, prohibits courses that \"promote the overthrow of the United States government\" or \"are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group.\" \"These people think you're a separatist if you want to teach and include people,\" Acu\u00f1a told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. \"I don't want to be part of Mexico ... That's a stupid thing to argue.\" Share this slide:\n\nPearson", "article_metadata": {"description": "Immigrant rights activists blocked the entrance to Eloy Detention Center in Arizona and held a demonstration in front of Phoenix\u2019s Immigration and Custom...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-15 19:42:33 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Immigrant rights activists blocked the entrance to Eloy Detention Center in Arizona and held a demonstration in front of Phoenix\u2019s Immigration and Custom...", "title": "Activists Turn Up The Heat On ICE", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/14/eloy-detention-center-protest_n_4099063.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1406649/images/o-NDLON-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Immigrant rights activists blocked the entrance to Eloy Detention Center in Arizona and held a demonstration in front of Phoenix\u2019s Immigration and Custom...", "creator": "RoqPlanas", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1406649/images/o-NDLON-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Activists Turn Up The Heat On ICE", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-14 19:42:33 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4099063", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Puente Arizona,Latino politics,ICE protest,Phoenix ICE protest,Eloy Detention Center,ndlon,Phoenix protest,Eloy Detention Center protest,Not 1 more deportation", "article": {"section": "Latino Voices", "tag": "Puente Arizona,Latino politics,ICE protest,Phoenix ICE protest,Eloy Detention Center,ndlon,Phoenix protest,Eloy Detention Center protest,Not 1 more deportation", "published_time": "2013-10-14 19:42:33 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-10-14 19:42:33 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94ed\"", "article_summary": "vamos a quebrar el hielo #not1more pic.twitter.com/npv5Nl7dsd \u2014 NDLON (@ndlon) October 14, 2013the doors at @wwwicegov in phoenix have a new sign #shutdownice #not1more pic.twitter.com/qm9sOfjBsk \u2014 NDLON (@ndlon) October 14, 2013Protesters pointed a finger at President Barack Obama, arguing that he could use his executive authority to scale down deportations.\nEloy is one of three immigrant detention centers run by the Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison contractor in the United States.\nAt least two detainees have died this year in the 1,600-bed detention center, prompting an investigation by ICE in May.\nICE!\u201d protesters chanted outside the entrance to the detention center.\n\u201cToday we are here to shut down ICE,\u201d one organizer said during a livestream of the Phoenix protest."}
