There was only one way to find out. I called up WillUsingThePrefixCyberMakeMeLookLikeAnIdiot.com and plugged in Monaco\u2019s likely answers.\n\nQuestion number one: Are you a science fiction author? No, though I suppose it's possible that Monaco secretly dabbles in anonymous Star Trek fanfic or something.\n\nQuestion number two: Are you about to use IM to talk dirty to someone? Again, not that I know of. I\u2019m not aware of any stories of government officials spending time making online sexy talk, although there was the EPA employee who looked at porn all day. But we'll assume the answer is no.\n\nQuestion number three: Are you using \"cyber\" to replace the word \"computer\" or \"network\" for a bad or nonexistent reason? (E.g. \"cybersecurity\" instead of \"network security.\") Actually, yeah, kind of. Now that you mention it. It's definitely in the zone of \"bad or nonexistent.\" We\u2019ll go with yes on this one.\n\nQuestion number four: Are you using the term to saber-rattle and/or fear-monger in order to secure funding for your corner of the military industrial complex? I suppose one could argue that the center's title should be exempt because cyber is used as a word and not a prefix, but that seems a little silly. (If anything, promoting cyber to its own word is even worse.) There's really no point in arguing here. This is definitely a yes.\n\nI put all these responses in, and here\u2019s the answer I got: \"Actually, you will probably not look like an idiot to the credulous legislators you're bullying into handing you money. But the rest of us think you're a dangerous moron.\"\n\nThis answer seems directed more at contractors and defense department project managers, but otherwise it seems more or less on target in its basic sentiment.\n\nAnd, in fact, the Post's report indicates that, as the answer I got suggests, some security bureaucrats love it, but other folks think the idea is dumb:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Richard Clarke, a former White House counterterrorism official. \u201cIt\u2019s overdue.\u201d\n\nOthers question why a new agency is needed when the government already has several dedicated to monitoring and analyzing cyberthreat data. The Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Security Agency all have cyber-operations centers, and the FBI and the NSA are able to integrate information, noted Melissa Hathaway, a former White House cybersecurity coordinator and president of Hathaway Global Strategies. \"We should not be creating more organizations and bureaucracy,\" she said. \"We need to be forcing the existing organizations to become more effective \u2014 hold them accountable.\"\n\nIndeed, given the dramatic rise in federal data* security breaches over the past several years, the government might consider getting its existing house in order before building an addition.\n\n*See? I didn't have to say \"cyber.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "One of my favorite obscure websites takes the form of a simple questionnaire that answers the question posed by its URL, WillUsingThePrefixCyberMakeMeLookLikeAnIdiot.com.&nbsp;", "title": "White House to Announce New Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center.
