Minuteman Health spent $1,091 in medical and administrative claims per member per month for every $202 it took in in premiums, representing the highest losses in the industry.One co-op even pulled the plug last week.Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner, Nick Gerhart, announced Friday that he would seek liquidation of CoOportunity Health, which covered nearly 120,000 people in Iowa and Nebraska before faltering financially late last year.Gerhart said CoOportunity Health had less cash on hand than medical claims to cover for members, with no expected infusion of new money until the second half of 2015. He plans to seek a court order this week to liquidate the company, with the order taking effect Feb. 28.Without CoOportunity Health, Iowa\u2019s insurance shoppers will have just one carrier option: Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield.The failure of the Iowa taxpayer-funded insurer was a bad blow to those supporting the co-ops\u2019 creation under the ACA.\u201cAM Best is concerned about the financial viability of several of these plans,\u201d the analyst firm said in its report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/are-health-coops-headed-for-the-insurance-graveyard-21312.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Less than two years later, nearly all the new health insurance co-ops are posting losses and one is even headed for liquidation.", "title": "Are health co-ops headed for the insurance graveyard?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Less than two years later, nearly all the new health insurance co-ops are posting losses and one is even headed for liquidation.", "title": "Are health co-ops headed for the insurance graveyard?", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/are-health-coops-headed-for-the-insurance-graveyard-21312.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Less than two years later, nearly all the new health insurance co-ops are posting losses and one is even headed for liquidation.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a2c\"", "article_summary": "According to an analysis from AM Best, just one of the 23 co-ops was profitable last year\u2014Maine Community Health Options.Meanwhile, co-ops like Massachusetts\u2019 Minuteman Health and New York\u2019s Freelancers Health Services Corporation were less successful.\n\u201cThere are so many facets of a health insurance plan.\nAnd despite the co-ops\u2019 large market shares, insurance agents have been skeptical about the groups\u2019 ability to offer low health insurance rates long-term.\u201cI\u2019ve never been someone who just chases premiums,\u201d said Larry Harrison, a Nevada agency owner who sold just a few state co-op plans last year.\nIt\u2019s about reciprocity across state lines, it\u2019s about the network and it\u2019s about rate increases that could be suspect going forward.\u201dIt appears Harrison and other like-minded agents may have been right in their hesitancy.\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it called for the establishment of Consumer Oriented and Operated Plans (co-ops)\u2014insurance carriers meant to boost competition and offer competitive health plans for individuals and small groups.About $2.5 billion in taxpayer dollars went to fund the 23 co-ops, which were responsible for about 300,000 enrollments last year and a third of the lowest-premium plans offered on the state and public exchanges."}
