I understand if people are married, it\u2019s going to be both salaries. But if you are not \u2013 like, we are in a domestic partnership \u2013 then how are they going to calculate this?\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway: If you file taxes together, you shop for insurance together.\n\nBear with me. This is a tricky question.\n\nMarried couples, including those in same-sex marriages, would apply on Covered California as a single household. Both incomes would be taken into account. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, made that part pretty simple.\n\nBut overturning DOMA didn\u2019t change anything for registered domestic partners. They cannot file taxes jointly with the Internal Revenue Service, so Covered California has had to get creative.\n\nDomestic partners will have to shop the exchange separately, according to a Covered California spokeswoman. Their premium rates would be based on half of their combined income. A simple example \u2013 if one partner makes $40,000 and the other makes $20,000, both would tell Covered California their income is $30,000.\n\nBut it gets trickier. Eicher and Rose\u2019s case is a little different because they aren\u2019t registered domestic partners.\n\nThe state does not recognize domestic partnerships for opposite-sex partners because they have the option to marry, said Leigh Kretzschmar, a San Diego attorney specializing in domestic partnerships. (The rule doesn\u2019t apply to couples over the age of 62)\n\nThat affidavit Eicher and Rose signed doesn\u2019t legally bind them outside of Eicher\u2019s previous employer. Some companies will cover long-term partners if you file paperwork with their human resources department.\n\nThat means Rose\u2019s relationship with Eicher won\u2019t come into play at all. She can apply on the health exchange as an individual. Whether she qualifies for subsidies depends on her income alone. Subsidies are available to people who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $44,680.\n\nA good rule of thumb: If you file federal taxes together, you\u2019ll shop the exchange together. If you file separately, you\u2019ll shop separately.\n\nThe Orders: Apply for a Covered California plan by March 31.\n\nCovered California is the only place you\u2019ll find federal premium assistance if you\u2019re eligible. Open enrollment on the exchange has already begun and runs through March 31. Plans won\u2019t kick in until Jan. 1.\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: Does Obamacare give employees more choice over coverage?\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Community, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
