He was 82. One memorial service was held Nov. 2 in Estes Park.\n\nThe Omaha native was the son and grandson of Omaha physicians. He earned his medical degree from the University of Nebraska in 1957. He completed his residency training in internal medicine and infectious disease at the University of Illinois.\n\nHe taught at UNMC from 1961 to 1997. He was a revered clinician and teacher of medical students and residents, said Dr. Tom Tape, professor and chief of the division of general internal medicine for UNMC.\n\n\u201cCal was an outstanding role model of the consummate academic physician educator,\u201d Tape said. \u201cHe maintained an extensive personal library of medical literature. He also was a master clinician and taught me many clinical pearls.\u201d\n\nDavis was chairman of the department of preventive medicine from 1965 to 1971 and chief of the infectious disease section from 1969 to 1991. He held two other posts in the College of Medicine: assistant dean of admissions and students (1986-95) and assistant dean for student and minority affairs (1995-97).\n\nHe was named associate professor emeritus when he retired in 1997.\n\nAfter retirement, Davis returned to campus several months each year as a volunteer teacher.\n\nHe loved the outdoors and enjoyed hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park near Estes Park. He moved to Estes Park in retirement.\n\n\u201cTo me, his passing is equivalent to burning down a library,\u201d said Dr. Anne Kessinger, professor of internal medicine-oncology/hematology. \u201cHe was such an intellectual. During a series of walks together, he discussed medieval history, botany and NBA basketball.\u201d\n\nDr. Robert Wigton, retired associate dean of the College of Medicine\u2019s graduate medical education program, said: \u201cWhen I was his student in medical school, I valued his teaching and advice. When I joined the faculty, I found him a source of clinical wisdom and a mentor.\n\n\u201cHe has always been an inspiration to me as a physician and teacher, and \u2014 throughout it all \u2014 a dear friend.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "With his vast knowledge, a colleague says, his death is akin to \u201cburning down a library.\u201d", "title": "Dr. John Calvin Davis III revered as physician, teacher", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/dr-john-calvin-davis-iii-revered-as-physician-teacher/article_5318802c-cbc8-550f-9c86-0fc015ad679f.html", "image": {"width": 334, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/4d/54de4018-c2fd-5d58-a2fc-0a2458ce1b80/5332e9839bd14.image.jpg?resize=334%2C449", "height": 449}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With his vast knowledge, a colleague says, his death is akin to \u201cburning down a library.\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f4e\"", "article_summary": "Davis died Oct. 29 in Estes Park, Colo., after a long illness related to heart failure.\nHe loved the outdoors and enjoyed hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park near Estes Park.\nOne memorial service was held Nov. 2 in Estes Park.\nHe was a revered clinician and teacher of medical students and residents, said Dr. Tom Tape, professor and chief of the division of general internal medicine for UNMC.\nDr. John Calvin Davis III, a longtime internal medicine faculty member at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, will be remembered at a memorial service at St. Cecilia Cathedral, 701 N. 40th St., at 11 a.m. Saturday."}
