College athletes with ACL injuries lose more time on the field than athletes with ankle or traumatic head injuries, according to the researchers.\n\nYoung women facing the greatest risk are those who play sports involving a lot of pivoting, such as soccer, basketball, lacrosse and handball, according to Sugimoto. He added that the most common age for women to be injured is around 14 to 17 years.\n\nGrethe Mykelburst, who outlined the risks involved with ACL injury in an email, said, \u201cit takes you out of your sport for 6-12 months, and some don\u2019t succeed to return to their previous level.\u201d She added that the risk of getting osteoarthritis, a degenerative condition, in the knee is high after injury.\n\nMykelburst, a sports physical therapist and associate professor at the Oslo Sport Trauma Research Center in Oslo, Norway, was not involved in the review.\n\nSugimoto\u2019s team analyzed 14 studies of exercise intervention programs, looking specifically at four different exercise approaches including balance, jump training, abdomen stabilizing exercises and strengthening of the legs and hips.\n\nTraining programs that aimed to build strength in the back of the legs and in the hips significantly reduced the number of ACL injuries when compared with programs that did not. That was also true of programs that focused on strengthening and developing more control of the abdomen.\n\nPrograms that included more than one type of exercise were significantly more effective than those using only one type. \u201cNeuromuscular training has to incorporate many exercise modes,\u201d Sugimoto told Reuters Health. \u201cPerforming only one exercise mode seems ineffective.\u201d\n\nThe researchers note that while balance and jumping exercises were somewhat helpful in reducing injury, they were not effective unless combined with other exercises.\n\nThe study lists a number of specific helpful exercises, including Russian hamstring curls, sit-ups, pushups and bench press. Sugimoto emphasized the hamstring curls in particular, as they work both to strengthen the legs and hips and require abdomen control.\n\n\u201cWith inclusion of these exercises as well as a variety of exercise modes, athletes can attain the fullest benefit from neuromuscular training and prevent ACL injury,\u201d Sugimoto said.\n\nEvery year 350,000 people seek ACL reconstruction surgery in the United States, the authors point out.\n\nSugimoto said that although surgery is the best available treatment, 24 to 30 percent of high school athletes who undergo the surgery tear their ACL again within the next several years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to prevent ACL injury in first place to avoid subsequent ACL injury and preserve a healthy knee joint,\u201d Sugimoto said.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is strong that neuromuscular training works,\u201d Mykelburst agreed. \u201cAs an athlete or a coach, you can\u2019t afford not using the prevention program and exercises that exist,\u201d she added.\n\nSOURCE: http://bmj.co/1wATVNF British Journal of Sports Medicine, online December 1, 2014.\n\n(By Madeline Kennedy)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "review, finds, best, exercises, prevent, womens, knee, injury", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A review of 14 different studies has found the best training exercises to prevent knee injuries in women.", "title": "Review Finds Best Exercises To Prevent Women's Knee Injury", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/review-finds-best-exercises-prevent-womens-knee-injury-314318", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/14/knee-injuries.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A review of 14 different studies has found the best training exercises to prevent knee injuries in women.", "title": "Review Finds Best Exercises To Prevent Women's Knee Injury", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/review-finds-best-exercises-prevent-womens-knee-injury-314318", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/14/knee-injuries.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/14/knee-injuries.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-14T11:16:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-14T11:17:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A review of 14 different studies has found the best training exercises to prevent knee injuries in women."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf006\"", "article_summary": "A review of 14 different studies has found the best training exercises to prevent knee injuries in women.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to prevent ACL injury in first place to avoid subsequent ACL injury and preserve a healthy knee joint,\u201d Sugimoto said.\nACL injuries are very serious and can take a long time to heal, the researchers write in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\nCollege athletes with ACL injuries lose more time on the field than athletes with ankle or traumatic head injuries, according to the researchers.\n\u201cWith inclusion of these exercises as well as a variety of exercise modes, athletes can attain the fullest benefit from neuromuscular training and prevent ACL injury,\u201d Sugimoto said."}
