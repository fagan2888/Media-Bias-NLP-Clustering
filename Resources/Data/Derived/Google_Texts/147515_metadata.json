So although it is an effective line of defense, it should be seen as one of the last lines of defense,\u201d Mr. Cunliffe said, according to a text of his speech.\n\nHis remarks come amid concern that low interest rates and other stimulus policies pursued by central banks since 2008 are stoking asset prices and inflating dangerous bubbles in financial markets.\n\nCritics of central-bank policy argue very low interest rates risk fomenting a new crisis that could threaten economic recovery. The Bank for International Settlements, a forum for central bankers based in Switzerland and one such critic, on Sunday urged its members to raise interest rates to preserve financial stability.\n\nBut officials such as Mr. Cunliffe and his BOE colleague Andrew Haldane contend that higher rates risk aborting still-fragile economies and that new \u201cmacroprudential\u201d tools designed to safeguard financial stability\u2013such as higher bank capital requirements and controls on lending\u2013should be deployed first instead.\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a speech Wednesday, agreed, saying she favors relying first on regulation and supervision to make the financial system more resilient to occasional bouts of turbulence. She and other central bankers stress they are not ruling out applying the monetary brakes if those tools fail.\n\nU.K. central bankers June 26 made use of their new powers to curb risky lending in Britain\u2019s housing market, which Mr. Cunliffe described Thursday as \u201ca very major risk\u201d to the U.K. economy.\n\nThe BOE told banks they mustn\u2019t give more than 15% of new loans to home buyers borrowing more than four-and-a-half times their income and must impose stricter tests on borrowers to ensure they can repay their loans at higher interest rates.\n\nMr. Cunliffe said the new rules should be thought of as insurance against the risk that rising house prices aren\u2019t matched by a pickup in Britons\u2019 incomes, which could lead home buyers to take on bigger debts than they can afford.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A senior Bank of England official Thursday said raising interest rates should be among the last lines of defense for central banks faced with the threat of financial instability.", "title": "BOE\u2019s Cunliffe: Monetary Policy Last Line of Defense on Financial Stability", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/07/03/boes-cunliffe-monetary-policy-last-line-of-defense-on-financial-stability/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "BOE\u2019s Cunliffe: Monetary Policy Last Line of Defense on Financial Stability", "description": "A senior Bank of England official Thursday said raising interest rates should be among the last lines of defense for central banks faced with the threat of financial instability.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Jason Douglas", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "A senior Bank of England official Thursday said raising interest rates should be among the last lines of defense for central banks faced with the threat of financial instability.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-03T12:59:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/07/03/boes-cunliffe-monetary-policy-last-line-of-defense-on-financial-stability/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-26558", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A senior Bank of England official Thursday said raising interest rates should be among the last lines of defense for central banks faced with the threat of financial instability.", "title": "BOE\u2019s Cunliffe: Monetary Policy Last Line of Defense on Financial Stability", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/07/03/boes-cunliffe-monetary-policy-last-line-of-defense-on-financial-stability/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-26558", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-03T13:01:40-04:00"}, "article_summary": "So although it is an effective line of defense, it should be seen as one of the last lines of defense,\u201d Mr. Cunliffe said, according to a text of his speech.\nCritics of central-bank policy argue very low interest rates risk fomenting a new crisis that could threaten economic recovery.\nA senior Bank of England official Thursday said raising interest rates should be among the last lines of defense for central banks faced with the threat of financial instability.\nJon Cunliffe, the BOE\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability told an audience in Liverpool, England, that although tighter monetary policy is an effective way of stemming risks from financial-sector excesses it isn\u2019t without costs to the wider economy.\nThe Bank for International Settlements, a forum for central bankers based in Switzerland and one such critic, on Sunday urged its members to raise interest rates to preserve financial stability."}
