That means all policies within a given area are priced the same, regardless of individuals\u2019 health status. Employers with 51 or more FTEs are subject to \u201cexperience-rated\u201d pricing, which is based on claims history.\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires states to change the definition of \u201csmall group,\u201d as of Jan. 1, 2016, to one with 100 or fewer FTEs. However, PACE nullifies that provision, instead allowing states to choose either 50 or 100 as the threshold above which experience rating kicks in.\n\nA majority of states, some of which had been in the process of enacting new legislation to comply with the ACA provision, are expected instead to keep the small-group definition at 50 FTEs, according to Adam Brackemyre, director of government relations for the Self-Insurance Institute of America (SIIA).\n\nThose decisions generally would be nods to small businesses that could be hurt financially in states where 100 does become the new employee limit for \u201csmall groups.\u201d In such states, employers with 51 to 100 FTEs would then be offered community-rated insurance rather than claims-related insurance, which would initially act to raise pricing for healthier groups and lower it for less-healthy ones.\n\nBut if pricing were to go up for employers with healthier workers, many of them would likely seek to make up for that by self-insuring, which over time is generally several percentage points less costly than buying insurance policies, and buying stop-loss insurance to pay for unexpected catastrophic claims. And with healthy groups leaving the small-group market, the remaining ones would see their rates shoot up as well.\n\nPACE largely undoes that scenario, but there are exceptions. In New York, employers with 50 or fewer FTEs are prohibited from purchasing stop-loss coverage, without which self-funding is far too risky for companies of that size. The state legislature passed a law in 2013 that expands the prohibition, as of Jan. 1, 2016, to companies with up to 100 FTEs.\n\nTwo bills have been introduced seeking to quash that law. One would make the stop-loss ban applicable in perpetuity only to the 50-workers-and-under employers, but it\u2019s stalled in committees, with 2016 just over two months way. The other bill, which has passed both houses of the legislature, would grandfather stop-loss coverage for employers in the 51-to-100-worker category for two years.\n\nHowever, says Brackemyre, the bill apparently has not yet been sent to Gov. Andrew Cuomo for his signature or veto, and Cuomo hasn\u2019t said whether he\u2019s in favor of the bill. \u201cMy guess is that New York would be unlikely to move the small-group definition back to 50 [FTEs],\u201d Brackemyre says.\n\nIn California, a law that took effect last year prohibits stop-loss insurers from issuing policies carrying annual deductibles of less than $35,000 per covered individual to employers with 100 or fewer FTEs. In other words, the catastrophic insurance does not kick in until a covered person has racked up $35,000 in medical bills.\n\nThat limit, which will rise to $40,000 in 2016, is too high to make self-funding economically viable for virtually all employers with 50 or fewer FTEs, and many of those in the 51-to-100 category as well, according to Brackemyre.\n\nCalifornia, like New York, has already changed its definition of \u201csmall group\u201d to 100 or fewer FTEs and is unlikely to reverse that move. It\u2019s a public policy goal for many California politicians to enroll as many people as possible in the state\u2019s Small Health Options Program (SHOP), a public insurance exchange for small groups. Under the ACA, all states must have a SHOP.\n\nThe federal government, of course, itself is motivated to drive usage of healthcare.gov, the private exchange it runs in the approximately three dozen states that opted not to create and run an exchange themselves. Last November, the Labor Department issued guidelines pointing out ways states could regulate stop-loss insurance without violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nOther states that have expanded the definition of \u201csmall group,\u201d like Colorado and Virginia, are more likely than California and New York to revert to the lower threshold, according to Brackemyre.\n\nMaryland, too, raised the minimum deductible threshold for stop-loss coverage, starting this year. The threshold is now $22,500, up from $10,000 previously.\n\nImage: ThinkStock", "article_metadata": {"description": "But firms in New York and California with 51 to 100 employees may not be as lucky in the self-funding arena.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Law Preserves Self-Funding as an Option for Many Companies\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2015\\/10\\/law-preserves-self-funding-option-many-companies\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-21 14:17:26\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-21 15:31:24\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":451511,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"ACA\",\"Adam Brackemyre\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"community-rated insurance\",\"experience-rated insurance\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Regulation\",\"Risk &amp; Compliance\",\"Risk Management\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/10\\/ThinkstockPhotos-452017615.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "But firms in New York and California with 51 to 100 employees may not be as lucky in the self-funding arena.", "title": "Law Keeps Self-Funding as an Option for Many Firms", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/10/ThinkstockPhotos-452017615.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-21T15:31:24+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/10/law-preserves-self-funding-option-many-companies/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "But firms in New York and California with 51 to 100 employees may not be as lucky in the self-funding arena.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Law Keeps Self-Funding as an Option for Many Firms", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Law Preserves Self-Funding as an Option for Many Companies", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20151021, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Risk Management", "tag": "stop loss insurance", "published_time": "2015-10-21T14:17:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-21T15:31:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aca, adam brackemyre, affordable care act, community-rated insurance, experience-rated insurance, fte, full-time-equivalent, fully insured, health insurance portability and accountability act, pace, protecting affordable coverage for employees act, self funding, self insurance, self-insurance institute of america, shop, siaa, small group, small health options program, stop loss, stop loss insurance"}, "article_summary": "The state legislature passed a law in 2013 that expands the prohibition, as of Jan. 1, 2016, to companies with up to 100 FTEs.\n\u201cMy guess is that New York would be unlikely to move the small-group definition back to 50 [FTEs],\u201d Brackemyre says.\nIn New York, employers with 50 or fewer FTEs are prohibited from purchasing stop-loss coverage, without which self-funding is far too risky for companies of that size.\nLast November, the Labor Department issued guidelines pointing out ways states could regulate stop-loss insurance without violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\nA law signed by President Obama on Oct. 7 with little fanfare could effectively save thousands of companies from losing the option to lower costs by self-funding employees\u2019 health benefits."}
