They\u2019ve said, we\u2019re not just going to get rid of his entitlement program; we\u2019re going to have to create a new entitlement program. They\u2019ve said, just like the President does, we\u2019re going to count success, by the number of people that have a cards, never mind whether they really have access to doctors or affordable healthcare, never mind if we\u2019re actually reducing costs for the American people.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t ever remember these candidates saying, \u2018well vote for us, give us the majority and we\u2019ll just repeal the easy parts of Obamacare, not the hard parts.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be a cheaper, weaker version of the Democratic Party,\u201d Jindal proclaimed, continuing, \u201cand we certainly don\u2019t need Obamacare-lite.\u201d\n\nHe transitioned to his second call to repeal all of Common Core, saying, \u201cRight now I\u2019m suing Arne Duncan to get rid of every word of Common Core.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution,\u201d Jindal said as point one of two arguing against Common Core, \u201cwe have never allowed the federal government to make curriculum, to make standards, to make testing decisions that should be best made a the local level by parents, teachers and local officials.\u201d\n\nThe Governor offered his solution to \u201callow the dollars to follow the child instead of making the child follow the dollars.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cThe best way to fix education in America is to trust moms and dads and to give them real choice about how, when and where their children are educated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe face a fundamental threat from radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d Jindal said, transitioning to his third, \u201cmost serious of all\u201d issue.\n\n\u201cI hate to say this, but we have a President right now who is not qualified to be our Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt gives me no joy to say that. This is not a partisan statement. This is not an ideological statement. This is a recognition of the facts. We\u2019ve got a President who can\u2019t seem to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism. How can he defeat the enemy if he\u2019s not even willing to recognize the enemy that we face.\u201d\n\nReviewing radical Islamic terrorists\u2019 mass slaughters and terrorism over the past few months, Jindal called out \u201chorrific, barbaric behavior.\u201d He then criticized the Obama administration, Attorney General Eric Holder and the State Department official\u2019s responses to these acts.\n\n\u201cFor some reason our President, doesn\u2019t seem to want or doesn\u2019t seem to be capable of recognizing that what we\u2019re at war with is a set of evil beliefs. These individuals, they want to kill us, they want to enslave us, they want to treat women as second-class citizens. We\u2019re not going to fight this with a jobs program. We need to understand what\u2019s at stake here,\u201d said Jindal.\n\nJindal recalled his father\u2019s words to him and his brother when they were young: \u201cEvery night boys, you need to get on your knees and give thanks to God almighty that you are blessed to be born in the greatest country in the history of the world, these United States.\u201d Jindal\u2019s parents came to America over 40 years ago.\n\nHe criticized Obama\u2019s apprent weakness and declared, \u201cWe cannot let Iran become a nuclear power.\u201d Jindal continued, \u201cI fear he wants a bad deal better than no deal at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d Jindal asked the audience. \u201cWe must win in 2016\u2026.We must win this election. We can win this election. We will win this election and get our country back on the right path.\u201d\n\nIn post-speech questions, Jindal answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether the party needs to go in a more moderate direction.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jindal: Obama \u2018Not Qualified\u2019 to be Commander-in-Chief", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jindal: Obama \u2018Not Qualified\u2019 to be Commander-in-Chief", "title": "Jindal: Obama \u2018Not Qualified\u2019 to be Commander-in-Chief - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Jindal-Michelle-Moons-Breitbart-News.png", "height": 600}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/02/23/jindal-obama-not-qualified-to-be-commander-in-chief/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jindal: Obama \u2018Not Qualified\u2019 to be Commander-in-Chief", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Jindal-Michelle-Moons-Breitbart-News.png", "title": "Jindal: Obama \u2018Not Qualified\u2019 to be Commander-in-Chief - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, Common Core, Congress, Constitution, Islam, jindal, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, obamacare, Radical Islamic Terrorism, Republicans, terorrism, Unite IE Conference,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-02-23T04:54:39-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Unite IE Conference", "categories": "Breitbart California,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc90f\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve got a President who can\u2019t seem to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism.\nThey\u2019ve said, we\u2019re not just going to get rid of his entitlement program; we\u2019re going to have to create a new entitlement program.\nWe need to understand what\u2019s at stake here,\u201d said Jindal.\n\u201cI hate to say this, but we have a President right now who is not qualified to be our Commander-in-Chief.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt gives me no joy to say that.\nThese individuals, they want to kill us, they want to enslave us, they want to treat women as second-class citizens."}
