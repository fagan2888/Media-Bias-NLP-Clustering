A sniff may even trigger a childhood memory. But scientists at Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Iowa have discovered that chemicals that we smell are detected by cells in our lungs as well. While cigarette smoke permeating the air, for example, elicits a pungeant smell in our brains, it can also prompt so-called neuroendocrine cells in our lungs to release a large amount of hormones that cause our airways to constrict. This is because the cells in our airways have the same odor receptors as our olfactory system, yet produce very different outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe forget,\u201d Ben-Shahar, author and leader of the study, told Washington University\u2019s newsroom, \u201cthat our body plan is a tube within a tube, so our lungs and our gut are open to the external environment. Although they\u2019re inside us, they\u2019re actually part of our external layer. So they constantly suffer environmental insults,\u201d he said, \u201cand it makes sense that we evolved mechanisms to protect ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of these so-called pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, or PNECs, was reported in the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology and might be key in understanding respiratory diseases and their characteristic hypersensitivity to certain chemicals. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema, suffer from frequent tightening of the chest, coughing, and wheezing when they are exposed to traffic fumes, pungent odors, perfumes, and other chemicals that can waft into their lungs.\n\nBen-Shahar hypothesized that future therapies could block odor receptors in our lungs, thereby short-circuiting respiratory attacks and reducing the need for steroids and dilators. \u201cWhen people with airway disease have pathological responses to odors, they\u2019re usually pretty fast and violent,\u201d Ben-Shahar said to Washington University. \u201cPatients suddenly shut down and can\u2019t breathe, and these cells may explain why.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to neurons in our nose that respond to odor molecules in a very specific manner, Ben-Sharar pointed out that PNECs in the lung are less discerning by having more than one kind of receptor. This means that several types of molecules can trigger a lung cell to spill out chemical messengers, namely serotonin and neuropeptides, to generate uncontrollable respiratory responses. \u201cThey are possibly designed,\u201d he said, \u201cto elicit a rapid, physiological response if you inhale something that is bad for you.\u201d\n\nFurther proof that these lung cells serve as a potential target to stem respiratory disease comes from the authors noting that sufferers have more PNECs in their airway tissue than healthy donors. With lung doctors predicting higher rates of respiratory diseases thanks to global climate change and widespread allergies, Ben-Sharar is hopeful that his team\u2019s findings bear therapeutic fruit.\n\nSource: Ben-Sharar, Y. et al.
