Getty Images\n\nFollowing his recent brush with death, Lamar Odom has received an outpouring of support from family, friends, and former teammates. But while his health is steadily improving, the basketball star isn\u2019t completely in the clear. The former NBA forward will likely have to undergo a kidney transplant, and surprisingly, many of his fans have expressed their intent to help.\n\nAccording to TMZ, super fans of Odom\u2019s are offering up their own kidneys in the event that he needs a transplant. In fact, some fans have been so generous that they\u2019ve sent their blood type and contact information to Khloe Kardashian, Odom\u2019s wife, via social media. One Twitter user, for example, wrote, \u201cIf Lamar needs a kidney I will be the first to step up and donate one of mine! That is a promise. Lamar deserves a 2nd chance.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 13, Odom was found unresponsive at a Las Vegas brothel where he allegedly engaged in a five-day sex and drug binge. Among the drugs he reportedly took: \u201cherbal Viagra\u201d and cocaine. He subsequently suffered an ischemic stroke due to a drug-induced blood clot, which blocked blood flow to his brain. To prevent any further harm, Odom was placed in a medically induced coma and put through dialysis.\n\nThe LA Daily News reported that Odom is currently dialysis for about six to seven hours a day at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Dialysis is a procedure that helps patients with failing kidneys remove waste, retain needed chemicals in the blood, and control blood pressure. In light of his condition, he\u2019s expected to undergo months of dialysis and physical therapy.\n\nOdom\u2019s toxicity report is currently under investigation, as blood samples obtained through a warrant are still pending. The brothel, however, alleges that employees saw him drink alcohol and take herbal Viagra supplements that go by the brand name Reload. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning for Reload after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. Odom allegedly overdosed on cocaine as well, however, the brothel\u2019s owner Dennis Hof, as well as his employees, claim they didn\u2019t see him take any drugs.\n\nFortunately, Odom is reportedly making great strides with his vision and speech. \u201cHe is beginning to gradually flourish both mentally and physically,\" said Alvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer, in a statement. \"His use of speech has increased and he's more cognitively responsive.\" The statement also confirmed that Odom\u2019s therapy regimen is \u201caggressive,\u201d but did not elaborate any more.\n\nAuthorities have not ruled out the possibility of taking action against the brothel or Odom.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fans offer lamar odom their kidneys", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fans have come to Lamar Odom's aid as he faces the possibility of needing a kidney transplant.", "title": "Lamar Odom's Fans Are Lining Up To Offer Him Their Kidneys", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lamar-odom-might-need-kidney-transplant-all-his-fans-are-offering-their-own-358760", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/23/lamar-odom-signs-autographs-fans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fans have come to Lamar Odom's aid as he faces the possibility of needing a kidney transplant.", "title": "Lamar Odom's Fans Are Lining Up To Offer Him Their Kidneys", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lamar-odom-might-need-kidney-transplant-all-his-fans-are-offering-their-own-358760", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/23/lamar-odom-signs-autographs-fans.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/23/lamar-odom-signs-autographs-fans.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-23T16:44:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-23T16:44:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Fans have come to Lamar Odom's aid as he faces the possibility of needing a kidney transplant."}, "article_summary": "Some of Lamar Odom's fans have gone as far as offering their kidneys, via social media, if the NBA star has to undergo a kidney transplant.\nGetty ImagesFollowing his recent brush with death, Lamar Odom has received an outpouring of support from family, friends, and former teammates.\nThe former NBA forward will likely have to undergo a kidney transplant, and surprisingly, many of his fans have expressed their intent to help.\nAccording to TMZ, super fans of Odom\u2019s are offering up their own kidneys in the event that he needs a transplant.\nOne Twitter user, for example, wrote, \u201cIf Lamar needs a kidney I will be the first to step up and donate one of mine!"}
