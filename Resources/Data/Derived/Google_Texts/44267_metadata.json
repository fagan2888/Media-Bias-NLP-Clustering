This success shows just how The Walt Disney Company continues to drive the Broadway musical business.\n\n\u201cDisney has had a major influence on the success of Broadway over the past two decades,\u201d said Ken Davenport, a Broadway producer and author of the blog theproducersperspective.com.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Top-Grossing Broadway Musicals of All Time\n\nIt all started with the movie Beauty and the Beast, Davenport explained, which Disney created as a new classic musical for parents to watch with their children \u2013 then extended the brand to the stage.\n\nDisney took over and restored the New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street in 1993, contributing to a major clean-up of Times Square under New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.

Beauty and the Beast has played to more than 35 million people in 13 countries; for many of the top musicals, Broadway represents only a fraction of worldwide sales. For instance, The Lion King\u2019s Broadway box office of $1.09 billion as of mid-September, according to BroadwayWorld.com, is less than 18 percent of its worldwide gross.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera, the second highest grossing musical ever (and a non-Disney production, of course) had similar earnings.\n\nClick here to see the 10 Top-Grossing Broadway Musicals.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Lion King has become the highest grossing musical of all time with more than $6.2 billion earned globally \u2013 showing just how The Walt Disney Company continues to drive the business of musicals all over the world.", "title": "The 10 Top-Grossing Broadway Musicals", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/24/10-Top-Grossing-Broadway-Musicals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Broadway_Musicals_The_Lion_King.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/24/10-Top-Grossing-Broadway-Musicals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Broadway_Musicals_The_Lion_King.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Lion King has become the highest grossing musical of all time with more than $6.2 billion earned globally \u2013 showing just how The Walt Disney Company continues to drive the business of musicals all over the world.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccce4\"", "article_summary": "Click here to see the 10 Top-Grossing Broadway Musicals.\nThis success shows just how The Walt Disney Company continues to drive the Broadway musical business.\nThe Lion King has become the top-grossing musical of all time with more than $6.2 billion earned globally.\nSLIDESHOW: 10 Top-Grossing Broadway Musicals of All TimeIt all started with the movie Beauty and the Beast, Davenport explained, which Disney created as a new classic musical for parents to watch with their children \u2013 then extended the brand to the stage.\n\u201cDisney has had a major influence on the success of Broadway over the past two decades,\u201d said Ken Davenport, a Broadway producer and author of the blog theproducersperspective.com."}
