They were supposed to be small-scale single-payer systems that would be free from the profit motive; a progressive\u2019s dream solution to the problem of providing health insurance for all.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve turned into a nightmare. So far, 12 of the 23 co-ops have failed, defaulting on more than $1.2 billion in federal loans. Only two have been able to break even so far, and most of the remaining co-ops are eyeing massive premium increases \u2013 as high as 40 percent in some cases \u2013 to stay solvent.\n\nA government program being poorly run is nothing new, of course. But the co-ops established under the health care law were subject to a series of regulations that make you wonder how they were ever supposed to succeed in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt should be no surprise that so many of them are going belly-up,\u201d said John Davidson, director of health policy for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on the latest edition of the Watchdog Podcast. \u201cThe rules that they put on these co-ops almost set them up to fail.\u201d\n\nFor starters, the co-ops were barred from hiring anyone who had served at an executive level at any health insurance company in the country.\n\nThink about that for a second. This was essentially a brand new business venture that was prevented from relying on the expertise of anyone who might have the slightest idea what they were doing.\n\nAnother regulation prevented the co-ops from raising any capital aside from what was provided via those federal loans. Other rules prevented the co-ops from being allowed to turn a profit, and if one happened to accidentally make money anyway, it wasn\u2019t allowed to use its profits to help it grow.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of business plan that would be laughed out of a business school classroom.\n\n\u201cThe co-ops were essentially amateur exercises,\u201d said Davidson. \u201cRunning a health insurance company and keeping it actuarially sound is a difficult thing to do, under the best of circumstances.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Dark days for Obamacare as premiums rise, co-ops fail\n\nRepublicans are eager to make the failures of the co-ops look like a major disaster for Democrats who backed the overhaul and particularly for the progressives who pushed for the inclusion of the pseudo-single-payer-programs.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a political nightmare, but it\u2019s a real life nightmare too.\n\nSeveral hundred thousand people \u2013 more than 100,000 in New York alone, where the nation\u2019s largest co-op is now going under \u2013 stand to lose their health insurance as a result of the implosions. Even those who don\u2019t lose coverage altogether face the prospect of paying significantly higher premiums.\n\n\u201cThere were some hopes and pray\u00aders as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adated with the co-ops that were prob\u00adably un\u00adreal\u00adist\u00adic,\u201d Larry Levitt, a seni\u00ador vice pres\u00adid\u00adent at the Kais\u00ader Fam\u00adily Found\u00ada\u00adtion, told National Journal\u2019s Caitlin Owens last week. \u201cThe sup\u00adport for the co-ops was as much ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal as prag\u00admat\u00adic. The way they emerged was so bizarre.\u201d\n\nAs Owens\u2019 detailed piece goes on to explain, there is a long history behind the sudden failure of so many of the co-op programs.\n\nBut the rules and regulations written into the text of the law makes it hard to believe there was ever much of a chance for the co-ops to succeed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The rules and regulations written into the text of Obamacare makes it hard to believe there was ever much of a chance for the Co-Ops to succeed.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s co-ops were regulated to death before they were even born - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/shutterstock_145263814.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-24T09:16:09+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/248687/obamacare-co-ops-regulated-to-death/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Accountability", "published_time": "2015-11-24T05:00:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T09:16:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The rules and regulations written into the text of Obamacare makes it hard to believe there was ever much of a chance for the Co-Ops to succeed.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s co-ops were regulated to death before they were even born - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/shutterstock_145263814.jpg"}, "creator": "@ericboehm87", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The rules and regulations written into the text of Obamacare makes it hard to believe there was ever much of a chance for the Co-Ops to succeed."}, "article_summary": "They were supposed to be small-scale single-payer systems that would be free from the profit motive; a progressive\u2019s dream solution to the problem of providing health insurance for all.\nAnother regulation prevented the co-ops from raising any capital aside from what was provided via those federal loans.\nOther rules prevented the co-ops from being allowed to turn a profit, and if one happened to accidentally make money anyway, it wasn\u2019t allowed to use its profits to help it grow.\nSo far, 12 of the 23 co-ops have failed, defaulting on more than $1.2 billion in federal loans.\n\u201cThe rules that they put on these co-ops almost set them up to fail.\u201dFor starters, the co-ops were barred from hiring anyone who had served at an executive level at any health insurance company in the country."}
