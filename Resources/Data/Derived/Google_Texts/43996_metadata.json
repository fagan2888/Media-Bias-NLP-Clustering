In all, trained spotters reported six touchdowns during day.\n\nOne confirmed tornado touched down south of Roggen at 2:34 p.m. It shattered windows on a few buildings at a farm and damaged the roof of a storage shed, according to Sgt. Sean Stanbridge of the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nSome power lines were down and trees were uprooted in the area of Weld County roads 79 and 16, he said.\n\nAbout 40 minutes earlier, several people reported seeing a funnel cloud near Grover in northeast Weld County. The tornado, which didn\u2019t cause any damage, was on the ground for several minutes.\n\nSome flights were being diverted from Denver International Airport because of the weather, and the Colorado Department of Transportation reported on Twitter that U.S. 160 had been closed near Trinidad because of tornado-related damage to power lines.\n\nAt one time Friday afternoon, five warnings were in effect, from the far north to the far south of the state. Parts of 11 counties were under warnings at 3:15 p.m., but all of those warnings had expired by 4 p.m.\n\nA few more tornado warnings were issued later, including the areas near Kit Carson and Lamar, but no touchdowns were confirmed.\n\nAlso, a flash flood advisory was issued for the Black Forest burn area as 1 inch of rain fell in a short period.\n\nThe weekend weather looks much the same with afternoon storms and a 40 percent chance of precipitation Saturday in Denver and a 30 percent chance Sunday. High temperatures should be in the lower- to mid-70s.\n\nStorms with hail and damaging winds are possible through the weekend, especially late in the day.\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New tornado warnings for eastern Colorado; some damage reported near Roggen", "title": "New tornado warnings for eastern Colorado; some damage reported near Roggen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/06/new-tornado-warnings-for-eastern-colorado-some-damage-reported-near-roggen/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140606__CD05LIGHTNINGDSC_9563p1.jpg", "height": 589}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140606__CD05LIGHTNINGDSC_9563p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-06T08:42:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:25:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc72\"", "article_summary": "Some power lines were down and trees were uprooted in the area of Weld County roads 79 and 16, he said.\nAbout 40 minutes earlier, several people reported seeing a funnel cloud near Grover in northeast Weld County.\nTwo tornadoes touched down in Weld County on Friday afternoon as another round of stormy weather hit the state.\nSean Stanbridge of the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nThe weekend weather looks much the same with afternoon storms and a 40 percent chance of precipitation Saturday in Denver and a 30 percent chance Sunday."}
