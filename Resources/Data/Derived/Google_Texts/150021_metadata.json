Their journey across the prairies at night are most often driven by low level winds rich with higher humidity. These environments are often ripe to feed thunderstorms with a rich supply of ingredients needed to support rain at a time of year when many start looking for moisture during the hotter weeks of the summer.\n\nSo if nighttime thunderstorms with severe weather are forecast in your area, remember to turn on your weather radio before you go to bed. Most radios can be programmed for just your local county area, so you don't have to lose sleep over a storm that's not nearby.\n\nOf course not all thunderstorms at night produce severe weather, but when they do, they can be very powerful. Anyone who remembers the July 31st, 2008 Highway 12 windstorm east of Aberdeen will tell you overnight storms can be dangerous. It's why we monitor the weather 24-7 to keep you ahead of the next round of storms.\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
