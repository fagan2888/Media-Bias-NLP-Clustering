Members of the National Center\u2019s Project 21 black leadership network, once again, are not surprised.\n\nThis time, Quanell X, the leader of the New Black Panther Party in Houston, Texas, underwent police training simulations with the Missouri City Police Department. He was run through a series of live and video simulations that are based on real-life situations faced by officers. He was armed with a fake gun and Taser.\n\nThe results \u2014 filmed by KHOU-TV \u2014 were eye-opening.\n\nFacing a man holding a baby who rushed at him with a knife, Quanell X used his Taser. But he admitted that, at the time he chose to use force, he was not clear of the threat posed to him:\n\nTo be honest with you, I never saw the knife. But I saw him come out of his pocket with something like [a weapon]. If he would have pulled a lollipop out of his pocket, the same way he just did, I still would have used force to stop him. And then somebody could have said, \u201cAll he had was a lollipop.\u201d But you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s happening so fast like that.\n\nHe also admitted \u201cI can easily see me pulling my gun on a simple call\u201d in a high crime area. In other simulations, Quanell X\u2019s slow reactions to danger lead to him being \u201cshot\u201d by assailants. In training, he was shocked at the number of times he fired while under stress.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that Quanell X gained a new appreciation, and perhaps will be less critical, of law enforcement. On the training ground, his advice to the people he has marched with against the police in the past was:\n\nPlease, brothers and sisters, if [police] tell you to do something \u2014 do it. When the suspect started being combative or argumentative, I\u2019m gonna pull my gun.\n\nProject 21 members active in both law enforcement and community policing see this sort of thing as a positive move toward healing the rift between police and black communities, which deepen after accusations are made by those lacking a full knowledge of what it is like for officers forced to make quick decisions involving deadly force.\n\nProject 21 member Carl Pittman, a 20-year veteran of law enforcement (including in the Houston metropolitan area) and a retired member of the U.S. Marine Corps, said:\n\nThe phrase \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words\u201d has never been more fitting. The call by Houston area black activist Quanell X for those asked by the police to comply is long overdue. Incidents involving Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York might never have happened had they complied with officer instructions. The facts must control the outcome of these investigations, not fear. These incidents are directly related to conduct, not color!\n\nAdditionally, Project 21 member Nadra Enzi, a community policing activist in New Orleans, said:\n\nIt\u2019s too easy to demonize police officers who are often white and deify black predators from afar. Actually placing oneself in an officer\u2019s shoes takes a lot more character and competence than hoodie marches or chanting \u201cHands up! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d Safety is the 21st century\u2019s civil rights movement. Hopefully, Mr. X will upgrade his advocacy accordingly.\n\nQuanell X\u2019s experience and apparent epiphany in Houston is similar to what happened to Reverend Jarrett Maupin in Phoenix. That community activist also seemed to gain a newfound respect for law enforcement and understood the need to comply with their instructions after going through his own use-of-force simulations. Project 21 members also commented Reverend Maupin\u2019s revelation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/P21NadraEnzi.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1423253814865", "description": "Another community activist and vocal critic of the police has gained a new perspective on polic...", "title": "Behind the Gun, Another Community Activist Gains Clarity regarding Police\u00a0Procedures - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40ae\"", "article_summary": "Facing a man holding a baby who rushed at him with a knife, Quanell X used his Taser.\nThe call by Houston area black activist Quanell X for those asked by the police to comply is long overdue.\nMembers of the National Center\u2019s Project 21 black leadership network, once again, are not surprised.\nIn the end, it seemed that Quanell X gained a new appreciation, and perhaps will be less critical, of law enforcement.\nIn other simulations, Quanell X\u2019s slow reactions to danger lead to him being \u201cshot\u201d by assailants."}
