HOLLAND, MI - The 1,000th baby recently was admitted to Holland Hospital's special care nursery, which provides care for pre-term babies.

The nursery, which opened in 2007, has eight high-tech infant beds designed for premature babies. For families, the nursery has a private lounge, kitchenette, bathroom, lockers and breast-feeding support.

"We are thankful to be able to provide this kind of high-level acute care in our community, keeping so many newborns and their families together close to home," said Carol Veldkamp, the nurse clinical manager of the Boven Birth Center.

More than 1,800 babies are born each year at the hospital's birth center. About 8 percent are premature or have other conditions that require admission to the special care nursery, the hospital says.
