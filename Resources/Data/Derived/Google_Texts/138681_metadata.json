(AP) - For a lot of people, camping is off limits. Tents and gear are expensive, and then there\u2019s the thought of sleeping outside on the ground.\n\nA group formed by the state to help revamp California\u2019s 280 state parks wants to open up their natural beauty to a wider array of people than typical campers.\n\nParks Forward envisions putting in simple - yet eye-catching - cabins that sleep four or more on some of the 15,000 camping spaces at parks throughout the state. The idea is that people who have never camped will suddenly find it alluring.\n\n\u201cThis is one step above sleeping on the ground,\u201d said Lance Conn, co-chair of Parks Forward. \u201cIt\u2019s rustic. It\u2019s got a door. It\u2019s clean and comfortable, but not the Four Seasons.\u201d\n\nParks Forward was created in the fallout of a 2012 scandal that bruised the reputation of the California Department of Parks and Recreation when $54 million was found hidden in secret accounts while budget cuts were threatening to close 70 state parks.\n\nThe independent commission was asked to find ways of modernizing the parks, an entryway to California\u2019s stunning coastline, towering redwoods and historic Gold Rush sites.\n\nThe group will present its blueprint to lawmakers later this year for keeping state parks relevant for generations. That includes a new twist on the age-old concept of cabins.\n\nFor the designs, Conn turned to a class of architecture students at Cal Poly Pomona. They came up with four, including one that looks like a curvy and colorful surfer\u2019s hut and another that\u2019s woodsy and wedge-shaped. Each is bare-bones with no plumbing or electricity.\n\nJuintow Lin, an architecture professor who led the graduate course, said her students designed them to be small, affordable and movable.\n\nLin said another goal is for visitors to feel an urge to take selfies in front of their cabin and post them on Facebook, saying, \u201cHey, look at where I stayed!\u201d\n\nSo far, one cabin has been built - a model called The Wedge - and displayed at the California State Fair. The Los Angeles County Fair is its next stop.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when mass production begins, Conn said. He envisions finding private lenders to kick-start the project with $10 million to build and install the first 500 cabins, each costing up to $20,000. He sees campers paying $50 to $75 a night, which he says will pay off the loan and put no burden on the state.\n\nConn said he hopes officials will embrace the concept that promises to draw more visitors.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re designed to be turn-key,\u201d he said, adding that the state won\u2019t have to take the financial risk, allowing parks officials to do what they do best to ensure the mission is respected.\n\nState officials recognized the need to attract a more diverse crowd. A 2011 study found that most people camping at the parks are white and 35 to 54 years old.\n\nToday, the park system offers 171 cabins, tent-cabins, yurts, cottages and even some floating campsites in Lake Oroville.\n\nVicky Waters, a spokeswoman for the department, said officials are waiting for lawmakers to see Parks Forward\u2019s recommendations before taking action. Waters added that the department shares the desire to expand camping choices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much open to opportunities for improving the parks system,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d\n\nThe cabins won approval from San Francisco architect Steve Chaitow, a principal at Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, a firm that designs homes, civic buildings and nature centers that strive to complement the surrounding landscape.\n\nContacted by The Associated Press, Chaitow said he appreciates how The Wedge is made of simple materials yet contains features found in refined homes he has designed. The cabin satisfies a basic human need to feel safe with solid walls on two sides yet allows outside views on both ends, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve done well with your architecture, you\u2019ve really connected with your place,\u201d Chaitow said. \u201cYou\u2019ve created a place that draws an emotional response with people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For a lot of people, camping is off limits.
