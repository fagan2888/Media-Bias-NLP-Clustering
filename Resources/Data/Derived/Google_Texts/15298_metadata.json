Mark Leno aimed at raising the minimum wage passed the California Senate and is moving on to the Assembly.\n\nBut what does this have to do with health?\n\nA \u201cpowerful intervention\u201d for public health.\n\nGenerally, advocates of raising the minimum wage try to sway public opinion by using economic arguments. But there\u2019s an increasing move to tie health outcomes and health costs directly to the minimum wage, just as health advocates have long tied socioeconomic status generally to health status.\n\nA new study finds that raising the state minimum wage could prevent hundreds of premature deaths in California each year and save millions in health costs.\n\nHuman Impact Partners, or HIP, conducted a \u201crapid health analysis\u201d of Leno\u2019s proposed SB935, which would raise the current $8-an-hour minimum wage to $13 an hour by 2017.\n\nThey found that the higher wage would prevent the premature deaths of nearly 400 lower-income Californians per year.\n\n\u201cGiving working families a decent standard of living \u2026 is one of the most powerful interventions we can make for public health,\u201d says HIP co-director Jonathan Heller.\n\nRaising the Minimum Wage Can Also Raise Health Status \u2026\n\nHigher pay reduces people\u2019s risk of all kinds of health problems, ranging from obesity to depression to smoking.\n\nThe report also found that adults and families who live in poverty are more than twice as likely to face serious psychological distress than those families who make three times the poverty level.\n\nHeller says studies have tied the physical problems to the accumulated effects of chronic stress, less access to health care and the quality of neighborhoods in which people can afford to live.\n\nWhile HIP\u2019s study looked specifically at the impact of a minimum wage increase in California, other researchers have looked more broadly. Paul Leigh is a professor of economics at UC Davis Medical School. He and research partner DaeHwan Kim crunched numbers from a multistate health study that lasted from 1999-2007. In some of the states, the minimum wage went up during that time.\n\nIn one case, they looked at the effect of the wage increase on rates of high blood pressure. \u201cWe found a higher minimum wage was associated with fewer cases of hypertension, especially at lower income levels,\u201d Leigh said.\n\nThe researchers used the same data set to look at weight. \u201cWe found low-wage workers had higher rates of obesity, and when wages went up there was a reduction in prevalence of obesity,\u201d Leigh said.\n\n\u2026 Could Lead to Health Cost Savings\n\nLeigh says he would like to do research linking health care cost savings with raising the minimum wage.\n\nAccording to the Harvard School of Public Health, the United States spent $190 billion a year on obesity-related costs in 2005. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says smoking drains more than $289 billion a year from the economy in both medical care costs and lost productivity.\n\n\u201cObesity, hypertension, smoking are very costly for U.S. economy, so anything you can do to reduce them will have positive effect in reducing overall medical costs,\u201d said Leigh.\n\nThat would give advocates of raising the minimum wage a new tool for making their argument.\n\nRajiv Bhatia authored the study by Health Impact Partners, which looked at how SB935 could impact the health of California\u2019s low-income workers.\n\nHe says it\u2019s important to understand the nuanced way that wages affect health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018OK, I get more money in my pocket and my blood pressure changes and health improves,\u2019\u201d says Bhatia. \u201cIncome is working through many pathways. And not every pathway is working on every individual.\u201d\n\nStill, he says, people at the bottom 20 percent of income are four times as likely to rate their health as poor as those at the top. \u201cLow income is associated with exposures that cause diseases,\u201d says Bhatia. \u201cBut it also causes your disease outcomes to be worse.\u201d\n\nHe says there is a precedent for public health departments getting involved in a policy fight to raise the minimum wage. In Minnesota the commissioner of health publicly advocated for an increase, after a study there showed the health benefits of raising the state\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nBhatia says that, long term, he would like to create something like an online calculator, \u201cso somebody in any state could look at their state wage and plug in an alternative minimum wage. Then they would get as an output how would self-rated health improve, how would health insurance options change, how would education outcomes change.\u201d\n\nBhatia says that is in the works. In the meantime, he is hopeful that more people arguing for the minimum wage will take up the health mantle.\n\nHe says the current paradigm by many advocating for a minimum wage increase is that this is an economic trade-off issue, between what is right and fair versus something that is economically feasible.\n\nBut, he says, by putting it in a health frame, it humanizes and adds another dimension. Factoring in health improvements \u2014 and estimated health costs savings \u2014 is a dimension Bhatia hopes will resonate with the public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study finds raising minimum wage to $13/hour avoids 400 premature deaths annually, lowers other risks.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"How An Increase in Minimum Wage Can Improve Health\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/03\\/how-an-increase-in-minimum-wage-can-improve-health\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-03 12:48:33\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-05 09:50:10\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19337,\"author_id\":\"252\",\"author_name\":\"Rachel Dornhelm\",\"author_display_name\":\"Rachel Dornhelm\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/10\\/56292361-e1382588779517.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Study finds raising minimum wage to $13/hour avoids 400 premature deaths annually, lowers other risks.", "title": "How An Increase in Minimum Wage Can Improve Health", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/03/how-an-increase-in-minimum-wage-can-improve-health/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/10/56292361-e1382588779517.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But there\u2019s an increasing move to tie health outcomes and health costs directly to the minimum wage, just as health advocates have long tied socioeconomic status generally to health status.\nHow An Increase in Minimum Wage Can Improve HealthA bill by state Sen.
