A mostly sunny Saturday in Denver with cool temperatures could turn into a slight chance of snow on Sunday.

The metro area should see a high of 38 degrees with south southwest winds gusting around 5 to 7 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Temperatures should dip into the low 20s Saturday night as clouds roll in, the weather service said.

By Sunday morning, Denver residents can expect a 10 percent chance of snow before 11 a.m. Skies are expected to clear up by the afternoon as temperatures warm to a high near 40 degrees, the weather service said.

Martin Luther King Day looks to be partly sunny with balmy temperatures in the 50s.
