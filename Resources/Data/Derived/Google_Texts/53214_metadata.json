It turns out the two don\u2019t have much to do with each other. This matters to you if you drink soda.\n\nCaramel color is the additive in many soft drinks and some foods that turns them brown. Some types of caramel color contain a chemical called 4-methylimidazole or 4-Mel, and 4-Mel is potentially carcinogenic. In 2011, the state of California added 4-mel to the so-called Prop. 65 list \u2014 a list of chemicals known by the state to cause cancer.\n\nConsumer Reports published an analysis of various brands of soda on Thursday. They found that two brands exceeded a level of 29 micrograms per can or bottle: Pepsi One and Malta Goya. Consumer Reports cites state data showing daily consumption above that amount would cause one excess case of cancer in every 100,000 people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why consumers should be exposed to an avoidable and unnecessary risk that can stem from coloring food brown,\u201d said Urvashi Rangan, PhD in the Consumer Reports story. He\u2019s a toxicologist and executive director of the magazine\u2019s Food Safety and Sustainability Center. \u201cManufacturers have lower 4-Mel alternatives available to them. Ideally there would be no 4-Mel in food.\u201d\n\nConsumer Reports conducted two rounds of testing of the sodas during 2013. Both times, samples of Pepsi One and Malta Goya exceeded 29 micrograms per can or bottle. But neither product had a cancer-risk warning label, as required by Prop. 65.\n\nConsumer Reports contacted both Pepsi and Malta Goya. Only Pepsi responded. From Consumer Reports:\n\nAfter we informed PepsiCo of our test results, the company issued a statement that said that Proposition 65 is based on per day exposure and not exposure per can. It also cited government consumption data that shows that the average amount of diet soda consumed by people who drink it is 100 milliliters per day, or less than a third of a 12-ounce can. For that reason, they believe that Pepsi One does not require cancer-risk warning labels\u2014even if the amount of 4-MeI in a single can exceeds 29 micrograms. Consumer Reports says there is analysis of government data that shows higher levels of daily consumption of soft drinks generally. \u201cNo matter how much consumers drink they don\u2019t expect their beverages to have a potential carcinogen in them. And we don\u2019t think 4-MeI should be in foods at all. Our tests of Coke samples show that it is possible to get to much lower levels,\u201d says Rangan.\n\nConsumer Reports says that because of its results, Consumers Union, the policy wing of Consumer Reports, is contacting the California Attorney General\u2019s office and is also petitioning the Food and Drug Administration \u201cto set a federal standard for 4-Mel and to require manufacturers to list the type of caramel color they use on the products\u2019 ingredient lists.\u201d While there are four types of caramel coloring, only two of them contain 4-Mel.\n\nConsumer Reports also found that three brands \u2014 Coke, Diet Coke, and Coke Zero \u2014 had less than 5 micrograms per can in its tests, which, the report noted, its \u201cexperts believe is more acceptable.\u201d Consumer Reports said it used Sprite as a control. It\u2019s a clear soda and showed no significant levels of 4-Mel, the group found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's caramel, and then there's caramel color.
