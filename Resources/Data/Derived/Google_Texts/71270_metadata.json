Bill Holtzclaw (R-Madison), Nobel Prize in Literature winner Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d is inappropriate for the public school setting, as the 1970 novel, which illustrates the life of a young Black girl who grows up longing to be White, has a storyline that exposes the reality of incest, rape and molestation.\n\nReferring to the book as a piece of child pornography, Holtzclaw has called for its banishment from the public school system and its removal from the national Common Core suggested reading list.\n\n\u201cThe book is just completely objectionable, from language to the content,\u201d Holtzclaw told the Alabama Media Group.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe book is being criticized among conservative commentators and politicians for its perceived graphic content, including scenes of rape, pedophilia and incest.\n\nHoltzclaw defends his decision regarding Morrison\u2019s book as one rooted in the belief that Alabama School Districts should have local control \u2014 and if those in that area don\u2019t feel comfortable with a certain piece of literature, they should have the authority to ban it.\n\n\u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d is in the Core\u2019s reading curriculum for eleventh-graders.\n\nHoltzclaw\u2019s statements came after he was attacked by fellow GOP members for failing to align with them on a repeal of Common Core standards, which were adopted in Alabama in November 2010. More than 40 states throughout the U.S. are a part of the Core system, criticized by conservatives for suggesting literature that doesn\u2019t hold up to their moral code \u2014 which excludes discussion of rape.\n\nThe Common Core \u2018Bogeyman\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the federal government telling us when and what to teach our children, and I don\u2019t want the Alabama legislature doing it either,\u201d Holtzclaw wrote in a recent blog post.\n\nCommon Core isn\u2019t wildly popular among Holtzclaw\u2019s constituents, who have warned that it will take local control away and leave Alabama school districts to fall victim to a perceived liberalization of America\u2019s education system. Holtzclaw has elsewhere defended Common Core, although his recent call to ban \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d is inching him closer to those who are painting the system as the \u201cBogeyman\u201d of the national education program.\n\n\u201cThe day may come when the Common Core Standards become the Bogeyman some fear. If so, we will raise the blinds and allow the light of day \u2014 through Alabama maintaining control over our education standards \u2014 to cast the shadows of mystery that is the Common Core Bogeyman,\u201d Holtzclaw wrote. \u201cState and local control will ensure Alabama\u2019s children are taught high standards for a globally competitive, college and career ready workforce encompassing the conservative values we demand.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Holtzclaw has read the book, but it is clear that his objections stem from scenes in which Morrison describes the agonies of a Black child growing up in Ohio.\n\nWhile not an autobiographical account, Morrison, who grew up in Ohio, wrote the 1970 novel as a reflection of the times, highlighting the feelings of young girls and the unfortunate life struggles so many faced.\n\nThough the novel is seen by many educators as a valuable piece of literature for students seeking to understand the racial climate 1970s America, Holtzclaw claims it perpetuates an emphasis on sexuality in the public school setting.\n\nConservative mothers rallying against literature option\n\nHoltzclaw isn\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cThis newest controversy is only the latest example of how Common Core takes decisions from Alabama and puts it in the hands of entities outside of Alabama,\u201d Alabama Federation of Republican Women President Elois Zeanah said in a press release. \u201cBooks on the approved Common Core list end-run the public process. Parents, school officials and legislators have no say in what goes on that list, which becomes part of the Alabama curriculum.\u201d\n\nWhile no one is forcing Alabama eleventh graders to read \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d the federal Department of Education encourages it, and that goes too far for conservative organizations.\n\n\u201cWhile the Alabama course of study does not list recommended books, the course of study does link to the national list recommended by Common Core,\u201d Zeanah said. \u201cFurther, the State Department of Education\u2019s own website contains a statement that highly encourages schools to teach the selections listed by Common Core.\u201d\n\nOthers claim that a ban on the book isn\u2019t what they\u2019re after \u2014 they just want it removed from even being an option.\n\n\u201cThe parents who are actively petitioning the school board to have it removed from the classroom do not want a complete ban on the book nor its removal from the school; rather they would like it to be removed from the approved reading list in the classroom, where students spending three to four weeks reading and discussing, in depth, the developmentally inappropriate material,\u201d Politichicks author Macey France wrote in a recent article.\n\nFrance, co-founder of the Stop Common Core in Oregon movement, refers to the book as \u201cCommon Core-approved child pornography,\u201d rallying behind those who claim it has no place in the classroom.\n\n\u201cChildren are simply not mature enough to process the violent, incestuous sex scenes in the book,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd yes, high school kids are still considered children! They are minors. They are not adults, and they are not in college. We need to use some common sense when choosing texts to be studied in the classroom. Children\u2019s developing brains do not need to be assaulted with this notion of sexual violence. Educators are supposed to protect children from violence.\u201d\n\nCommon Core is supported by dozens of educational organizations throughout the nation, including the American Council on Education, the Coalition for a College and Career Ready America and the American Federation of Teachers. The standards are an attempt to create an aligned learning system in the American education system \u2014 one that provides teachers throughout the country with the same tools and methods for academic achievement. Its aim is to raise the bar for all schools throughout the nation, while assuring that the quality of schools remains consistent.\n\nShould literature be censored?\n\nThe call to rid American classrooms and libraries of \u201cThe Bluest Eyes\u201d isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. An entire exhibit created by the U.S. Library of Congress is devoted to books that have been banned throughout U.S. history \u2014 and the influence they had on society.\n\nThe exhibit, titled Books that Shaped America, details the stories behind once-banned books now recognized as gems of American literature.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d was among those once banned in the U.S. Now considered a classic and a high school educational tool in many schools throughout the nation, it still runs up again criticism from conservative circles, who claim it is too sexual in nature, as it contains one vaguely described sex scene. Notably, it came under fire in 1987 from a Charleston, S.C. Baptist school because of \u201clanguage and sexual references,\u201d according to the American Library Association.\n\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d was another classic challenged by public schools and libraries, as it was considered sexually explicit and pro-communist, according to the ALA.\n\nWhile no one went so far as to describe those books as act of pornography, the new argument against \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d does just that.\n\nSome progressives are calling out the novel\u2019s critics, claiming the efforts to label the book as child pornography more has to do with the concerted effort among conservatives to march against anything related to federal government initiatives.\n\n\u201cFirst, calling \u2018The Bluest Eye\u2019 child pornography is a troubling thing to do because it\u2019s not true,\u201d writes Alyssa Rosenberg with ThinkProgress. \u201cIt\u2019s grotesque to accuse Morrison of producing child pornography when she\u2019s doing anything but, and it suggests the weakness of the actual case against \u2018The Bluest Eye\u2019 that the novel\u2019s detractors have to reach for this kind of hyperbole.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Alabama congressman calls the Common Core novel \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d exactly that: \"child pornography.\", Alabama, banned books, Censorship, child pornography, Common Core, Toni Morrison,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Trisha Marczak", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "An Alabama congressman calls the Common Core novel \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d exactly that: \"child pornography.\", Alabama, banned books, Censorship, child pornography, Common Core, Toni Morrison,", "title": "Toni Morrison, Child Pornographer?", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/toni-morrison-the-bluest-eye-child-pornography/168515/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/090613_book_16x9-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-10T09:32:06-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Alabama congressman calls the Common Core novel \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d exactly that: \"child pornography.\", Alabama, banned books, Censorship, child pornography, Common Core, Toni Morrison,", "title": "Toni Morrison, Child Pornographer?", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/090613_book_4x3.jpg", "creator": "@TrishaMarczakMP", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Toni Morrison", "published_time": "2013-09-07T04:59:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T09:32:06-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddab4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFirst, calling \u2018The Bluest Eye\u2019 child pornography is a troubling thing to do because it\u2019s not true,\u201d writes Alyssa Rosenberg with ThinkProgress.\nToni Morrison, Child Pornographer?\nAn Alabama congressman calls the Common Core novel \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d exactly that: \"child pornography.\"\nWhile no one went so far as to describe those books as act of pornography, the new argument against \u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d does just that.\n\u201cThe Bluest Eye\u201d is in the Core\u2019s reading curriculum for eleventh-graders."}
