Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay told TV channel America that consumer prices in Argentina increased close to 30 percent last year.

"We begin the year with an inflation rate close to 30 percent, which is where we closed 2015, and target a rate of 20 or 25 percent in 2016," Prat-Gay said in the interview posted on his official Facebook page on Monday.
