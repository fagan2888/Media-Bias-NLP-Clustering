And I have not,\u201d he told GQ magazine for its upcoming \u201cMen of the Year\u201d issue.\n\nObama signed his signature health care legislation into law in March 2010, but rumors have circulated on several occasions since then that he had taken up smoking again.\n\nThe most recent speculation arose in June, when a photo taken during the G7 Summit in Germany appeared to show the President clutching a small rectangular item that closely resembled a box of cigarettes.\n\nThe White House denied that the item was a pack of smokes.\n\nIn his wide-ranging GQ interview, conducted by HBO\u2019s Bill Simmons, Obama also mused on his favorite characters in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d what he may do after he leaves the White House and what running against Donald Trump may have been like.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump. That would\u2019ve been fun,\u201d Obama, whose time in office is capped at two terms, said.\n\nObama also professed his \u201clove\u201d for the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but admitted that his \u201cproblem\u201d with the show was that he doesn\u2019t \u201cremember the names of any of the characters.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy favorite character is probably \u2026 the dwarf, what\u2019s his name,\u201d Obama, said referring to Tyrion Lannister, a character in the show played by actor Peter Dinklage.\n\nWhen Obama was asked to compare Trump to a character from the show, he declined to respond.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026I don\u2019t think any of them rise to that level,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen it came to the worst day of his presidency, Obama didn\u2019t hesitate to describe his feelings during the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\n\u201cBefore the second inauguration has even happened, Sandy Hook happens. Which remains, by the way, the worst few days of my presidency. I went up and visited with those families and \u2014 you know, Bill, you\u2019ve still got small kids. These are 6-year-olds, right? And you have 20 of them who\u2019ve been massacred,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cRight away, our focus had to shift to \u2018is there a way for us to capture this moment to see if we can get over this incredible hump to try to put in place some common-sense gun-safety rules?\u2019 And we knew it was a stretch, just because of the politics of Congress and the NRA. But we had to try.\u201d\n\nCapping the interview on a lighter note, Simmons asked Obama whether he would be interested in being named a Supreme Court justice after his presidency.\n\nObama paused while answering, prompting Simmons to jump in and press him for his true feelings.\n\n\u201cNo, well, the reason I paused for a second was just to make sure that I let people know that I think good judges are really important, and Supreme Court justices, obviously, are hugely important,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the temperament to sit in relative solitude and just opine and write from the bench. I want to be in the action a little bit more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ADAM EDELMAN", "twitter": {"description": "He may be a lightning rod for criticism, but President Obama maintains he won\u2019t be lighting up any time soon.", "title": "Obama says he hasn't smoked since Obamacare passed", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-campaigning-trump-fun-article-1.2437843", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2437842.1447784392!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/president18n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "barack obama, gq, donald trump, barack obama on GQ, barack obama interviews,", "parsely-author": "Adam Edelman", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "barack obama, gq, donald trump, barack obama on GQ, barack obama interviews,", "nydn_tags": "barack obama, donald trump, 2016 election, game of thrones, newtown shooting, obamacare", "news_keywords": "barack obama, gq, donald trump, barack obama on GQ, barack obama interviews,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-campaigning-trump-fun-article-1.2437843", "parsely-title": "Obama says he hasn't smoked since Obamacare passed", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-17T13:22:26-0500", "sailthru.title": "Obama says he hasn't smoked since Obamacare passed", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-17T18:22:26", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2437842.1447784392!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/president18n-1-web.jpg", "description": "He may be a lightning rod for criticism, but President Obama maintains he won\u2019t be lighting up any time soon.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "He may be a lightning rod for criticism, but President Obama maintains he won\u2019t be lighting up any time soon.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "He may be a lightning rod for criticism, but President Obama maintains he won\u2019t be lighting up any time soon.", "title": "Obama says he hasn't smoked since Obamacare passed", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-campaigning-trump-fun-article-1.2437843", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2437842.1447784392!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/president18n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "barack obama, donald trump, 2016 election, game of thrones, newtown shooting, obamacare", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2437842.1447784392!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/president18n-1-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "ADAM EDELMAN", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "He may be a lightning rod for criticism, but President Obama maintains he won\u2019t be lighting up any time soon.\nWhen Obama was asked to compare Trump to a character from the show, he declined to respond.\nThat would\u2019ve been fun,\u201d Obama, whose time in office is capped at two terms, said.\nObama paused while answering, prompting Simmons to jump in and press him for his true feelings.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026I don\u2019t think any of them rise to that level,\u201d he said."}
