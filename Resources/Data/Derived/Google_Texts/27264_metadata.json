The idea was to make dances around other works of art. As the \"camera obscura\" was used by artists in history to paint two-dimensional pictures from three-dimensional scenes, I wanted to kind of avert that and do the opposite: \"illuminate\" two-dimensional images in three dimensions.\n\nOriginally there were five dances and they span from a piece inspired by Caravaggio, to Degas, Schiele and someone more contemporary, like John Currin. And wherever we've performed the piece, I've been commissioned to add a specific piece based on something in a local collection. I was at the Ringling two years ago and saw the (John Turrell) Skyspace and suggested I would be interested in doing something inspired by that. So that will be the new piece on the program.\n\nQ: What can you tell us about it?\n\nA: All the other paintings I've used as inspiration are very character-driven. Not necessarily a story, but a story I see in the painting. But this piece is so contemporary and it's not a painting, but more of a light installation and exploration of space. So I wanted to go in an abstract direction. For me, the biggest inspiration was the rectangular shape of the room and the conversation with the sky and our changing perception of it. So it's very abstract and the inspiration is the rectangle.\n\nQ: How do the pieces differ, and is there music for each one?\n\nA:I'm bringing eight dancers and there are four males and four females, and there are different combinations in each piece, solos and duets. All the artwork spans four centuries and the music does, too, from Baroque to contemporary. For the new piece, I'm still working on the score. It's more ambient, I didn't want it to be a \"composed\" composed piece. It's more like sounds.\n\nQ: What is your training background and do you dance anymore?\n\nA: My early training was in the Czech Republic; I was a professional ballroom dancer. I didn't like the competitiveness of it, I didn't like always being judged and I didn't like the politics. Dancing to win a trophy seemed very strange to me. I came to the U.S. in 1992 to study English and ended up at Bard College where I went to study biology. But at the same time I took flamenco, ballet, (Merce) Cunningham,(Jose) Limon. Right out of college I went to Cunningham, became an understudy and started doing other projects in New York. I was with Lucinda Childs, then in the Netherlands for a year then came back to the U.S. and started my own company in 2003.\n\nI rarely perform now. I still do cameo appearances, but in 2011 I decided it was time for the youth to take over. (Tynek is 41.) It was a good decision and not a difficult transition. It's exciting to translate material I've made on myself to other bodies and to see what they can do with it. I can be in the audience and watch what we've created and while that's stressful because you fee you don't have any control, letting go is a good thing.\n\nQ: Are you looking forward to your trip to Florida?\n\nA: Sarasota is such a cultured city with a real audience for the arts. I've been three or four times and I love it. And it's perfect timing. Last winter was so insanely terrible and everyone said, 'Oh, it will never be this bad again.' But I'd have to say, this year has been pretty much the same. It will be a welcome escape and the dancers are so excited. We all need to warm up a little bit.\n\nDANCE PREVIEW\n\nDUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATRE: CAMERA ILLUMINATA, part of the Ringling Museum's New Stages series. 7:30 p.m. March 6 and 7.
