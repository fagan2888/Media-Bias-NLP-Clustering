As a result, medical groups and health plans have an ever-more pressing need to predict the costs of care.\n\nSan Mateo, Calif.-based Apixio wants to fill that need by crunching a lot of existing clinical data, providing healthcare organizations with the intel they need to accurately estimate patient risk. That enables providers to more accurately (and profitably) bill for their services.\n\nApixio says it uses natural language processing and machine learning to make sense of a mountain of unstructured data.\n\nBain Capital Ventures and a group of Silicon Valley angel investors are getting behind the concept by infusing Apixio with $13.5 million in new capital. The new capital brings Apixio\u2019s investment total up to $22.6 million.\n\n\u201cThe proceeds will be used to ramp up our sales and operations in support of the strong growth we are experiencing in our risk adjustment business,\u201d said Shawn Dastmalchi, CEO and co-founder of Apixio, in a statement. \u201cWe also intend to further develop our Big Data technology and to build on our vision to provide analytic solutions that power value-based care.\u201d\n\nApixio was founded in 2009 and raised $500,000 from undisclosed investors that year.\n\nGet more stories like this on Facebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-05-27T11:13:33+00:00", "author": "mark-sullivan", "modDate": "2014-05-27T11:13:33+00:00", "keywords": "affordable-care-act,apixio,bain-capital", "type": "news", "id": 1481042}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Medicare rolls are swelling and the Affordable Care Act is bringing\u00a0more people under the umbrella of insurance coverage.
