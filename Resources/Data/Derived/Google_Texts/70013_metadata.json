He was airlifted to Memorial Hospital in South Bend and had a two-month rehab stay in a nursing home. \"The bills that resulted were overwhelming, and the payments would have never been manageable for my fixed retirement income,\" he says.\n\nFortunately, a hospital program called CarePayment, which allowed Stoces to finance his payments, started at $54 a month. \"I was immediately relieved,\" he says. \"I had no options. For me, it was one of the greatest things that has happened. Now I can pay my bills off, and that's good for me and the hospital.\"\n\nOf course, financing is a temporary measure - you still have to pay the bills off, sooner or later, and health care bills can really mount later in life. According to Bankrate.com, high medical expenses are the biggest financial worry in for retirees like Stoces.\n\nThat's true even for people earning more than $75,000 a year, who are \"more concerned about high medical expenses than the overall population.\"\n\n\"Health care costs can be one of the most difficult, yet also most critical, expenses to project in retirement,\" says Joe Jennings, vice president ofin Baltimore. \"Not only do they have the potential to consume a disproportionate amount of a retiree's income, but they have also been rising at a rate much higher than inflation. Another concern is that while life expectancy for retirees continues to rise, many retirees fear they may live longer, but with a lower quality of life due to health-related issues.\"", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "Most Americans don't even have $1,000 set aside for future health care emergencies.", "author": "Brian O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Most Americans don't even have $1,000 set aside for future health care emergencies.", "title": "High Medical Expenses Haunt Retirees, But Insurance and Creativity Can Save the Day", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/high-medical-expenses-haunt-retirees-but-insurance-and-creativity-can-save-the-day", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/seniordoctor.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/seniordoctor.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "date": "2015-02-23T07:00Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "health care, health care costs, health care expenses, HSA's, long term care insurance, Health Savings Account, retiree health, retiree health plan, senior health, senior health plan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "senior health plan", "published_time": "2015-02-23T07:00Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/459200"}, "guid": 13053237, "twitter": {"description": "Most Americans don't even have $1,000 set aside for future health care emergencies.", "title": "High Medical Expenses Haunt Retirees, But Insurance and Creativity Can Save the Day", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/high-medical-expenses-haunt-retirees-but-insurance-and-creativity-can-save-the-day", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/seniordoctor.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/seniordoctor.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health care, health care costs, health care expenses, HSA's, long term care insurance, Health Savings Account, retiree health, retiree health plan, senior health, senior health plan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd927\"", "article_summary": "That's true even for people earning more than $75,000 a year, who are \"more concerned about high medical expenses than the overall population.\"\nAccording to Bankrate.com, high medical expenses are the biggest financial worry in for retirees like Stoces.\nAnother concern is that while life expectancy for retirees continues to rise, many retirees fear they may live longer, but with a lower quality of life due to health-related issues.\"\n\"The bills that resulted were overwhelming, and the payments would have never been manageable for my fixed retirement income,\" he says.\nHe was airlifted to Memorial Hospital in South Bend and had a two-month rehab stay in a nursing home."}
