Try chewing on that while walking away. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve got to multitask,\u201d Moore says. \u201cYou\u2019re cutting into my film time.\u201d\n\nThis may be difficult to believe, but Moore, a fourth-year NFL safety who made two interceptions in the Broncos\u2019 season-opening win a week ago, may be just as life-possessed with football as Peyton Manning.\n\nYes, Manning was all but born into the NFL. Moore started running around a football field when he was a 4-year-old water boy for his older brother Shaft\u2019s Pop Warner team. The younger brother started putting on his own pads in his South Central Los Angeles Pop Warner League when he was 7.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just play the game. The hyperactive kid studied it.\n\n\u201cWhen Rahim was a little boy, 7 or 8 years old, he would sit with his coach and watch film for hours,\u201d said Moore\u2019s mom, Nowana.\n\nIn a hallway at Broncos headquarters, Moore is watching film now.\n\n\u201cYou want to see this play right here? This is a play they\u2019re good at,\u201d he says. \u201cAlex Smith is always making plays. You can never count him out.\u201d\n\nSmith, who quarterbacks the Chiefs, is executing one of coach Andy Reid\u2019s patented plays: the misdirection, play-action bootleg pass.\n\nKnow what film study does? It helps a safety break a half second quicker on a ball tipped in the air. When the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Andrew Luck forced a pass to tight end Dwayne Allen down the seam last Sunday, it wasn\u2019t the first time Moore saw that play.\n\nWhen cornerback Aqib Talib deflected the ball, Moore caught it just inches off the ground.\n\nLater, when a Luck pass clanked high off Coby Fleener\u2019s hands as the tight end was running a crossing route, Moore was in position \u2014 and had the athletic, change-of-direction quickness to shift from coming up on the tackle to making a lateral dive for the interception.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the right position and you\u2019re going hard, then good things happen,\u201d said Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it was. In both cases he was where he was supposed to be. He was breaking the way he was supposed to be breaking and aggressively going after the ball.\n\nBeing benched \u201cwas like retiring\u201d\n\nOn occasion, Moore has looked wistfully at the city he\u2019s played for going on four seasons. It\u2019s not like Denver is exempt from gang problems, but it\u2019s nothing like the dangerous neighborhood surrounding his Dorsey High School.\n\nMoore was never close to joining a gang, but he did have close friends who did.\n\n\u201cIf it got to the point where they were going to do something they weren\u2019t supposed to do, I was going to the grass,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gangs were street. Going to the grass was a metaphor for not hanging on the street. Going to the grass meant working out, doing homework, practicing, watching game film.\n\nGoing to the grass.\n\n\u201cIf I had a choice, I would love for my mom and my dad to both be married and live in Lone Tree, or Highlands Ranch, or live in Cherry Creek,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI would love that. But that\u2019s not the plan God had for me.\u201d\n\nSouth Central Los Angeles was what Nowana and her three children made of it. A single mother who worked 25 years in the banking business, Nowana would get up at 6 a.m., drop off Rasheed (Shaft), now 31; Rahim, 24; and DuRaisha (NaeNae), 19, who is in her second year at Arizona State; at school and then head to the bank.\n\n\u201cIt was tough sometimes,\u201d Nowana said. \u201cIt was also rewarding. They had birthday parties every year. We did family functions. I loved on them. I took them to school, we went to church, I whipped their butts, I raised them, I loved them. And you do it until they get of age and take the baton and move on to be productive in their own lives.\u201d\n\nAfter Moore led the nation with 10 interceptions as a sophomore at UCLA, he showed up the next year in New York for the 2011 NFL draft believing he would go in the first round. Instead he wasn\u2019t selected until the second day, in the second round.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut looking back, I\u2019m happy I went in the second round. I was disappointed because I felt like I did everything I could to be drafted at that level. But who cares? In the NFL, you either make plays or you don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter what round you are drafted or how much money you\u2019re making. Are you\u2019re making plays and are you helping your team win?\u201d\n\nHe started his first five games as a rookie, but the Broncos\u2019 coaching staff determined he wasn\u2019t ready and benched him, pretty much for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cIt was like retiring,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThey took the game away from me. Looking back, it was good for me. I disagreed with it. But at the same time, Coach (John) Fox said it would better me. It did.\u201d\n\nIt helped to have a sideline view of veterans Brian Dawkins and Champ Bailey. Moore also saw that the NFL game wasn\u2019t as difficult as he was making it out to be.\n\nDon\u2019t think, just play.\n\n\u201cLord, let me wake up from this\u201d\n\nHe played well in his second season of 2012 until the Flacco Fling in a second-round playoff game pointed the index finger of blame directly at Moore. The Ravens tied the score in the final seconds of regulation, then won the game in overtime.\n\nFunny thing happened after that Jacoby Jones touchdown catch for Baltimore, though. Before the angry mob could gather, Moore disarmed it by standing in front of his locker and taking full responsibility.\n\n\u201cHe was so remarkable,\u201d Nowana said. \u201cI know he set a tone and an example to many. He said, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s right there in front of everybody.\u2019 Why say something different? He said it, he owned up to it. He moved on. Of course he carried it for a while. But once he let it go, it was a brand new day.'\u201d\n\nThe next day, Moore headed off to Florida to begin his offseason training. He doesn\u2019t smoke, doesn\u2019t drink. In 2013, he was playing every snap at free safety for the Broncos when, in a home game against Kansas City \u2014 \u201cNovember 17,\u201d Mom said reflexively \u2014 Moore\u2019s leg was inexplicably going numb.\n\nFox, who was watching at home as he recuperated from heart surgery, may have been the first to realize something was amiss.\n\n\u201cThere was a run that broke out to the boundary,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAnd he ran after it, and I mean he had no juice. I was thinking, \u2018Something\u2019s wrong with him.\u2019 \u201c\n\nEarly the next morning, Moore underwent a life-threatening surgery to correct a circulation condition in his lower left leg called lateral compartment syndrome.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I told anybody else this, but when they gave me anesthesia, right before they gave that to me, I said, \u2018Lord, let me wake up from this,\u2019 \u201d Moore said. \u201cBecause they told me I could have passed, lost my leg. And as I was fading out, I was blinking, and I thought to myself, I hope this isn\u2019t the last time I have eyes open.\u201d\n\nHe woke up happy to be alive. But eventually came renewed disappointment: His season was finished. No playing in AFC championship victory. No playing in Super Bowl defeat.\n\nThe 2014 season opener last Sunday marked the Denver debuts of Talib, DeMarcus Ware, Emmanuel Sanders and T.J. Ward, reaffirmed the greatness of Manning and the unique talent of Julius Thomas.\n\nAnd two interceptions for Moore in his first game back.\n\nNow it\u2019s on to the second game. Moore is in a hallway, watching a safety\u2019s view shot of the Chiefs\u2019 Alex Smith faking the handoff left, rolling right and hitting a wide-open running back in the flat. Smith must have completed 50 such passes last year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s good. I like him,\u201d Moore says. \u201cHe\u2019s a good quarterback.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rahim Moore\u2019s studious approach to playing football began long before he joined Broncos", "title": "Rahim Moore\u2019s studious approach to playing football began long before he joined Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/13/rahim-moores-studious-approach-to-playing-football-began-long-before-he-joined-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__20140914_C1_SP14FBNBRONXp1-1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__20140914_C1_SP14FBNBRONXp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-13T18:12:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:43:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the right position and you\u2019re going hard, then good things happen,\u201d said Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what round you are drafted or how much money you\u2019re making.\nNow it\u2019s on to the second game.\nMoore also saw that the NFL game wasn\u2019t as difficult as he was making it out to be.\nGoing to the grass meant working out, doing homework, practicing, watching game film."}
