The latest Health Policy Brief from Health Affairs and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation examines the issue of mental health parity. The push to make coverage for mental health treatment equal to that of physical health has been on legislative to-do lists for some time, both in Congress and in state houses. This brief looks at the evolution of the Mental Health Parity Act, originally passed by Congress in 1996 as well as changes in mental health parity brought about by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Also posted today: an update to the last month’s brief on the transition to ICD-10. Congress recently passed legislation delaying the system’s implementation. Click here to learn what the delay means for providers and payers.

Health Policy Briefs are aimed at policy makers, congressional staffers, and others needing short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics. Sign up for an e-mail alert about upcoming briefs. The briefs are also available from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s website. Please feel free to forward the briefs to any of your colleagues who are tracking health issues.
