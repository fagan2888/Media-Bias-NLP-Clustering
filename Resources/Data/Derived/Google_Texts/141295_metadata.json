Tom Smart/EPA\n\nNot one to back down easily from controversial statements, the Republican presidential candidate continues to add to the list of people he condemns.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Donald Trump crossed the kind of line he did on Saturday, when he questioned the heroism of Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam War POW. The question now is whether Candidate Trump is immune from the laws of political gravity or soon will be isolated and regarded as an object of scorn or curiosity rather than of presidential seriousness.\n\nSince announcing his candidacy last month, Trump has enjoyed a swift rise, vaulting into the lead in some national and state polls in the crowded contest for the Republican nomination. His sharp attacks on illegal immigrants from Mexico and his flamboyant style struck a nerve with voters who are angry with Washington and with political double talk.\n\nTrump has dominated coverage of the race with nonstop interviews and over-the-top comments. He has proved to be a skilled showman \u2014 a talent honed on reality TV \u2014 who is able to command attention with his combative verbal style.\n\nBut there is more to becoming president than what Trump has displayed so far, and many Republicans said Sunday that they think his attack on McCain (R-Ariz.) marks a turning point for Trump the politician.\n\nFew would offer their views for the record, owing to their positions working for other candidates or a desire not to put themselves into direct conflict with Trump. One described Trump\u2019s attack on McCain as \u201clethal.\u201d Another said he expects \u201ca complete cratering\u201d of Trump\u2019s support. Still another predicted that Trump would become \u201ca niche candidate\u201d and a sideshow to the main event.\n\n1 of 12 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Cutting ties with Trump: Who has dumped him and why View Photos The Republican presidential hopeful has faced an avalanche of criticism over his characterization of illegal immigrants as \u201crapists,\u201d drug dealers and other criminals. Caption The GOP presidential hopeful has faced an avalanche of criticism over his characterization of illegal immigrants. Randal Pinkett, Tara Dowdell and Kwame Jackso Former \"Apprentice\" contestants Randal Pinkett, right, Tara Dowdell, center, and Kwame Jackson speak at a news conference in New York. The contestants claim that a great deal of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's conversation has been divisive and extremely dangerous for America. Pinkett, a business consultant who won the show\u2019s fourth season, said he is grateful for the opportunities that have come his way as a result of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d but added, \u201cbecause our allegiance to our country supersedes our relationship with Donald, we see today as an act of patriotism, not disloyalty.\u201d Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nBut others are less confident that Trump\u2019s candidacy will take a nose dive, highlighting the combination of hope, fear and uncertainty that has gripped the party since Trump decided to run.\n\nPhil Musser, a GOP strategist unaffiliated with a campaign, said anyone who claims to know what the next turn is for Trump is only guessing. \u201cThis guy has tapped into a very virulent strain of the anti-establishment wing of the Republican Party,\u201d he said, adding that he finds Trump\u2019s comments personally offensive. \u201cIf he\u2019s got a message that works for 15 percent of the people in the first five states,\u201d Musser said, \u201che\u2019s a factor, and he\u2019s a factor with delegates.\u201d\n\n[Trump condemned for attacks on McCain]\n\nTrump has benefited from being cast as a not-quite-serious presidential candidate, which has allowed him to carry on as he has. His Republican rivals have been tentative in attacking him for describing illegal immigrants from Mexico as \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers, hoping he will collapse under his own weight and not wanting to get into a head-to-head scrap. The media, for all the coverage and often critical commentary given to Trump, have not subjected him to the kind of scrutiny that often goes with being atop the polls.\n\nBut every candidate who becomes a serious contender for the presidency eventually has to cross a threshold of acceptability with the voters. That is measured not only in where candidates stand on issues or how authentic they seem, but whether voters conclude they have the temperament, character and judgment to sit in the Oval Office.\n\nThat day of reckoning was always coming for Trump if he remained in the thick of the nomination contest, but his remarks on Saturday may have accelerated it. \u201cThe fact that he has no filter is what some voters find appealing, but it\u2019s that lack of a filter that could doom his presidential campaign,\u201d said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, who is working for the super PAC affiliated with former Florida governor Jeb Bush but offered his comments only on behalf of himself.\n\nTrump\u2019s candidacy for the GOP nomination is a knot of contradictions. He disparages the Affordable Care Act but has called for a universal national health-care program. He calls himself pro-life after earlier saying he was pro-choice. He wants to expand Social Security benefits. He has repeatedly mocked his opponents in the most personal ways. Could someone like that unite the Republican Party or the country?\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump refuses to apologize for saying that Sen.John McCain is \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d (Reuters)\n\nSuch questions have been avoided, along with those of temperament and judgment. What happened Saturday could give license to his rivals and his critics to subject his candidacy \u2014 what he says and how he says it, where he stands vs. where he once stood \u2014 to the kind of scrutiny he has largely escaped.\n\nTrump gave no indication Sunday that he had been chastened by the latest controversy or that he was ready to tone it down, as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus asked him to do.\n\n[What the world thinks of the infatuation with Donald Trump]\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d correspondent Martha Raddatz asked Trump whether he owed McCain an apology. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he replied. He repeatedly accused McCain \u2014 who still bears the physical scars from the torture he was subjected to during more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison camp \u2014 of having \u201cdone nothing\u201d for veterans.\n\nWhen Raddatz confronted him with statements of condemnations by leaders of veterans groups, Trump said, \u201cWell, maybe they don\u2019t speak to the same vets that I speak to.\u201d He filibustered throughout in the face of persistent questioning.\n\nRaddatz asked whether, as president, Trump would continue to label an opponent as a \u201closer\u201d or \u201cdummy,\u201d as he has done as a candidate. \u201cLook, when people attack me, I let them have it back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou say physical appearance. You know . . . people are constantly attacking my hair. I don\u2019t see you coming to my defense.\u201d Then he again called McCain \u201ca dummy.\u201d\n\n[Donald Trump didn\u2019t apologize to John McCain. Because, of course not.]\n\nIf Republicans \u2014 many privately and some publicly \u2014 agreed that Trump has entered a new and more challenging phase of his candidacy, they differed on what the right strategy should be for those who feel he is a threat to the party\u2019s hopes of winning the 2016 election.\n\nSteve Schmidt, who was senior adviser to McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, says Trump\u2019s GOP rivals and others in the party must step up and confront him. \u201cWhat he represents has to be taken seriously. It has to be confronted seriously,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a cancer on the Republican Party and the conservative movement. It\u2019s a cancer on our politics as a whole. . . . My personal view is that it ought to trigger a fight for the soul and heart of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\u201d\n\nAnother prominent GOP strategist, speaking anonymously to be candid, counseled a more nuanced approach. Candidates should prosecute the case against Trump, this strategist said. \u201cBut they have to do that with a certain amount of respect, with disappointment in their voice, and not go over the top.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s harshest critic among his fellow Republican candidates has been former Texas governor Rick Perry. Even before Saturday\u2019s controversy, Perry had aggressively criticized Trump for his comments on immigration. Now, after the attack on McCain, he says the businessman should get out of the race.\n\nThat\u2019s unlikely right now, and it still would leave Trump free to mount an independent candidacy next year. Perry\u2019s motivation may spring in part from his desire to raise his own profile in the hope of qualifying for the first GOP debate, which will take place Aug. 6 in Cleveland.\n\nThat debate promises to be dominated by the issue of Trump, and every candidate on that stage will have to weigh the political consequences of challenging him directly. Whether Trump will begin to weigh the consequences of his actions is another question. So far, there\u2019s no indication of a change of heart. But for the candidate, the stakes have gotten noticeably higher after what he did Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE TAKE | The real estate mogul has risen in the polls by tapping into anger, but can he pass the presidential test for voters?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "THE TAKE | The real estate mogul has risen in the polls by tapping into anger, but can he pass the presidential test for voters?", "title": "Trump\u2019s attack on McCain marks a turning point for him \u2014 and the GOP", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-attack-on-mccain-marks-a-turning-point-for-him--and-the-gop/2015/07/19/92759254-2e51-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/19/National-Politics/Images/GOP_Trump_2016-07989.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@danbalz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-attack-on-mccain-marks-a-turning-point-for-him--and-the-gop/2015/07/19/92759254-2e51-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "trump mccain, trump mccain hero, trump abd, trump raddatz, trump won't apologize", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo"}, "eomportal-uuid": "92759254-2e51-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "trump mccain, trump mccain hero, trump abd, trump raddatz, trump won't apologize"}, "article_summary": "The contestants claim that a great deal of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's conversation has been divisive and extremely dangerous for America.\nOne described Trump\u2019s attack on McCain as \u201clethal.\u201d Another said he expects \u201ca complete cratering\u201d of Trump\u2019s support.\nCaption The GOP presidential hopeful has faced an avalanche of criticism over his characterization of illegal immigrants.\nTom Smart/EPANot one to back down easily from controversial statements, the Republican presidential candidate continues to add to the list of people he condemns.\nTrump\u2019s candidacy for the GOP nomination is a knot of contradictions."}
