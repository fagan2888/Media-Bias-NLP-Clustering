Iowa State University Field Agronomist Mark Johnson works in the fields of ten central Iowa counties, and says many beans in his area weren't planted until June. He says in some places the stand is still just knee high. Other fields were planted earlier and in better conditions. But even there, Johnson says he's seeing some localized disease pressure, like Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS).\n\nJohnson explains how SDS affects the plant, \"When an area turns yellow, that's called chlorotic. And then when it turns brown, that's necrotic. So, necrotic means it's dying or dead. So what happens with Sudden Death Syndrome is it gets infected in the roots very, very early, so it typically shows up more in beans that were planted in early, cool, wet soils. And then it just kind of sits there until you get a lot of demand on the plant trying to fill the pods. Once you see it it does really go through the symptoms pretty quickly.\"\n\nSDS is one of the top yield robbing diseases in soybeans. The Iowa State University Extension says from 1999 to 2004 average losses in the U.S. were estimated at $190 million a year.\n\nOverall, Johnson says disease and insect pressure has been low in his counties this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DES MOINES, Iowa - Yield-wise, this year's Iowa soybean crop probably won't be breaking any statewide average records. \u00a0Iowa State University Field Agronomist Mark Johnson works in the fields of ten central Iowa counties, and says many beans in his area weren't planted until June.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "0b712ce3c768feea09b44013120c6553"}, "og": {"site_name": "whotv.com", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2013 Yield-wise, this year\u2019s Iowa soybean crop probably won\u2019t be breaking any statewide average records. \u00a0Iowa State University Field Agronomist Mark Johnson works i\u2026", "title": "Sudden Death Syndrome In Soybeans", "url": "http://whotv.com/2014/08/22/sudden-death-syndrome-in-soybeans/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/promo2330027661.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/promo2330027661.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@whohd", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@whohd"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324711668", "fb": {"pages": 383549560312}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whotv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f35371452b04df2deef561dcee55bb01?s=16", "application-name": "whotv.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD", "published_time": "2014-08-22T19:28:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-22T19:28:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD"}, "keywords": "agribusiness, agribusiness", "google-site-verification": "rL7fNdHSnN2PyMcNFC2GBk_LusisYfoPth6XdX-yZ2Y", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But even there, Johnson says he's seeing some localized disease pressure, like Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS).\nThe Iowa State University Extension says from 1999 to 2004 average losses in the U.S. were estimated at $190 million a year.\nSo what happens with Sudden Death Syndrome is it gets infected in the roots very, very early, so it typically shows up more in beans that were planted in early, cool, wet soils.\nIowa State University Field Agronomist Mark Johnson works in the fields of ten central Iowa counties, and says many beans in his area weren't planted until June.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoDES MOINES, Iowa - Yield-wise, this year's Iowa soybean crop probably won't be breaking any statewide average records."}
