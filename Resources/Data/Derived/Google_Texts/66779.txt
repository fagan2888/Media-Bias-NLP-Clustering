Chrysler to offer free tuition at Strayer University to all employees

Following in the footsteps of Starbucks, the United States division of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced Monday that it will offer free college tuition at Strayer University to the 118,000 employees at its Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and Fiat dealerships.

Fortune reported that any part-time and full-time employees who have worked at a dealership for 30 days can enroll in an associate, bachelor’s, or master’s degree program at Strayer University, either online or on a physical campus.

The program will be introduced to 356 dealerships in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee at first and will expand nationwide by the end of the year.

While Chrysler’s plan is similar to the one announced by Starbucks last month, Chrysler will actually cover the workers’ tuition upfront.

“It’s vitally important that we don’t ask these employees to put a cash outlay and then wait 90 or 180 days for reimbursement. Many of them couldn’t afford that,” Al Gardner, vice president of dealer network development and president and CEO of the Chrysler brand, FCA US, said.

Gardner said that they came up with this huge perk to try and retain and recruit talented employees.

Right now, most dealership showrooms experience annual turnover between 45-60 percent, Gardner told Fortune, with most workers staying less than six months.

“Their largest issue is how to attract the right talent to take customer service to the next level,” he said of talking with dealership owners.

Gardner hopes the free tuition offering should help.
