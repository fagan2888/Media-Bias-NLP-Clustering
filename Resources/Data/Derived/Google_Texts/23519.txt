President Obama will be in Dallas today to encourage uninsured Texans to sign up for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. He also has a couple of fund-raisers to attend. If he’s not satisfied with the eats at them (who knows whether they’ll be rubber-chicken events), he might be wondering where he can get a great bite.

Forget about Lucia: Word on the street is that no tables are set aside for VIPs there — even Jennifer Uygur’s mom can’t get a table unless she calls a month ahead on the first day of the month like everyone else. So forget about that. Unless he wants to take his chances and try to get a seat at the chef’s counter — there might even be room there for three Secret Service guys to sit next to him.

The president might be interested in seeing what all the fuss at FT33 is about — after all, chef-owner Matt McCallister was just named The Dallas Morning News’ first-ever Chef of the Year. So that’s an idea. He could go to Hibiscus or Al Biernat’s, and feast on some fabulous locally-raised grass fed beef.

Or he might want to play it lower-key, and spend a more quiet evening eating something soothing and delicious. In that case, I’d head to Mesa Veracruz Coastal Cuisine. I understand it’s only busy on weekends, so that should be no problem — and it’s probably an ideal situation in terms of the Secret Service securing the space. Bonus: the president reportedly loves mom and pop places, and Mesa fits that bill (as do FT33 and Lucia). Mr. President, if you go to Mesa, please do not miss the enmoladas — Olga Reyes‘ wonderful hand-made corn tortillas layered with her fabulous mole sauce and folded into neat packets — and then have the cochinita pibíl. And be sure to have a Meso-Rita — which may well be the best margarita in town.

Maybe you have a great idea of where the president should dine post-rubber-chicken fest. Please let him know in a comment!
