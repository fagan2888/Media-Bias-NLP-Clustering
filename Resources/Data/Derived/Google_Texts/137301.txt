Authorities are investigating after two Custer County Sheriff's deputies shot and killed an 18-year-old suspect Saturday night.

According to the OSBI, just before 7 p.m., deputies received two 911 calls about a domestic dispute inside a home in the 10000 block of N. 2200 Road just outside Clinton. The caller stated an 18-year-old man had two knives.

OSBI agents say the deputies entered the home and eventually had to fire their weapons, killing the suspect, Mah-Hi-Vist Goodblanket.

One deputy was injured during the shooting, according to the OSBI.

The Custer County Sheriff's Office requested the OSBI's help to investigate the case. OSBI agents are collecting information and evidence from the scene. They will include in a written report all the facts gathered during the investigation for the district attorney to review.

The district attorney will then determine whether the shooting was justified, according to the OSBI.

The deputies have been placed on routine, paid administrative leave. The OSBI has not released their identities.
