President Barack Obama stars in a video for BuzzFeed (screen grab)

A Minnesota newspaper has backtracked after calling President Barack Obama an “assclown” over a spoof video that was meant to promote health insurance.

Last week, BuzzFeed published a video of the president mocking himself by making funny faces in the mirror, and using a so-called “selfie stick” to encourage people to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act.

Over the weekend, the St. Paul Pioneer Press sports producer Kevin Cusick used his daily “Loop Ten” slide show feature to call out the president.

“A fool-proof way to make yourself look like a self-absorbed assclown,” the caption read under a photo of Obama using the selfie stick.

On Monday, Cusick told KMSP that he realized that he went too far after people complained.

“After further review, it’s a poor choice of word,” Cusick explained in an email. “I must have been in an especially foul mood last night. I’ve toned it down a bit.”

The caption was changed to read: “A fool-proof way to make yourself look like a self-absorbed celebrity.”
