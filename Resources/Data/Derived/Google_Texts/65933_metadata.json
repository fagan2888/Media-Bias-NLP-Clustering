But one thing that hasn\u2019t changed much and isn\u2019t likely to anytime soon is who pays for our healthcare. Unless voters elect Bernie Sanders\u2014the only 2016 presidential candidate advocating a single-payer national healthcare system \u2014to the White House come November, the third-party payer system is probably here to stay.\n\nCritics argue that this model is responsible for giving the United States the dubious distinction of having some of the highest healthcare costs in the world. In fact, the United States spent more per capita on healthcare \u2014$9086\u2014in 2013 than 12 other high-income countries, including France, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, and Canada, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund. Yet despite throwing all that money around, we also have the lowest life expectancy and some of the worst health outcomes among the other relatively wealthy nations studied.\n\nLearn more about how to gain reimbursement for your medical device at the BIOMEDevice Boston conference, April 13-14, 2016.\n\nI would argue that the third-party payer system also hurts Americans in another way: It\u2019s holding back medtech innovation.\n\nAt the MD&M West conference in Anaheim, CA, last month, Betsy Gross, vice president of healthcare economics and reimbursement at Intersect ENT, shared a hypothetical story about an imaginary tympanostomy device to illustrate why medical device developers should consider their reimbursement strategy early on. But to me, her tale also underscores how the healthcare payment model in the United States is detrimental to innovation.\n\nGross asked the audience to imagine a medical device that would allow the common procedure of placing tubes in children\u2019s ears to move from the hospital operating room to a physician\u2019s office and eliminate the need for the patient to undergo general anesthesia. Sounds like a winner, right?\n\nNot so fast. As Gross explained, a device like this probably wouldn\u2019t hold up when exposed to the realities of our third-party payer system.\n\nBecause payers dole out a fixed sum for tympanostomies, providers have gotten good at maximizing throughput. Thus, moving the procedure to the physician\u2019s office would cut off an important revenue stream for hospitals. Not putting patients under could also make the procedure take longer, which would lower the hourly rate providers receive for their work. Finally, payers have already negotiated the rate paid to hospitals for tympanostomies so low that it\u2019s unlikely the payment to a physician\u2019s office would be much less. As a result, Gross said, such a device would likely fail to catch on.\n\nIs it just me, or is that madness? A device that\u2019s better for patients than the current standard of care could never see the light of day simply because it doesn\u2019t play nice with our convoluted reimbursement model.\n\nWhile Gross\u2019s example was make-believe, another speaker explained how this is playing out in real life.\n\nUtah-based startup Owlet Baby Care has created a pulse oximetry system to alert parents if their baby stops breathing. Although Sean Kerman, Owlet\u2019s vice president of clinical strategy, said the company has received feedback from nurses who say its device is easier to use than some of the equipment they have access to in the neonatal intensive care unit, Owlet is initially marketing the device only as a health and wellness product sold directly to consumers. That decision was made partly because going through FDA would have lengthened the development cycle, but also because Owlet wanted to ensure parents could get access to its product.\n\n\u201c. . . You run the risk that some people won\u2019t have [the device] covered by insurance, and they won\u2019t be able to purchase it because it\u2019s behind some kind of Rx channel,\u201d Kerman said.\n\nHe admitted that Owlet is pursuing a reimbursement strategy, but his comment begs the question: How many medical innovations are we missing out on because of our messed up reimbursement model?\n\nIt's enough to make you feel the Bern.\n\nJamie Hartford is MD+DI's editor-in-chief.
