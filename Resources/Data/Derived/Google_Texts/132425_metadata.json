In other communities, only 5.37 percent report low health literacy. According to a study by the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa Office of Public Health Studies, led by Assistant Professor Tetine Sentell, these percentages matter for individual health. Those who live in communities where many people report low health literacy have, on average, worse health than people who live in communities where few residents report low health literacy.\n\nThe study of 11,779 individuals within 37 communities in Hawai\u02bbi found that each percentage increase of average low health literacy within a community was associated with an approximately 2 percent increase in poor self-reported health for individuals in that community. This was regardless of individual health literacy, age, gender or access to health insurance.\n\n\u201cFrom previous work, we already knew that almost 20 percent of adults in Hawai\u02bbi reported low health literacy and that low individual health literacy was associated with poorer personal health status,\u201d said Sentell. \u201cWhat our new study found is that community health literacy also matters to your personal health status. Health literacy is an important factor at both the individual and community level.\u201d\n\nPrimary-care providers, community health centers and public health facilities should, therefore, consider and address health literacy at both community and individual levels.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised at the community variation in low health literacy and how important it was to individual health,\u201d said Sentell. \u201cWe know in Hawai\u02bbi that the community context is important to health in many ways. This study shows that a large increase in health literacy across enough individual members of a community could provide community-wide health benefits. There is increasing funding with relevance for social health factors, including efforts supported by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThis study was a collaboration between UH M\u0101noa\u2019s Department of Public Health Sciences, Associate Professor Wei Zhang of the Department of Sociology and Kay Baker of the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Health.
