But having insurance can mean the difference between financial security and financial ruin.\n\nA new study is showing that, by giving health insurance to low-income people, Obamacare seems to have cut down on their debt substantially. It estimates that medical debt held by people newly covered by Medicaid since 2014 has been reduced by about $600 to $1,000 each year.\n\nThe study, published Monday as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, builds on earlier evidence from Oregon and Massachusetts that offering health insurance to low-income Americans can help them avoid debt and financial shocks.\n\nI\u2019ve written before about the big benchmarks I\u2019m watching to evaluate the success of the health law. Its impact on people\u2019s financial security is an important one.\n\nRobert Kaestner, one of the authors of the new study, said he and his co-authors think the financial impacts of Medicaid could have cascading effects for the program\u2019s beneficiaries. Previous research has linked hospitalizations among the uninsured to higher risk of bankruptcy, unpaid bills and a lowered credit score.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFinancial distress has many subsequent consequences,\u201d said Mr. Kaestner, a professor of health economics at the University of Illinois. \u201cIf people are skipping bills and going into debt, then it can have other repercussions \u2014 for example you lose your car, you fall behind on rent.\u201d\n\nThis year, we heard from thousands of readers about how medical bills can alter finances and daily life.\n\n\u201cI just turned 26, and I can\u2019t even get a new contract with AT&T without a $750 security deposit, let alone finance a new (used) vehicle,\u201d wrote Richard Barnes, a reader who was uninsured when he was struck with appendicitis three years ago. \u201cWhen I was moving in May 2015, I had extreme trouble finding somebody who would rent to me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA survey that The Upshot conducted with the Kaiser Family Foundation found that about one in five Americans still struggle to pay a medical bill, even after the Affordable Care Act. But several studies show that the number has declined as insurance coverage has expanded.\n\nThe new study homed in on the impacts for the lowest-income Americans. The researchers examined credit reports on a sample of Americans across the country. They compared debt incurred by people in two very different sets of states: those that expanded Medicaid to provide free insurance to all individuals earning under about $16,000 and those that either chose not to cover that popuation or had expanded their programs earlier.\n\nBy focusing on the 25 percent of ZIP codes with the highest percentage of low-income, uninsured people before 2014, the researchers were able to compare debt incurred by people in the unchanged states with the debt of residents of states that offered new insurance options.\n\nOver two years, they didn\u2019t find major changes in every measure of financial distress. But Medicaid expansion did move the needle on the number of bills sent to collections and the amount of debt sent to collections. That\u2019s important because that\u2019s the pattern of debt-stressed people after an expensive health crisis, Mr. Kaestner said.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 estimate of $600 to $1,000 involved some back-of-the-envelope math, but the money is substantial in the context of a population earning less than $16,000 a year. Medical debt also isn\u2019t spread out evenly across the population; about 20 percent of low-income Medicaid beneficiaries end up hospitalized in a given year. That means that a smaller group of people was protected against huge bills.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study had some limitations. It could look only at people who had a credit report; government research has found that about 30 percent of people with very low income aren\u2019t tracked by the credit agencies.\n\nThe research also couldn\u2019t tell whether any particular individual got Medicaid. Instead, it tracked everyone in the places where researchers anticipated the biggest changes in Medicaid enrollment. But the differences were clear enough that the researchers are confident that they represent a real change in the financial circumstances of people who signed up for new Medicaid plans.\n\nThe authors pointed out that the lower debt burden for the newly insured indirectly helps other people. The credit reports also track debt and unpaid bills outside of health care. The insurance coverage means more bills are paid to doctors and hospitals \u2014 but also to banks, utility companies and landlords.\n\nThose financial ripples often receive less attention than the health law\u2019s more obvious effects on people\u2019s access to health care. But they are also an important effect of the law.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160420070023, "twitter": {"description": "A study builds on earlier evidence that offering the poor health insurance helps them avoid financial shocks.", "creator": "sangerkatz", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/upshot/obamacare-seems-to-be-reducing-peoples-medical-debt.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004342982"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Obamacare Seems to Be Reducing People\u2019s Medical Debt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/upshot/20UP-ACA/20UP-ACA-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/upshot/obamacare-seems-to-be-reducing-peoples-medical-debt.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004342982", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/upshot/obamacare-seems-to-be-reducing-peoples-medical-debt.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 20, 2016", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Medicaid,Personal Bankruptcies", "description": "A study builds on earlier evidence that offering the poor health insurance helps them avoid financial shocks.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/upshot/20UP-ACA/20UP-ACA-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "21up-aca", "byl": "By MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A study builds on earlier evidence that offering the poor health insurance helps them avoid financial shocks.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/upshot/20UP-ACA/20UP-ACA-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Medicaid", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 20, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2016-04-21", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Personal Bankruptcies", "published": "2016-04-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160421045151, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/upshot/obamacare-seems-to-be-reducing-peoples-medical-debt.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/upshot/20UP-ACA/20UP-ACA-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A study builds on earlier evidence that offering the poor health insurance helps them avoid financial shocks.", "title": "Obamacare Seems to Be Reducing People\u2019s Medical Debt"}, "pdate": 20160420, "des": "Personal Bankruptcies", "articleid": 100000004342982, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obamacare Seems to Be Reducing People\u2019s Medical Debt", "col": "Public Health", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "A new study is showing that, by giving health insurance to low-income people, Obamacare seems to have cut down on their debt substantially.\nIt estimates that medical debt held by people newly covered by Medicaid since 2014 has been reduced by about $600 to $1,000 each year.\nEven if you lack health insurance, you\u2019ll probably be able to get treatment at a hospital in the event of a catastrophe \u2014 if you\u2019re struck by a car, say.\nThose financial ripples often receive less attention than the health law\u2019s more obvious effects on people\u2019s access to health care.\nMedical debt also isn\u2019t spread out evenly across the population; about 20 percent of low-income Medicaid beneficiaries end up hospitalized in a given year."}
