A Los Angeles hospital has agreed to pay $40,750 to settle a case involving a patient who waited in the emergency department for more than six hours and never received care for acute appendicitis.

The Daily News reports a deal was announced Thursday between Olive View-UCLA Medical Center and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

Federal officials say the Sylmar facility violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.

According to the complaint the man eventually left Olive View and received treatment at another hospital.

An Olive View spokeswoman says the hospital has made several changes including adding physicians assigned to provide rapid screening.
