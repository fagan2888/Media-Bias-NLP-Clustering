That type of special enrollment is available year round.\n\nOverall, 1.4 million Californians get their health coverage through the state marketplace.\n\nUninsured people can't avoid a health-law penalty for lacking coverage in 2014. But there's still time to do something for the 2015 tax year.\n\n\"It's not too late to avoid a penalty for 2015,\" Lee said. \"2014 is water under the bridge. You can't affect that.\"\n\nLee said the exchange is working with tax preparers and other government agencies to help ensure that people aren't surprised by the federal penalties.\n\nAn individual making $40,000 who can afford coverage would face a tax penalty of about $600 for being uninsured in 2015, Lee said.\n\nA family of four with a household income of $70,000 might have to pay nearly $1,000 to Uncle Sam for lacking health coverage this year, according to the state.\n\n\"Some people are just now discovering that being uninsured can be an expensive proposition,\" Lee said. \"We don\u2019t want there to be any surprises.\"\n\nConsumers can seek an exemption from the federal mandate to buy health insurance. Grounds for getting exemptions include financial hardship and religious reasons.\n\nFor the 2014 tax year, the penalty for being uninsured is $95 per adult or 1% of modified adjusted gross income, whichever is greater.\n\nThose penalties are increasing for future tax years. For 2015, they rise to $325 per adult or 2% of income, whichever is higher.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "18,000 Californians use extended Obamacare sign-up to avoid tax penalty", "date": "2015-04-07", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California officials said about 18,000 people have taken advantage of an extended Obamacare enrollment period that was created as a final opportunity to\u00a0escape the health law's tax penalties.", "title": "18,000 Californians use extended Obamacare sign-up to avoid tax penalty", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-taxes-20150407-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55242e85/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-taxes-20150407", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, taxes, Affordable Care Act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83238418", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, covered california, taxes, Affordable Care Act", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "California officials said about 18,000 people have taken advantage of an extended Obamacare enrollment period that was created as a final opportunity to\u00a0escape the health law's tax penalties.
