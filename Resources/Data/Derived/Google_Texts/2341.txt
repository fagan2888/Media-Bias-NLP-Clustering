Fox News is reeling from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s masterful performance before the House Benghazi Committee Thursday, trying — and failing — to find an angle or a narrative that doesn’t involve the utter debasement of the partisan GOP attack on the Democratic front-runner.

On “Fox & Friends” this morning, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan chose to continue yesterday’s line of attack by insisting — contra chair Trey Gowdy’s admission that no new information was learned during Clinton’s testimony — that his slides of her emails prove that she “knew on the day of the attack that it was a terrorist attack, yet she told the American people something else,” which to his mind is new information.

“When your government officials aren’t being square with you,” he told Kimberly Guilfoyle, “that’s not something we should have to tolerate.”
