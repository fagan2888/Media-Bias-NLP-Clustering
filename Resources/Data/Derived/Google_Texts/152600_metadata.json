It reflects your health with astounding accuracy, so treat it right by pampering, cleaning, and feeding it safe and healthy nutrients. You don\u2019t need to go out searching cosmetic counters or order expensive creams, lotions, and exfoliates when you have a wealth of do-it-yourself treatments and tricks that can take care of your skin at home.\n\nMost can pinpoint the culprits of their dull or oily skin from certain unhealthy habits. Whether it\u2019s a lack of broad-spectrum SPF 30 protection or sleeping with your makeup on, it causes harm to your body.\n\nThe top layer of the skin is dead, so blockages, such as old makeup, dirt, and sweat can accumulate and make it harder for the lower layers to flourish with the necessary oxygen and nutrients, although most derive from what the body digests. That's why what you eat and drink is just as important as what you're putting on your face.\n\nBy combining protection practices with nutrition and hygiene routines, your skin will feel cleaner and healthier as time goes by. Start taking care of yourself and applying and ingesting natural products and foods to your body. It takes 26 seconds for the chemicals in your personal care products to enter your bloodstream. Read these 16 natural beauty hacks for the everyday person:\n\n1. At-Home Burn Accidents\n\nBurn yourself with your hair iron, saucepan, or tea kettle? Instead of applying ice to minor burns, reach for some raw honey and slather on a thick layer. It will immediately cut the sting of the burn but also provide antibacterial protection while keeping skin hydrated.\n\n2. Feet in Need of TLC\n\nIf you have rough, dry, or cracked feet, you need a tougher exfoliator than your face does. Mix 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to half a cup of coconut oil and apply the blend to your feet in a circular motion. Then wash off with a warm washcloth. It will help to get of a lot of the dead skin off in a gentle but effective manner.\n\n3. Hair Removal Without the Razor\n\nShaving legs, underarms, and backs can hurt the skin if done too often without the proper moisturizer or shaving gel. Instead, mix together 1 tablespoon of iodine two percent with 1 cup of baby oil and rub it into the desired removal area. Let it set for only five minutes without water flow. Then, gently wipe away with a damp cloth, and with the mixture will come the hair without the pain or possible injury.\n\n4. All-Natural Self-Tanner Remover\n\nSkin cancer is far too prevalent, with one in five Americans developing skin cancer over the course of their lifetime. Avoid getting too much sun exposure by staying out of the sun and trying a self-tanner instead. Removal can be tricky, so try an all-natural approach by mixing water with lemon juice and baking soda. Then, use a toothbrush to gently help exfoliate away any dark spots left over.\n\n5. Fix Morning Eyes\n\nWaking up with puffy eyes doesn\u2019t help anyone look like a morning person. Place a spoon in the freezer the night before and in the morning hold under or on top of the eyelids to decrease puffiness and inflammation. Cool cucumbers or teabags work as well. The caffeine constricts blood vessels and, when applied to the under-eye area, decreases puffiness.\n\n6. Cure-All Herbal Treatment\n\nWitch hazel is an herbal remedy that also helps with under-eye bags, but it\u2019s also a cure-all astringent that works as a toner, serves as an excellent spot treatment, and a natural deodorant.\n\n7. Summer Salt Scrub\n\nExfoliate summer skin with Epsom salt, which is the go-to bath ingredient for post-gym workouts to soothe sore muscles. Add half a teaspoon into your favorite cleansing cream or lotion and gently massage the face in small circles once or twice a week. The mineral\u2019s compound of sulphate and magnesium helps flush toxins and calm inflammation.\n\n8. Skin-Soothing Aloe for Acne\n\nAcne is aggravating. The leaves of aloe vera plants are known to reduce facial acne flare ups thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties. It can also help heal existing acne, prevent future breakouts, and soothe sunburns. Simply break open an aloe leaf and apply directly to the problem areas for a natural acne fix, or squeeze into ice cube trays, let freeze, and rub cubes onto skin for an easy, clean application.\n\n9. Bug-Bite Baths\n\nFor bubble bath lovers, add half a cup of baking soda Arm & Hammer to hot water for a soothing soak. It will neutralize acids and skin irritants such as sunburn and bug bites.\n\nFeed Your Skin\u2019s Needs:\n\n10. For Dark Under-Eye Circles\n\nVitamin K found in pears, avocados, plums, and kiwi fruit help to heal the damaged capillaries and arteries in the thin skin layer around the eyes.\n\n11. For Uneven Pigmentation\n\nVitamin B found in fish and garlic will help to combat redness by boosting circulation in the body, leaving behind a radiant complexion.\n\n12. For Wrinkles\n\nVitamin A found in dark leafy greens and cantaloupe is the key to rejuvenating your skin and smoothing out fine lines and uneven skin tone, making it particularly helpful for those who have acne.\n\n\n\n13. For Dull Skin\n\nVitamin A from carrots will keep your skin healthy and vibrant from their high beta carotene levels, which is an antioxidant that is converted to vitamin A inside the body. It helps repair skin tissue and protects against the sun's harsh rays. Cooked carrots deliver even more skin\u2013friendly beta carotene than raw ones.\n\n14. For Dry Skin\n\nVitamin E found in mangos, almonds, broccoli, and spinach help to balance the skin's moisture levels and work as an effective antioxidant to help fight free radicals in the body. Vitamins A, C, and E encourage cell and tissue growth to help the body repair itself throughout its constant shedding and growing cycles.\n\n15. For Sun-Damaged Skin\n\nVitamin C found in oranges, strawberries, and kiwi can help reverse some sun damage and prevent wrinkles and sagging, as well as brighten the overall skin tone due to the fact that it stimulates collagen production.\n\n16. To Protect Against Future Sun Damage\n\nOmega\u20133 fats found in fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel, sardines, anchovies, and rainbow trout help fortify skin cell membranes, protect against sun damage, and may also reduce the risk of certain forms of skin cancer. The fats allow water and nutrients into the skin while keeping toxins out, and can also help fight inflammation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "16, beauty, hacks, your, skin, will, thank, you", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Skin treatments don't have to be over-the-counter products, but instead, you can use healthy ingredients from inside your own home.", "title": "16 Beauty Hacks Your Skin Will Thank You For", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/16-beauty-hacks-your-skin-will-thank-you-291712", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/beauty-hacks-every-skin-conscious-person-needs-know.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Skin treatments don't have to be over-the-counter products, but instead, you can use healthy ingredients from inside your own home.", "title": "16 Beauty Hacks Your Skin Will Thank You For", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/16-beauty-hacks-your-skin-will-thank-you-291712", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/beauty-hacks-every-skin-conscious-person-needs-know.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/07/beauty-hacks-every-skin-conscious-person-needs-know.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-07T15:51:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-07T16:10:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Skin treatments don't have to be over-the-counter products, but instead, you can use healthy ingredients from inside your own home."}, "article_summary": "The fats allow water and nutrients into the skin while keeping toxins out, and can also help fight inflammation.\nBy combining protection practices with nutrition and hygiene routines, your skin will feel cleaner and healthier as time goes by.\nRead these 16 natural beauty hacks for the everyday person:1.\nIt will immediately cut the sting of the burn but also provide antibacterial protection while keeping skin hydrated.\nIt will help to get of a lot of the dead skin off in a gentle but effective manner."}
