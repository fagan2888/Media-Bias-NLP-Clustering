For most women, an orgasm is a euphoric moment filled with happiness and pleasure, but for a Florida woman, orgasms are the constant torture of her life. Amanda Gryce, 24, experiences up to 50 orgasms a day, triggered by anything from a car trip to a loud, thumping bass. The afflicted woman has been suffering from persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) since she was 6 years old, and about a year ago, she started to seek treatment.

"Pleasure is supposed to be a good thing, but when you have it for too long, it's like eating a lot of candy — something that's really good and makes you happy, but then you start getting sick from it because you've had too much," Gryce told Barcroft TV in the video. Gryce has suffered in silence for years, as she was too ashamed to tell her family or friends. However, since last year, she has been in contact with pelvic pain expert Dr. Robert Echenberg, who has given her hope in finding a way to control her orgasms.

“After seeing Echenberg, I found there are things which can reduce the intensity of the orgasms, even though they are still constant,” she said. The 24-year-old currently takes medication to numb her genitals, does exercises to take her mind off PGAD, and must abstain from sex — doctor’s orders, The Huffington Post reported. Gryce receives support from her boyfriend, Stuart Triplett, 22, who has actually been helping her abstain from sex. “Stuart's really been holding me back as far as the intimacy goes — he actually has to remind me we're not allowed to do anything.”

Although abstinence is a major element to her health routine, she actually notices immediate and positive results. Gryce must abstain from sex until she gets her condition under control. “I finally feel like I'm going to have a more normal life — and eventually a positive sex life.”
