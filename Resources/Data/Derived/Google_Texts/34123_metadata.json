Together they represent the beginning of the consolidation of the feminist pro-abortion establishment behind Clinton who is in a dog fight with Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders in both New Hampshire and Iowa (where the first presidential caucuses take place February 1).\n\nOn Sunday Planned Parenthood Action Fund staged a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, site of the nation\u2019s first presidential primary, to make it formal. If you are so inclined, you can watch the event here. (She begins talking about 44 minutes in.)\n\nIn gratitude for the endorsement, Clinton, the former Secretary of State, pledged her bona fides maximus to the largest abortion provider in the world.\n\nOne particularly illustrative example is the following.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I will always defend Planned Parenthood, and I will say, consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported, and appreciated\u2014not undermined, misrepresented, and demonized. I believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion, not just in principle, but in practice. Any right that requires you to take extraordinary measures to access it, is no right at all. \u2026 and not as long as we have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment making it harder for low-income women to exercise their full rights.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIn reverse order, first, that if Hillary Rodham Clinton becomes president she will do her best to make sure that low-income women \u201cexercise their full rights\u201d [abort] by gutting the Hyde Amendment. For newcomers who may not understand the full importance of that promise, the Hyde Amendment is an annual appropriations rider which eliminates public funding for abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\n\nPrior to its passage in 1976, the federal Medicaid program paid for 300,000 abortions a year. Conservative estimates are that there are well over one million people are alive today because of the Hyde Amendment.\n\nTo this day pro-abortionists grind their teeth when they speak of the Hyde Amendment. For them the \u201cright\u201d to abortion never meant only the legal right to abort. It required that you and I and every other tax payer fund their abortions.\n\nSecond, keep the federal spigot turned on. The House and the Senate have passed legislation that would block most federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood, and repeal many parts of Obamacare, including the program that provides tax-based subsidies for about 1,000 health plans that cover elective abortions.\n\nWhat does PPFA do with the annual $500 million + tax payer dollars? \u201cPlanned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to death every two minute\u2013killing over seven million innocent children since 1973,\u201d Congressman Chris Smith, Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Pro-Life Caucus, said last week. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is Child Abuse, Incorporated.\u201d\n\nAnd as Clinton told her audience, \u201c[T[he only thing, as Cecile [Richards, PPFA president] said, stopping them from making that the law of the land was President Obama\u2019s veto pen.\u201d Clinton assured her audience she would \u201chave your back\u201d on this and other abortion-related issues.\n\nAnd to make sure she touched all the bases, Clinton warned her audience that \u201cI shudder to think about what the Republicans would do, if given the chance.\u201d Clinton added, \u201cWe know any Republican president would accelerate the assault on access to safe and legal abortion. And think about this: The next president could easily appoint more than one justice to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nCouldn\u2019t have made that latter point better myself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hillaryclinton305-300x158.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFirst of all, I will always defend Planned Parenthood, and I will say, consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported, and appreciated\u2014not undermined, misrepresented, and demonized.\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund\u2019s endorsement followed a similar enthusiastic expression of support from NARAL Pro-Choice America.\nOn Sunday Planned Parenthood Action Fund staged a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, site of the nation\u2019s first presidential primary, to make it formal.\nConservative estimates are that there are well over one million people are alive today because of the Hyde Amendment.\nTo this day pro-abortionists grind their teeth when they speak of the Hyde Amendment."}
