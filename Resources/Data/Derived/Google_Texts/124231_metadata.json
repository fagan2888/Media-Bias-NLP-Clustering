Thanks to virtual reality, they\u2019ll be exploring a Dali painting in a dreamy, three-dimensional world that turns art appreciation into an unforgettable, immersive experience.\n\nThe new exhibition, \u201cDisney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination,\u201d tells the story of the relationship between Salvador Dali, the surrealist artist, and Walt Disney, the great American animator and theme-park pioneer.\n\nBut the museum exhibition\u2019s highlight comes after visitors have seen the Disney-Dali show\u2019s paintings, story sketches, correspondence, photos and other artifacts. As visitors leave the exhibition area, they\u2019ll be invited to don a headset to try the virtual reality experience.\n\nCalled \u201cDreams of Dali,\u201d the VR experience takes viewers inside Dali\u2019s 1935 painting \u201cArcheological Reminiscence of Millet\u2019s \u2018Angelus.\u2019\u201d The painting depicts two towering stone figures along with tiny human figures in a bare landscape with a moody sky. Users can move around inside the painting, using Oculus Rift headsets to navigate a trippy three-dimensional environment that includes motifs from other Dali works like elephants, birds, ants and his \u201cLobster Telephone\u201d sculpture.\n\nAccompanied by a haunting piano soundtrack punctuated by bird cries, the VR visuals also include a crescent moon, a stone tunnel and even an image of rocker Alice Cooper, whom Dali featured in a hologram he created in 1973.\n\n\u201cYou actually have a three-dimensional feeling that you\u2019re inside a painting,\u201d said Jeff Goodby, whose firm Goodby Silverstein & Partners created the VR experience. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like you\u2019re inside a sphere with things being projected. It\u2019s actually like there are objects closer and further away and you\u2019re walking amidst them. It\u2019s a vulnerable feeling you give yourself up to. It\u2019s not like anything you\u2019ve ever felt before.\u201d The VR experience was previewed in New York for the media 10 days before its opening Saturday at the Florida museum.\n\nDisney and Dali met in the 1940s in Hollywood, according to museum director Hank Hine. \u201cTheir sensibilities were very connected,\u201d Hine said. \u201cThey wanted to take art off the palette, out of the canvas and into the world.\u201d The exhibition looks at the castle motif that became a symbol of Disney parks, along with Dali\u2019s \u201cDream of Venus\u201d pavilion from the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, which some consider a precursor of contemporary installation art.\n\nDisney and Dali also collaborated on a short animated movie, \u201cDestino,\u201d that was eventually completed by Disney Studios. The six-minute movie, which can be found on YouTube, features a dancing girl with long dark hair, a sundial motif and a song with the line, \u201cYou came along out of a dream. \u2026 You are my destino.\u201d Clips will be played within the gallery for the Disney-Dali exhibition and the full short will be shown at the museum\u2019s theater.\n\nThe show also displays the Dali painting that inspired the VR experience, \u201cArcheological Reminiscence of Millet\u2019s \u2018Angelus.\u2019\u201d The surrealist work was Dali\u2019s interpretation of a 19th-century painting by Jean-Francois Millet depicting two peasants in a field, heads bowed in prayer. Dali said that his work was a \u201cfantasy during which I imagined sculptures of the two figures in Millet\u2019s \u2018Angelus\u2019 carved out of the highest rocks.\u201d\n\nMuseum marketing director Kathy Greif said record numbers of visitors attended its last two major shows exploring Dali\u2019s relationships with Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso. Given the Disney brand\u2019s immense popularity and the VR novelty, attendance expectations for this show are high as well.\n\nDali \u201cwanted art that took you over,\u201d said Goodby. \u201cHe wanted to take you away and do something different with your head and that\u2019s what this does.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIf You Go\u2026\n\nVIRTUAL REALITY TRAILER: \u201cDreams of Dali,\u201d http://thedali.org/dreams-of-dali\n\nDISNEY AND DALI: Exhibition through June 12 at the Dali Museum, One Dali Blvd., St. Petersburg, Florida; http://www.thedali.org or 727-823-3767.
