Mac Intyre knew then and knows even more now that his father and his staff had monumental and lasting impacts on Mike\u2019s contemporaries.\n\nThat set a high standard, and ever since \u2014 including at Colorado, where MacIntyre is about to begin his third season as head coach \u2014 he has aspired to meet it.\n\nEven amid the brightened spotlight of the contemporary college game, it can be heartening to hear former players from three years ago, 10 years ago, even 45 years ago, say they\u2019re grateful for what they learned from their coaches. They\u2019re also likely to add that it took some separation from their football careers to make them truly understand it.\n\nThe big-time college game\u2019s detractors probably won\u2019t concede this, but it happens all the time, whether those former players were in the NFL for nine years or became pediatricians.\n\n\u201cHere, every day, you\u2019re able to try to make a difference in a young man\u2019s life, along with football,\u201d Mac Intyre said after the Buffaloes\u2019 Sunday morning practice. \u201cI enjoy that part of it.\u201d\n\nYet in 2003, when Bill Parcells was beginning his four-season stint as the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 coach, he called MacIntyre, then on the staff at Mississippi. Parcells asked MacIntyre and asked if he would be interested in talking about moving to the NFL.\n\nAs the Buffaloes reached the halfway point of their preseason practices Sunday, MacIntyre told me that he never \u2014 not for one second \u2014 had thought a move to the NFL was something he wanted.\n\nBut, hey, when the \u201cTuna\u201d calls \u2026\n\nMacIntyre was the Cowboys\u2019 defensive backs coach during Parcells\u2019 2003-06 run, then was on Eric Mangini\u2019s staff for one year with the New York Jets.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed coaching the players that I was there with, and I enjoyed the guys I was around, but they were coming in and out the door,\u201d MacIntyre said. He added, \u201cAnd they\u2019re men. Now you get kids that are 17, 18 years old and you\u2019re taking them through the journey, which I enjoy doing.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot in the NFL and it was a great experience for me, one that Bill Parcells gave me. Working for Eric Mangini, I learned a ton from him. It was kind of like getting my Ph.D. in football. But I enjoy the daily things in college more.\u201d\n\nWhat did he learn from Parcells?\n\n\u201cWow, we\u2019d take all day if I told you that,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nThen he recited a list of highlights, mostly involving organization and innovation in everything from talent evaluation to practice structure.\n\nThe five seasons in the NFL allowed MacIntyre to be vested in the league\u2019s pension plan, and it identified him as a proven member of the league\u2019s assistant coaching pool, meaning as long as he was willing to move around, he could stay in the league for many years.\n\nYet he was uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI knew that if I had a good opportunity, I was going to to go back to college,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I would have stayed.\u201d\n\nThis time the call was from an old Mississippi coaching compatriot, David Cutliffe, named Duke\u2019s head coach in December 2007. So MacIntyre was the Blue Devils\u2019 defensive coordinator in 2008 and \u201909, restarting the collegiate game progression that took him to San Jose State as head coach from 2010-12 and then to Boulder in 2013. Among his players now is his older son, redshirt freshman wide receiver Jay MacIntyre.\n\n\u201cI knew my desire was to be a college head football coach,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cEverybody has different desires, you know?\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost. com or twitter.com/ TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: CU Buffs\u2019 Mike MacIntyre is happy being a college head coach", "title": "Frei: CU Buffs\u2019 Mike MacIntyre is happy being a college head coach", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/16/frei-cu-buffs-mike-macintyre-is-happy-being-a-college-head-coach/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-16T19:34:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:44:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei, University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7f0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI knew my desire was to be a college head football coach,\u201d MacIntyre said.\nThat set a high standard, and ever since \u2014 including at Colorado, where MacIntyre is about to begin his third season as head coach \u2014 he has aspired to meet it.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I would have stayed.\u201dThis time the call was from an old Mississippi coaching compatriot, David Cutliffe, named Duke\u2019s head coach in December 2007.\nIn his early years in coaching, MacIntyre thought of himself as a second-generation college-game \u201clifer.\u201dAmong the stops his father, George, made was a seven-year stay as the head coach at Vanderbilt, and Mike played under him for two seasons as a safety.\nParcells asked MacIntyre and asked if he would be interested in talking about moving to the NFL."}
