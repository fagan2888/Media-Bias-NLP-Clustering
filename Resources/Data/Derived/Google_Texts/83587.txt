A Salina police officer says she hopes competing in this summer's Miss Kansas pageant will help improve the image of law enforcement officers.

Katie Conn will compete in the June pageant after being one of two people chosen to advance in the Miss Santa Fe Trail pageant in Ulysses Jan. 9. The 23-year-old Conn became a Salina police officer in October 2014.

The Salina Journal reports Conn gave a 90-second monologue about her law enforcement career in the talent portion of the Miss Santa Fee contest.

Conn enjoys being a role model, both as a pageant title holder and as a police officer. She says the best part is talking to children about trying to achieve their dreams, no matter who they are.
