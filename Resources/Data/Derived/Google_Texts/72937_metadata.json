It regulates the rating agencies and the insurance agencies. It regulates \u201cderivatives\u201d and \u201ccredit default swaps.\u201d It regulates banks, making them have more collateral for the loans they approve.\n\nAnd the Republicans want to repeal all of this and go back to the unregulated Bush years?\n\nJust like their claim that the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cdisaster\u201d (despite claims to the contrary); and just like their solution to the ACA \u201cdisaster\u201d is to repeal the whole law (offering nothing in its place), the Republicans are claiming Dodd-Frank is a \u201cdisaster\u201d (ignoring all the good things it does).\n\nLocally, we have Rachel Helm, in an editorial published by The Union, claiming that the \u201cgood intentions\u201d (of Dodd-Frank) are really \u201cthe road to hell.\u201d And again her solution is to repeal the whole law and offer nothing to replace it.\n\nWe have Republican candidate Marco Rubio saying, \u201cForty percent of small and midsized banks \u2026 have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank passed\u201d and therefore we should repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nIn an October 2015 editorial, the Wall Street Journal disputed Rubio\u2019s claim. And in August 2015, an investigative reporter, Glenn Kessler, of the Washington Post gave Rubio\u2019s claim three \u201cPinocchio\u2019s\u201d for misrepresenting the facts.\n\nLet me remind people of the Republican ideology that smaller government, fewer regulations and tax cuts for the rich will let the free market (capitalism) grow our economy and everything will turn up roses.\n\nWhat actually happened with fewer regulations (repeal of Glass-Steagall Act that kept commercial banks and Wall Street separated, and the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act that prevented the SEC from regulating \u201cderivatives\u201d and \u201ccredit default swaps\u201d) was the collapse of the financial industry.\n\nIn other words, unregulated capitalism leads to unchecked greed and corruption. Countrywide and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac gave loans to people who shouldn\u2019t have gotten them.\n\nThe banks reorganized them into subprime loans and sold them to unsuspecting investors. Rating agencies, in collaboration with the banks, rated these \u201ccredit default swaps\u201d as AAA, and insurance agencies like AIG insured these bad loans.\n\nEveryone along the way got their commissions and lots of people made lots of money. Greed ruled.\n\nThen, when this house of cards collapsed, millions of ordinary people lost their homes and their jobs, unemployment soared to over 15 percent, trillions of dollars in wealth was lost, and the world was on the verge of a second great depression \u2014 the (true) \u201croad to hell.\u201d\n\nIn stepped \u201cbig government\u201d, TARP rescued the banks from bankruptcy. Under Obama, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created jobs by providing money for infrastructure projects; thus stopping the rise of the unemployed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through low interest rates and \u201cquantitative easement\u201d, pumped money into the economy.\n\nObama rescued General Motors from bankruptcy \u2014 thus saving an industry that supports about one in six jobs in America.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to remember that the federal government has a long-standing role in protecting the American people, through targeted regulations, from the excesses of industry (capitalism).\n\nSome examples are the clean air act, the clean water act, food safety laws, car safety regulations, worker safety regulations, etc.\n\nOne last reminder: Obama has \u201ckept us safe\u201d from another collapse of the financial industry. No financial collapse, like the one in 2008, has happened on Obama\u2019s watch. Bottom line? We should keep Dodd-Frank and improve on it as needed \u2014 not repeal it.\n\nNancy Eubanks, who lives in Rough and Ready and is a member of the Nevada County Democratic Central Committee, is a member of The Union Editorial Board.
