The employee came forward after learning about the backpack\u2019s discovery on television news, Madrak said.\n\n\u201cWhile we are still working to understand exactly why this person took the information out of the building, based on what we have learned so far it does not appear there was malfeasance on the part of this person,\u201d Madrak said.\n\nCall center workers sometimes make the sort of notes found in the backpack while helping clients, but they are not allowed to take the notes from the call center office, Madrak said.\n\nThe employee who owns the backpack is on administrative leave and officials from Access Health and Maximus are meeting Monday morning to continue the investigation and determine \u201cany actions necessary to ensure this does not occur again,\u201d Madrak said.\n\nThe exchange is calling people whose names were on the notepads found in the backpack. They will be offered free credit monitoring, fraud resolution, identity theft insurance and security freezes of credit reports.\n\nMadrak said the data included fewer than 200 Social Security Numbers.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry this happened, and we are working to rectify as quickly as possible, as well doing whatever is necessary to try to prevent it from happening again,\u201d Madrak said.\n\nIt was not clear how the backpack ended up on the street in Hartford. It was found on Trumbull Street, the same street as the building that houses Access Health's headquarters and call center.\n\nEarlier this year, House Republicans raised concerns about the security of Access Health customers' data, proposing a bill that would require enhanced background checks for people who apply to work at the exchange or who will have access to personal information of people seeking coverage through the exchange. The bill died in committee.\n\n\u201cThere is a concern about the private information of folks that are going through the exchange,\u201d Rep. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said during a March public hearing.\n\nBut exchange CEO Kevin Counihan testified that the bill\u2019s requirements were unnecessary and would be costly to implement.\n\nCounihan told legislators that the exchange already performs \u201ccomprehensive criminal background checks\u201d on all employees, navigators and assisters who help sign people up, and vendor staff.\n\nOne of Counihan\u2019s criticisms of the proposal was that it would require the exchange to pay for background checks of vendor employees, something the vendors currently pay for. At one point in his testimony, Counihan used Maximus as an example, noting that the company had roughly 309 people in the call center.\n\n\u201cMaximus, like our other vendors, conforms to our existing security requirements,\u201d Counihan said, adding that Maximus, not the exchange, pays the costs.\n\n\u201cWe treat issues with privacy and security with the utmost seriousness and have from the beginning,\u201d he testified.\n\nMaximus\u2019 contract with Access Health includes provisions related to security breaches and loss of data, requiring the call center contractor to notify the exchange and state attorney general within 24 hours after discovering or becoming suspicious about a breach or loss. The contract also requires Maximus to provide and pay for credit monitoring by all people affected by a breach.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/08/obamacare-client-data-was-in-exchange-call-center-workers-bag/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, data breach, Jason Madrak, Kevin Counihan, Maximus, Obamacare, Rep.
