In its efforts to combat fraud and ensure hospices are meeting the program\u2019s conditions of participation, the Office of Inspector General investigated the Medicare survey process of hospices in 2007, finding that hospices were not surveyed often enough.\n\nIn 2007, OIG found that the average recertification survey occurred every nine years. The agency recommended to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that more frequent recertification surveys become the standard. CMS disagreed then, and again this summer, when OIG followed up on the 2007 report, finding that the frequency of surveys had not improved and once again recommended increased frequency of surveys, suggesting surveys be done every three years, which is the interval used by accrediting agencies approved by CMS.\n\nThose in the hospice community understand that CMS and the states don\u2019t have the resources for more frequent surveys, however, the industry seems ready to step up.\n\n\u201cThere is a cost associated with it, but there\u2019s also in basic compliance as well as in any quality improvement program an investment on the part of the healthcare provider to improve their care and their delivery mechanisms, and I think the hospice community is committed to that,\u201d said Keyserling.\n\nOne solution would be to require hospices to be surveyed on a three-year basis by one of the accrediting agencies, such as the Joint Commission, said Jay Analovitch, managing partner of operations at CURO Healthcare Solutions, an operator of seven hospice communities across 10 states.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this is a good use of monies as greater cooperation and review and mutual oversight would be accomplished by raising best practices for all hospice agencies to a national standard,\u201d he said.\n\nPaying out-of-pocket for an accrediting agency to conduct surveys would be something Mission Healthcare, which operates hospices and home care services in southern California, would be willing to do if it was the standard and all hospices were subject to the same scrutiny, said Kerry Pawl, one of Mission\u2019s founders and owners.\n\nWhile paying out-of-pocket will be a strain for many hospices, the benefits far outweigh the financial burden, said Malene Davis, chief executive officer of Capital Caring, a provider of palliative care and hospice services in the greater Washington, D.C. area.\n\n\u201cWhat a survey does for you is it tightens the organization back up,\u201d she said. It is a learning opportunity that helps the hospice continually be the best operationally, and for patients and their families.\n\n\u201cThe public needs some guarantee that when they sign up and when they give the right to their Medicare benefits to the hospice, they must have some \u2026 assurance that this place meets the basic criteria of what a hospice is supposed to be,\u201d she said, \u201cand the only way you can guarantee that is someone coming in and inspecting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/more-medicare-surveys-please", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1013-HFN-CC-hospice-davis.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Being surveyed to participate in the Medicare program is usually seen as an onerous task by most healthcare facilities, but the hospice community wants to be surveyed more frequently, even if the cost of those surveys comes out of its own pocket.", "title": "More Medicare surveys, please"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1013-HFN-CC-hospice-davis.jpg"}, "description": "Being surveyed to participate in the Medicare program is usually seen as an onerous task by most healthcare facilities, but the hospice community wants to be surveyed more frequently, even if the cost of those surveys comes out of its own pocket.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "More Medicare surveys, please"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Being surveyed to participate in the Medicare program is usually seen as an onerous task by most healthcare facilities, but the hospice community wants to be surveyed more frequently, even if the cost of those surveys comes out of its own pocket.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8b0\"", "article_summary": "The agency recommended to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that more frequent recertification surveys become the standard.\nCMS disagreed then, and again this summer, when OIG followed up on the 2007 report, finding that the frequency of surveys had not improved and once again recommended increased frequency of surveys, suggesting surveys be done every three years, which is the interval used by accrediting agencies approved by CMS.\nThose in the hospice community understand that CMS and the states don\u2019t have the resources for more frequent surveys, however, the industry seems ready to step up.\n[See also: Study finds hospice industry has experienced turbulence]The hospice community has been growing quickly in recent years, with Medicare paying an increasingly larger chunk of payments to those hospices.\nBeing surveyed to participate in the Medicare program is usually seen as an onerous task by most healthcare facilities, but the hospice community wants to be surveyed more frequently, even if the cost of those surveys comes out of its own pocket."}
