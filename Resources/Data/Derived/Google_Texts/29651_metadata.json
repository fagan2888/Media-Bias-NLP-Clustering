Indeed, the Obama administration has already lost unanimously 20 times, having passed in its first five years the Bush DOJ\u2019s number across two full terms (15).\n\nWhile it\u2019s still too early to make conclusions about the current Supreme Court session, in its previous three terms\u2014effectively in the 30 months from January 2012 to June 2014\u2014the government\u2019s goose-egg rate was three times Bush and double Clinton (23 in eight years).\n\nAgain, those are statistics for cases in which President Obama failed to pick up even the votes of his own nominees. The overall rate looks even worse: in the last two terms, the solicitor general\u2019s office won 39 and 55 percent of its cases, against a 50-year average of about 70 percent.\n\nSince some people think that overall rate isn\u2019t a fair measure given that five of the nine justices were appointed by Republican presidents\u2014although the government record in 5-4 cases isn\u2019t bad\u2014let\u2019s stick to the recent cases where the justices fully agreed.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, the high court ruled unanimously against the government in such disparate areas as religious liberty, criminal procedure, property rights, immigration, securities regulation, tax law, and the presidential recess-appointment power. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\n1. In Hosanna-Tabor Church v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2012), the government sued a church school that fired a teacher for violating one of the church\u2019s religious tenets. The unanimous court ruled that punishing a church for failing to retain an unwanted teacher in this context violates the First Amendment.\n\n2. In United States v. Jones (2012), the government claimed the power to attach a GPS device to a suspected drug dealer\u2019s car and monitor his movements without a warrant. While the justices had differing opinions on why this action violated the Fourth Amendment, all agreed it was unconstitutional.\n\n3. In Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (2012), the government denied property owners the right to challenge an order to stop building their house. The court ruled that access to courts is the least the government can provide in response to \u201cthe strong-arming of regulated parties\u201d by federal agencies.\n\n4. While the conventional wisdom regarding Arizona v. United States (2012) is that the high court smacked down a perniciously anti-immigrant state, Arizona actually won unanimously on its most controversial \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision. Not a single justice accepted the government\u2019s theory that mere enforcement priorities trump state laws. In what may foreshadow the ultimate result of the 25-state challenge to President Obama\u2019s latest executive actions on immigration\u2014now on appeal after the government lost in district court\u2014the unanimous Supreme Court rejected that breathtaking claim of \u201cpre-emption by executive whim.\u201d\n\n5. In Arkansas Fish & Game Commission v. United States (2013), the government argued that damage caused by temporary flooding didn\u2019t merit compensation under the Fifth Amendment\u2014even though Supreme Court precedent holds temporary physical invasions and permanent flooding to be takings. Justice Ginsburg, not a noted conservative, wrote the Court\u2019s ruling for the property owners.\n\n6. In Gabelli v. SEC (2013), the government argued that it can prosecute people regardless of any statutes of limitations, depending on when it discovers malfeasance. The 9-0 Court found that the government, with all its investigative tools, has to bring charges within a reasonable time so that the justice system can operate effectively.\n\n7. In Horne v. Department of Agriculture (2013), the government, not having learned its lesson from Sackett, claimed that raisin farmers weren\u2019t entitled to judicial review of a byzantine New Deal-era program that confiscated crops in an attempt to regulate prices. The Court again allowed plaintiffs their day in court.\n\n8. In Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled that the government needs to get a warrant if it wants to search the digital information stored on the cell phones of people it arrests.\n\n9. In Noel Canning v. National Labor Relations Board (2014)\u2014in what was perhaps the most surprising case to garner all of the Democratic appointees\u2019 votes\u2014the Court invalidated President Obama\u2019s NLRB appointments essentially because the Senate had not declared a recess when he made them.\n\nThe government\u2019s arguments across this wide variety of cases would essentially allow the executive branch to do whatever it wants without meaningful constitutional restraint. This position conflicts with another unanimous decision, Bond v. United States (2011). Bond vindicated a criminal defendant\u2019s right to challenge her federal prosecution. As Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cfederalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power. When government acts in excess of its lawful powers, that liberty is at stake.\u201d\n\nCuriously, Bond again came before the Court in 2014\u2014on the question of whether a weapons-trafficking statute could be used against someone who used household chemicals in a bizarre revenge plot\u2014and again the government lost unanimously. Perhaps that\u2019s a harbinger for Horne\u2019s return to the Court, now also on the merits of the underlying (raisin-takings) claim.\n\nThese cases have nothing in common, other than the government\u2019s view that citizens must subsume their liberty to whatever the experts in a given field determine the best policy to be. If the government can\u2019t get even one of the liberal justices to agree with it on any of these unrelated issues, there\u2019s something seriously wrong with its constitutional vision.\n\nIn short, if the government loses in this term\u2019s Obamacare case, it won\u2019t be because its lawyers had a bad day in court or because the justices followed their political preferences. It will be because this administration continues to make legal arguments that don\u2019t pass the smell test.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda04e\"", "article_summary": "The unanimous court ruled that punishing a church for failing to retain an unwanted teacher in this context violates the First Amendment.\nThis position conflicts with another unanimous decision, Bond v.
