And at a maximum I may do something else,\u201d Trump has told Reuters.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn further good news for the US economy, he has also assured his Twitter followers that he\u2019s not remotely interested in introducing a carbon tax either.\n\n.@thehill Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect\u2014it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2016\n\nThis was in response to claims by one of his energy advisers \u2013 Rep Kevin Kramer of North Dakota, an avowed climate skeptic \u2013 that a small carbon tax might make sense as a vacuous political gesture for the mob.\n\n\u201cHe can do all that if he wants,\u201d Cramer said of Trump\u2019s climate position, according toReuters . \u201cBut my advice would be, while I\u2019m a skeptic, as well, he is a product of political populism, and political populism believes that there needs [to be] some addressing of climate change.\u201d\n\nTrump is having none of it. He has long made it perfectly clear exactly what he thinks about \u2018global warming.\u2019\n\nIt snowed over 4 inches this past weekend in New York City. It is still October. So much for Global Warming. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2011\n\nIn the 1920\u2019s people were worried about global cooling\u2013it never happened. Now it\u2019s global warming. Give me a break! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2012\n\nGlobal warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leaked http://t.co/5BeAhats \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2012\n\nThe people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2013\n\nGive me clean, beautiful and healthy air \u2013 not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014\n\nThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012\n\nThe last one, he claimed on Fox and Friends, was a joke. Before going on to double down by suggesting, no actually, that he meant every word.\n\n\u201cI think that climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve received many environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China \u2014 obviously I joke \u2014 but this done for the benefit of China.\u201d He added: \u201cBecause China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you can burn. They couldn\u2019t care less. Their standards are nothing. But in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it\u2019s very hard on our business.\u201d\n\nIf Trump does stick to his guns on climate change as US president, then the damage it will do to the climatist religion is almost incalculable. Global warming is the most expensive scam in world history, costing the global economy an annual $1.5 trillion.\n\nIf a significant chunk of those wasted resources were to be diverted to more productive sectors of the economy, the disruption would be enormous \u2013 hugely profitable to those in currently penalized sectors like fossil fuel and heavy industry, agonizingly painful to those crony-capitalist businesses (especially those in the so-called \u201cclean energy\u201d sector) which depend for their existence on handouts from the taxpayer.\n\nHence the wailing and gnashing of teeth from the usual suspects:\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s denunciation of the Paris climate accord is not only short sighted, but would be terribly costly for America and our ability to lead the world. We cannot go backwards on this important step towards a clean energy economy that benefits all our families,\u201d billionaire environmental financier Tom Steyer said in a statement.\n\nWhen you\u2019re taking flak it means you\u2019re over the target.\n\nWherever you stand on any of Trump\u2019s other proposed policies, his stance on climate change is sensible, courageous, well-informed and, perhaps best of all, absolutely guaranteed to annoy the hell out of all the people in the world who most deserve to be annoyed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump has promised to nix the COP21 Paris climate treaty if and when he becomes U.S. president.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump has promised to nix the COP21 Paris climate treaty if and when he becomes U.S. president.", "title": "Trump Vows To Nix Paris Climate Treaty", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/donald-trump.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/05/18/trump-vows-to-nix-paris-climate-treaty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump has promised to nix the COP21 Paris climate treaty if and when he becomes U.S. president.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/donald-trump.jpg", "title": "Trump Vows To Nix Paris Climate Treaty", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "$1.5 trillion, China, Climate Change, Donald Trump, Global Warming, Kevin Kramer, skeptic, tom steyer,Big Government, Breitbart London, Environment,trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "tom steyer", "published_time": "2016-05-18T08:57:45-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart London,Environment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Donald J.
