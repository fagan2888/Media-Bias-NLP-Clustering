What is odd to me and many is that such an article would be published without a broader understanding of health care. Optometrists and ophthalmologists both applaud the fact that the Affordable Care Act pays for a child with conditions warranting an annual eye exam to get one. The same hopefully holds true for those needing dermatology, orthopedic or even cardiac exams annually. But health care payment reform has not dictated when such exams are needed. It has not suggested that healthy, symptom-free children need formal eye examinations at all.\n\nAt face value, most individuals see a single, mandatory eye exam in children as a good thing. Yet many organizations in health care and public health are unified in the belief that the best investment to catch kids with eye problems is through building up evidence-based screening programs.\n\nIt is true that in Minnesota, ophthalmologists prefer investment in proven vision-screening programs that extend from a child\u2019s birth, through every pediatric visit, through school and beyond instead of a set exam for certain conditions at a given age. A comprehensive exam has simply never been shown to be better than a longitudinal series of screening exams. Despite lack or paucity of evidence to justify the greater expense, four states have decided to try mandatory eye exams. Yet I know of 14 others that have looked carefully at the high value of screening and have realized that the best investment of taxpayer dollars is in bolstering such efforts. Many have modeled their programs after the one we have in Minnesota.\n\nThe article tried to paint this as some sort of turf war between Minnesota eye care providers. Again, the issue goes far beyond our own eye doctors and touches the hearts of many who care for our kids across the country. Vision screening programs have been equipped, proven effective and defended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Nurses, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Association of Certified Orthoptists, the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, and the Children\u2019s Eye Foundation, to name a few. In addition, various groups for teachers, state health departments and public health programs have looked at the data and support screening. Plus, I can\u2019t say enough about the steadfast support by Lions International in states that don\u2019t have their own programs.\n\nWould I enjoy further state investment in detecting and treating pediatric eye disease? You bet. But I am not interested in spending massive amounts of taxpayer or federal dollars to examine healthy, well-functioning children who have passed vision screening year after year. Children who don\u2019t fit that description are already triaged into the eye health care system. And the data show that we do a good job of that. What makes me excited is the research showing that, with investment, we are doing vision screening better than ever. We have affordable, handheld technologies in pediatricians\u2019 offices and schools today that detect vision problems and eye disease in seconds. In some cases, I think, these technologies do a better job than an eye exam.\n\nAnd consider the time saved for those who would otherwise have to take time off work, and take children out of school, for a mandatory exam. Consider the benefit to children with vision symptoms and real problems if the healthy ones don\u2019t have to bog down the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nVision screening in Minnesota is worth celebrating and fostering, not replacing at higher expense. Ophthalmologists know it; research proves it, and I hope the Star Tribune and our legislators can champion it.\n\nDr. Erick D.
