But Catholics now have a new alternative to the escalating financial and moral predicaments of health insurance under Obamacare, with the creation of the first-ever Catholic health-care sharing ministry.\n\nOn Oct. 2, the Christ Medicus Foundation (CMF) and Samaritan Ministries International (SMI) held a press conference in Washington to launch a new initiative called CMF CURO (from the Latin \u201cto heal\u201d) that fulfills the health-care requirement of the Affordable Care Act, but in a way that is both affordable and consistent with Catholic teaching.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to launch CMF CURO, because we think it will be quite a change in Catholic health care,\u201d CMF CURO Director Louis Brown said at Thursday\u2019s launch event.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, individuals are exempt from the health-coverage mandate without purchasing insurance policies if they belong to what the government recognizes as \u201chealth-care sharing ministries\u201d formed before 1999, such as Samaritan Ministries, a Christian health-care sharing ministry.\n\nHealth-sharing ministries are unique, in that they operate differently than traditional insurance providers and are not subject to federal or state contraception and abortion mandates. Instead of sending premiums to a third-party provider, the members of a health-sharing ministry have a set monthly portion (based on household type) called their \u201cshare,\u201d which they send directly to another member who has a medical bill published by the ministry. The collected shares are then used to pay that members\u2019 medical expenses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sending it directly to the individual in need, not a company, so you know where the money is going,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe added that the new initiative between CMF and Samaritan \u201cwill allow Catholics to practice their faith, utilize affordable access to health care for themselves and their family, protect religious liberty and the individual right of conscience and, most important, affirm the gospel of life.\u201d\n\nThe launch of CMF CURO as an option for Catholics is timely. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office reported Sept. 15 that insurance companies were widely ignoring rules designed to prevent federal funds from subsidizing abortion coverage.\n\nChrist-Centered and Consumer-Driven\n\nMore than 300,000 Americans belong to recognized health-care sharing ministries, where members share the yearly burdens of more than $200 million in health-care costs, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries.\n\nThe new Catholic health ministry\u2019s members will be part of Samaritan Ministries International, the largest Christian health-care sharing ministry with more than 37,000 households or 125,000 Christian members.\n\nAs a member representative of SMI, CMF CURO excludes sharing of medical expenses from procedures at odds with Church teaching, such as abortion, sterilization and in vitro fertilization. But the health-care sharing model also touts advantages over the health-insurance model, where increasing premiums, high deductibles and limitations on doctors and procedures come into play.\n\n\u201cOne of our principles is that health care should be consumer-driven,\u201d said Anthony Hopp, Samaritan Ministries\u2019 director of membership development. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have government, the insurance company or anybody telling you what to do for your family \u2014 you should make those decisions.\u201d\n\nHopp said SMI does \u201cdue diligence\u201d with cost comparison, but the goal is to make sure it is \u201cvery easy for a member to get the kind of care they want.\u201d\n\nBrown said that CMF CURO has \u201cno network\u201d of preferred health providers, making it far more portable than traditional health insurance. Instead, members choose their own health-care providers, and the final medical bill is sent to Samaritan Ministries for approval.\n\n\u201cSomeone could be in Paris, Geneva or Timbuktu; as long as we can translate the bill, they get the health-care cost-sharing,\u201d he said.\n\nHow It Works\n\nCMF CURO members are part of the SMI sharing ministry, but they have some unique benefits over other Samaritan members.\n\nMembers get a VISA debit card that doubles as their CMF CURO membership card. Medical-service providers submit the bill to the health-sharing ministry\u2019s pricing administrator, which prices the services at 125% of what Medicare pays. Expenses over $300 are published for sharing, and the received shares are directly deposited into the debit-card account.\n\n\u201cAll this is half or less the cost of traditional health insurance through an insurance company,\u201d said CMF co-founder David Wilson, explaining that it could fit the needs of the uninsured, the self-employed, small-business employers or those seeking an option to supplement their Medicare.\n\nThe cost-sharing burden depends on household type. For example, an individual over age 26 has a monthly sharing contribution of $264 a month, while a two-parent household pays $489 a month.\n\nUnlike insurance companies, the health-care ministry\u2019s members must vote to approve any increase of the set monthly share amounts.\n\nThe program works by making members directly responsible for health costs up to $300, such as preventative health maintenance. Expenses between $300 and $250,000 are published for sharing among members. During the year, members are responsible for paying the first $300 of their first three sharable needs, but any reductions in price they can negotiate against that initial $300. All medical expenses for needs after that are 100% shared.\n\nCMF CURO members are also enrolled in the SMI Save to Share program, which can provide additional protection for medical needs exceeding $250,000. The CMF CURO fund will meet members\u2019 unshared expenses not covered up to $1,000,000 or help pay for treatments not covered by SMI, such as NaPro natural fertility treatments.\n\n\u201cWe really believe it is sustainable, affordable health care,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nHe said that 80% of health-care costs are driven by lifestyle, and members of churches have generally proved healthier than the general population.\n\nMembership in CMF CURO requires that a pastor certify one is a practicing Christian who goes to church at least three times a month. Non-Catholic Christians can join as well, but all members are expected to refrain from smoking \u2014 barring the special occasion \u2014 and any immoderate consumption of alcohol.\n\nCMF CURO also comes with online tools for health and wellness management, health assessments and nutrition and exercise tracking tools.\n\nPrayer\n\nA key feature of health-sharing ministries is that members are asked to pray for the other members to whom they are sending their monthly share to pay for those medical needs.\n\nBrown said they want to build on that, with plans to form a call center for members in need of prayer.\n\n\u201cGod willing, over the next six months, we\u2019ll be building a team of volunteers that will be able to pray with people and ask the Lord\u2019s intercession and blessing for them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pre-registration began Oct. 2, and the enrollment period begins Dec. 15 to have membership by Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nMichael O\u2019Dea, the founder of the Christ Medicus Foundation, said that with the HHS contraceptive mandate, Catholics will have few other alternatives for obtaining health care that completely adheres to Church teachings. While dioceses may be able to get religious exemptions from the mandate, Catholic small-business employers do not have that luxury.\n\nO\u2019Dea said he believes faithful Catholics will welcome the new option that CMF CURO provides.\n\n\u201cWe think, once they get educated, they\u2019re going to want to be part of this program.\u201d\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith is the Register's Washington correspondent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CMF CURO aims to fulfill the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, but in a way that is both\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "CMF CURO aims to fulfill the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, but in a way that is both affordable and consistent with Catholic t...", "title": "New Catholic Health Initiative Provides Alternative to Obamacare Insurance", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/new-catholic-health-initiative-provides-alternative-to-obamacare-insurance/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/PressClub04.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/new-catholic-health-initiative-provides-alternative-to-obamacare-insurance/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/PressClub04.jpg", "description": "CMF CURO aims to fulfill the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, but in a way that is both affordable and consistent with Catholic t...", "card": "summary", "title": "New Catholic Health Initiative Provides Alternative to Obamacare Insurance"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, affordable care act, catholic, christ medicus foundation, health care, health care sharing ministry, louis brown, michael o'dea, national catholic register", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9034\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to launch CMF CURO, because we think it will be quite a change in Catholic health care,\u201d CMF CURO Director Louis Brown said at Thursday\u2019s launch event.\nBut Catholics now have a new alternative to the escalating financial and moral predicaments of health insurance under Obamacare, with the creation of the first-ever Catholic health-care sharing ministry.\nCMF CURO also comes with online tools for health and wellness management, health assessments and nutrition and exercise tracking tools.\n\u201cOne of our principles is that health care should be consumer-driven,\u201d said Anthony Hopp, Samaritan Ministries\u2019 director of membership development.\nO\u2019Dea said he believes faithful Catholics will welcome the new option that CMF CURO provides."}
