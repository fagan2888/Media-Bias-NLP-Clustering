He’s headed back to New York — but he left his heart in San Francisco.

Mayor de Blasio gushed about the “wonderful” liberal City by the Bay in a radio interview there Friday, as he wound up a four-day trip to promote his progressive agenda — what some wags have called his cross-country “Socialism Rocks!” tour.

“This is a wonderful, progressive town,” de Blasio told listeners on KQED ­Radio after being introduced as arguably “the new star of the party’s left wing.”

“I salute the people of San Francisco!” he said, before fielding softball questions from area callers, something he doesn’t do in his more hardball-flinging hometown.

The Frisco fandom was Hizzoner’s latest applause for a city outside New York.

In late April, de Blasio told a Milwaukee audience that people give him the finger when he attends baseball games in New York.

And de Blasio also complained to Rolling Stone magazine that “a lot of people outside New York City” appreciate him more than New Yorkers do, a comment he stood by in an interview with Salon.

But for all the good will from the Democratic Party’s progressive wing, de Blasio, who’s set to return to New York Saturday, has found himself on the outs with key party leaders.

On Thursday, President Obama dismissed de Blasio’s 13-point progressive agenda — which urges such national reforms as a $15 minimum wage, universal pre-K and affordable housing.

“It was basically my agenda,” the president shrugged.

On Friday, de Blasio returned the snub, telling ­Salon.com that ObamaCare is all well and good, but “I think we have to go farther.”

In an another interview released Friday, this time with The Nation, de Blasio went further, blasting Washington Dems for not leaning far enough to the left.

“There is a blindness in our party,” he said. “I’ve spoken about the problem of a money-heavy, consultant-heavy political culture,” he added, complaining that “many people in the party have moved away from our historic values.”
