However, he signaled in December that the probe wasn\u2019t going well and that it had failed to turn up much evidence to back up the initial claims about the NSA's snooping.\n\n\"The accusation cannot be proven in a legally sound way under criminal law,\u201d his office acknowledged on Friday, according to the BBC.\n\nIn part, closure of the investigation turns the page on the period of troubled relations between Washington and Berlin.\n\nPresident Obama traveled to Germany to meet with other leaders of the Group of Seven nations last weekend. He appeared to take pains to put the tensions behind him.\n\nAccording to the White House, the alleged eavesdropping did not come up in Obama\u2019s meeting with Merkel. Press secretary Josh Earnest called the omission \u201can indication that of all of the priorities that our two countries have.\u201d\n\nStill, the spying has not been swept entirely under the rug.\n\nA committee in Germany\u2019s parliament is continuing to investigate the NSA, though that panel seemed not to have made significant progress, either.\n\nLast week, the Senate passed and Obama signed legislation to end the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records and make its spying more transparent. For Americans, the phone records program was the most controversial of the NSA programs revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in the summer of 2013.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Previously high tensions between the U.S. and Germany are cooling.", "description": "Previously high tensions between the U.S. and Germany are cooling.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Previously high tensions between the U.S. and Germany are cooling.", "title": "Germany drops probe into Merkel phone tap", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/244795-germany-drops-yearlong-nsa-probe", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/merkelangela_012914getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-12T11:43:13-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-12T11:43-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/244795-germany-drops-yearlong-nsa-probe", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-12T08:41-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Security Agency, Germany,Angela Merkel, Harald Range,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-12T08:41:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T11:43:13-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/244795-germany-drops-yearlong-nsa-probe", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Previously high tensions between the U.S. and Germany are cooling.", "card": "summary", "title": "Germany drops probe into Merkel phone tap"}, "dcterms.title": "Germany drops probe into Merkel phone tap"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd946\"", "article_summary": "Germany\u2019s top prosecutor on Friday abandoned a yearlong investigation into reports that U.S. spies monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nLast week, the Senate passed and Obama signed legislation to end the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records and make its spying more transparent.\nFor Americans, the phone records program was the most controversial of the NSA programs revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in the summer of 2013.\nAccording to the White House, the alleged eavesdropping did not come up in Obama\u2019s meeting with Merkel.\nPresident Obama traveled to Germany to meet with other leaders of the Group of Seven nations last weekend."}
