The ATF lost track of more than 1,000 of the weapons, including two that turned up at the scene of Brian Terry\u2019s death in December 2010.\n\nAnother Fast and Furious weapon smuggled into Mexico was used to kill American Immigration Customs Enforcement officer Jaime Zapata in Mexico in February, 2011.\n\nThe Obama administration has stonewalled congressional investigators for years over Fast and Furious. In June 2012, Holder became the first attorney general in United States history to be held in contempt of Congress on a largely party-line vote.\n\nIn his letter, Terry brands Holder a \u201ccoward of an attorney general\u201d and demands that he live up to his oath of office.\n\n\u201cWhy hide behind executive privilege? \u2026 Somewhere deep inside you must have some conscience; do the honorable thing and have some integrity as an attorney general,\u201d Terry wrote.\n\n\u201cSo I ask you: stop misleading my family and the American people.
