He sees the governor\u2019s action as a way to appeal to more conservative values.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been able to get a lot of publicity as the anti-establishment candidate, the one that kind of is not going along with all of the Republican values,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in this particular situation, this is something that most Republicans agree with.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Mahoning County Republican Party, Mark Munroe, says that Kasich signing the bill isn\u2019t a make or break for his presidential campaign. He says voters need to look at each candidate closely before voting.\n\n\u201cSlowly, surely, people are going to learn about just what kind of a guy he is, and you know the last votes have not been cast yet. I think there\u2019s still a good possibility John Kasich may find a way to get to the White House.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s presidential primary is March 15th.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
