Two men were severely burned when they tried to make hash oil in this bathroom of a Tigard convenience store, Nov. 23, 2014 (TVF&R)

TIGARD, Ore. (KOIN 6) â€” Two men were severely burned when they allegedly tried to get hash oil from marijuana inside the bathroom at a convenience store in Tigard.

An explosion at the 76 Gas Station and Food Mart, 10775 SW Greenburg Road, was reported around 1:50 a.m., authorities said. When crews arrived, they discovered the bathroom was significantly damaged and a small fire had spread into the false ceiling.

The fire was quickly put out and the food mart suffered some smoke damage.

Police determined two men had been in the bathroom at the time of the explosion and used an extinguisher to put out the initial fire. The men, Dennis Tapia, 18, and 23-year-old Jose Rios, then took themselves to a hospital for treatment of their burns.

They later were transferred from Providence St. Vincent to the Legacy Oregon Burn Center for treatment. Their conditions are not available at this time.

The TVF&R investigator found the men were trying to get hash oil from pot and used a heat gun. That ignited butane gas and caused a fire and explosion.

The investigation continues. No charges have yet been filed.
