That is, there\u2019s a big gap between how many hours people estimate they \u201cusually\u201d work versus how many hours they log when asked to keep a time diary, especially for people who already keep long hours. (The typical person who reported having worked 40 hours, for example, actually worked about 37; people who claimed a usual week of 75 hours worked 50.) This discrepancy could be due to fuzzy memories, or a desire to sound more industrious, or both.\n\nThe same problems may plague self-reports of shut-eye.\n\nA recent Gallup report, based on a survey question about how much time people \u201cusually\u201d sleep, says the average American gets 6.8 hours of slumber a night.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s 2012 American Time Use Survey, on the other hand, reports an average of 8.7 hours. The latter is based on a sort of day-after time diary; respondents are interviewed about how they spent their time on the previous day, for each hour of the day. Here are the numbers broken down by age and sex.\n\nPhoto\n\nMaybe there\u2019s some difference in how people interpret the Gallup versus American Time Use Survey question. For example, Americans might tell the Labor Department that they spent the hours of 11 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. asleep, when a decent chunk of that time was actually spent tossing and turning and obsessively checking the alarm clock. And maybe when Gallup asks about \u201cusual\u201d hours of sleep, respondents instead count only the successfully unconscious portion.\n\nThe surveyed populations are also slightly different (18 and older for Gallup, versus 15 and older for the Labor Department), and teenagers do sleep more than the rest of population \u2014 but the inclusion of a few more teenagers seems unlikely to increase the overall average by nearly two full hours. Even the age range with the fewest hours of sleep on average (people around 45 to 54 years old) still report substantially more sleep than the overall Gallup numbers suggest.\n\nMaybe, as with estimated versus documented working hours, people just systematically exaggerate their industriousness when asked abstractly about their daily habits. I suspect that has to do with the workaholic American culture, but people in Belgium, Russia, China and Japan have also been found to overstate their work hours, based on similar metrics. I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s evidence that people from these or other countries also might understate their slumber time; if you know, feel free to mention it in the comments.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140116144208, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 16, 2014", "keywords": "Gallup Poll,Polls and Public Opinion,Sleep,Working Hours,United States,Uncategorized", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/You Sleep More Than You Claim You Do ( 20140116 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Catherine Rampell", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Catherine Rampell", "byl": "Catherine Rampell", "twitter": {"description": "When asked how much sleep they \u201cusually\u201d get, Americans estimate just 6.8 hours.
