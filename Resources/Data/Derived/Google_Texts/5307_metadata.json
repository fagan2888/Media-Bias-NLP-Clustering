About half of those who qualify for coverage on the health law\u2019s exchanges, or marketplaces, are ages 18 to 34, \u201cwhich means they might not think they need insurance,\u201d Burwell quipped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAffordability continues to be a challenge, she said. Even with the law\u2019s financial help to pay for premiums and out-of-pocket costs, some uninsured may simply not have the money to pay for coverage.\n\nAlmost 40 percent of the uninsured who qualify for marketplace coverage earn between 139 and 250 percent of the poverty level, about $30,000 to $60,000 a year for a family of four, Burwell said. Nearly 60 percent of the uninsured are either confused about how the tax credits work or don\u2019t know that they are available, and about half of the uninsured have less than $100 in savings, Burwell said.\n\nTo reach the approximately 10.5 million uninsured, agency officials plan to use data accumulated over the last two health law enrollment campaigns, such as information about where the uninsured live and what sorts of messages might convince them to purchase coverage, senior HHS officials said Tuesday. Email and social media campaigns that encourage people who have started their applications to finish them, or to promote awareness about the law\u2019s financial assistance that is available to help people purchase coverage and pay out-of-pocket costs, will be key. While there\u2019s \u201cno silver bullet\u201d to increasing enrollment, \u201cwe have to keep chipping away at it,\u201d a senior agency official said.\n\nOutreach and enrollment efforts will be focused on five targeted areas \u2014 Dallas, Houston, Northern New Jersey, Chicago and Miami \u2014 where there are large numbers of uninsured who qualify for the law\u2019s financial assistance.\n\nBefore open enrollment Nov. 1, potential enrollees will be able to see more information about health plans on HealthCare.gov, the law\u2019s official website, and the enrollment process will be streamlined, Burwell said. HealthCare.gov\u2019s toll free call center and in-person assisters will also play a key role since many people, especially in communities of color, prefer that kind of help, she said.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that there will be bumps along the way and things won\u2019t always go as we plan,\u201d Burwell said. \u201cBut we have a process in place \u2013 one that\u2019s been tested and refined \u2013 in order to deal with those bumps.\u201d\n\nMajor problems with HealthCare.gov caused headaches during the law\u2019s first open enrollment season.\n\nBurwell said the agency\u2019s goals for the upcoming enrollment season, which ends Dec. 15, are to \u201cimprove the consumer experience, retain our current customers and increase our enrollment.\u201d By the end of this year, HHS expects 9.1 million individuals will have coverage through the federal and state health insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, she said. HHS officials have yet to announce an enrollment goal for 2016.\n\nIn conjunction with Burwell\u2019s remarks, HHS officials said Tuesday that as of mid-September, an estimated 17.6 million uninsured people have gained health insurance through the law\u2019s various sources of coverage, including the marketplaces, the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion and the individual market. Between Oct. 2013 and Sept. 12 of this year, the uninsured rate for African Americans declined by just over 10 percent, for Hispanics it declined 11.5 percent and for whites the rate declined by 6 percent, according to the HHS analysis.\n\nSince its passage, Republicans have fought vigorously to repeal the health law while Democrats and President Obama have defended it. An audience member Tuesday asked Burwell what would happen to the law if a Republican were elected president in 2016. Republicans now control both chambers of Congress and may do so in the next Congress as well. Burwell said she thought the law would stay in place even under GOP control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that we would go back to a place where you can\u2019t get coverage because of pre-existing conditions\u201d or that women would pay more than men for the same health insurance plan. \u201cI think that as a nation we have moved beyond (it). \u2026 That is baked in the system,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
