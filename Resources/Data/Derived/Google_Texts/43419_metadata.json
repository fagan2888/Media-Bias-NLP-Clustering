The law was first passed in 1868 and the punishment was up to two years in prison and a $300 fine.\n\nBecause of the way the law was worded, the law did not apply to same-sex couples.\n\n\u201cIf any man and woman, not being married to each other, lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together, they shall be guilty of a second degree misdemeanor,\u201d the former law stated.\n\nDuring the session, Richard Stark, Democrat, co-sponsored the repeal and argued on the House floor that the ban had affected not just young singles but seniors as well.\n\n\u201cI represent communities of seniors, where a lot of them are technically not married,\u201d Stark said. \u201cThey are living together, but it makes more sense financially or for whatever reason like Social Security to not be married. I don\u2019t think that they want to be considered to be violating the law.\u201d\n\nThe measure passed unanimously in the Senate but drew five \u201cno\u201d votes in the House, all from Republicans, including Republican Jennifer Sullivan of Mount Dora, the youngest member of the Legislature at 24.\n\nScott signed the bill without issuing a comment.\n\nBills to repeal the cohabitation ban have been floated in the Legislature in recent years but were never consummated. The repeal leaves Michigan and Mississippi as the only states left with cohabitation bans still on the books.\n\nSource: \u2018Shacking up\u2019 now legal in Florida after Gov.
