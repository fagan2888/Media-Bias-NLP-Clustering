And I believe it\u2019s because I had incredible parents. And mostly I had a great mother who taught me to respect myself.\u201d\n\nWhile not wanting to impose her own values on others, Osmond explains how the choices one makes ultimately define the direction of a career, citing other successful women who have opted for alternate routes than her own, such as Cher and Madonna.\n\nUltimately, she tells the \"Piers Morgan Live\" host, it\u2019s all about individuality.\n\n\u201cI just know that some people love it and some people don\u2019t find it appealing for their children,\" she says of Cyrus' brand. \"And she gets to make those choices.\u201d\n\nWatch the above clip for more of her analysis of the modern entertainment industry, and for complete coverage of Piers Morgan's interview with Marie Osmond, watch \"Piers Morgan Live\" on CNN at 9.\n\n-\u2013\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter and join the conversation using #pml\n\n\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coming up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan welcomes the sole female member of the legendary Osmond clan, and one half of a famous brother/sister Las Vegas performing duo, as Marie Osmond joins him in studio for a primetime, face to face interview.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Piers Morgan asks Marie Osmond the pressing question,  \u201cDo you Twerk?\u201d", "og": {"url": "http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/11/piers-morgan-asks-marie-osmond-the-pressing-question-do-you-twerk/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131011184811-pmt-marie-osmond-on-miley-cyrus-00002418-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Coming up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan welcomes the sole female member of the legendary Osmond clan, and one half of a famous brother/sister Las Vegas performing duo, as Marie Osmond joins him in studio for a primetime, face to face interview.", "title": "Piers Morgan asks Marie Osmond the pressing question,  \u201cDo you Twerk?\u201d"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Piers Morgan", "keywords": "the piers morgan interview, deb daly", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/169bdd3c913ad32d5e743b1d82ca1052?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd855b\"", "article_summary": "-\u2013\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Twitter and join the conversation using #pml\u00bb Follow \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Instagram\nUltimately, she tells the \"Piers Morgan Live\" host, it\u2019s all about individuality.\n\"And she gets to make those choices.\u201dWatch the above clip for more of her analysis of the modern entertainment industry, and for complete coverage of Piers Morgan's interview with Marie Osmond, watch \"Piers Morgan Live\" on CNN at 9.\nComing up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan welcomes the sole female member of the legendary Osmond clan, and one half of a famous brother/sister Las Vegas performing duo, as Marie Osmond joins him in studio for a primetime, face to face interview.\n\u201cI think she knew exactly what she was doing.\u201dAsked if her career had ever tempted her to do something \u201cnaughty,\u201d Osmond answers clearly and proudly."}
