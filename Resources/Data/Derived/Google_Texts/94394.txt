Eight years ago, Obama said he wanted to fundamentally change this country. He gave us Obamacare, which has become a nightmare for consumers and has co-ops dropping out.



He gave us open borders, endangering us while securing Democrat votes.



He gave us a Middle East more unstable than ever and infected with terrorists.



He vilified our police resulting in many afraid to perform their jobs.



He reduced the armed forces despite increased threats from abroad.



He has exacerbated race relations, damaging needed gains in that area.



He has thrown Israel, a strong ally, under the bus while signing a dangerous nuclear pact with Iran which is governed by extremists.



He has dictated to schools a program allowing people unsure of their gender to use a bathroom of their choice.



He has chastised Christians while praising Islam.



He has widened the gap between rich and poor, while the income of the middle class earners have decreased.



He has given us an economy with huge increases in food stamp recipients, part time instead of full time jobs, and 94 million out of work.



He has issued executive orders which may either be unconstitutional or very close to it.



For eight years he has torn this country apart piece by piece.



This is Obama's legacy.
