You should get it by the end of January.\n\nMore from the IRS on what you can expect\n\nHerron added, \"That tells us that they are covered and what coverage they have.\"\n\nFolks who got insurance through the Marketplace and also got a tax credit, will have another form to fill out.\n\nIf their income changed throughout the year, that could mean paying some of the credit back.\n\nHerron says that will be simple too.\n\n\"We will be able to do the calculations to see if they will have to repay.\"\n\nIf you didn't get insurance, you may have to pay a penalty. It's $95 per person or 1% of your gross income, whichever is larger. However, there are exemptions.\n\nWhile the IRS will start accepting returns January 20th, Herron cautions taxpayers about filing too early.\n\nHe says if you haven't received all of the proper documentation in the mail, such as the Marketplace Statement, you could end up having to file an amended return.\n\nHow health coverage affects your tax return", "article_metadata": {"description": "Changes to healthcare means changes to your taxes this year!", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WREG.com", "description": "Changes to healthcare means changes to your taxes this year!", "title": "What the Affordable Care Act means for your taxes", "url": "http://wreg.com/2015/01/15/what-the-affordable-care-act-means-for-your-taxes/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/taxes.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/taxes.jpg?w=240", "site": "@3onyourside", "card": "summary", "creator": "@3onyourside"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324690258", "fb": {"pages": 114737265221655}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wreg.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9bc3246fbdba300537a296bf9ad07b3c?s=16", "application-name": "WREG.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3", "published_time": "2015-01-15T20:52:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T00:33:13+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wreg3"}, "keywords": "news, on your side, affordable care act, irs, marketplace, tax filing season, taxes", "google-site-verification": "uJnF6Q7vJP3k7pEVLotNZ8dGfBwvCzC3at_F3MZ_CA4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf76\"", "article_summary": "The tax season officially starts next Tuesday and lots of folks are worried about changes related to the Affordable Care Act.\nHerron, who has prepared taxes for a decade and worked for the Internal Revenue Service prior to that, is talking about all of the changes this tax season that came with the Affordable Care Act.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Clearing up confusion about your taxes and health insurance!\nAmericans are required to have health insurance and taxpayers must prove it when they file.\nIf you bought insurance through the Marketplace, be on the lookout for a piece of mail that contains a Form 1095-A, the Health Insurance Marketplace Statement."}
