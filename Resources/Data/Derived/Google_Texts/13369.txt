Part of a parking garage at the Watergate complex collapsed Friday morning, injuring at least one person and possibly trapping others.

D.C. first responders were attempting Friday afternoon to shore up the structure before moving in to assess whether any others are trapped or injured.

D.C. Fire and EMS spokesman Tim Wilson said the “pancake collapse” was reported around 10 a.m. in the Watergate garage located in the 2600 block of Virginia Avenue in Northwest.

At least one person sustained minor injuries and was taken to a hospital.

“At this point we don’t have any information to determine if any additional people are missing,” Mr. Wilson said.

Construction workers were in the area at the time but it was unclear what may have cause the collapse.

“I was installing a panel,” worker Gabriel Gresczyk told NBC News. “I was looking out and I heard a rumble, and a 40-foot-by-40-foot section of earth just went down, hitting the floor below it, and then that floor went down.”
