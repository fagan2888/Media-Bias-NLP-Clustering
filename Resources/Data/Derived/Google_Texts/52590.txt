In a campaign season where healthcare has taken a back seat to other issues, one presidential candidate feels it’s time to move America toward a single-payer system to further capitalize on the progress of the Affordable Care Act.

Prior to the latest Democratic presidential debate held on January 17, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled details of his “Medicare for All” health plan for all Americans.

Sanders’ vision builds on the 50-year history of the Medicare program and eliminates private payers and employer-sponsored plans altogether in favor of a federally administered single-payer healthcare program. The plan, Sanders notes, would cover the entire continuum of healthcare from primary care to specialty care and allow Americans to choose the physician they want without worrying about in-network privileges or how to afford out-of-network costs.

Sanders’ campaign also estimates that the plan would save $6 trillion, but it would also cost $1.38 trillion annually, paid for primarily through a new 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% tax on employers, and raising income tax rates for those in the highest income brackets.

“What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country healthcare for every man, woman and child as a right,” Sanders said at the recent Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, South Carolina. “…My proposal [is to] provide healthcare to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks. That's the vision we need to take.”
