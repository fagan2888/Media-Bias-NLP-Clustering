Two North Texas residents were seriously injured while lighting fireworks overnight, authorities said Sunday.

A 20-year-old man lit a firework he was holding, and the explosion “took off a large portion” of his hand, according to the Collin County Sheriff’s Office. The incident occurred shortly before 4:15 a.m. Sunday at a house near FM 1778 and CR 597, the sheriff’s office said.

The man was airlifted to Parkland Memorial Hospital by air medics.

In a separate incident, a woman in her 40s lit a firework on the ground that exploded “right around her,” causing second and third-degree burns on her legs, groin and buttocks, said Chad Hutchinson, chief of the Lilian Volunteer Fire Department.

The accident occurred around 9:30 p.m. Saturday at the “Pop stand,” a football field on 917, near 616, where hundreds of people go to legally set off fireworks. Paramedics, firefighters and police were on standby there.

The woman was airlifted to Parkland Memorial Hospital for treatment.
