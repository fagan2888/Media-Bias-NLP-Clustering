Morongo Indian Reservation, CALIF -- An estimated 25,000 spectators gathered for a three-day celebration of Native American culture, art and cuisine at the annual Morongo Thunder & Lightning Powwow.

Now in its 24th year, the popular event attracted more than 650 Native American dancers and 25 drum groups from across the United States and Canada. Throughout the weekend, dancers wearing intricately crafted regalia of leather, fine beadwork and brightly-colored feathers competed for monetary prizes in a variety of events that displayed the diversity of Native American dance styles.

“Every year, the Morongo Thunder and Lightning Powwow provides us with the opportunity to celebrate and share our heritage with friends and family, and to experience the cultures of dozens of tribes from across North America and Canada,” said Tribal Chairman Robert Martin of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. “It’s always a wonderful experience to welcome visitors to our reservation every year to learn about the richness and beauty of Native American dance, music and art.”

The events of each day, which began on September 26-28, were highlighted by the Grand Entry, a spectacle of sound and motion as hundreds of men, women and children flood the arena dressed in traditional regalia to dance to the music of competitive drum groups and singers. The pow wow also included exhibitions of gourd dancing and traditional bird singing.

Dozens of artists and vendors were on hand for the pow wow, offering authentic Native arts and crafts such as jewelry, beadwork, pottery, clothing, and basketry items for sale. Native food vendors made their presence know as well by selling homemade Indian tacos, tamales and popular Indian frybread.

The 24th Annual Morongo Thunder & Lightning Powwow was held at the Morongo Event Center alongside the Morongo Casino, Resort and Spa.
