It\u2019s a strategy to get ahead of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) mandate to improve quality and increase efficiency through coordinated care across the entire care continuum.\n\nThis growing national trend means further consolidation of clinical laboratory testing services within the merging organizations. For pathology groups, the new super-systems may encourage the different pathology groups within the system to consolidate into a single practice entity. This would help improve how pathology services are more deeply integrated into the care continuum. It would also facilitate contract negotiations between the pathologists and the parent health system.\n\nConsolidation Trend Fueled by Push for Better Outcomes\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has unleashed a merger frenzy,\u201d stated Leemore S. Dafny, Ph.D., a professor and health economist at Northwestern University and former Deputy Director for Health Care and Antitrust at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The quote appeared in a story published at Politico.com.\n\nIndeed, health systems are scrambling to expand their presence and financial clout. \u201cIn order to improve outcomes and lower cost we need scale, and to be attractive to payers and employers we need geographic reach,\u201d stated James Skogsbergh, co-CEO of Chicago\u2019s Advocate NorthShore Health Partners, in a Chicago Business Journal (CBJ) story.\n\nFTC and Payers Fear Impact of Consolidation on Competition\n\nThe FTC views some provider consolidations as potential threats to free markets and healthcare costs, a Politico.com story noted. In fact, a number of studies have shown hospital mergers often lead to higher prices for consumers, according to a piece published in The New York Times (NYT).\n\n\u201cThe strong evidence is that these kinds of mergers raise prices anywhere from 20, 30, 40 percent up to 50 percent, if a merger strongly enhances a hospital system\u2019s negotiating power,\u201d Martin Gaynor, Ph.D. told the NYT. Gaynor is E. J. Barone Professor of Economics and Health Policy at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. He was formerly Director, Bureau of Economics, at the FTC.\n\nThe agency\u2019s recent success in challenging some health system mergers has had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on hospital consolidation, according to Melinda R. Hatton, Senior VP and General Counsel, American Hospital Association, in another NYT story. FTC officials contend that providers can often achieve the benefits of coordinated care without a full merger.\n\nMeanwhile, payers remain concerned that consolidations result in giving health system too much market power. \u201cThe promise is usually greater efficiency,\u201d observed Karen Ignagni, CEO, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a national trade association, in the NYT piece. \u201cThe reality is higher prices for consumers.\u201d\n\nNotable Mergers of Hospitals and Health Systems\n\nHere are some of the hospitals and health systems that have joined up to create mega-systems.\n\n\u2022 Chicago non-profits Advocate Health Care merged with NorthShore University Health System to form Advocate NorthShore Health Partners. Based on 2013 financial results, the now 16-hospital system will generate an estimated $6.5 billion in revenue and $400 million in operating income, according to a media release.\n\n\u2022 Chicago-based Northwestern Memorial Healthcare and Winfield-based Cadence Health completed their merger in September. The new four-hospital system will operate under the Northwestern Medicine name. Expected annual revenues are at least $3 billion, CBJ reported.\n\n\u2022 In Detroit, Beaumont Health System, Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., and Botsford Health Care completed their affiliation agreement in September. The three combined operations into a single eight-hospital nonprofit health system known as Beaumont Health. The new system will generate $3.8 billion in annual revenues, according to a news release. Experts predict a minimum of $380 million in annual savings, according to a story in Crain\u2019s Detroit Business.\n\n\u2022 Mount Sinai Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners combined in 2013 to form the Mount Sinai Health System. With 3,300 beds, the super-system is the largest private hospital system in New York City and one of the largest non-profit systems in the nation, according to a press release.\n\n\u2022 Dallas-based Baylor Health Care joined forces with Temple, Texas-based Scott & White in October 2013. Including joint ventures, the new system has 43 hospitals and spans 24 counties, noted a Modern Healthcare story. Combined 2013 revenues were $5.9 billion, with assets of $8.3 billion, another MH story reported.\n\nIn the current healthcare environment, pathologists and clinical laboratory directors will increasingly face the challenges of integration with another entity. For this reason, pathologists will want to follow the consolidation trend carefully and be prepared to optimize the high-value role of pathology in the continuum of care.\n\n\u2014Pamela Scherer McLeod\n\nRelated Information:\n\nCollaboration As Merger Alternative: Health Systems Seek New Model\n\nAdvocate, NorthShore Merger Would Create Giant Hospital Network\n\nBeaumont Health Closes Deal to Merge Three Nonprofit Systems\n\nBaylor, Scott & White Merger Creates $8.3 Billion System in Texas\n\nTwo Hospital Networks Agree to Merge, Raising Specter of Costlier Care\n\nHospital Consolidation: Is It Raising Costs?\n\nHow to Evaluate a Potential Merger or Acquisition", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, affordable care act, aca, anatomic pathology, leemore s. dafny, northwestern university, federal trade commission, politico.com james skogsbergh, advocate northshore health partners, chicago business journal, the new york times, martin gaynor, carnegie mellon university, melinda r. hatton, american hospital association, karen ignagni, america\u2019s health insurance plans, advocate health care, northshore university health system, northwestern memorial healthcare, cadence health, northwestern medicine, beaumont health system, oakwood healthcare, inc., botsford health care, beaumont health, crain\u2019s detroit business, mount sinai medical center, continuum health partners, mount sinai health system, baylor health care, scott & white, modern healthcare, ,aca,advocate health care,advocate northshore health partners,affordable care act,america\u2019s health insurance plans,american hospital association,anatomic pathology,baylor health care,beaumont health,beaumont health system,botsford health care,cadence health,carnegie mellon university,chicago business journal,clinical laboratory,continuum health partners,crain\u2019s detroit business,federal trade commission,inc.,karen ignagni,leemore s. dafny,martin gaynor,medical laboratory,melinda r. hatton,modern healthcare,mount sinai health system,mount sinai medical center,northshore university health system,northwestern medicine,northwestern memorial healthcare,northwestern university,oakwood healthcare,politico.com james skogsbergh,scott & white,the new york times,laboratory hiring & human resources,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology,laboratory sales and marketing,management & operations", "description": "Large and financially-stable multi-hospital health systems are racing to form regional mega-systems.
