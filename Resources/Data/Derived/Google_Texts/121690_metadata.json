Seeing Tulo glide to to his right, field the ball and make that leaping throw to first is one of the prettiest plays in baseball. I admire his toughness and competitive fire. When he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s one of the top 10 players in the majors.\n\nAs a Rockies beat writer, I can count on Tulo to be available, candid and passionate.\n\nI bring this up because of a number of e-mails I received after my recent story on new Rockies outfielder Drew Stubbs. In a nutshell, those disgruntled Rockies fans were upset because Tulo spoke his mind.\n\nFor the record, when I asked Tulo about the Rockies\u2019 acquisition of Stubbs, this is what he said: \u201cI have high hopes for Drew. For me, he\u2019s got to come to our team and try to be the starting center fielder. That\u2019s my opinion.\n\n\u201cI know they have talked about CarGo (Carlos Gonzalez) being our center fielder, but for me, I think we are a better team if Drew can grab that position and run with it. That way, we can leave Carlos in left.\u201d\n\nOne fan\u2019s e-mail read: \u201cWhy can\u2019t Tulo just keep his mouth shut and play? He should concentrate on getting healthy and not worry about where CarGo plays. Just because Tulo is a friend of Stubbs doesn\u2019t mean Stubbs will be any good. \u2026 Just another swing and miss by the Rockies.\u201d\n\nFor the record, I knew that Stubbs and Tulo have known each other for years, so I called Tulo to see what he thought about the trade. He didn\u2019t have to call me back on the day before Christmas, but he did. He didn\u2019t have to be honest with me, but he was. As a reporter, I appreciate that.\n\nListen, I get the frustration of Rockies fans. They have continued to support the team despite two straight last-place finishes in the National League West. Until the Rockies start winning, and until the front office proves it has a viable plan, the fans\u2019 outrage is completely reasonable and justified.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t quite understand is the anger directed at Tulowitzki. I\u2019ve had fans tell me that he\u2019s not fan friendly \u2014 not like Michael Cuddyer or Todd Helton. Others point to Tulo\u2019s frequent injuries.\n\nOK, Tulo is intense, and he\u2019s not very warm or cuddly. Could he stand to to sign a few more autographs? Could he engage the fans a little more? Sure, but I don\u2019t think Tulo\u2019s unfriendly, and I really think he appreciates the fans. He\u2019s just not great at showing it.\n\nAnd, yes, injuries have tarnished his star. He\u2019s played in more than 143 games just once in the past six years. But nobody, save for maybe Cuddyer, arrives at the ballpark earlier or stays later. Last season, every day, Tulo followed a strict strength-and-stretching routine to keep his legs in shape for the grinding season. He cares passionately about staying on the field.\n\nDuring our postseason sit-down with Dick Monfort, the Rockies owner gave Tulo a backhanded compliment.\n\n\u201cTulo has always been one of these guys who said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to have more pitching, we\u2019ve got to have this, we\u2019ve got to have that,\u2019 \u201d Monfort said. \u201cBut I saw a guy that had the greatest change \u2026 over the last two years. This guy is getting more engaged, more engaged with the younger guys. Before, all he cared about was Tulo. \u2018I went 0-for-3, we won the game, but I went 0-for-3.\u2019 I think the guy is maturing.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t completely agree with Monfort. I do think Tulo has matured, but I don\u2019t believe that the \u201cold Tulo\u201d only cared about Tulo. What I think he\u2019s always cared about was winning. That\u2019s why he\u2019s prodded the Rockies management for more pitching and better players.\n\nIf I\u2019m a fan of a baseball team that\u2019s never won a division title in 21 years, I applaud the player who\u2019s not afraid to show his frustration and speak his mind from time to time.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\n\n\nVisit denverpost.com each weekday near noontime for a serving of dish concerning Colorado\u2019s sporting landscape from a Denver Post sports writer.
