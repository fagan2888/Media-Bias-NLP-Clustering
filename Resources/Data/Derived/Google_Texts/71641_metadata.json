The setup \u2013 a couple of journalists sitting around talking \u2013 just didn\u2019t measure up to what she had in mind, she said.\n\nMs. Howard was hired from the AOL Huffington Post Media Group to ramp up video\u2019s importance at The Times. The department\u2019s staff has grown, doubling to 55 from last year. She has hired 17 people since starting in March, with another four to come before the end of the year.\n\nThe Times is now producing 250 \u201cpieces of content\u201d a month, she told me in an interview last week. I spoke to Ms. Howard as part of my Sunday column on innovation at The Times and the way it is challenging traditional boundaries; this post contains the outtakes from that interview.\n\nHer role may be the most obvious change in the old forms because, as general manager of video production, she reports both to the news and the business sides of The Times \u2013 representing, in one person, the way some of the old lines are being blurred. It\u2019s an unusual arrangement, one that has caused plenty of buzz, both inside The Times\u2019s newsroom and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe want to create more inventory because there is advertising demand, but we still need to differentiate,\u201d she said.\n\nIn other words, she said, The Times needs to meet its reader (or viewer) expectations for high quality, \u201ctheir brand expectation.\u201d But, without enough video to offer advertisers, advertiser money is being left on the table \u2013 something no media organization wants to do in an era in which print advertising has declined sharply.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep our journalism at the same level of excellence as the rest of The Times,\u201d she said. Also working toward that end, and also reporting to Ms. Abramson, is a senior editor, Richard L. Berke, the director of video content.\n\nToward that end, she said, video staff members have started working closely with the various newsroom desks \u2013 national, foreign, business and the like. \u201cThat closeness ensures the editorial fit that we want,\u201d she said.\n\nVideo production, which used to be something of a \u201cone-man band\u201d approach, with the same person shooting and editing, now goes through a post-production process staffed by about six people.\n\nNot every Times video has advertising attached to it, at this point, because \u201cwe don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessarily the best experience for the user.\u201d But she and her staff members intend to experiment soon with placing an ad on every video and \u201cwe will test it very closely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to feel inundated\u201d by advertising, she said.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that video is growing fast. Most recently, The Times began a series of videos on science topics. The popular Modern Love feature now has animated video accompanying it. And a documentary on the mayoral candidate Christine C. Quinn, \u201cHers to Lose,\u201d appeared on Thursday.\n\nWhat does the future hold for video at The Times? A year from now, Ms. Howard said, she hopes that The Times will be offering \u201ca network of channels\u201d on topics like technology and business, including as many as five original series apiece. She is also working to get Times video on portal sites like Yahoo, and is fielding interest from television networks on using Times documentaries. On Nov. 1, something called \u201cNew York Minute\u201d will begin on The Times\u2019s site \u2013 60 seconds on \u201cthree things you should be paying attention to.\u201d The project is \u201cvery digital first,\u201d she said, something that will work especially well on mobile devices.\n\nI\u2019ve written about some readers\u2019 concerns that too many resources are being put into creating multimedia extravaganzas on topics that aren\u2019t the most worthwhile ones from a strictly journalist perspective.\n\nMs. Howard is aware of that issue and said that the quality of The Times\u2019s video, and the choices that are being made, should begin to answer readers\u2019 questions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s a tension,\u201d she said, between what will generate viewer traffic and what is valid on newsworthiness alone. \u201cHow do you use the data to make journalistic decisions?\u201d Ms. Howard readily agrees that it\u2019s not always appropriate to do so.\n\nHas the presence of a business-side boss in the newsroom caused some unease among her journalistic colleagues, I asked.\n\n\u201cI know people are thinking it,\u201d even if they don\u2019t say much, she said, adding that she has joked about being seen as \u201cthe alien from another planet.\u201d\n\nBut, she added: \u201cI think it\u2019s working really well. You have to be strategic when you\u2019re deciding how to devote resources.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130928141826, "twitter": {"description": "Rebecca Howard, the general manager of video production at The Times, straddles the traditional wall between business and journalism.", "title": "In the Expanding World of Times Video, a Boss 'From Another Planet'", "url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/in-the-expanding-world-of-times-video-a-boss-from-another-planet/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@sulliview", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002471098, "DISPLAYDATE": "September 28, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/publiceditor/In the Expanding World of Times Video, a Boss 'From Another Planet' ( 20130928 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Margaret Sullivan", "SCG": "The Public Editor", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/publiceditor", "CLMST": "Margaret Sullivan", "byl": "Margaret Sullivan", "BN": "publiceditor", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/publiceditor/post", "description": "Rebecca Howard, the general manager of video production at The Times, straddles the traditional wall between business and journalism.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 28, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1380392306, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/thepubliceditor/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2013-09-28T18:18:26-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20130928181826, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130928, "pdate": 20130928, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Public Editor's Journal", "description": "Rebecca Howard, the general manager of video production at The Times, straddles the traditional wall between business and journalism.", "title": "In the Expanding World of Times Video, a Boss 'From Another Planet'", "url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/in-the-expanding-world-of-times-video-a-boss-from-another-planet/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/in-the-expanding-world-of-times-video-a-boss-from-another-planet/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "In the Expanding World of Times Video, a Boss 'From Another Planet'", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf173\"", "article_summary": "She is also working to get Times video on portal sites like Yahoo, and is fielding interest from television networks on using Times documentaries.\nMs. Howard was hired from the AOL Huffington Post Media Group to ramp up video\u2019s importance at The Times.\nIt\u2019s an unusual arrangement, one that has caused plenty of buzz, both inside The Times\u2019s newsroom and beyond.\n\u201cHow do you use the data to make journalistic decisions?\u201d Ms. Howard readily agrees that it\u2019s not always appropriate to do so.\nToward that end, she said, video staff members have started working closely with the various newsroom desks \u2013 national, foreign, business and the like."}
