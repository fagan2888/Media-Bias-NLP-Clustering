Smith said Tuesday that he has a dream: \u201cEvery black person in America vote Republican\u201d for one election.\n\n\u201cWhat I dream is that for one election, just one, every black person in America vote Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause from what I\u2019ve read, and I\u2019m open to correction, but from what I\u2019ve read, Barry Goldwater is going against Lyndon B. Johnson. He\u2019s your Republican candidate. He is completely against the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n\u201cLyndon B. Johnson was in favor of it. What happens is, he wins office, Barry Goldwater loses office,\u201d Mr. Smith added. \u201cBut there was a senate, a Republican senate, that pushed the votes to the president\u2019s desk. It was the Democrats who were against Civil Rights legislation. So because President Lyndon B. Johnson was a Democrat, black America assumed the Democrats were for it.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking at the Impact Symposium at Vanderbilt University earlier in the week, the popular sports personality said that black American disenfranchise themselves by essentially voting for Democrats, and then blame white people for that disenfranchisement.\n\n\u201cBlack folks in America are telling one party, \u2018We don\u2019t give a damn about you.\u2019 They\u2019re telling the other party, \u2018You\u2019ve got our vote.\u2019 Therefore, you have labeled yourself disenfranchised because one party knows they\u2019ve got you under their thumb. The other party knows they\u2019ll never get you, and nobody comes to address your interest,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nMr. Smith was in speaking as part of the college\u2019s \u201cHow You See It: Perceptions of (In)Equality,\u201d event.\n\nPrior to the comments he told the audience to \u201cbuckle up and get ready\u201d because they would go viral.\n\n\u201cDo you know that since 1964, black America hasn\u2019t given the Republican Party more than 15 percent of its vote?\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cMy point is, when you go buy a house, do you look at one? When you are looking for a car, do you look at one? When you want to buy some clothes, when you want to buy some shoes, when you want to buy anything, you\u2019re shopping around. [\u2026] We don\u2019t do that with politics and then we blame white America for our disenfranchisement when it is us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ESPN host Stephen A.
