If the channel can address that need by serving as consultants and trusted partners, it will be a win-win for all sides.\"\n\nHealth-care providers are employing cloud services for both PHI and non-PHI applications, according to the survey.\n\nSome 77 percent of respondents said they involve their network provider early in cloud-strategy discussions.\n\n\u201cThe health-care space is undergoing rapid and transformative change,\" Ratchinsky said. \u201cAs the implications from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continue to unwind, cloud is becoming ever more integral to enabling telemedicine and mHealth applications to the end patient. In order to realize the promise of this transformation, health-care providers need agile, secure and scalable platforms \u2013 and a consultative approach to deploying them.\"", "article_metadata": {"vpi-date": "2016-05-20", "description": "Cloud service providers Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google are recognized among health care providers as industry leaders.", "og": {"url": "http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/news/2016/05/level-3-more-health-care-providers-are-adopting-c.aspx", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/~/media/3B6D4250D4924359AF690531F41D850A.ashx", "description": "Cloud service providers Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google are recognized among health care providers as industry leaders.", "title": "Level 3: More Health-Care Providers Are Adopting Cloud"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Channel_Online", "image": "http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/~/media/3B6D4250D4924359AF690531F41D850A.ashx", "description": "Cloud service providers Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google are recognized among health care providers as industry leaders.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Level 3: More Health-Care Providers Are Adopting Cloud"}, "DC.date": "2016-05-20", "google-site-verification": "uJ_3iiZCd3utqJhSqNjfOiD7qMbYScg0ILfVpuenT-Q", "keywords": "Level 3,Cloud Survey,hospital,HIMSS Analytics", "site_name": "Channel Partners Online", "verify-v1": "KVvKeDbOLxn8Tks4osvlMQWp+G2KHVKx5PTlAfW5cHE=", "y_key": "717ad7be1b2053dd"}, "article_summary": "Level 3: More Health-Care Providers Are Adopting CloudBy Edward GatelyNewsA Level 3 Communications survey provides further evidence that health-care providers increasingly are turning to the cloud for cost savings, disaster recovery and scalable platforms to support their internal needs.\nIn order to realize the promise of this transformation, health-care providers need agile, secure and scalable platforms \u2013 and a consultative approach to deploying them.\"\nHealth-care providers are employing cloud services for both PHI and non-PHI applications, according to the survey.\n1 obstacle to cloud adoption \u2013 it is lack of resources or technical expertise, according to RightScale\u2019s 2016 State of the Cloud survey,\" she said.\nKarin Ratchinsky, Level 3\u2019s director of health-care strategy, tells Channel Partners that \u201cwe\u2019ve finally moved past the tipping point in cloud adoption for health care.\""}
