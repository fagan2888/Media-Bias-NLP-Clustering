Don\u2019t tell Ty his numbers are down because he\u2019s playing some of the best basketball I\u2019ve seen him play in my five years (here),\u201d Hunt said.\n\nThe noticeable dropoff has come in his scoring, where he went from a 16.5 points per game average through the end of February to just 11.7 through March 21. He\u2019s also slightly down in assists (9.8 per game before, 9.5 now) and steals (1.3 to 1.1).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get lost in the distraction of his numbers. I\u2019m getting lost in his leadership,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019m counting the number of times he points to a guy and tells him to get in the corner. I\u2019m counting the number of times when he\u2019s on someone for not running. \u2026 I played the position, and if you\u2019re a point guard that\u2019s what you do. The numbers will find themselves.\u201d\n\nSimilar situations Sunday night marked the NBA\u2019s first meeting this season of two interim coaches, with James Borrego seeing the Magic through the past 6 \u00bd weeks since Jacque Vaughn was dismissed Feb. 5.\n\n\u201cMy kindred brother,\u201d Hunt said before tipoff. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation to be in, but we\u2019re both big boys. We\u2019re both embracing it.\u201d\n\nThe Magic won four of their first six under Borrego, but have since endured four- and six-game losing streaks. Hunt said the two spent some time together last week in Houston; the Nuggets arrived on the same night Orlando lost to the Rockets.\n\n\u201cHe looks stoic and all that,\u201d Hunt said of Borrego, \u201cbut you can tell that dude\u2019s pouring everything into it. They\u2019re starting to take on the identity I think he wants.\u201d\n\nUnlike the Nuggets, the Magic appear set on their long-term core, with a backcourt of rookie Elfrid Payton and second-year Victor Oladipo emerging to complement big man Nikola Vucevic.\n\nLineup changes Randy Foye was not part of Sunday\u2019s starting lineup, with Hunt saying he was \u201ca little under the weather.\u201d\n\nJusuf Nurkic made his second consecutive start, with Hunt opting for a big lineup to counter the Magic. Kenneth Faried shifted over to forward, with Danilo Gallinari moving to the backcourt with Lawson.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Briefs: Ty Lawson\u2019s dip in numbers doesn\u2019t faze coach Melvin Hunt", "title": "Briefs: Ty Lawson\u2019s dip in numbers doesn\u2019t faze coach Melvin Hunt", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/22/briefs-ty-lawsons-dip-in-numbers-doesnt-faze-coach-melvin-hunt/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__lawsonp1.jpg", "height": 606}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__lawsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T17:12:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T02:24:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ORLANDO \u2014 Melvin Hunt put his finger to his lips when someone noted Ty Lawson\u2019s numbers have been slightly down since the calendar turned to March.\nDon\u2019t tell Ty his numbers are down because he\u2019s playing some of the best basketball I\u2019ve seen him play in my five years (here),\u201d Hunt said.\n\u201cHe looks stoic and all that,\u201d Hunt said of Borrego, \u201cbut you can tell that dude\u2019s pouring everything into it.\n\u201cI\u2019m counting the number of times he points to a guy and tells him to get in the corner.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get lost in the distraction of his numbers."}
