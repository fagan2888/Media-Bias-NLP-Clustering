University of Illinois and Northwestern University\n\nA tiny new patch could deliver important information regarding users\u2019 heart health and skin moisture levels, based on successful early efforts by researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nA new study shows the patch is flexible, durable, and able to be worn around-the-clock \u2014 qualities, the researchers argue, which make it ideal for wireless health monitoring. Changes in the device\u2019s color signal a temporary loss or increase of blood flow, which may be of clinical significance in matters of skin hydration and cardiovascular health.\n\nRight now, the patch is still in the lab-testing phase. More research needs to be done to hone the particulars, such as how the user can easily obtain the relevant data. In the meantime, the researchers sing the device\u2019s praises for its victories in proving the principle.\n\n\u201cThese results provide the first examples of \u2018epidermal\u2019 photonic sensors,\u201d said John A. Rogers, the paper\u2019s corresponding author and professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois, in a statement. \u201cThis technology significantly expands the range of functionality in skin-mounted devices beyond that possible with electronics alone.\u201d\n\nThe magic of the device is in the 3,600 liquid crystals that live on its surface. Each one half a millimeter square, the crystals provide individual temperature points that react with the presence or absence of heat under the skin. Hospitals currently make use of expensive infrared technology to accomplish the same task. The new device is both portable and low-cost, the team asserts.\n\nThirty-six-hundred liquid crystals track a person's blood flow and change color when heat is either lost or gained. University of Illinois and Northwestern University. University of Illinois and Northwestern University\n\n\u201cOur device is mechanically invisible \u2014 it is ultrathin and comfortable \u2014 much like skin itself,\u201d said Northwestern\u2019s Yonggang Huang, one of the senior researchers. Huang and the team tested the device on people\u2019s wrists. Along with its clinical significance, Huang points out, the patch could also have aesthetic advantages.\n\n\u201cOne can imagine cosmetics companies being interested in the ability to measure skin\u2019s dryness in a portable and non-intrusive way,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThis is the first device of its kind.\u201d\n\nSkin temperature has been well-studied and confirmed as a predictor of blood flow quality. As the brain\u2019s hypothalamus detects changes in external temperature \u2014 like extreme heat, for example \u2014 it emits nerve impulses that tell blood vessels to open, letting more heat reach the skin, which can then escape as heat loss.\n\nWhen the heart fails to supply this blood in sufficient quantities or at consistent rates, the new sensor will change color. It detects these changes through a wireless heating system powered by electromagnetic waves present in the air. Further tests will confirm the patch\u2019s effectiveness and improve upon its ability to avoid error. As for the convenience factor, the research team is confident that part is already secured.\n\n\u201cThe device is very practical,\u201d said Yihui Zhang, co-author and research assistant professor. \u201cWhen your skin is stretched, compressed, or twisted, the device stretches, compresses or twists right along with it.\u201d\n\nSource: Gao L, Zhang Y, Malyarhcuk V, et al.
