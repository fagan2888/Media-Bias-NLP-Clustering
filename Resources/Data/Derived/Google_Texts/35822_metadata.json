Then who\u2019s to blame It sure as heck isn\u2019t the Baptists\u2019 fault.\n\nBy the way, do you know why Baptists don\u2019t have sex standing up? You don\u2019t? It\u2019s because people will think they\u2019re dancing. Do you know what\u2019s funny about that joke? You don\u2019t? You would if you were raised in West Texas.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s another query for you: what\u2019s the difference is between the Baptists and Islam? Baptists won\u2019t put out a fatwa on you for telling a joke about them, that\u2019s what.\n\nSo where does this Islamic beheading bunkum hail from? Is it, like our President purports, an aberration of the warp and woof of Islam? Or is it for these wizards just another manic Monday?\n\nBecause I can read and because, historically speaking, I\u2019ve been pretty good at playing connect the dots, I\u2019m leaning towards the \u201cManic Monday\u201d explanation for the Islamic mayhem because their leader was hardly a Mother Theresa. Check it out according to TheReligionOfPeace.com : Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, had people killed for insulting him or for criticizing his religion. This included women. Muslims are told to emulate the example of Muhammad. Muhammad said in many places that he has been \"ordered by Allah to fight men until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is his messenger.\" In the last nine years of his life, he ordered no less than 65 military campaigns to do exactly that. Muhammad inspired his men to war with the basest of motives, using captured loot, sex and a gluttonous paradise as incentives. He beheaded captives, enslaved children and raped women captured in battle. Again, Muslims are told to emulate the example of Muhammad. Muhammad directed Muslims to wage war on other religions and bring them under submission to Islam. Within the first few decades following his death, his Arabian companions invaded and conquered Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and Zoroastrian lands. For those of us in the U.S. still skipping around the maypole with rose-colored glasses on, thinking beheadings will never happen in our neck of the woods -- I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what the UK thought prior to Lee Rigby\u2019s beheading last year.\n\nJust this past week, the Aussies got a massive wake up call when authorities smashed up a work in-progress plot by AU Muslims to behead random people on their streets.\n\nIn addition to AU Muslim BS, Fox News reported last week that ISIS operatives have Tweeted out their plans for \u201clone wolves\u201d here in the U.S. to \u201cstrike terror into the hearts of the enemies of Allah.\u201d\n\nSo, practically, what can we do to keep from getting our noggins lopped off? Donald Joy, a writer for my news portal, ClashDaily.com, offers these five poignant points to help keep our heads attached:\n\n1. I hate to be clich\u00e9, but if you see something, say something. Seek the police out and relay anything suspicious that you observe, wherever you are\u2026be vigilant. Tell your companions to watch your back, and watch theirs.\n\n2. Be a \u201cracist.\u201d One of the fundamental principles of surviving an adverse, life-threatening event has two key elements: Distance and shielding. That is, stay away or get away, as far away as possible, from the threat, and, put barriers (ideally, impenetrable barriers such as thick metal and concrete, mountains, etc.) between yourself and the threat. In other words, avoid Muslims to the extent possible and get substantial amounts of solid matter in between yourself and them. That\u2019s right; unless you have completely reliable intimate knowledge that any given Muslim does not pose some level of a threat (there are, of course, many harmless Muslims), profile Muslims as members of a totalitarian, murderous, savage cult who probably present at least some degree of opportunity for jihad to take place.\n\n3. Counterattack. So many in these forums constantly remark about how they conceal carry whatever pistol, and how they\u2019ll double-tap Mohammed between the eyes until their muzzles melt and all that. Great. But we all know that even the most paranoid, hyper-vigilant among us sometimes has to go someplace where it\u2019s just not possible or practical to carry, or, we find ourselves in situations where our commando identity has to take a backseat to blending in with normal, real-life humans, traveling across state lines, and other complications. So what if we sense Ahmed is about to pounce while we happen to be un-strapped, or otherwise somewhat off-guard? Go cafeteria crazy on the goathumper; grab whatever\u2019s handy and bludgeon away with extreme viciousness until he\u2019s down and desists.\n\n4. Educate others about the true nature of Islam. Arouse the curiosity of your kids\u2019 school staff by asking them if they even know what Beslan is. Ask it in a helpful tone of voice; maybe bring it up in a general conversation about school security, Sandy Hook, and such. Emphasize the word: Beslan. Prompt them, if they just give you a blank stare, to do some internet browsing on their own using that simple six-letter name as a keyword. 5. Be politically active and support candidates who would bulldoze mosques. I could say a lot more on this, but I think you get the gist. Nobody will run for office if they sense their life will be destroyed for merely advocating that we resist Mohammedan throat-cutters\u2019 building and running Islamic military training academies (mosques) among us. The best way to survive the attempt to behead you is to forestall it, pre-empt it, undertake a constant Crusade against followers of Mohammed and drive them from our midst. It\u2019s going to be a long slug but we have no other option if we intend to prevail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to Islam, \"beheading\" has been re-introduced into our daily discussions. .05/27/2016 2:15:52AM EST.", "author": "Doug Giles", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to Islam, \"beheading\" has been re-introduced into our daily discussions.", "title": "- Beheadings: Brought To You By \u201cThe Religion Of Peace\u201d", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/douggiles/2014/09/21/beheadings-brought-to-you-by-the-religion-of-peace-n1894501", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/236/2014-08-24T161602Z_1_LYNXMPEA7N0A7_RTROPTP_3_INDUSTRY-US-MEDIA-VIOLENCE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Thanks to Islam, \"beheading\" has been re-introduced into our daily discussions.", "title": "- Beheadings: Brought To You By \u201cThe Religion Of Peace\u201d", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/douggiles/2014/09/21/beheadings-brought-to-you-by-the-religion-of-peace-n1894501", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/236/2014-08-24T161602Z_1_LYNXMPEA7N0A7_RTROPTP_3_INDUSTRY-US-MEDIA-VIOLENCE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Beheadings: Brought To You By \u201cThe Religion Of Peace\u201d, Doug Giles, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Thanks to Islam, \"beheading\" has been re-introduced into our daily discussions.\nCheck it out according to TheReligionOfPeace.com : Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, had people killed for insulting him or for criticizing his religion.\nBy the way, do you know why Baptists don\u2019t have sex standing up?\nAnyway, here\u2019s another query for you: what\u2019s the difference is between the Baptists and Islam?\nMuhammad directed Muslims to wage war on other religions and bring them under submission to Islam."}
