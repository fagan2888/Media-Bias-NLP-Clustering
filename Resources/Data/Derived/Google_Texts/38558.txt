Mt. Pleasant police say three men have been charged with attempted murder after several gunshots were fired into an occupied home early Saturday morning.

According to a release, officers were called out to a home in the 1700 block of Rifle Range Road after multiple gunshots were fired into a residence around 1:55 a.m. that was occupied by three people.

Officers say the suspects' vehicle was spotted leaving the scene, and was immediately located on Venning Road.

Barry Laval Brown Jr., 22, Courtlen Dauqan Brown, 19, and Dominique Moses Horry, 19, were taken into custody following the traffic stop. All three suspects were charged with three counts of attempted murder.

Police say Courtlen Brown was already out on bond for a previous attempted murder charge, in which he shot one of the people who lived at the same home in the 1700 block of Rifle Range Road, but at a separate location.

No one was injured in this shooting.
