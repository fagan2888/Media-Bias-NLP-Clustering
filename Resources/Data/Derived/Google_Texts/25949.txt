MERRIMACK, N.H.—Florida Gov. Jeb Bush defended negative ads that a super PAC supporting him has run against his rivals, saying that “politics isn’t beanbag.”

During a town hall event here Saturday night, Mr. Bush took a question from a voter who said he’d grown tired of overwhelmingly negative ads that are now blanketing the airwaves in New Hampshire, Iowa and other early primary states.

“I bet you have a lot of them,” Mr. Bush joked in return.

In his defense, the governor said that Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting his bid, had run a lot of ads early on about “how great I was as governor of Florida.”

But Mr. Bush said that “comparing and contrasting” candidates was also warranted.

“I’ve been around politics for a long time,” he said. “This is actually pretty tame compared to other campaigns I’ve been involved in terms of the attacks.”

Right to Rise has increasingly gone negative in its ads, delivering broadsides against Fla. Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The PAC has defended its approach, saying it’s “equal opportunity” with all the candidates.

Mr. Bush on Saturday said the PAC has highlighted facts about other candidates’ records, such as who expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in their states. Both Messrs. Kasich and Christie accepted Medicaid funding as governors, though conservatives don’t support the expansion of Medicaid.

About 250 people attended Mr. Bush’s third town hall event in New Hampshire Saturday. The governor will next campaign on Tuesday, in Nevada.
