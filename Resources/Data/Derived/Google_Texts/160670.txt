A Colusa husband and wife are in custody after allegedly kidnapping a 13-year-old boy who made their child cry.

Police arrested Rebecca Carranza-Molina, 44, and Jose Alfred Molina, 56, shortly after 6 p.m. Friday on suspicion of kidnapping, false imprisonment and child cruelty charges.



The couple is accused of kidnapping a 13-year-old Colusa boy from a street corner following an altercation on the Sacramento River at Colusa's Memorial Grove Park.

Witnesses reported they were with the victim on a sandbar on the Sacramento River at the base of the city park.

Carranza-Molina was nearby with her two small children.

One of the children was inadvertently hurt while playing with the teen, causing the child to cry.

Carranza-Molina became angry and attacked the boy, striking him several times and taking his bicycle from him.

The teen recovered his bike and left with witnesses.

Carranza-Molina left also, going home and picking up her husband.

The couple then drove back to the area of the park and found the teen walking on Eighth Street, near Main Street. They then chased him to Seventh and Market streets, at which point they grabbed him, and forced them into their minivan, police said.

Witnesses called police, using their cellphones.

Investigators said the suspects drove the teen to their home in the 400 block of 14th Street, and forced him into the house and kept him there until he apologized for making their child cry.

Officers from the Colusa Police Department and Colusa County Sheriff's Department arrived at the couple's home as the teen was apologizing.

The victim sustained only minor scratches and bruising and was released to his grandparents.

Carranza-Molina and Molina were booked into the Colusa County Jail. Bail for each was set at $100,000.
