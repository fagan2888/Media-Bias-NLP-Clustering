Gov. Ralph Northam announces intention to run for governor\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam (D) officially announced his intention to run for governor, on Tuesday, Nov. 17.\n\n\u201cAs a former Army doctor and practicing pediatric neurologist, I know that the best way to serve people is to listen to their needs and concerns,\u201d Northam said in an e-mail sent to supporters. \u201cAnd as a public official, I\u2019ve taken the same approach to serving our Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nNortham has served with Gov. Terry McAuliffe the past two years.\n\n\u201cIn the two years I\u2019ve been Lieutenant Governor, we\u2019ve been able to make great strides. We\u2019ve expanded access to affordable health care, created over 40,000 jobs, and opened up pre-K to thousands of young Virginians. I\u2019ve broken ties on Senate votes in favor of increasing the minimum wage, banning discrimination in the workplace, and repealing the invasive ultrasound mandate.\n\nInitially it was unclear if he would face off against Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D), who would have likely received strong support from the party given his high profile actions with same-sex marriage. Herring announced he will run for reelection in 2017.\n\nOn the Republican ticket, Ed Gillespie has announced he will run. Former attorney general Ken Cuccinelli has not ruled out a run.\n\nThe Virginia GOP released a statement:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam (D) officially announced his intention to run for governor, on Tuesday, Nov. 17.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam (D)  officially announced his intention to run for governor, on Tuesday, Nov. 17.", "title": "Lt.
