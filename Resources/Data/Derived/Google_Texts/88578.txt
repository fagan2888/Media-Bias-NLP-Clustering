Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America claims the November 20 Florida State University (FSU) shooting incident makes “nearly 100 school shootings” in less than two years.

To arrive at this figure they have shifted away from requiring even one death in order to qualify as a school shooting and have instead listed just about any discharge of a firearm on or near a campus as a school shooting.

For example, in the list of “school shootings” Moms Demand shares with Everytown for Gun Safety, 67 of the 91 incidents listed had no fatalities. And although Breitbart News previously reported there were no fatalities in the FSU incident, Moms Demand counts it anyway. They also say incidents like the one at FSU “should be a call to action for our political leaders to address… gun violence.”

We began to see this new measure for “school shootings” in June, when Michael Bloomberg released a report claiming “74 school shootings” since Sandy Hook. At the time, Breitbart News reported Bloomberg’s list of shootings included stabbings and incidents where no one was injured.
