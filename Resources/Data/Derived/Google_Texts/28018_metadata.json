The Fantasy will be replaced by the Carnival Ecstasy next month. file/staff/wade spees\n\nCharleston\u2019s growing popularity as a tourism destination is showing up at the State Ports Authority\u2019s cruise ship terminal, creating a need for an ever-more delicate balance between filling market demand and maintaining quality of life.\n\nThe SPA will host 103 port calls from at least 19 different cruise ships this year, according to the agency\u2019s cruise calendar, which shows a couple of visits from ships that have not yet been announced. Those totals compare to 96 port calls from 22 cruise ships in 2015.\n\nAs more cruisers want to visit Charleston, the SPA is looking to enhance its offerings while at the same time limiting annual traffic to a maximum of 104 cruise ships, with no ship carrying more than 3,500 passengers.\n\nJim Newsome, the maritime agency\u2019s president and CEO, has repeatedly stated that a Charleston-size market can\u2019t support any more cruise ships than the agency\u2019s self-imposed maximum. Historic preservationists, who are suing the SPA over plans for a new cruise ship terminal, would prefer the market was even smaller.\n\nWhile more port calls are unlikely, diversification of Charleston\u2019s cruise industry \u2014 centered mostly on trips to the Bahamas \u2014 could be on the horizon.\n\nFor example, the SPA thinks the market is ripe for a cruise line offering trips to Bermuda. And the agency would like another home-ported ship to join Carnival\u2019s Ecstasy as a regular visitor to Union Pier Terminal.\n\n\u201cIf the domino theory takes hold with new ships, maybe we\u2019ll get a shot seasonally,\u201d Peter Lehman, the SPA\u2019s vice president of cruise and real estate, told Cruise Industry News. \u201cLet them come in and test the market and do an assessment after the fact.\u201d\n\nSPA spokeswoman Erin Dhand said Lehman\u2019s comments \u201cwere general in nature about prospective interest in our port\u201d and that the agency isn\u2019t currently in negotiations with a cruise line looking for another place to call home.\n\nCarnival has no interest in putting a second full-time ship in the city, saying one is enough to fill the market\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, our operations from Charleston consist of one ship \u2014 the Carnival Ecstasy \u2014 year round,\u201d Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer De La Cruz said.\n\nThe 2016 cruise calendar on the SPA\u2019s website shows visits from ships carrying as few as 132 passengers on the Silversea Explorer and as many as 3,006 on the Carnival Sunshine.\n\nFuture calendars are filling fast, with Lehman telling Cruise Industry News that cruise lines are already reserving spots as far ahead as 2019.\n\nThe most frequent visitor this year will be the Ecstasy, which will replace the Fantasy next month as Charleston\u2019s home-ported ship. It will make sailings to points in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic. Carnival also will bring its Sunshine to Charleston for five sailings \u2014 including a 10-day trek through the Eastern Caribbean \u2014 and the Pride, which will make a port of call in December.\n\nAmong the other cruise lines sending at least one of their ships to Charleston: Seabourn Cruises; Crystal Cruises; AIDA Cruises; Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines; Holland America Line; Azamara Club Cruises; P&O Cruises; Regent Seven Seas Cruises; Oceana Cruises; and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises.\n\nNone of those cruise lines will be sailing out of a new passneger terminal in Charleston. Environmental and historic preservation groups are appealing a decision in a lawsuit over state permitting for the SPA\u2019s planned $35 million project. The S.C. Court of Appeals is expected to hear arguments in that case in March or April. An administrative law judge previously ruled that the groups lacked legal standing to oppose the state permit.\n\nSeparately, the Army Corps of Engineers is reviewing an application for federal permits for the new terminal. A previous permit application was tossed out by a judge in 2013 because the proposal did not consider the terminal\u2019s impact on the city\u2019s Historic District.\n\nReach David Wren at 843-937-5550 or on Twitter at @David_Wren_", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Popularity of Charleston cruises has State Ports Authority thinking diversification, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalIndustry, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Wren, \r\nDavid Wren, Army Corps of Engineers,Carnival Cruise Line,Carnival Ecstasy,Carnival Fantasy,cruise ship,cruise terminal,Jim Newsome,Port of Charleston,State Ports Authority", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Charleston\u2019s growing popularity as a tourism destination is showing up at the State Ports Authority\u2019s cruise ship terminal, creating a need for an ever-more delicate balance between filling market demand and maintaining quality of life.", "title": "Popularity of Charleston cruises has State Ports Authority thinking diversification", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160117/160119496/popularity-of-charleston-cruises-has-state-ports-authority-thinking-diversification", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160117/PC05/160119496/AR/0/AR-160119496.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160117/PC05/160119496/AR/0/AR-160119496.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Charleston\u2019s growing popularity as a tourism destination is showing up at the State Ports Authority\u2019s cruise ship terminal, creating a need for an ever-more delicate balance between filling market demand and maintaining quality of life.", "title": "Popularity of Charleston cruises has State Ports Authority thinking diversification", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160117/PC05/160119496/AR/0/AR-160119496.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160119496}}, "keywords": "Popularity of Charleston cruises has State Ports Authority thinking diversification , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalIndustry, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Wren, \r\nDavid Wren, Army Corps of Engineers,Carnival Cruise Line,Carnival Ecstasy,Carnival Fantasy,cruise ship,cruise terminal,Jim Newsome,Port of Charleston,State Ports Authority", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T15:59:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Charleston\u2019s growing popularity as a tourism destination is showing up at the State Ports Authority\u2019s cruise ship terminal, creating a need for an ever-more delicate balance between filling market demand and maintaining quality of life."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f75\"", "article_summary": "Among the other cruise lines sending at least one of their ships to Charleston: Seabourn Cruises; Crystal Cruises; AIDA Cruises; Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines; Holland America Line; Azamara Club Cruises; P&O Cruises; Regent Seven Seas Cruises; Oceana Cruises; and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises.\nfile/staff/wade speesCharleston\u2019s growing popularity as a tourism destination is showing up at the State Ports Authority\u2019s cruise ship terminal, creating a need for an ever-more delicate balance between filling market demand and maintaining quality of life.\nHistoric preservationists, who are suing the SPA over plans for a new cruise ship terminal, would prefer the market was even smaller.\nCarnival Fantasy cruise ship passengers get a view from the deck as the ship pulls away from the Port of Charleston in this file photo.\nThose totals compare to 96 port calls from 22 cruise ships in 2015."}
