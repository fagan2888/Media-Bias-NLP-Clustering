Therefore, the Congress should not include this rider.\u201d\n\nCongress faces a Dec. 11 deadline to pass a comprehensive spending package, and lawmakers have already begun discussing a number of policy riders\u2014measures attached to the bill that create new policy or limit how government funds can be spent\u2014they hope to see included.\n\n\u201cThe provision would apply to political parties only, setting up a different standard between the parties and multi-candidate committees,\u201d the conservative leaders said. \u201cPolitical contribution is a form of free speech, which is protected by our Constitution and should not be limited.\u201d\n\nThe language of the policy rider has not yet been released. However, in addition to receiving opposition from conservative leaders, McConnell\u2019s campaign finance measure also drew criticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nAt a monthly gathering with reporters Wednesday, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said that his group of 40 conservative lawmakers would oppose McConnell\u2019s measure.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s not the direction we need to go unless you\u2019re going to free up the restrictions on everyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Signal, Senate Conservatives Fund President Ken Cuccinelli criticized the provision for serving as a way to silence the grassroots movement that saw increased momentum after the 2010 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell\u2019s campaign rider is a blatant attempt to give himself a political advantage over the grassroots who are disgusted with his leadership and want to elect new leaders to the Senate. McConnell and his cronies don\u2019t like being held accountable so he wants to rewrite the law to help him crush conservative candidates,\u201d he said. Cuccinelli continued:\n\nMcConnell claims that he\u2019s pushing this rider to expand freedom of speech, but it only expands speech for establishment Republicans while Americans who want to change Washington get absolutely nothing.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, political parties can currently spend $48,000 in coordination with House candidates and up to $20 million for presidential nominees.\n\nShould McConnell\u2019s policy rider pass, parties would be permitted to spend unlimited amounts in coordination with candidates.\n\nCongressional leaders on both sides of the aisle have used massive spending bills as a vehicle for campaign finance policy riders in the past.\n\nLast year, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, added a measure into a spending bill that raised the amount an individual could contribute to between $97,200 and $777,600 to party committees.\n\nThe contributions, though, are restricted to accounts for legal proceedings and party headquarters buildings, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThis story was updated with the latest version of the letter, which contains additional signatures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The policy rider would eliminate the caps on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The policy rider would eliminate the caps on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.", "title": "Conservatives Oppose McConnell Campaign Finance Measure", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151201_OutsideGroupsOmnibus_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-04T10:42:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OK3jEd"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The policy rider would eliminate the caps on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.", "title": "Conservatives Oppose McConnell Campaign Finance Measure", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151201_OutsideGroupsOmnibus_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-12-03T17:59:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T10:42:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "omnibus spending bill, Mitch McConnell, political parties, campaign finance, Jim Jordan, Ken Cuccinelli, Federal Election Commission, NRSC, NRCC"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5f4\"", "article_summary": "However, in addition to receiving opposition from conservative leaders, McConnell\u2019s campaign finance measure also drew criticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\nMcConnell\u2019s measure would lift the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with a candidate.\nIn a letter circulated among conservative groups, nearly 50 conservative leaders Thursday rallied in opposition to a campaign finance policy rider McConnell, R-Ky., will reportedly insert into the omnibus spending bill.\n\u201cThe provision would apply to political parties only, setting up a different standard between the parties and multi-candidate committees,\u201d the conservative leaders said.\nCongressional leaders on both sides of the aisle have used massive spending bills as a vehicle for campaign finance policy riders in the past."}
