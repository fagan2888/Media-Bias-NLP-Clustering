DENVER (MainStreet) — Marijuana growers are capitalizing on Colorado’s 300 days of sunshine with a move toward establishing cultivation facilities in greenhouses, rather than indoor warehouses retrofitted to handle the colossal electrical load cannabis production requires.

And while there are significant cost savings that come from using the sun, there are significant challenges to overcome with growing weed in a greenhouse. Growers must keep the temperature and humidity in the proper range, which is largely dependent on what the environment outside the greenhouse is like.

“You may spend more on heating and cooling, depending on where the greenhouse is located,” said Matthew Sharpe, an electrical engineer with Surna, a Boulder, Colo.-based manufacturer of equipment for the legal weed industry. “But the general consensus is we need to be using the sun for cannabis. It’s just how to do that effectively and control your environment.”

Greenhouse grows use about a quarter of the lightbulbs that indoor cultivation facilities need, and at a cost of about $500 a lightbulb, that adds up, said Trent Woloveck, chief operating officer of American Cannabis Company Inc., which provides provides consulting services, manufactures cultivation products and facilities and manages a group partnership that supplies ancillary products to the marijuana industry. The cost to outfit a 100,000-square-foot building with lightbulbs is about $625,000, compared with $156,250 for the same size greenhouse.

Growing weed in greenhouses also keeps electric bills substantially lower. The electric bill for a 120,000-square-foot warehouse using 22,320 kilowatt hours is about $38,100 a month, compared to $9,525 for the same size greenhouse using 5,580 kilowatt hours.
