A similar reform bill was introduced last year in Congress, but ultimately did not gain enough support to pass.\n\n\u201cThe bipartisan, bicameral USA Freedom Act of 2015 is the product of intense and careful negotiations between the House and Senate,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) as he introduced the bill.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cIf enacted, our bill will usher in the most significant reform to government surveillance authorities since the USA Patriot Act,\u201d said Leahy, adding that the law is designed to both \u201cend the NSA\u2019s dragnet surveillance and protect Americans\u2019 privacy rights.\u201d\n\nThe new version of the USA Freedom Act will now compete with a parallel surveillance bill introduced earlier this month by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.), both Republicans. McConnell and Burr\u2019s bill would reauthorize the Patriot Act through the end of 2019 and entrench much of the domestic spying legal structures used by government agencies. This includes the re-authorization of Section 215, one of the most contentious provisions in the law that the NSA uses to conduct bulk phone records collection.\n\nAs the Guardian\u2018s Spencer Ackerman explains in his most recent reporting, the USA Freedom Act remains a hard swallow for civil libertarians and privacy advocates because even though it sunsets Section 215 and includes other strong reforms, it also \u201ccontains several concessions to pro-surveillance legislators meant to facilitate its passage. Among them are expansions of temporary spying authorities to account for surveillance targets transiting into and out of the U.S., and an unrelated expansion of penalties for people convicted of lending \u2018material support\u2019 to terrorism.\u201d\n\nAs such, advocates of privacy and civil liberties offered mixed reactions to the bill on Tuesday, acknowledging the USA Freedom Act makes laudable attempts at reform in some key areas, while falling markedly short in others.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to ending domestic bulk collection, this new version of the USA Freedom Act is clearly superior to the bill that passed the House of Representatives in 2014,\u201d said Harley Geiger, advocacy director and senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), in a statement. \u201cThe Patriot Act has been misappropriated for mass collection of Americans\u2019 sensitive information for too long, without any tangible benefit to security. Congress should not wait any longer to decisively rein in these egregious practices.\u201d\n\nCDT acknowledged that comprehensive surveillance reform is still needed, but justified its support of the USA Freedom Act by saying its passage would represent significantly more progress than if the Patriot Act, and troubling provisions like Section 215, were given re-authorization without new constraints. As Greiger explained in a detailed Q&A about the bill on its website: \u201cWe\u2019d certainly prefer to see the USA Freedom Act make far more reforms than it does. However, it is not an omnibus surveillance reform bill.\u201d\n\nJameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), however, expressed stronger dissatisfaction with the new version of the bill, telling the Guardian in a statement that it \u201d doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough\u201d to rein in mass surveillance or curb the worst abuses when it comes to government bulk data collection.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the hard work of legislators like Senator Leahy, Representative Sensenbrenner, and Representative Conyers,\u201d said Jaffer, \u201cthis bill would make only incremental improvements, and at least one provision \u2013 the material-support provision \u2013 would be a step backwards. The disclosures of the last two years make clear that we need wholesale reform. Congress should let Section 215 sunset as it\u2019s scheduled to, and then it should turn to reforming the other surveillance authorities that have been used to justify bulk collection.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Patriot Act re-authorization quickly coming down the pipe, fight over surveillance reform represented in competing congressional bills.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "With Patriot Act re-authorization quickly coming down the pipe, fight over surveillance reform represented in competing congressional bills.", "title": "Patriot Act Re-authorization Debate Heats Up In Congress With 'USA Freedom Act'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/patriot-act-re-authorization-debate-heats-up-in-congress-with-usa-freedom-act/205042/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121613_NSA_16x9.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With Patriot Act re-authorization quickly coming down the pipe, fight over surveillance reform represented in competing congressional bills.", "title": "Patriot Act Re-authorization Debate Heats Up In Congress With 'USA Freedom Act'", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/121613_NSA_16x9.jpg", "creator": "@jonqueally", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "USA freedom act", "published_time": "2015-04-29T11:23:01-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf947\"", "article_summary": "A similar reform bill was introduced last year in Congress, but ultimately did not gain enough support to pass.\n\u201cThe Patriot Act has been misappropriated for mass collection of Americans\u2019 sensitive information for too long, without any tangible benefit to security.\nAs Greiger explained in a detailed Q&A about the bill on its website: \u201cWe\u2019d certainly prefer to see the USA Freedom Act make far more reforms than it does.\n\u201cThe bipartisan, bicameral USA Freedom Act of 2015 is the product of intense and careful negotiations between the House and Senate,\u201d said Sen.
