But good lord\u2013I could watch this for days! This is a woman with ovaries of goddamned steel. I just get so tired of seeing the GOP treated like delicate Faberge eggs when they\u2019re the ones running around like bulls in a china shop.\n\nHaving conniption fits over women taking birth control? Please. Get the hell over it. You don\u2019t shut down an entire government and screw with people\u2019s jobs because you don\u2019t want delicate employers to have to cover birth control, or because you\u2019re not getting everything on your Christmas Wishlist. Screw you, grow the hell up.\n\nIn this clip from yesterday, Bernie Sanders also weighs in on the GOP\u2019s \u201cWe want what we want when we want it\u201d blackmail plan. He explains how if the Senate and the President give into them and they get to see that it works, that this is just what they\u2019ll do all the time. Which, hey, they\u2019re kind of doing anyway. These are people who, for the most part, bragged about their plans to shutdown the government before they were even elected or knew why they\u2019d be shutting it down! They never even planned on doing anything other than getting paid for having fancy titles, like some kind of American Royalty.\n\nIn addition to explaining his own position on the subject, Sanders also quoted several prominent Republicans who, though opposed to the Affordable Care Act, didn\u2019t think that shutting down the entire government if you don\u2019t get your way is the best way to run things. I hate to say it, I\u2019m actually starting to feel badly for these people. Peter King in particular. Sure, I don\u2019t agree with them on anything, but there\u2019s a difference between \u201cholding different positions than I do\u201d and being legitimately batshit crazy. It\u2019s a subtle difference, but it\u2019s there.\n\nAnother important thing that Sanders and Warren mention is that it\u2019s not just the Affordable Care Act they want to go away. They want to implement Paul Ryan\u2019s budget. Many of them want to eliminate the minimum wage, eliminate Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the EPA, Veteran\u2019s Benefits, etc. etc. If they were to get everything they want, we\u2019d have a serious, seriously dystopian world on our hands.\n\nThe GOP does not care about Democracy, they care about getting their own way. Thank goodness, at least, there are a few sane people left in government.
