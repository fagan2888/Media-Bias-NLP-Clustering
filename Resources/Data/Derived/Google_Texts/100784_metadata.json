Most Americans enjoy a good life. But far too many are still trapped in poverty and idleness and fear. Let a just nation throw open to them the city of promise:\n\nListed under \u201c Opportunity for All \u201d in Johnson\u2019s annual message to Congress was the following statement:\n\nJanuary 8, 1964 marked a half century since President Lyndon B. Johnson presented his State of the Union Annual Message to Congress in which he outlined his \u201cGreat Society\u201d program (a $20 trillion taxpayer-funded war on poverty) with its astounding number of proposals to enrich the life of man for the purpose of creating a world that is meant for all men to ultimately have.\n\nDuring Moynihan\u2019s address at the Urban Institute in 1966 \u2014 in his report titled, \u201cThe Negro Family: The Case for National Action\u201d \u2014 Moynihan reeled off the dire statistics about the plight of the African American families. Among the concerns Moynihan touted in 1966:\n\nAbout a quarter of Negro families are headed by women. The divorce rate is about two-and-a-half times what it is [compared with whites], the number of fatherless children keeps growing. And all these things keep getting worse, not better, over recent years.\n\nBy the 1990\u2019s much reflection was being done over Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs of the 1960s. What had happened? It is not surprising that different conclusions were reached at the time about how effective Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty had been.\n\nMichael Fumento expressed this concern in his June 19, 1992 article in Investor\u2019s Business Daily titled \u201cIs the Great Society to Blame? If Not, Why Have Problems Worsened Since the \u201960s.\u201d Fumento expressed then a concern that has become even more troubling in today\u2019s atmosphere in the Obama administration.\n\nSome may say, \u2018Who cares?\u2019 Let\u2019s stop laying blame and start implementing solutions.\u201d Yet, if government is to be part of the solution, some wonder if it isn\u2019t necessary to first ask if it hasn\u2019t been part of the problem.\n\nOn the blame side, George H. W. Bush administration spokesman Marlin Fitzwater blamed the Great Society programs for ignoring \u201cthe relationship between people\u2019s pride in their community and having a job.\u201d\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush noted how what was intended to be a \u201ccompassionate safety net\u201d not only consumed $3 trillion in 25 years, but also trapped many in an endless cycle of poverty that didn\u2019t reward individual initiative. The other side predictably argued that the programs were never given a chance to work \u2014 though, in fact, they never worked in the first place.\n\nFumento\u2019s 1992 article has statistics that are in keeping with Moynihan\u2019s expressed reason for the poverty he observed in 1966 in relation to the single-parent family:\n\nIn 1980, there were 6.2 million families headed by single women, making up 19.4% of all families with children. By 1990, that number had risen to 84 million families, or 24.2% of the total. Blacks were hit especially hard. . . . At the beginning of World War II, the illegitimate birth rate among black Americans was slightly less than 19%. Beginning in the late 1960s the trend rapidly accelerated, reaching 49% in 1975 and 65% in 1989.\n\nEmpirical studies back in the \u201990s, as they do today, have borne out the theory that welfare checks are behind much of the disintegration of the family. Statistics from the \u201990s:\n\nThe University of Washington showed that an increase of roughly $200 a month in welfare benefits per family correlated with a 150% increase in the illegitimate birth rate among teens.\n\nDavid Elwood of Harvard University found that of the 3.8 million families currently on AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children), well over half will remain dependent or more than 10 years, many others for 15 years or longer.\n\nNow it is 2014, fifty years after President Johnson\u2019s 1964, State of the Union address at which he announced an ambitious government undertaking to eradicate poverty, and is this nation any closer to winning the War on Poverty?\n\nThis concern remained important enough for President Obama to highlight it in his February 19, 2013, State of the Union Address.\n\nWe got single moms out here. They\u2019re heroic what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019re so proud of them. But at the same time, I wish I\u2019d had a father who was around and involved.\n\nAccording to Robert Rector, a specialist on welfare and poverty at The Heritage Foundation, the war on poverty has been a failure when measured by the overall amount of money spent ($20.7 trillion) and how poverty rates haven\u2019t changed significantly since Johnson gave his address back in 1964. Not withstanding, during the Obama administration the poverty level has reached a 50-year high. Rector went on the say that President Obama\u2019s anti-poverty effort \u201care basically to give more people more free stuff.\u201d That\u2019s exactly the opposite of Johnson\u2019s goal which was \u201cto make people prosperous and self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rector, too many government anti-poverty programs still discourage marriage. Statistics show how more than four in 10 children are born to unmarried parents. When the war on poverty started, about 6 percent of children were born outside of marriage.\n\nAs benefits swelled, welfare came to serve as a substitute for a breadwinner husband at home through the marginalization of the men who had heretofore headed those families. It is inconceivable today that a record 47 million Americans receive food stamps. That is about 13 million more than when Obama took office.\n\nIn commemoration of the 50 years and the $20 trillion spent since President Johnson used his State of the Union address in 1964, to declare his unconditional War on Poverty in America, the Wall Street Journal on January 7 published an opinion piece by Robert Rector: \u201cHow the War on Poverty Was Lost.\u201d\n\nWhat an unmitigated disaster. We never learn, no matter how bad the outcome. What do we do? We double down and believe more welfare will be better.\n\nAbout all we have accomplished in the last 50 years of this lost cause is to spend $20 trillion (that is with a t, and a very large sum of money); destroy the nuclear family idea (most tragically, blacks suffered most); moved out-of-wedlock birth from around 6% to over 41% (again mostly imposed on the African American community); destroyed any semblance of work ethic among those in poverty; and created a welfare society no economy can afford or sustain.\n\nImagine if just half of the $20 trillion was devoted to investment in infrastructure, or left in the hands of the private sector. How robust our economy would be? Imagine how strong this country would be if we had a public education system that functioned as it should \u2014 to actually educate our children \u2014 how strong this country and economy would be.\n\nBased on the weight of many Americans \u2014 and in particular, those classified at the poverty levels \u2014 we have at least ended hunger.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/lbjs-great-society-programs-at-the-core-of-nations-poverty/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LBJ-Great-Society.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "LBJ\u2019s \u2018Great Society\u2019 Programs Are at the Core of America\u2019s Poverty Crisis"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8023\"", "article_summary": "It is not surprising that different conclusions were reached at the time about how effective Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty had been.\nBy the 1990\u2019s much reflection was being done over Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs of the 1960s.\nBy 1990, that number had risen to 84 million families, or 24.2% of the total.\nMichael Fumento expressed this concern in his June 19, 1992 article in Investor\u2019s Business Daily titled \u201cIs the Great Society to Blame?\n\u2026 to the poor and the unfortunate, through doubling the war against poverty this year."}
