Although he wants to play again and finish out the season strong, and although he took infield practice Saturday, if the injury doesn\u2019t heal enough, Reyes will sit out the final seven games.\n\nThe bigger question is about his long-term future. Traded to Colorado as part of the deal with Toronto for Troy Tulowitzki, Reyes is owed $22 million over each of the next two seasons, making him Colorado\u2019s highest-paid player. There has been a lot of speculation that the Rockies will attempt to trade Reyes in the offeason, even if that means eating a large portion of his salary.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen in the offseason,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still part of this team and I have a contract for the next two years.\u201d\n\nStill, Reyes admitted that \u201cit feels weird\u201d being in his situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be up in the air in the offseason and not know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is baseball, so nothing surprises me. Nothing is promised as (to what\u2019s) going to happen. But for now, I\u2019m part of this ballclub.\u201d\n\nSaid manager Walt Weiss: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s our shortstop. I don\u2019t get caught up in the contract stuff.\u201d\n\nAs for his tender Achilles, Reyes is being cautious.\n\n\u201cThe Achilles is a very serious injury and you don\u2019t want to (tear) that,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to finish the season. But I don\u2019t want to go out there, try to be tough and make it worse. But if it\u2019s a little sore but good enough to play, I want to.\u201d\n\nIn 42 games with the Rockies, Reyes is hitting .253 with three homers, seven doubles, two triples and seven stolen bases.\n\nArenado won\u2019t back down. Nolan Arenado, who entered Saturday with 39 homers and a National League-leading 117 RBIs, has been hitting the dirt a lot lately as Pirates and Dodgers pitchers have thrown pitches high and tight.\n\nEach time, Arenado has popped back up and got right back to business.\n\n\u201cHe sticks his nose right back in there and he doesn\u2019t back off the plate,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him take aggressive swings on the very next pitch. He\u2019s a great competitor.\u201d\n\nWeiss doesn\u2019t think teams are going after Arenado, or testing him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a trend, but we will certainly protect our guys if we feel like we need to,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s a sign of respect. Nolan\u2019s become an elite hitter in this league and (pitchers) are afraid to miss over the plate. When the catcher calls for the ball in against a great hitter, the pitcher wants to make sure he doesn\u2019t leave it over the plate and have it get hit into the seats.\u201d\n\nPraise for Murphy. Rookie catcher Tommy Murphy wasn\u2019t originally pegged to get called up this season, but injuries to Michael McKenry and Nick Hundley expedited his promotion. He has made the most of the opportunity.He entered Saturday\u2019s game hitting .292 with three home runs and eight RBIs in just 24 at-bats. He\u2019s also shown veteran poise behind the plate. \u201cHe\u2019s a real hard-nosed kid, very mature,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nDodgers\u2019 Alex Wood (11-11, 3.60 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (5-9, 5.39), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 630 AM\n\nThe honor of pitching the final game of the season at Coors Field goes to Rusin, a left-hander who\u2019s run so hot and cold this season. He has two complete games at home this season, yet he\u2019s only 4-3 with a 5.31 ERA at Coors Field. In his past three starts, he is 0-2 with a 10.38 ERA. Wood, also a lefty, dominated the Rockies on Sept. 16 in a 2-0 victory for the Dodgers, allowing just one hit over eight innings, which tied a career high for innings pitched. Of course, that performance was at pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. In four career starts against Colorado, he is 2-1 with a 4.35 ERA.\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Christian Bergman (3-1, 4.62 ERA) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Robbie Ray (5-12, 3.53), 7:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (8-5, 4.38) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Chase Anderson (6-6, 4.40), 7:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 David Hale (5-5, 6.01) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Patrick Corbin (6-5, 3.28), 7:40 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jose Reyes in limbo as Rockies\u2019 season nears close", "title": "Jose Reyes in limbo as Rockies\u2019 season nears close", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/jose-reyes-in-limbo-as-rockies-season-nears-close/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__Jose-Reyesp1.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__Jose-Reyesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T18:08:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T22:17:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Limbo is not a comfortable place to reside, but that\u2019s where shortstop Jose Reyes finds himself as the Rockies\u2019 season draws to a close.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen in the offseason,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be up in the air in the offseason and not know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\nNothing is promised as (to what\u2019s) going to happen.\nBut if it\u2019s a little sore but good enough to play, I want to.\u201dIn 42 games with the Rockies, Reyes is hitting .253 with three homers, seven doubles, two triples and seven stolen bases."}
