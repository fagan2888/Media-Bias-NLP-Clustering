It is a problem not just affecting individuals, but families. The church needs to be the front-runner in this. Heaping guilt and shame on a person only leads them to escape into the things we\u2019re trying to rescue them from.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Rand Paul ducks Christian summit, parties with Alec Baldwin\n\nThe survey was taken earlier this year, and the results were compiled from the responses of 1,000 U.S. adults. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, at a 95 percent confidence level.\n\nThe survey did not break down Christian men who viewed pornography by their ages. But the poll did have age groupings for all male respondents, and 79 percent between the ages of 18 and 30 said they watch pornography at least monthly, while 29 percent of them said they view it daily.\n\nThe definition of pornography was left up to the respondents, Mr. Hesch said.\n\nJeremy Thomas, assistant professor of sociology at Idaho State University, said any survey involving sex is going to be limited in its data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get good information on sex, generally because people tend to be hesitant to respond,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the other things to realize is you could be getting a response bias. It could very well be religious and non-religious people view porn more or less [the same], but religious persons are a little more hesitant to say so.\u201d\n\nHowever, Christians might be more likely to self diagnose themselves as addicts. According to the survey, 15 percent of men who identified as Christian said they thought they might be addicted to porn, compared to 6 percent of non-Christian men who considered themselves addicted.\n\nThe trouble is that \u201cpornography addiction\u201d doesn\u2019t exist in the professional mental health community, said Joshua Grubbs, who focuses on clinical psychology of religion and addictive behavior patterns at Case Western University.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a diagnosis that\u2019s recognized,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there are some people who believe it is a diagnosis, but it\u2019s not recognized by the community at large.\u201d\n\nThough research is just beginning on why people might be anxious to admit their addiction, Mr. Grubbs said religion does play a big part of it.\n\n\u201cReligious people are more likely to say they feel addicted,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems to be stemming from religious people disapproving of pornography.\u201d\n\nThe thinking, he continued, is \u201cI\u2019m religious. I think pornography is bad, but I\u2019m a sexual person who thinks pornography is enjoyable. What would cause me to do something that is bad? Maybe I\u2019m addicted.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean pornography can\u2019t have a negative impact on someone\u2019s life, said William Struthers, a psychology professor at Wheaton College.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is [pornography viewing] can become an addictive pattern if they\u2019re not careful,\u201d Mr. Struthers said. \u201cYou may find those individuals who are feeling low or down, now they can view pornography, they can sexually act out, and the high of the orgasm gives them that moment of \u2018OK, that\u2019s gone, everything\u2019s better.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor Christians, faith can put them in a bind.\n\n\u201cReligion can serve to provide a richer understanding of sexuality. It can add spiritual and moral dimensions,\u201d Mr. Struthers said. \u201cThe problem is this cuts the other way. You can have higher highs but lower lows when committing sexual transgressions.\n\n\u201cThey can have a better understanding of sexuality, but that religion causes them to become much more compulsive in the ways in which they think about sexuality. That\u2019s why I think they\u2019ve gotten the message wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe church\u2019s message is \u2018Sex is bad. Don\u2019t do it until you\u2019re married.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome churches are having to re-brand their teaching on sexuality, whether by choice or because the culture is changing.\n\n\u201cChurches will lose this sexual red herring,\u201d said Eric Anderson, a sociologist at the University of Winchester who focuses on masculinity and sexuality. \u201cThey lost on premarital sex, on masturbation, on gay sex, on anal sex among heterosexuals and they will lose this war against pornography.\n\n\u201cIf you want evidence, all you have to do is look at the research, at what percent use pornography, and how young they start using it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the way for everyone to win is to embrace both the human and spiritual urges of Christians, said Mr. Grubbs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we do, what humans do. If you feel bad about sex in general, it\u2019s going to create problems for you elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going on in your head, so we can avoid those problems elsewhere.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are two kinds of Christians in America \u2014 those who watch porn and those who lie about it.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "There are two kinds of Christians in America \u2014 those who watch porn and those who lie about it.", "title": "More than half of Christian men admit to watching pornography", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/24/more-than-half-of-christian-men-admit-to-watching-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/24/8_242014_ap090625028618201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/24/8_242014_ap090625028618201.jpg", "description": "There are two kinds of Christians in America \u2014 those who watch porn and those who lie about it.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "More than half of Christian men admit to watching pornography"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Social Issues, Joshua Grubbs, Joel Hesch"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6b8\"", "article_summary": "Of the Christian men who did look at pornography, the majority did so several times per week.\nThe survey did not break down Christian men who viewed pornography by their ages.\n\u201cThey lost on premarital sex, on masturbation, on gay sex, on anal sex among heterosexuals and they will lose this war against pornography.\nI think pornography is bad, but I\u2019m a sexual person who thinks pornography is enjoyable.\nAccording to the survey, 15 percent of men who identified as Christian said they thought they might be addicted to porn, compared to 6 percent of non-Christian men who considered themselves addicted."}
