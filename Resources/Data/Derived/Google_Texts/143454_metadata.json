We are here to help. We got these tips from Reader's Digest, who went straight to the source, a telemarketer.\n\nErica Elson worked for a telemarketing company for two years and realized people had no clue how to make the calls stop.\n\nHere's what you need to know. You don't want to immediately hang up the phone, a telemarketer then marks your call as a \"no answer\" and they will call you back.\n\nYou don't want to get into a conversation, so don't ask questions and don't show interest.\n\nNext, don't get angry at the telemarketer. If you get upset, there's a good chance your name will go back into the phone number pool. That's an easy way the telemarketer gets revenge for you being rude and nasty.\n\nYou also shouldn't hang up in the middle of a conversation. They could list the call as \"disconnected\" and will call you back.\n\nHere's how to put an end to it. The best way is to tell the telemarketer to stop calling you. You say \"Please put me on your Do Not Call List\" and if they ask why, repeat it.\n\nYou can register on the national \"Do Not Call\" list. If you are on the list, it is illegal for companies to call you. But, non-profit organizations can still dial your number.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Nobody likes getting random calls from telemarketers. We are here to help.
