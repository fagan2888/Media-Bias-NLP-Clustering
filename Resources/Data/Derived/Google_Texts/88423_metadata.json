Or making the most of their reduced power in this Congress to solve problems and help those left behind in the economic recovery?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBy all measures, the bill represents a major breakthrough both in terms of government policy and House politics. No less than Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) helped craft the compromise, which incorporates significant changes in Medicare as well as billions in relief for children and the elderly living at the edge of poverty.\n\nBut even at this stage, Senate Democrats remain surprisingly cool, almost resentful.\n\nThose on the powerful Senate Finance Committee issued a \u201cunified\u201d statement late last week that did more to recite their reservations than encourage the House effort. The latest complaint is that Pelosi has been too quick to accept restrictions on abortions as part of a two-year extension of $3.6 billion in annual funding for community health centers.\n\nThis charge, promoted by Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s rights groups, carries added weight because of an ongoing battle in the Senate over anti-abortion language inserted in an otherwise bipartisan bill to combat human trafficking.\n\nBut a closer look shows the two fights are very different from a practical standpoint. And if Senate Democrats can\u2019t see past the trees and make this distinction, critics say it speaks volumes about their politics.\n\nIndeed, the tepid support from Senate Democrats also gives lie to their oft-stated concerns about income inequality. If the package fails in Congress, the very wealthy will escape having to pay more in Medicare premiums. The biggest losers will be low-income seniors and working-class households down the economic ladder.\n\nThe abortion issue \u2014 described by Democrats as radioactive \u2014 comes into play in the funding for the more than 1,200 community health centers around the nation.\n\nSince 2010, these centers have enjoyed a stream of mandatory appropriations first approved under the Affordable Care Act but due to expire at the end of this fiscal year, which falls on Sept. 30.\n\nWithout some relief, almost certain cuts will follow, given the caps imposed on discretionary spending in 2016. Equally important, any extra money which the health centers do secure in the coming budget battles will come out of the hides of other education, labor and health programs in 2016.\n\nAs a veteran of the House Appropriations Committee, Pelosi understands these stakes very well. So does Sen. Patty Murray (D- Wash.), who will have major influence over how Senate Democrats finally break on the House bill.\n\nIndeed, Murray represents almost her own trifecta here: A former teacher who identifies with the women\u2019s rights movement, a member of her party leadership and the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations panel, which oversees the annual bill funding the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nYet for all that, Murray has been largely mum and noncommittal.\n\nThe abortion language itself is not new. Named after its early champion, the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill), it has been attached to annual funding for HHS for better than three decades.\n\nAs such, it already applies to annual appropriations for community health centers. The language bars any use of taxpayer dollars for abortions except in cases of rape and incest or narrowlydefined circumstances when the pregnancy poses a threat to the life of the mother.\n\nThe tussle over the Boehner-Pelosi bill stems from a matter of legislative construction. The language makes reference to past appropriations riders affecting public health service programs but is applied here to an extension of health center funding rooted in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 not just an annual spending bill.\n\nSince the ACA is a permanent statute, it follows that any amendment to any part of the ACA seeps back into the U.S. Code.\n\nThis is a genuine worry for Planned Parenthood and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which fear that Republicans are waging a concerted campaign to quietly elevate the Hyde restrictions. But the similarities to the human trafficking bill soon end after that.\n\nIn the case of the trafficking bill, the reach of the Hyde language is extended so it applies to not just public funding but also private dollars: money collected from increased penalties on those who promote or take advantage of trafficking. This is important since the Crime Victims Trust Fund \u2014 established in 1984 and quite similar in its financing \u2014 is typically not covered by Hyde.\n\nSecond, almost by definition, the victims of human trafficking are often young women and girls who have been subjected to sexual abuse. The idea that Hyde would be applied here to limit medical services available during their recovery is infuriating for women\u2019s rights groups.\n\nThe situation for community health center funding is very different. Public money is much more clearly involved. Moreover, the population served by the centers has far broader health care needs than abortion \u2014 needs that will go unmet without the House bill.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray will have major influence over how Senate Democrats finally break on the House bill. | Getty\n\nOf the 22 million patients seen each year at the centers, 13 million are women or girls under 18, said Daniel Hawkins, a top policy official with the National Association of Community Health Centers. \u201cIf there is a women\u2019s health and children\u2019s health issue here, it will be if Congress doesn\u2019t act,\u201d he said.\n\nThe annual $3.6 billion is a mandatory appropriation. As such, Republicans allied with Boehner argue that the deal must include the same Hyde language that regularly applies to discretionary appropriations bills.\n\nAttorneys for women\u2019s rights organizations counter that this is not needed since President Barack Obama already agreed in a 2010 executive order that any such appropriations from ACA would be subject to Hyde-like restrictions.\n\nBut given all the Republican anger toward Obama\u2019s executive orders, it seems almost laughable to ask the GOP to accept this concession when it has the power to insist on legislation.\n\nWhen Democrats ran the Senate in the previous Congress, they cut deals of their own with Boehner. Time and again, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) urged the speaker to defy the Republican right and come more to the center.\n\nThe fact that Boehner is now doing precisely that with Pelosi is what makes the politics of the House bill so intriguing. But if the Senate Democratic response is to go into a sulk, the party risks further isolating itself.\n\nThe community health center provision is worth $7.2 billion alone over two years. Additional money would go to the National Health Service as well to permanently extend a program to help low-income seniors pay their Medicare Part B premium for physician services. The children of working class families would get a two-year extension of their Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program coverage and thereby insulate the program from what could be nasty fights this summer over Obamacare.\n\nBy playing tough, Senate Democrats may hope to get a longer, four-year extension of CHIP. That would be a genuine win. But it\u2019s a stretch to assume that Pelosi hasn\u2019t tried already. And without doubt, some senators are using CHIP to hide their nervousness about structural reforms demanding the wealthy pay more in Medicare premiums.\n\nActivists march in the annual March for Life, Jan. 22, 2015 in Washington, D.C. (M. Scott Mahaskey/Politico)\n\nThe Boehner-Pelosi compromise would end the flawed formula now governing Medicare reimbursements for physicians. But to help cover the costs, it asks high-income seniors to pay more beginning in 2018. Little about those affected could be described as middle class. Any couple for whom the higher premiums are a long-term concern would have to continue to enjoy an income of $267,000 or more into retirement.\n\nThe very breadth of the package has drawn diverse support.\n\nHow often do the conservative editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal and the liberal nonprofit Families USA support the same health care bill? When do the fiercely anti-tax Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform and Robert Greenstein, the founder and president of the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, agree on most anything at all?\n\nGiven all that, if Senate Democrats can\u2019t do more to work with their own fellow Democrats across the Capitol, won\u2019t voters begin to notice?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A bipartisan Medicare deal is a gut check moment.", "title": "Decision time for Dems: Abortion rights or helping the poor?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/decision-time-for-dems-abortion-rights-or-helping-the-poor-116321.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/23/150323_lede__452028666_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,National Women\u2019s Law Center,Medicare,Harry Reid,Planned Parenthood,Abortion,Department Of Health And Human Services,Affordable Care Act,Patty Murray,henry hyde,Senate,Health Care,Nancy Pelosi,House Of Representatives,Senate Democrats,John Boehner,hyde amendment", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A bipartisan Medicare deal is a gut check moment.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb17\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf there is a women\u2019s health and children\u2019s health issue here, it will be if Congress doesn\u2019t act,\u201d he said.\nAnd if Senate Democrats can\u2019t see past the trees and make this distinction, critics say it speaks volumes about their politics.\nIndeed, the tepid support from Senate Democrats also gives lie to their oft-stated concerns about income inequality.\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray will have major influence over how Senate Democrats finally break on the House bill.\nGiven all that, if Senate Democrats can\u2019t do more to work with their own fellow Democrats across the Capitol, won\u2019t voters begin to notice?"}
