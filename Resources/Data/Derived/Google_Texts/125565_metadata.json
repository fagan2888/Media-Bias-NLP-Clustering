The sounds, the lights, the corny decadence. \u2026 I love it all, except for one thing: I hate losing money. So in the handful of times I\u2019ve visited one, I\u2019d give myself a high-low limit. If I lost $100 or won $200, I\u2019d have to leave. I guess I\u2019m not much of a gambler.\n\nHad I been a gambler, I might have been more familiar with the sinking feeling of not only failing at our first I.V.F., but in watching thousands of dollars go down the drain with it.\n\nSee, when you start I.V.F., everyone tells you to have a plan: How much time and money are you willing to spend on the process? The answer to the first question was a no-brainer for us; we had only a year, maybe two at the most, to have a baby with my eggs. We wouldn\u2019t be able to continue on indefinitely the way some younger women with fertility problems can if they choose to.\n\nMoney \u2026 now that was a different question. How much would we be willing to spend?\n\nThe answer, it would seem, should be \u201ceverything,\u201d right? You\u2019d give everything you have just to have a baby, just as people sacrifice all they can once they have their children. But how much is it worth to us? How much would we borrow, how much can we spend? Is having a baby worth spending $10,000? $20,000? $100,000? $1,000,000?\n\n\n\nI am not sure how most people figure out the answer to this question. Some people surely can\u2019t afford it at all. How do the rest pay for I.V.F.? Some people crowdfund their treatment. Others take out mortgages, ask their parents or put it on their credit cards.\n\nI hate that we have to even consider this question. It\u2019s so crass. And so not fair.\n\nI know, life isn\u2019t fair, not in the least. A good friend has cancer, another was found to have H.I.V. Now those are conditions that must be treated, or my friends will die. We \u2013 all of us with fertility problems, with 150,000 I.V.F. cycles in a year (25 percent under age 35) according to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology \u2013 will not die if we don\u2019t have a child.\n\nOnly eight states have mandatory I.V.F. insurance coverage. (New York isn\u2019t one of them \u2013 insurance there varies but generally covers fertility medicines and certain procedures, though not I.V.F.) The Affordable Care Act will not be \u201cvery hopeful\u201d for the one in eight couples of childbearing age with fertility problems, according to Resolve, the National Infertility Association. The new act outlines 10 \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d including maternal and newborn care, mental health and pediatric services, but not infertility. States without fertility coverage before are unlikely to cover it again.\n\nSolomon and I will still have to pay out of pocket.\n\nNow, financially, we are what you might call N.Y.C. middle class. (With three advanced degrees between us, we are rich in education.) His full-time job and my part-time gigs \u2014 writing, editing, teaching, all in the moribund field of journalism \u2014 allow us to get by in New York City, but not abundantly. We have about as much money for I.V.F. as we do time: It\u2019s limited.\n\nOf course we were so sad at our first I.V.F. failing. But we were also dismayed at how quickly $5,000 of our savings \u2013 which we thought would be for our future child \u2013 was gone. (Although we were relieved that we hadn\u2019t done regular I.V.F., which costs $10,000 to $30,000.)\n\nAfter, we had to ask ourselves the hard question: How much are we willing to spend?\n\nAfter reviewing our finances, asking our generous families for help, revising our sparse budget (go Groupons!), we decided to invest in three or four cycles, what Dr. C. says will give us a reasonable idea of our chances for success.\n\nBut it\u2019s not really an investment. It\u2019s a gamble. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to stick to our limit. I hope that decision never has to be made.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131203125548, "BN": "parenting", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/parenting", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/parenting/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 3, 2013", "keywords": "Babies and Infants,Health Insurance and Managed Care,In Vitro Fertilization,Infertility,Parenting,Fertility Diary,_featured", "GBLC": "Fertility Diary", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/parenting/How Much Would You Pay to Have a Baby?
