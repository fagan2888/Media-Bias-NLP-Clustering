John McCain (R-Ariz.) called the Republican approach a \"fool's errand.\"\n\n\u201cWe started this on a fool\u2019s errand, convincing so many millions of Americans and our supporters that we could defund Obamacare,\" McCain said on CNN.\n\nLast week, former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who also vied for the GOP nomination in 2012, said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) \"did more harm\" than good by tying anti-Obamacare provisions to the government funding bill.\n\n\"I think he didn't do a very good job in pointing [his objective] out,\" Santorum said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"It's one thing to have a goal, and another thing to have a plan to get you to that goal, and he didn't figure that out.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2013 Government Shutdown 2013 Government Shutdown\n\n1 of 242 John Boehner Speaker of the House Rep.
