Indians got self-determination as official federal Indian policy, ethnic minorities gained a greater degree of civil rights, and the United States got out of the Vietnam War. On the negative side, hippies flocked to Indian reservations searching for Indian wisdom, in the process committing a form of theft Indian people now refer to as cultural appropriation.\n\nDuring those turbulent times the hippies literally ran for the hills in their attempts to escape a spiritually bankrupt social system and set up communes, inspired to a great degree by what they perceived to be American Indian lifestyles and values. Many of them, such as Black Bear Ranch in Northern California, still survive today.\n\nIn 2006 a documentary was made about BBR.\n\nThe communes were well-intentioned enough, fueled as they were by a desire to transcend systems of greed, social inequality, and environmental degradation the hippies had inherited from their ancestors.\n\nBut what they also inherited was a sense of settler entitlement to land based on that very system of capitalist greed they were trying to overcome. Most of them hadn\u2019t thought twice that the lands they were buying were stolen from the very people they were trying to emulate; they were just looking for good deals. But what they did in the process was repeat the patterns of settler colonialism they were simultaneously condemning. (For more on the topic of hippie communes and Indians see the book \u201cHippies, Indians, and the Fight for Red Power\u201d by Sherry L. Smith).\n\nBlack Bear Ranch was founded ironically on the slogan \u201cfree land for a free people,\u201d apparently oblivious to the fact that the land was stolen in the first place. Some of the Black Bear Ranch people are beginning to see themselves as complicit with settler colonialism in their idealist visions.\n\nRecently an open letter was written to the BBR members and \u201cfamily\u201d from a coalition of former BBR residents pointing out the ways the commune is founded on these contradictions. The letter raises the question, \u201ccan it be \u2018free land\u2019 if it is stolen land?\u201d\n\nWritten by non-Natives calling themselves \u201cUnsettling Klamath River,\u201d the letter skillfully employs the language of settler colonialism:\n\n\u201c[We] are an open community collective of settlers, many us former Black Bear residents, living on the Klamath and Salmon Rivers working to understand and respond to the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019: the continued occupation of Karuk, Hoopa, Yurok, Konomihu, Shasta, and Shasta New River Homelands. While we understand that the values of settler society are the problem and not necessarily settler people themselves, we recognize that we have a responsibility to face our position as beneficiaries of settler colonialism (even though we have not intended to benefit in this way).\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on to explain the ways the \u201cback to the land\u201d counterculture people built communities that reflected their own values but simultaneously became \u201cpart of the same system that created westward expansion, advertised famously with the promise of \u2018Indian Land for Sale.\u2019\u201d It describes \u201cportals\u201d that further inundated and displaced indigenous populations with settlers (such as BBR). The letter calls for closing the portals through a process of land repatriation:\n\n\u201cWe further believe that it would be a beautiful act for this family to offer to repatriate\u2014return\u2014the land base we call Black Bear Ranch. We can\u2019t say what this will look like, though this is a real conversation happening in these communities. The more voices and creativity that are a part [of] this conversation, the more powerful and possible this healing process will be. We do know that repatriation is a complete release of ownership and control, so it is important that this action is approached in that spirit, without any contingency on what happens on the land after the transfer. There are emerging ideas among Indigenous people about what this land project could become. We feel repatriation would be regenerative, healing and directly responsive to the wounds created by settler colonialism.\u201d\n\nIn 2012 scholars Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang wrote a hard-hitting essay called \u201cDecolonization is Not a Metaphor.\u201d The essay reminds readers of the ways the concept of decolonization has been used by non-Natives, losing the core of its meaning\u2014a political process to return land and self-determination to indigenous peoples. The authors talk about \u201csettler moves to innocence\u201d that strive to reconcile settler guilt and complicity and ensure settler future existence.\n\nTuck and Yang also call for an \u201cethic of incommensurability,\u201d meaning that decolonization is not responsible for answering the questions of settlers\u2019 futures. Those futures may not be knowable presently, but will reveal themselves in time.\n\nThe letter to Black Bear Ranch by the \u201cUnsettling\u201d group is a remarkable example of how some conscientious settlers are attempting to decolonize indigenous lands. It enacts an ethic of incommensurability by not demanding to know how decolonizing the lands will affect their own futures.\n\nThere is a non-defensive recognition of themselves as settlers, free of any moves toward settler innocence. It is a small ray of hope that some settlers are capable of standing in solidarity with indigenous peoples in a profoundly meaningful way to break down the oppressive systems that are threatening all of our futures, settler and indigenous alike.\n\nDina Gilio-Whitaker (Colville) is a freelance writer and Research Associate at the Center for World Indigenous Studies.
