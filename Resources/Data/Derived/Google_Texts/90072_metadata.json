It helped him pitch faster, he thought, with less wind resistance. That quirk of his personality is by far more memorable than when he walked out of the bullpen with a four-game, season-opening winning streak on the line.\n\nWho can remember Leskanic\u2019s blown save at Houston on April 30, 1995? Who can remember the last time the Rockies had won four games to open a season before this year?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Rockies manager Walt Weiss, the starting shortstop on that 1995 team. \u201cI vaguely remember getting off to a good start.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies were 4-0 again entering Saturday night\u2019s game against the Chicago Cubs. After a series sweep at Milwaukee and a home-opening win Friday, the Rockies were undefeated and had veteran right-hander Kyle Kendrick on the mound. He wasn\u2019t even in high school 20 years ago.\n\nBut like the 1995 Rockies, the streak stopped at 4-0. Two former Rockies \u2014 outfielder Dexter Fowler and pitcher Jason Hammel \u2014 helped cool Colorado\u2019s sizzling start, and Kendrick allowed a career-high eight earned runs in the Cubs\u2019 9-5 victory.\n\nThis is the Rockies\u2019 23rd season, and they never have started a season 5-0. But they won seven of their first eight games in 1995 on their way to a 77-67 record. That team earned the Rockies\u2019 first postseason berth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure people weren\u2019t picking us to win the World Series that year,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut I remember we had a pretty good feeling about the club.\u201d\n\nThe same applies to the 2015 Rockies. Their 21 extra-base hits in the first three games were the second-most by a major-league team since 1900. They had three more Friday. That left the Rockies and their fans feeling fine.\n\nBut Fowler, who went 0-for-5 during his return to Coors Field on Friday, busted out Saturday. He tripled in the first and second innings, scoring twice and knocking in two runs.\n\n\u201cDexter hits a lot of triples,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him do it here.\u201d\n\nIn 32 career at-bats against Kendrick, Fowler has four triples.\n\nThe Rockies, though, were hanging tough behind their new starter. After Fowler\u2019s two-run triple in the second inning, the Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado launched a 432-foot, two-run homer to left-center field, two-thirds of the way up the bleachers. That trimmed Chicago\u2019s lead to 3-2.\n\nBut Kendrick served up back-to-back solo home runs in the third, to Chris Coghlan and Mike Olt. Starlin Castro hit another on the first pitch of the fifth inning.\n\nKendrick, pitching at Coors Field for the first time since signing with the Rockies during the offseason, allowed three homers and five walks in five innings. His ERA rose to 6.00.\n\n\u201cMy command obviously wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cWalking five guys, that wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nHammel gave up eight hits, but he struck out six and walked none. He helped silence the top of the Rockies\u2019 lineup \u2014 Charlie Blackmon and Carlos Gonzalez combined to go 1-for-9. But DJ LeMahieu\u2019s 3-for-4 game lifted his average to .524.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nCubs\u2019 Kyle Hendricks (7-2, 2.46 ERA in 2014) vs. Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (1-0, 3.00 in 2015), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nLyles skidded into the end of last season, as the Rockies lost in five of his final six starts. But he\u2019s 5-1 with a 5.00 ERA in 11 career starts at Colorado. And he allowed just two runs on five hits in a 5-2 win at Milwaukee on Tuesday. When asked about Hendricks watching scouting video on a laptop, Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, jokingly: \u201cHe was checking out Wikipedia. \u2026 He\u2019s researching something to do with the Flatirons and Chinook winds. I think they were the two big topics today.\u201d\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post\n\nMonday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (0-0, 3.18) vs. Giants\u2019 Chris Heston (1-0, 0.00), 2:35 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Christian Bergman (0-0, 0.00) vs. Giants\u2019 Tim Hudson (0-0, 0.00), 8:15 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (0-0, 1.75) vs. Giants\u2019 Tim Lincecum (0-0, 0.00), 8:15 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kyle Kendrick hit hard in first loss for Colorado Rockies", "title": "Kyle Kendrick hit hard in first loss for Colorado Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/kyle-kendrick-hit-hard-in-first-loss-for-colorado-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_085755_colorado-rockies.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_085755_colorado-rockies.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T21:48:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T00:58:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4180\"", "article_summary": "I think they were the two big topics today.\u201dNick Groke, The Denver PostMonday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (0-0, 3.18) vs. Giants\u2019 Chris Heston (1-0, 0.00), 2:35 p.m., ROOTTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Christian Bergman (0-0, 0.00) vs. Giants\u2019 Tim Hudson (0-0, 0.00), 8:15 p.m., ROOTWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (0-0, 1.75) vs. Giants\u2019 Tim Lincecum (0-0, 0.00), 8:15 p.m., ROOT\nBut like the 1995 Rockies, the streak stopped at 4-0.\nAfter a series sweep at Milwaukee and a home-opening win Friday, the Rockies were undefeated and had veteran right-hander Kyle Kendrick on the mound.\nWho can remember the last time the Rockies had won four games to open a season before this year?\n\u201cI vaguely remember getting off to a good start.\u201dThe Rockies were 4-0 again entering Saturday night\u2019s game against the Chicago Cubs."}
