The value equation of care quality divided by cost simply is not emphasized, according to Davis.\n\n\u201cWe compete on who can do the most surgeries, who can do the most MRIs, because we get paid for doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the quality is there, that\u2019s nice, but it doesn\u2019t really matter to the provider because we\u2019re still getting paid anyway.\u201d\n\nIf a procedure needs to be repeated, providers just get paid twice, he noted.\n\nDavis envisions what is beginning to happen in the Lower 48 coming to Alaska, he said in an interview. That is, the \u201cvalue-based\u201d purchasing components of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, spreading to private payers.\n\nUnder the ACA, some Medicare payments are being held back based on patient satisfaction and procedure quality scores.\n\nThis year is the first year for provider penalties under the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System set up by the ACA.\n\nPenalties result from performance two years prior, so physicians who did not report in 2013 or were found unsuccessful that year receive a 1.5 percent penalty on Medicare payments, according to the American Medical Association. The penalty increases to 2 percent in 2016.\n\nLower 48 insurance companies are beginning to follow the ACA methodology, Davis said.\n\nBundled payments for predictable procedures \u2014 hip and knee replacements and back surgeries among others \u2014 that include \u201cthe whole episode of care\u201d down to physical therapy also emphasize value for payment, he said.\n\nPayers in Alaska have begun to ask for case rates and bundled payments. While no providers have agreed to those terms yet, Davis predicted they are not far off.\n\nThe state\u2019s small insurance market could slow the growth of bundled payments because insurers have less leverage, so it will likely start with the government structure and evolve into private plans.\n\n\u201cOnce the practice is in place it becomes sort of a natural progression\u201d through the types of payers, Davis said.\n\nDavis, Taylor and Tonjes all agreed that hospitals need to take a back seat in the state\u2019s care structure.\n\n\u201cWe all have to take a little bit of a leap of faith,\u201d Tonjes said.\n\nHe emphasized that patients aren\u2019t the only ones who need to change their behavior; hospital administrators do too.\n\nTaylor outlined the reasoning behind Alaska Regional\u2019s decision announced in January to open a community health clinic in Anchorage\u2019s Mountain View neighborhood, an area currently lacking in primary care. However, a bus route takes patients directly from Mountain View to the Alaska Regional emergency room, she noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paid very well for patients that come in with sniffles and sore throats and it\u2019s not the right thing to do,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cReimbursement does not encourage us to keep people out of the ER.\u201d\n\nThe Mountain View clinic is an effort to put proper, economical care where it is needed most, she said.\n\nTaylor has led Alaska Regional for nearly two years following hospital administration positions in Idaho and Denver.\n\nShe said primary care physicians led the decision-making process of appropriate care at her previous hospitals, another Lower 48 lesson Alaskans could learn from.\n\nThe idea of having one\u2019s health care guided by a primary care doctor doesn\u2019t always sit well in Alaska, when direct access to specialists is available, according to Taylor.\n\nThe lack of care management that exists in the state is costing everyone a lot of money, she said, because preventative care and less-expensive treatment options often aren\u2019t explored.\n\nTaylor used the example of a patient going under the knife for back pain who might have missed key care steps such as physical therapy because they went directly to a specialist before consulting a primary care physician.\n\n\u201cThis is not just the hospital reducing cost or physicians aligning; this is changing behavior and an expectation (by patients) that\u2019s been set for many years,\u201d she said.\n\nIn small Alaska communities, hospitals will still be the umbrella organization for care, but patients will be directed to primary physicians under this coordinated care model.\n\nDavis said he is in the early stages of shifting the mentality among providers towards a coordinated care model at Central Peninsula Hospital.\n\nPopulation health management is an angle of coordinated care he feels could work well in Alaska.\n\nIn the population health management structure, large payers \u2014 state Medicaid and large defined groups \u2014 and providers agree to a lump sum payment amount to cover groups of patients numbering into the thousands each year.\n\n\u201c(Population health management) gives the payer a confidence that their costs aren\u2019t going any higher and it incentivizes the system to put better coordination of care in place,\u201d Davis said.\n\nBecause group members can now go out of network and still charge the provider group, providers are encouraged to get the patient as healthy as possible as inexpensively as possible, according to Davis.\n\nPayment amounts are negotiated on available data and stop-loss insurance for providers is available to cover costs exceeding the payment, particularly for smaller groups where percentage cost variance risk increases.\n\nThe group management system also pushes provider networks to invest in behavioral health and primary care as ways to avoid high-cost ER use and prevent long-term conditions as often as possible, Davis said.\n\nAlaska\u2019s primary care and behavioral health provider shortage would not be a major issue under a coordinated care model, according to Davis.\n\nAccording to the Alaska\u2019s Health Workforce Vacancy Study, about 20 percent of primary care positions are vacant in rural areas of the state. Rural behavioral health positions are 14 percent vacant, according the report released in August 2014.\n\nStatewide, there is a need for a 10 percent increase in behavioral health professionals, the report states.\n\nCoordinated care has helped increase wages for primary care physicians and slowed specialist pay increases in the Lower 48 where it has been implemented, he said. Higher wages in Alaska should encourage more primary care and behavioral health providers, he said.\n\n\u201cThe incentive is to shift the money over to those primary care providers who are going to be the captain of the ship,\u201d Davis said.\n\nElwood Brehmer can be reached at elwood.brehmer@alaskajournal.com.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Reducing Alaska\u2019s health care costs, or at least limiting cost escalation, will require philosophical shifts from both patients and providers, according to the leaders of three of the state\u2019s hospitals.
