To make the case, the CSA drags out a quotation by Vladimir Lenin to further link the Affordable Care Act to the Soviet era. According to CSA, Lenin said, \u201cSocialized medicine is the keystone to the arch of the socialist state.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Lenin probably never said that, and that the quote appears to have originated in 1949, when the American Medical Association (AMA) launched a campaign against President Truman\u2019s proposal to create a national health insurance system.\n\nBut playing loose with history hasn\u2019t stymied the CSA, headed by James Lafferty, husband of current TVC president Andrea Lafferty.\n\nIn its latest letter, the CSA makes the case that the Affordable Care Act is how President Obama is going to \u201cinstitutionalize ObamaCare so that we can never get rid of it.\u201d He\u2019s determined to do this, the CSA continues, \u201cbecause nationalized health care is the link that connects his promise to \u2018fundamentally transform\u2019 America and his drive to turn America into a Socialist state.\u201d\n\nSimilar claims equating the President\u2019s health care plan to socialism have run rampant on the radical right. And this isn\u2019t the first time the CSA has used fundraising letters that prey on unfounded fears.\n\nIn 2006, the CSA mailed letters with bogus \u201cU.S. Taxpayer Census\u201d forms as part of a packet that included a survey about Social Security and warnings about politicians raiding the program for personal gain. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the mailing did not explicitly point out that money donated to CSA would go directly to TVC.\n\nRight Wing Watch also pointed out that CSA/TVC mailed its \u201cTaxpayer Census Forms\u201d out again in 2008, which garnered concerns from some senior citizens who had received them. And in 2010, CSA sent out more packets, attempting to fundraise in order to lobby against President Obama and AARP for their \u201csocialist agenda.\u201d\n\nBut this current letter plays on historic memes, including the famous right-wing fabrication of \u201cdeath panels\u201d \u2013 the right wing worry that government-sponsored \u201cpanels\u201d will determine which individuals are \u201cworthy\u201d of healthcare under the Affordable Care Act. The claim derives from a provision in the ACA in which Medicare would reimburse doctors who discuss end-of-life wishes with patients and ensure those preferences are followed. To right wing media, however, it was \u201cevidence\u201d that doctors would somehow talk their elderly patients into \u201ceuthanasia.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the CSA states that, \u201cFor us, ObamaCare means more than the end of freedom and the advent of socialism. For us, ObamaCare means the institution of DEATH PANELS that will decide what health care we can receive,\u201d putting \u201cdeath panels\u201d in caps throughout the letter, to ensure you see the term.\n\nThe CSA also includes warnings about the president\u2019s mythical \u201cwar on Christians\u201d (especially in terms of forcing religious people to \u201csubmit\u201d to marriage equality). According to the CSA, \u201cThe President has unleashed every government agency \u2013 including the military! \u2013 to hound and persecute Christians because we oppose his God-less vision for America.\u201d\n\nThe letter of course includes no examples of this alleged hounding or persecution.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Lafferty is also known on the anti-Muslim circuit. He headed up the \u201cVirginia Anti-Sharia Task Force,\u201d and sits on the board of the anti-Muslim hate group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, along with notorious anti-Muslim activist Pam Geller.\n\nSo how can you help the CSA in its war against Obama, socialism, LGBT people, death panels, and AARP? Send money. Lots. The CSA requests just over $5 million to \u201cdeliver a series of fatal blows to ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nBut before you deliver those fatal blows, go over to the CSA website for your daily dose of irony, where you can sign up for the CSA Insurance Exchange/Marketplace. Billed as a private health insurance exchange, the CSA marketplace explains how the Affordable Care Act provides a public exchange funded by the federal government that ensures all Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare. If that\u2019s not your bag, the page explains how private exchanges offer alternatives to people who don\u2019t qualify for a government subsidy.\n\nAnd then you can speak to a licensed agent. One wonders if that agent will bring up DEATH PANELS, socialism or the war on Christians.
