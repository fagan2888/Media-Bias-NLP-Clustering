Louie Gohmert says he\u2019s dropped his health coverage because it\u2019s too expensive under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOther people are going to see what I did when I looked into health insurance for my wife and me: that the deductible rate, it doubled, about $3,000 to $6,000, and our policy was going to go from about $300 to about $1,500 a month,\u201d the Texas Republican said in a local radio interview Sunday, The Dallas Morning News reported. \u201cI actually don\u2019t have insurance right now, so thank you very much, Obamacare.\u201d\n\nGohmert, an outspoken opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, told the Morning News he couldn\u2019t afford to pay more than quadruple what he had been paying before.\n\n\u201cI lost my health care. I liked it OK, but I didn\u2019t get to keep it,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to go up four or five times what I was paying and double my deductible, and so I\u2019m better off with just setting money aside for health care and paying the penalty.\u201d\n\nBut as the Morning News noted, Gohmert is eligible for a nearly $950 monthly subsidy as a member of Congress, which he and other lawmakers have previously denounced as special treatment and which Gohmert vowed not to accept.\n\nAs the newspaper also reported, Gohmert is eligible for free outpatient care at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a U.S. representative, though pays full price for in-patient treatment. He can also receive routine exams and certain tests at the U.S. Capitol\u2019s physician\u2019s office for a flat yearly fee. His wife is not eligible.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Rep.
