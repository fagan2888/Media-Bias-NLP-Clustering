OK, so maybe it's not that easy.\n\nThe company made a few other improvements to its platform, as well. Google Docs's Android app has a new research feature so you can pull in facts, images, quotes and more from Google search. Google Sheets features new visualization tools for all your data; and the company has added pre-designed templates for Docs, Sheets and Slides.\n\nThis video includes images from Google.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google introduced a few new features to its Docs platform.
