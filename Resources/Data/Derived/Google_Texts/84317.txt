GOP Presidential Candidates Get Down with Funky Selves on SNL (watch!)

Republican presidential candidates never had much of a cool quotient, but not now.andshowed how they can get down at the… SNL style.

“Saturday Night Live” cast members Beck Bennett (Huckabee), Kenan Thompson (Carson), Bobby Moynihan (Cruz), Kate McKinnon (Fiorina), Kyle Mooney (Paul) and Taran Killam (Rubio) shaked, rattled and rolled during the cold open.

If only it were so.

Cecily Strong played DJ and introduced the head-bopping, hip swaying candidates, who danced to some of their more outlandish political pronouncements.

“What up, what up, what up… Southern Republican Leadership Conference,” she said warming up the crowd and making introductions.

Carson, the Yale-educated retired neurosurgeon, compared Obamacare to slavery. Badda-boom!

“Put this guy in prison, because he’s gonna steal your vote. But watch out, if sexuality works they way he says it does, he might turn gay in there,” said Strong.

Former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee entered stage right with his thumpin’ bass guitar. He also promises to “shred” Obamacare.

“People say that’s crazy, but he don’t give a Huck!,” Strong rhymed.

If you think that’s crazy, Strong was just getting started. Guess what candidate is anti-Obamacare, anti-gun control and pro marijuana!
