The dentist, who saw the children at the request of the Department of Children and Families, found infections and a severe cavity on every tooth; six teeth were in such bad shape they had to be pulled.\n\nIn a separate case, testimony is continuing against a Brevard County woman accused of child abuse and neglect, WFTV Channel 9 reports. Investigators say the boy was restrained for months, tied to his bed or locked in a closet or bathroom. A former teacher said she contacted DCF in 2010 because she suspected the boy was being starved. DCF says it\u2019s now taking another look at its investigation -- which found no criminal activity -- prompted by that complaint. The boy and two other children were removed from the home in 2012. At that time, he was 12 years old and weighed just 40 pounds.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "A Palm Beach County woman was charged with child neglect after a dentist found that her 2- and 3-year-old children had mouths riddled with cavities, the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/mom-arrested-over-kids-tooth-decay", "type": "article", "description": "A Palm Beach County woman was charged with child neglect after a dentist found that her 2- and 3-year-old children had mouths riddled with cavities, the", "title": "Mom Arrested Over Kids\u2019 Tooth Decay"}, "story_id": 261060783, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Health News Florida Staff", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Mom Arrested Over Kids\u2019 Tooth Decay"}, "nid": 5139, "datePublished": "2014-01-09", "keywords": "Department of Children and Families, DCF, child neglect, child abuse, dental hygiene, complaint, tooth decay, investigation, starvation", "wordCount": 309, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In a separate case, testimony is continuing against a Brevard County woman accused of child abuse and neglect, WFTV Channel 9 reports.\nA Palm Beach County woman was charged with child neglect after a dentist found that her 2- and 3-year-old children had mouths riddled with cavities, the Palm Beach Post reports.\nInvestigators say the boy was restrained for months, tied to his bed or locked in a closet or bathroom.\nA former teacher said she contacted DCF in 2010 because she suspected the boy was being starved.\nDCF says it\u2019s now taking another look at its investigation -- which found no criminal activity -- prompted by that complaint."}
