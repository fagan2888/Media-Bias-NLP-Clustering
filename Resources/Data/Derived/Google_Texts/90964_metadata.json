Peyton Manning led the Broncos to five touchdowns, but they didn\u2019t clinch their 35-19 win until they turned away a Jaguars drive with about four minutes remaining.\n\nPosluszny did his part to keep the game interesting, returning an interception of a Manning pass 59 yards for a second-quarter TD that trimmed Denver\u2019s lead to 14-12.\n\n\u201cThat was an exciting play,\u201d Posluszny said of his first NFL touchdown. \u201cAndre Branch made a great block that got me in the end zone.\u201d\n\nFellow linebacker Russell Allen discounted any thought that the Broncos, now 6-0, overlooked the Jaguars (0-6).\n\n\u201cThey jumped up 14-0,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey were ready to play. We got their best shot. They\u2019ve had a lot of notoriety because they\u2019ve earned it. They probably have the best quarterback of all time. We did a lot of good things today, but came up short. We\u2019re improving, but we\u2019re not were we want to be.\u201d\n\nJacksonville coach Gus Bradley said the Broncos were simply too talented for his rebuilding club.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going in the right direction, but we\u2019re trying to get the outcome to go in our favor,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe let their emotion get the best of us, but we were able to come back and do some good things.\u201d\n\nBradley said his team needs to build off what it did well and improve on what it didn\u2019t do well.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about the point spread,\u201d he said. \u201cWe celebrate the victories within the game. We got a pick six. The overall outcome we\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t where we want to be.\u201d\n\nBradley credited Denver with having a lot of weapons. The surprise was the threat the Jaguars posed on offense. Coming into the game, they were the lowest-scoring team in the NFL, averaging only 10 points.\n\nVeteran quarterback Chad Henne, who didn\u2019t talk with the media after the game, seemed to give Jacksonville a lift. He replaced struggling Blaine Gabbert, who\u2019s injured.\n\n\u201cI thought he showed leadership and he was competitive,\u201d Bradley said of Henne. \u201cIt was good to see Chad do some good things, but he\u2019s not where he has to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jaguars, Paul Posluszny thought a win was there to take vs. Broncos", "title": "Jaguars, Paul Posluszny thought a win was there to take vs. Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/13/jaguars-paul-posluszny-thought-a-win-was-there-to-take-vs-broncos/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__paul-posluszny-peyton-manning-int-broncos-101313p1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__paul-posluszny-peyton-manning-int-broncos-101313p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-13T19:24:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:01:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29b6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe thought we\u2019d win the game,\u201d Posluszny said.\nPaul Posluszny has the linebacker look and maybe that\u2019s why nobody laughed Sunday in the Jacksonville locker room when he said the Jaguars didn\u2019t come to Denver in search of a moral victory.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t care what the outside world thought.\u201dThe outside world thought the Jaguars were going to get hit with a wrecking ball, with the Broncos favored by 27 points.\nPeyton Manning led the Broncos to five touchdowns, but they didn\u2019t clinch their 35-19 win until they turned away a Jaguars drive with about four minutes remaining.\n\u201cAndre Branch made a great block that got me in the end zone.\u201dFellow linebacker Russell Allen discounted any thought that the Broncos, now 6-0, overlooked the Jaguars (0-6)."}
