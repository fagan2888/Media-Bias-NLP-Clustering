Those figures from the Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics are only part of the story.When factoring in all individuals under adult correctional supervision, which includes those supervised in the community on probation or parole, the year-end 2013 figure stands at 6.89 million.That\u2019s a lot of people. And they all have at least one thing in common: the need for healthcare services.\u201cIt behooves everybody in corrections to understand that some of these people are very bad, but they are people,\u201d says David Thomas, MD, JD, EdD, professor and chair of the Department of Surgery and Division of Correctional Medicine at Nova Southeastern University\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine. \u201cNo matter why these people are incarcerated, they are people and they need to be treated like people.\u201dThomas is well versed in correctional healthcare. As the medical director of Florida\u2019s Zephyrhills Correctional Institute, he has provided full-time, hands-on healthcare services inside a prison facility. It was a job he took because he initially thought it would be an \u201cout of the way, less stressful environment\u201d in which to work. But that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cManipulation and drug-seeking is a much larger problem than in the non-incarcerated world,\u201d says Thomas, assessing life behind prison bars. \u201cIn addition, at least 20% of the patients are significantly troubled with a mental disease.\u201dThe disease processes are also more advanced than in the average practice or tertiary care center for 2 reasons. First, those incarcerated usually do not receive even routine medical care until they arrive in prison. And second, their lifestyle before being incarcerated leads them to acquire an epidemiology of diseases different from what is seen in the non-incarcerated world.\u201cPrisons are repositories of mental health problems, HIV problems, and hepatitis-C problems,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWhen these people are not in prison their physical health status means very little to them. Their life is full of other concerns like where their next meal is coming from, or where their next fix is coming from. Healthcare, when they are not incarcerated, is frequently not a high priority for them.\u201dThomas explains that having the right mindset, and being educated in the proper mindset, is key to being a good correctional provider. With that in mind, he founded the nation\u2019s first correctional medicine fellowship at NSU. That\u2019s a major milestone, considering the last medical specialty to be established was emergency medicine in 1976.The fellowship is a 2-year, hands-on clinical didactic program, at the end of which graduates come out with a master of public health degree and a board eligibility or a board certification in correctional medicine which is administered by the American Osteopathic Association. During that fellowship they\u2019re exposed to a gamut of correctional medicine.\u201cA jail is entirely different than a prison, yet most people lump them all together,\u201d Thompson explains. \u201cJails are generally short-term facilities with a lot of acute problems. Physicians are trained in the care of intoxication, or care of an acute diabetic episode.\u201dPrison, on the other hand, is filled with chronic problems. For example, inmates often have significant resistance to many of the drugs for HIV, because they take them while they\u2019re in the incarcerated setting, but once they get out, they may take them once in a while or not at all.\u201cWhen they get re-arrested and go back in, you have to figure out a new regimen for them which will work, because they have created resistance to some of the other regimens,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cSo, there is a broader scale of knowledge that many physicians must have, and in some areas, it has to be much deeper.\u201dThompson explains that, for the most part, inmates are more compliant and very receptive to medical care. But there are exceptions. Some patients will refuse care because that\u2019s the one way they can act out. It\u2019s one of the few things they can control in their life while incarcerated.\u201cThat\u2019s why it makes it a great environment for students and residents because you can see the natural history of a disease,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cAnywhere else, if I treat your diabetes and you don\u2019t like me, you go someplace else, or you don\u2019t go to anybody. In a correctional environment, if you refuse my care for diabetes, I still get to see you back, and I get to see what happens to an untreated diabetic.\u201dWhen Mel Carr felt that his medical career as an internist wasn\u2019t advancing, he took a part-time job providing healthcare services to inmates at a correctional facility in southern California. Carr is a pseudonym. The physician was granted anonymity in exchange for speaking with MD Magazine.As his interest in a private practice continued to decline, his time at the prison was becoming more and more interesting. So when he was offered a full-time position at the correctional facility, he took it.\u201cI just thought this was going to be another temporary stop, that I wasn\u2019t going to be doing it very long,\u201d Carr recalls. \u201cI was still trying to get something started in the private sector. I wanted to go solo.\u201dInstead, Carr spent 20 years working at the correctional facility. But his tenure might not have lasted nearly as long had it not been for the influence of Austin Ryder, MD, an older medical colleague at the prison.\u201cI kind of looked at things on the negative side,\u201d Carr says. \u201cWhen you work under the correctional department, they don\u2019t want you to do much for the inmates. You\u2019re kind of battling these bureaucracies.\u201dBut Ryder, an African-American, had gone through his share of challenges and prejudices during his career and had developed an optimistic perspective. That perspective rubbed off on Carr.\u201cWe started working together and I began to see things these challenges as an amazing opportunity,\u201d Carr says. \u201cI got organized and started putting together protocols, training doctors, and further educating myself. It was kind of like a new frontier.\u201dAs he explored that frontier Carr encountered many individuals with a dual diagnosis: medical problems and mental health problems. As such, he found himself handling a greater array of conditions than a physician might in a private practice.\u201cA doctor (in traditional practice) just kind of does his discipline, and then, if there\u2019s some underlying problem, he\u2019s relying on some other doctor to take care of the depression, or the schizophrenia, or bipolar,\u201d Carr explains. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that opportunity to deal with the whole patient.\u201dOne key skill Carr developed was compassion.\u201cYou need to be competent, but you have to have compassion,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think you need to have a public health background, too. We had a measles outbreak. There\u2019s a lot of TB, and a lot of sexually transmitted or social disease that you don\u2019t necessarily see in the private setting.\u201dToday, Carr is back in private practice. What made him leave after 20-plus years? Much of his decision had to do with conflict and internal bureaucracy. He often found himself caught in the middle in battles over whether inmates should remain in the prison when they were ill or should be admitted to a hospital.\u201cThe hospital didn\u2019t want us to put them there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe struggled for years to try to get an isolation cell, but couldn\u2019t get it. We struggled for years to get mental health to admit their patients somewhere else, and couldn\u2019t make that happen.\u201dIn addition, Ryder was getting older, and was eventually moved out of his position. Carr immediately clashed with the new physician in charge.\u201cThey were treating me like I was one of the orderlies,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe situation became unbearable. So I did some deep thinking and decided it was time to go. You have to know when it\u2019s your time to leave.\u201dCarr details his 20-year experience in his book \u201cTitle XV\u201d \u201cThe book is an acknowledgement to those who accepted their situation and continued to provide care to those in need,\u201d he says. \u201cWe often mistreat those working in this capacity. But in the end, their commitment to do great work benefits society.\u201dWhen Johnny Wu, MD, FACP, CCHP, finished his residency training in internal medicine at Seton Hall in 2001, he joined a large specialty internal medicine/cardiology group in Bridgewater, NJ. There, he had an opportunity to provide general ambulatory service several days a week at the nearby Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women.Today, as director of medical services, fellowship program director, and assistant clinical professor at UConn Health\u2019s correctional managed healthcare unit, he looks back on the experience as enabling him to become a true internist.\u201cAn internist is someone who handles everything, you know, outside of something that needs surgical intervention,\u201d Wu explains. \u201cNowadays, when people say primary care, they\u2019re looking at family medicine, and sometimes it\u2019s implied you\u2019re not as good because you didn\u2019t go on and get any additional specialized training. But even though I might not have the credential of finishing a board certification of, say, infectious diseases or critical care or gastroenterology, I am able to handle all that stuff, with the exception of having to do procedures.\u201dThat\u2019s important, because working in correctional healthcare, Wu says he has the opportunity to truly be controlling his medical home.\u201cI trained in Grenada at St. George\u2019s University, so I understand Third World medicine and the British system of training, where the physician takes ownership to try to diagnose, take a very good history, and do a very good physical examination,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s being lost these days.\u201dThrough an agreement with the Department of Corrections in Connecticut, Wu and his staff of 750 full-time and 50 part-time healthcare professionals provide medical, dental, and mental health services to inmates, often right on site. And they see everything from advanced HIV to hepatitis-C to cancer at an early stage.\u201cIn textbooks you say okay, this patient has this one disease, so you just focus on it and treat it,\u201d Wu says. \u201cBut we have a patient who has all of these diseases, and they\u2019ve never even seen a physician. They\u2019ve let it go for so long it takes time for us to try and stabilize them.\u201dWu has worked closely with the medical staff at John Dempsy Hospital, which is part of UConn Health, to explain and teach about the culture of correctional healthcare. Initially, students began to shadow his staff, and before long nurse practitioners and pharmacy students began rotating through the jails and prisons.\u201cWe approached the American Osteopathic Association about our intent to create a program that would encompass training on all the different aspects of correctional medicine,\u201d Wu says. \u201cSurprisingly, it was approved rather quickly. Now we\u2019re the second accredited program in the country after Nova Southeastern that Dave Thomas put together.\u201dWu says that as a clinician working in correctional healthcare, being able to take care of a patient and see their improvement, see the impact that he had, is tremendously rewarding. He often receives letters from appreciative patients stating things like, \u201cYou treated me with dignity. You treated me with respect. Nobody else ever treated me like this before.\u201d Some have even contacted him following incarceration and asked if he would be their private physician.\u201cI don\u2019t practice in the private community,\u201d says Wu, but he acknowledges that the response he receives from patients is a direct result of the trust he has fostered with them.\u201cCorrections is becoming more like a managed care model,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly HMO, some medical home, and I feel like these are my patients. It\u2019s like back in the day, when doctors were in control of a town.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Physicians who work in correctional facilities face a range of challenges, from patients with multiple ailments and spotty health histories, to bureaucratic hurdles, and non-compliant patients.
