NORRISTOWN >> The Norristown Regional Medical Center hosted an open enrollment event Saturday for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Visitors were welcome to come in and sign up for health care insurance, make changes to their current plan and ask questions about eligibility. Enrollment is open from now until Feb. 15, 2015, and more than 41 different health care plans are available.

Norristown Regional Health Center, located at 1401 DeKalb Pike, is part of Delaware Valley Community Health, which provides medical care, social services, adult services, pediatrics and, now, health service enrollment.

The open house allowed individuals to speak with staff members about health care options. They could also ask questions about eligibility for programs such as Medicare and CHIP. The number of options has increased this year in both programs in terms of income guildlines. There were also screenings and information for anyone with a medical condition.

For initial sign-ups, help was provided to create email accounts and healthcare.gov accounts.
