The drone had been brought in as a reference to Paul\u2019s famous filibuster calling for President Barack Obama\u2019s clarification on whether the federal government believed it was constitutional to use drones to kill U.S. citizens on American soil.\n\nIn his remarks, Paul recounted his political path and experiences in the Senate. He spoke of the mere one-sixth of \u201cnon-essential\u201d designated government employees who were sent home during the 2013 government shutdown that was blown far out of proportion in the media.\n\nPaul then moved to discuss the importance of government separation of powers.\n\n\u201cReally the worst thing that the President\u2019s done to the country is the collapse of the separation of powers,\u201d Paul stated\u2013worse, he said, than Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. The idea of the separation of powers \u201ccame from Montesquieu. It was this idea that each branch would be coequal and they would check the power of the others.\u201d Montesquieu warned, he said, \u201cthat if the executive branch begins to legislate that a type of tyranny will ensue.\u201d\n\nPaul concluded: \u201cThere needs to be more jealous guarding of power and protection of power to each branch.\u201d\n\nReferring to the recent expiration of the Patriot Act, Paul recounted the experience of John Adams as he watched James Otis giving testimony in court concerning the issuance of general warrants by England\u2019s King. He said that is what led Adams to say that \u201cit [execution of general warrants] was the spark that led the revolution.\u201d\n\nPaul went on to make his case against government collection of digital and phone records, which had used the Patriot Act as justification. He called the data collection execution of general warrants.\n\nThen he spoke of Benghazi. What was most horrifying about the acts surrounding the events on September 11, 2012 in Benghazi, Libya wasn\u2019t the lying or the cover-up, Paul said. Rather, the events in the nine months leading up to the murder of four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador, were the most worrisome. One six person Special Forces team was removed in February, another in March, Paul told the crowd. In April 2012 tensions had been rising, so the team on the ground requested a DC-3 airplane in case of emergency. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department denied it, Paul said.\n\n\u201cThree days after Hillary Clinton denied the plane, you know what Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved? A hundred thousand dollar request for a charging station for the Vienna embassy. Seems we were sprucing up, we were greening up the embassy.\u201d\n\nHe recounted the $650,000 spent on State Department Facebook ads, $700,000 on landscaping at the Brussels embassy, $100,000 on comedians for the \u201cMake Chai Not War\u201d Tour to India, and $5 million for crystal barware for embassies.\n\nThen, in August 2012, said Paul, \u201cAmbassador Stevens begins sending cables, cable after cable, describing the deterioration of the situation\u201d in Benghazi. Hillary Clinton was \u201cmaking decision after decision that made our people vulnerable.\n\nHe concluded that her conduct \u201cshould forever preclude her from being Commander In Chief.\u201d\n\nPaul also said:\n\nI think the things that we\u2019re for we need to be boldly for and if anything be more boldly for, balanced budgets, low taxes stimulate the economy\u2026 lower regulations, all of that.\n\nWe need to become the party of the entire Bill of Rights. We need to be the party that champions individual freedom and liberty for everyone.\n\nWe have to be the party that\u2019s with tattoos, without tattoos, with earrings, without earrings\u2026We\u2019ve got to be a party that looks like America.\n\nBut the thing is is that there are parts of the Bill of Rights that haven\u2019t gotten much attention\u2026\n\nThe Sixth Amendment says that you have a right to a trial by jury. Says you have the right to a speedy trial. And people say, well who could be opposed to a trial by jury? I could name names. We had a debate in 2011, we had a debate over whether American citizens could be detained indefinitely without a trial. And I\u2019m having this debate with another Republican Senator. I won\u2019t name names, he\u2019s from Arizona.\n\nPaul recalled asking the Senator, \u201cDo you mean an American citizen can be sent to Guantanamo Bay without a lawyer, without a trial, forever? And he said yeah, if they\u2019re dangerous.\u201d Paul said he responded to the Senator, \u201cWho gets to decide who\u2019s dangerous and who\u2019s not?\u201d\n\nPaul then recounted the story of Kalief Browder. Browder spent three years at Rikers Island Prison Complex without a trial before being released. \u201cThe person that accused him of the crime was in the country illegally, never was found again.\u201d Paul stated Browder was beaten by gangs and attempted suicide several times while in prison before his release. Sadly, Bowder succeeded in committing suicide last week, Paul stated.\n\nYou wonder why people are unhappy? And you want to say we want to be the party that brings people in and says we\u2019re going to be your party? We\u2019re going to be their party when we defend the Fourth Amendment just as much as we defend the second.\n\nWhen we become the party that proclaims the entire Bill of Rights with the passion of Patrick Henry, we\u2019re going to dominate, we\u2019re going to win it so big, no one\u2019s going to have ever seen anything like it in their life.\n\nPaul closed by saying, \u201cWhen we are the party that proclaims our message with the passion of Patrick Henry, but also with the hope and the image of a man coming over the hills singing, then we will dominate and then we will win California.\u201d\n\nAhead of his speech, Paul answered questions from the press. Paul was asked about the potential of another summer in which Central Americans and foreign nationals from around the globe arrive at the Southwest border. If the border were as secure as Paul would like it to be, how would he address those that arrive there?\n\n\u201cIf you have compassion without security then you have a recipe for a humanitarian disaster,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest prevention of illegal immigration is having significant legal immigration,\u201d Paul explained. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the best ways you secure your border is having an adequate visa program, having an adequate legal program, but you also, in order to have security if people don\u2019t obey your rules, they have to go immediately back.\u201d\n\nBreitbart California Politics Editor Jon Fleischman said of the evening and Paul\u2019s speech, \u201cSenator Paul\u2019s comment that the GOP should be as passionate about the 4th amendment as it is about the 2nd really resonated with the crowd. It was clear that this was a very friendly audience for the Senator\u2019s pro-liberty message.\u201d\n\nSenator Paul was also speaker at the Orange County Republican Party Flag Day fundraising dinner Friday night.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul Lights the Torch for San Diego Republicans", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul Lights the Torch for San Diego Republicans", "title": "Rand Paul Lights the Torch for San Diego Republicans - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/IMG_9812.jpeg", "height": 960}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/06/14/rand-paul-lights-the-torch-for-san-diego-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul Lights the Torch for San Diego Republicans", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/IMG_9812.jpeg", "title": "Rand Paul Lights the Torch for San Diego Republicans - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Benghazi, bill of rights, border, GOP, Hillary Clinton, illegal immigration, Patrick Henry, republican, san diego, San Diego County Republican Party, Sen.
