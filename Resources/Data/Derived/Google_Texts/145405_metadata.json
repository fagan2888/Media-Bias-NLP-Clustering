Because PayNearMe receipts serve as a consumer's proof of payment for important items such as rent, loans and utilities, they are more likely to be inspected and retained than a traditional receipt.\n\nIn addition to rent, loans and utilities, PayNearMe also allows cash-preferring consumers to pay with cash for online purchases and more at participating 7-Eleven stores and other retail stores across the U.S. Once a payment is accepted, the business being paid is notified immediately and the consumer receives a receipt as proof of payment.\n\nSecretary Burwell joined PayNearMe and 7-Eleven, Inc. leadership today in announcing the partnership at a 7-Eleven store in Washington D.C., where PayNearMe demonstrated how consumers would receive receipts printed with information on Open Enrollment.\n\n\"Banked or unbanked, cash or plastic -- no matter what your preference, everyone can benefit from affordable health care,\" said Danny Shader, PayNearMe's founder and chief executive officer. \"By partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services, we can help generate awareness of this open enrollment process among consumers.\"\n\nAbout PayNearMe\n\nPayNearMe is the electronic cash transaction network that enables consumers to pay rent and utility bills, repay loans, buy tickets, make online purchases and do much more with cash. According to the FDIC, 28 percent (34 million) of U.S. households are financially underserved(i). Consumers can conveniently make payments on their own schedule and in their own neighborhood in less than a minute at one of over 17,000 trusted locations including 7-Eleven\u00ae, Family Dollar\u00ae and ACE Cash Express\u00ae stores across the United States.

Many may even qualify for financial assistance. Open enrollment in the Insurance Marketplace runs through Feb. 15, 2015. Health coverage can start as soon as Jan. 1, 2015 for consumers who sign up by Dec. 15, 2014. Consumers who already have health coverage through the Marketplace will generally be reenrolled into their same plan but can also shop for new coverage if they choose to.\n\n(i) 2013 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households\n\nImage Available: http://www.marketwire.com/library/MwGo/2014/12/11/11G028344/Images/PNM-ACA_-_Receipt2-565766706525.jpg", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Marketwire", "description": "WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - December 11, 2014) - To reach more Americans this open enrollment season, Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced a first-of-its-kind partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the electronic cash transactions company PayNearMe to reach financially underserved and other cash-preferring consumers. \"Leveraging developments from...", "title": "Department of Health and Human Services Announces Partnership With Technology Company PayNearMe to Encourage Consumers to Visit Health Insurance Marketplace", "url": "http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/department-health-human-services-announces-partnership-with-technology-company-paynearme-1976273.htm", "image": "http://www.marketwire.com/library/MwGo/2014/12/11/11G028344/PayNearMe-690019437372.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - December 11, 2014) - To reach more Americans this open enrollment season, Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced a first-of-its-kind partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the electronic cash transactions company PayNearMe to reach financially underserved and other cash-preferring consumers. \"Leveraging developments from..."}, "article_summary": "\"With this partnership, we are using digital platforms to place Open Enrollment information in the hands of consumers who need it.\"\n\"By partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services, we can help generate awareness of this open enrollment process among consumers.\"\nOpen enrollment in the Insurance Marketplace runs through Feb. 15, 2015.\nPutting these reminders at the bottom of PayNearMe receipts will help get health coverage information into the hands of traditionally hard-to-reach consumers.\nHealth coverage can start as soon as Jan. 1, 2015 for consumers who sign up by Dec. 15, 2014."}
