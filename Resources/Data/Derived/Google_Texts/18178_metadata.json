The proposed increases go as high as 60 percent.\n\nUnited Healthcare has filed a request to raise insurance premiums by an average of 18 percent on plans in Florida, according to a report on CNN.\n\nScott & White insurers are seeking a 32 percent increase for their health plans in Texas. Blue Cross and Blue Shield in North Carolina wants 26 percent more for its plans.\n\nThe companies will not actually get the green light for increases this large, experts said. Regulators in individual states are expected to negotiate lower rates with the companies, but some experts say you can expect increases above 10 percent in many regions.\n\n\u201cRequests of this magnitude are not shocking,\u201d said David Dranove, Ph.D., a Northwestern University business professor who co-authors a blog on healthcare. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the [healthcare] exchanges are a whole new ballgame.\u201d\n\nHowever, other experts say it\u2019s too early to tell.\n\nCynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation notes the only insurance requests on the government site are above 10 percent. There may be other single-digit requests that will bring down the average and force other companies to lower their expectations.\n\nRead More: Do Doctors Really Hate Obamacare? \u00bb\n\nMore Data, \u2018Low Balling\u2019 May Be at Work\n\nThere are several reasons for the insurance premium hikes expected next year, Dranove said.\n\nThe first is that 2016 will be the third year of healthcare plans under the ACA. Insurance companies now have one to two years\u2019 worth of data on which to base their estimates.\n\nInsurance enrollees have turned out to be older and less healthy than originally anticipated, Dranove said. That costs the companies more money.\n\nMedical costs, especially prescription prices, are also going up. Dranove said that would likely continue as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nCox agrees healthcare costs are starting to rise. However, she said there are some \u201cdownward pressures,\u201d too.\n\nMore insurance firms will continue to join the exchanges, increasing competition. And the pent-up demand for healthcare will increase the number of clients, potentially bringing down costs.\n\nCox and Dranove both said there may have been some \u201cstrategic pricing\u201d during the first two years of the ACA exchanges. Insurance companies may have \u201clow balled\u201d some premiums to draw in new clients, according to Dranove.\n\nSince customers generally don\u2019t switch insurance plans even with rate hikes, the theory is the insurance companies will make more money in the long term by initially offering lower rates.\n\nDranove advises consumers to shop around during renewal time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just re-enroll,\u201d he said.\n\nRead More: Low-Income Cancer Patients Hurt by Refusal to Expand Medicare \u00bb\n\nThe Insurance Industry\u2019s View of Things\n\nClare Krusing, press secretary for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, agreed there is more information available now.\n\nInsurance companies will have \u201crelatively solid claims data\u201d on enrollees and medical costs for the first time in 2016, she said.\n\nIn addition to older enrollees and rising drug prices, some programs included in the ACA rollout intended to keep costs lower are ending next year.\n\nOne of them is the \u201creinsurance\u201d program that spread the financial risks across all insurance companies to help out companies that took on potentially expensive clients.\n\n\u201cPremiums cannot be viewed in isolation,\u201d said Krusing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to look at the individual market dynamics that impact how much consumers pay for their healthcare coverage and the factors, like provider consolidation and exploding prescription drug prices, that drive up premiums across the country.\"\n\nRead More: What Your Doctor\u2019s Office Will Look Like in 5 Years \u00bb\n\nWhat the Future Holds\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict if the 2016 insurance premium hikes will become a pattern of rising costs because there are so many factors at play.\n\nTaxes may eventually have to go up to pay for the healthcare subsidies now offered by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to have to be discussed,\u201d Dranove said.\n\nThere\u2019s not much Congress can do now to significantly change the ACA because of the veto power held by President Obama. That could change dramatically depending on who is elected to the White House in 2016.\n\nThe other major looming question is the outcome of the King v. Burwell case currently being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. The case centers on whether the federal government can provide tax credits for federal subsidies offered in the states that do not offer their own insurance exchanges.\n\nIf the court strikes down the subsidies, that would most likely result in a large jump in out-of-pocket expenses for consumers who sign up for those plans.\n\nDranove said it could create a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d where people drop their health insurance plans, choosing to pay a fine rather than pay for premiums because it\u2019s cheaper. The smaller client base could then cause insurance premiums to rise further, causing more people to drop out and so on.\n\nNo matter which way the decision goes, Cox said at some point insurance premiums will go up. It just might not be next year.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ACA, health insurance, insurance premiums", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Many health insurance companies have filed requests for double-digit rate hikes in 2016 for plans they sell through the Affordable Care Act.
