Seedlings are sold in lots of 30 or 50, and include native mountain species such as aspen, Engelmann spruce, Colorado blue spruce, limber pine and bristlecone pine. CSFS seedlings offer an affordable way to ensure a diverse, forested landscape on your property in years to come. Place your order early for the best selection, as popular varieties often run out. The extension office will accept orders until April 18, 2014. Seedlings will be available for pickup in Frisco in mid-May (exact date to be determined). To download an order form and for more information on selecting appropriate species for your property, visit the extension website at www.co.summit.co.us/Extension, or call (970) 668-3595.\n\nSummit High School says muchas gracias!\n\nA huge thank you to charitable Summit County from Summit High School\u2019s Spanish Honor Society and Summit in Honduras!
