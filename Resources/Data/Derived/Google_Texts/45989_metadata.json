The two not-for-profit healthcare organizations have announced that they will engage in discussions to evaluate opportunities for working together in the future.\n\n\u201cWhile significant challenges are ahead in healthcare, it is essential to explore partnerships that can ensure our organizations remain on the leading edge as providers of quality medical care,\u201d said Roger L. Kirk, FACHE, president and chief executive officer of Bethesda Health. \u201cAs not-for-profit hospitals, we share similar missions and a common vision for improving the health of our respective communities that can be significantly strengthened by this potential affiliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see a very positive cultural fit between our two organizations, which is the foundation for any partnership,\u201d said Brian E. Keeley, president and chief executive officer of Baptist Health South Florida. \u201cThis possible affiliation would give us the opportunity to jointly develop and share best practices in order to continue improving quality and access to care for our patients. It will also allow us to better prepare for healthcare reform and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBoth Baptist Health and Bethesda Health have strong reputations in South Florida for being comprehensive healthcare organizations that provide high-quality, compassionate care to their respective communities.
