Despite his anger at President Obama, Glenn Beck has not exactly looked back fondly on the George W. Bush years. He’s slammed the last president as a “progressive” Republican, and repeated the same point on Monday responding to Jeb Bush‘s criticisms of Ted Cruz and the shutdown strategy. Beck suggested that after years of Bush progressivism being pushed on the public, maybe people should stop listening to them.

Beck first tore into Bush’s argument for an alternative health care plan, calling it borderline “fascist” and saying the Republican establishment is no longer contending that the government shouldn’t be involved in health care, merely arguing now that they can do it better.

But it was Bush’s comment about the need for “self-restraint” in the Obamacare fight that really set Beck off. He said, “If you guys would not have been shooting at Ted Cruz, you could have been showing the world how bad it was!”

He mused, “Maybe it’s time to stop listening to the Bushes.” Beck listed a whole array of things brought to life by the Bushes, from the PATRIOT Act to John Roberts to “never-ending wars” to No Child Left Behind, and asked why on earth any conservative would ever have voted for them in the first place.
