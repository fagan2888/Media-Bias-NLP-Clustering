Burwell.\n\n\u201cThe government should move on from this unnecessary fight, and go provide these services some other way that doesn\u2019t use nuns,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund.\n\nThe nuns, who run homes for the elderly, are one of several petitioners who object to methods of distribution of contraceptives that involve them. The Becket Fund, along with other petitioners, filed supplemental briefs at Supreme Court on Tuesday, as did the US government, in response to the high court\u2019s invitation to propose a way out of the impasse. Each side has until April 20 to respond to what the other has told the eight justices, who may issue a final ruling by the end of June.\n\nAccording to ScotusBlog, the government brief argued that the alternative plan would only work for religious non-profits that use an outside insurance company for health coverage for their employees and it warned of serious complications.\n\nThe government\u2019s strongest wish is that the Court not require any changes in the existing ACA birth-control rules, to which the non-profits continue to be strenuously opposed, and the non-profits\u2019 strongest wish is to have the widest possible separation between themselves and the source of contraceptives, even if that undermines the \u201cseamless\u201d nature that the government argues is essential to make the ACA mandate work.\n\nBecket also suggested that instead of having the offer of separate contraceptive coverage come directly from the insurance company,\n\nthe government itself could inform petitioners\u2019 employees about the availability of that coverage, \u201cor ask healthcare providers to provide that information to any individual who lacks contraceptive coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Aleteia.org \u2013 Worldwide Catholic Network Sharing Faith Resources for those seeking Truth \u2013 Aleteia.org", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Aleteia.org \u2013 Worldwide Catholic Network Sharing Faith Resources for those seeking Truth \u2013 Aleteia.org", "description": "There are several ways in which employees of religious nonprofit organizations can obtain contraceptive coverage that do not involve any participation of the non-profits.
