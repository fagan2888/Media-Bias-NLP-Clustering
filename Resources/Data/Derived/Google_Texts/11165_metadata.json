In 2014, when the Chamber launched its effort to attack conservatives in primaries, the group spent close to $70 million.\n\nThe evolution of the Chamber\u2019s political spending goes a long way to explain the current dysfunction in Washington. The organization will devote $170 million to combat conservatives in primaries and support establishment Republicans in the general, but only around $30 million when Obama is running for reelection.\n\nAt the time business groups announced their heavy involvement in Republican primaries, Scott Reed, the Chamber\u2019s top political consultant said, \u201c[t]he need is now more than ever to elect people who understand the free market and not silliness.\u201d\n\nThe top legislative priorities for the U.S. Chamber, and many business groups, are reinstatement of the Export-Import Bank, an immigration overhaul that greatly expands the number of both legal workers and foreign work visas, and an overhaul of the corporate income tax.\n\nOnly one of these priorities is clearly a free-market position.\n\nConservatives support corporate tax reform, but oppose the other two priorities. Establishment Republicans, however, support all three. A perhaps larger problem for the Chamber, though, is that conservative priorities have no interest for them.\n\nObamaCare has little impact on the large corporations that dominate the Chamber and most business organizations. Likewise, concerns over government spending and debt mean little in the corporate boardroom, many of which are dependent on large government contracts. For the largest corporations, regulations are a nuisance that can generally be managed, albeit expensively, through lobbying and the courts.\n\nThe loss of John Boehner is a big blow to the Chamber and other business organizations. Boehner was one of the few House leaders to support reinstating the Ex-Im Bank, which does nothing for the economy but handsomely rewards a few corporations with deep political pockets. Boehner also, along with the entire Republican establishment, wants to expand immigration with the express purpose of increasing the labor pool.\n\nThe brief government shutdown in 2013 prompted the Chamber to engage in Republican primaries. \u201cThe gang that wants to shut down the government, that\u2019s a clear contrast to what the business community agrees is best for economic growth,\u201d Reed said.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter than the Republican party won an historic landslide election just one year after the shutdown, the Washington establishment is convinced it hurt the party. The sudden resignation of Speaker Boehner will only further convince business groups to engage against conservatives in primaries.\n\nThe Chamber has already spent $3 million on political ads this summer in an effort to support establishment Republicans. Its the earliest the organization has even run ads.\n\nThe business effort will go beyond simply running TV commercials, though. The Business and Industry PAC, now run by former moderate Republican Rep. Jim Gerlach, is planning a grass-roots campaign among employees of major corporations.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m still not sure yet how much employees understand the importance of their actual participation in the process,\u201d Gerlach said, \u201cso that\u2019s going to be our job to educate them.\u201d\n\nThere was a time that the top priority of America\u2019s largest businesses was simply to be left alone by the government. As a result, the interests of conservatives and business organizations were completely intertwined. For a long list of reasons, that time has faded away. Many large corporations don\u2019t as much want government to get out of the way as to get on their side.\n\nConservatives may not want an outright war with the largest business associations, but that war has already started.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Chamber will take the lead, planning to spend $100 million in 2016, a large portion of which will be devoted to defeat conservatives", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The U.S. Chamber will take the lead, planning to spend $100 million in 2016, a large portion of which will be devoted to defeat conservatives", "title": "U.S. Chamber Plans $100 Million Campaign Against Conservatives - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/US-Chamber-Donohue-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/01/u-s-chamber-plans-100-million-campaign-conservatives/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Chamber will take the lead, planning to spend $100 million in 2016, a large portion of which will be devoted to defeat conservatives", "title": "U.S. Chamber Plans $100 Million Campaign Against Conservatives - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/US-Chamber-Donohue-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,Chamber", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-10-01T08:30:08-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In 2014, when the Chamber launched its effort to attack conservatives in primaries, the group spent close to $70 million.\nThe organization will devote $170 million to combat conservatives in primaries and support establishment Republicans in the general, but only around $30 million when Obama is running for reelection.\nThe Chamber has already spent $3 million on political ads this summer in an effort to support establishment Republicans.\nThe U.S. Chamber will take the lead, planning to spend $100 million in 2016, a large portion of which will be devoted to defeat conservatives in Republican primaries.\nConservatives support corporate tax reform, but oppose the other two priorities."}
