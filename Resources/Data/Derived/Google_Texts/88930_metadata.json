Cheerleaders sprang in the air, color guards carried flags and big-rigs tagged with Teamsters logos rumbled down Avalon Boulevard.\n\nA rally at Banning Park that followed the march included speakers, music and a barbecue, organizers said.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, doors opened for a Labor Day music festival in Exposition Park. The event \u2014 which charged admission \u2014 was scheduled to feature a lineup that included Grammy-nominated jazz singer and percussionist Sheila E., a Jamaican reggae act and The James Andrews New Orleans All Star Band.\n\nLabor Day march and rally in Wilmington attract crowds with a \"Stop War on Workers\" theme and support from high school bands.\n\nThe performances benefited Working Californians, a labor-allied nonprofit political research and advocacy group which billed the event as \u201cthe biggest Southern California Labor Day concert celebration ever.\u201d\n\nIn a Labor Day message, Rusty Hicks, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, said \u201cthe Los Angeles labor movement is more dynamic than ever before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to fight for the good of all workers \u2014 higher wages, access to quality healthcare, the promise of retirement security and the right to have a collective voice on the job,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way, but there is still much to be done.\u201d\n\nSan Pedro High School Golden Pirate Regiment Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times Amanda Solid of the San Pedro High School Golden Pirate Regiment performs in a Labor Day parade in Wilmington.

The law is expected to affect hundreds of thousands of workers and made Los Angeles the largest city in the country to mandate the higher pay.\n\nAbout seven weeks later, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors similarly voted to increase the minimum wage to $15 in unincorporated communities.\n\nMonday\u2019s festivities marked the end of the traditional summer season \u2014 even as temperatures refused to cool and were expected to head higher in the coming days.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown alluded to the gains by labor dating back more than a century.\n\n\u201cThis year, as we enjoy traditions ranging from beach outings and barbecues to an annual change in the rules of high fashion,\u201d he said, \u201cwe should remember how much progress has allowed us to celebrate this Labor Day.\u201d\n\nFollow @ByMattStevens for coverage of the California drought, the Westside and breaking news.\n\nTimes staff photographer Barbara Davidson contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nALSO\n\nDeputy and firefighter couple die in alleged murder-suicide\n\nWildfire near Fresno grows as firefighters brace for hot, dry weather\n\nCheetah on loan from San Diego escapes, briefly, at Indianapolis Zoo", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Labor Day in L.A.: Wilmington rally, Exposition Park music festival", "Description": "With hot rods and high school bands on display, Los Angeles soaked in a few more hours of summer relaxation Monday, celebrating Labor Day \u2014 and a last respite from work and school.A parade and rally in Wilmington and a concert in Exposition Park were among the events across Los Angeles County that...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "With hot rods and high school bands on display, Los Angeles soaked in a few more hours of summer relaxation Monday, celebrating Labor Day \u2014 and a last respite from work and school.", "title": "Labor Day in L.A.: Wilmington rally, Exposition Park music festival", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-labor-day-20150907-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ee6ce6/turbine/la-me-ln-labor-day-20150907", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84374348", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-07", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "(Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times) (Barbara Davidson / Los Angeles Times)Local union leaders won several high-profile victories this summer.\nOn Monday afternoon, doors opened for a Labor Day music festival in Exposition Park.\nAmanda Solid of the San Pedro High School Golden Pirate Regiment performs in a Labor Day parade in Wilmington.\nLabor Day march and rally in Wilmington attract crowds with a \"Stop War on Workers\" theme and support from high school bands.\nAbout seven weeks later, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors similarly voted to increase the minimum wage to $15 in unincorporated communities."}
