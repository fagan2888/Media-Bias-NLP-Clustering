Ted Cruz (R-TX) is known for waging political battles even if the odds of success are slim. He famously launched a 21-hour filibuster in a failed, last-ditch effort to repeal Obamacare. But his latest crusade may be his biggest challenge yet: repealing a federal law that does not exist.\n\nOn Twitter, Cruz blasted the federal government role in education and called for the repeal of Common Core:\n\n\n\nFederal govt has no business sticking its nose in education. We need to repeal every word of Common Core! #nhpolitics #MakeDCListen \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 15, 2015\n\nCan Cruz \u201cmake DC listen\u201d? It will be particularly hard since Common Core is not, in fact, a federal law.\n\nThe Common Core State Standards Initiative, known as Common Core, was developed by the states \u2014 with input from teachers, education experts and business leaders \u2014 and has been voluntarily adopted by 43 states and the District Of Columbia. Notably, \u201cthe federal government played no role in creating the standards, nor did it require that states adopt them.\u201d\n\nCommon Core is not a curriculum but a set of standards regarding what students \u201cshould know and be able to do at each grade level in math and English language arts.\u201d How kids get there is left to the schools and teachers.\n\nAdopting Common Core was helpful to states seeking federal funding in 2009 under a program called \u201cRace To The Top.\u201d But many states that did not receive funding continue to implement Common Core.\n\nCommon Core has become a highly politicized topic. In 2013, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution opposing Common Core, calling it \u201can inappropriate overreach to standardize and control the education of our children.\u201d The RNC attacked Obama, who was not involved in the creation of the standards, but ignored the role of many Republicans in creating Common Core. Many of the states that adopted Common Core are controlled, in whole or in part, by Republicans.\n\nThe historical role of Republicans in creating and adopting the standards, however, is not lost on Ted Cruz. One of Common Core\u2019s biggest supporters is former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who just might be competing against Cruz to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016.\n\nCruz certainly has a better chance of defeating Jeb Bush than repealing the federal Common Core law, since it doesn\u2019t exist.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Sen.
