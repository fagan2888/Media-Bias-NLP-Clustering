How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?\"\n\nFiled by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the brief notes that Sensenbrenner \"was not aware of the full scope of the program when he voted to reauthorize Section 215\" and would have voted against it if he had known.\n\nIn Sensenbrenner's words: \"The suggestion that the administration can violate the law because Congress failed to object is outrageous. But let them be on notice: I am objecting right now.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Michael B Kelley", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "\"How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?\"", "creator": "MichaelBKelley", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/patriot-act-author-nsa-abused-its-power-2013-9", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5228cdefeab8ead1698b4569-506-253/patriot-act-author-the-nsa-is-actively-violating-the-law.jpg", "title": "PATRIOT Act Author: The NSA Is Actively Violating The Law", "site": "BI_Defense", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "defense,sai,politics,law", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "NSA, Edward Snowden, Surveillance, Spying, Military, Michael B Kelley", "description": "\"How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?\"", "author": "Michael B Kelley", "sailthru.date": "2013-09-05", "sailthru.title": "PATRIOT Act Author: The NSA Is Actively Violating The Law", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5228cdefeab8ead1698b4569-50-50/patriot-act-author-the-nsa-is-actively-violating-the-law.jpg", "news_keywords": "NSA, Edward Snowden, Surveillance, Spying, Military, Michael B Kelley", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5228cdefeab8ead1698b4569/patriot-act-author-the-nsa-is-actively-violating-the-law.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-09-05", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/michael-b-kelley"}, "sailthru.description": "\"How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?\"", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "\"How can every call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific investigation?\"", "title": "PATRIOT Act Author: The NSA Is Actively Violating The Law", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/patriot-act-author-nsa-abused-its-power-2013-9", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5228cdefeab8ead1698b4569-1190-625/patriot-act-author-the-nsa-is-actively-violating-the-law.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "PATRIOT Act Author: The NSA Is Actively Violating The Law", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5228cdefeab8ead1698b4569/patriot-act-author-the-nsa-is-actively-violating-the-law.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "defense"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3baf\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. government contends that the bulk collection of U.S. phone records is authorized by section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.\nJim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), the author of the original USA PATRIOT Act, disagrees.\nIn Sensenbrenner's words: \"The suggestion that the administration can violate the law because Congress failed to object is outrageous.\nSection 215, known as the business records provision, authorizes intelligence agencies to apply for information if \"the records are relevant to an ongoing foreign intelligence investigation.\"\nIn practice, the NSA uses section 215 to collect data pertaining to every phone call to, from, and within the U.S. in the name of combating terrorism."}
