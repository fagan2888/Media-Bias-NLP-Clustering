What little known investment should people be turning to more often?

LARRY ZIMPLEMAN: If you are considering investment options beyond the two traditional asset classes (equities or stocks and bonds or fixed income), you would generally want it to be a new asset class with good size and depth of market to it so that you don’t expose yourself to excess volatility. It should also be an asset that you can generally understand or relate to. Otherwise, how do you know if it’s performing as it should?



Given this, the one asset class that people may want to consider is real estate–probably not residential real estate but more like real estate investment trusts (REITs) or possibly some commingled funds that invest in commercial real estate. This asset class is relatively easy to understand, tends to pay a high dividend and also can generate additional return through capital appreciation.

These types of investments might be especially appropriate for investors as they move to the near and in-retirement phases of their life.
