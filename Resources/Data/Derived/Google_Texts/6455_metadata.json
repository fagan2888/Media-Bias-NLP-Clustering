John Kasich went around the state legislature to expand Medicaid under Obamacare in 2013, but that\u2019s not the story he\u2019s telling voters on the campaign trail.\n\nKasich, a Republican candidate for president, introduced a budget in February 2013 that included the expansion of Medicaid to working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities that was part of the 2010 health care overhaul. For months, Kasich pressed the state legislature to approve the expansion.\n\nHere\u2019s how the policy fight played out in 2013:\n\nHow does this compare to what Kasich is telling Republican presidential primary voters?\n\n\u201cThe legislature didn\u2019t want to vote,\u201d Kasich told New Hampshire town hall attendees last week when asked why he implemented the expansion against the General Assembly\u2019s wishes.\n\nKasich said General Assembly leadership agreed to pass the Medicaid expansion through the Controlling Board, a quasi-legislative panel of six legislators and one executive appointee, because \u201cwe couldn\u2019t get a vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I didn\u2019t just do this on my own, young lady, I did it with the blessing of the leadership and we got it done,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nFormer state Rep. John Adams, the fourth-ranking member of the Ohio House majority leadership at the time, told Watchdog.org he was never involved in any such conversation.\n\n\u201cThey did not have a caucus meeting to tell everybody, \u2018this is what we\u2019re going to do,'\u201d Adams explained. \u201cI\u2019m amazed that this governor wants to throw Bill Batchelder and Keith Faber under the bus, even though they were complicit.\u201d\n\nBatchelder, who was House speaker before retiring due to term limits, signed a formal protest letter that Adams circulated after the Kasich administration submitted its Controlling Board request.\n\nBefore the Controlling Board vote, Senate President Faber insinuated Kasich had backed lawmakers into a corner by threatening to bankrupt Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program if Obamacare money was not appropriated.\n\nThe House speaker and Senate president can swap Controlling Board members at will. Batchelder and Faber stacked the panel so Kasich\u2019s Obamacare funding request would be approved.\n\n\u201cI was there. We had a solution our caucus could have chosen,\u201d Adams said, explaining that he and Rep. Jim Butler previously met with Batchelder and shared a list of options for treating Ohio\u2019s drug-addicted, mentally ill and working poor without taking Medicaid expansion money.\n\nBut at the October 21, 2013, Controlling Board hearing where Kasich\u2019s Obamacare funding request was approved, Ohio Department of Medicaid Director John McCarthy said Medicaid expansion was necessary to serve Ohio\u2019s needy.\n\nMcCarthy publicly threatened to bankrupt the entire Ohio Medicaid program if the Controlling Board refused to appropriate the money.\n\nControlling Board President Randy Cole \u2014 who was appointed by Kasich \u2014 repeatedly steered the panel\u2019s conversation away from concerns about Medicaid expansion\u2019s long-term costs and sustainability. No testimony opposing the expansion was heard.\n\nKasich told New Hampshire voters last week that his latest budget continued Medicaid expansion \u201cwithout one single objection.\u201d\n\nRepublican State Rep. Nino Vitale told Watchdog.org he was one of several legislators to protest inclusion of the expansion in Ohio\u2019s 2016-17 budget. Vitale spoke against the policy on the House floor before voting against the budget. Three other Republicans in the General Assembly joined him. All four cited the Medicaid expansion as a specific reason for their votes, and several lawmakers voted for the budget only after voicing opposition to the expansion.\n\nSince taking effect in January 2014, Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion has enrolled 650,000 people and has cost federal taxpayers $6.4 billion.\n\nThe Kasich campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
