That bill is a bold measure that would counter the relentless barrage of anti-choice legislation that has made abortion \u2013 a constitutionally protected medical procedure \u2013 all together inaccessible for many U.S. women.\n\nThe bill was introduced last year by Senators Richard Blumenthal and Tammy Baldwin and Representatives Judy Chu, Lois Frankel and Marcia Fudge. It prohibits states from applying regulations to reproductive health care centers and providers that do not also apply to other low-risk medical procedures. It would, essentially, remove politicians from decisions that \u2013 for every other medical issue \u2013 remain between individuals and their providers.\n\nThe WHPA is long overdue. For the past three years, conservative lawmakers have used the guise of protecting women\u2019s health to pass more than 200 state laws that have closed clinics, eliminated abortion services, and left women across the country without access to critical reproductive health care. The WHPA would reverse many of those policies and prevent others from being passed.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was representative of the broader debate over abortion rights. Those in favor of the bill argued that securing guaranteeing unfettered access to reproductive health care, including abortion, is critical to the health and lives of U.S. women and their families.\n\nThose in opposition used familiar canards about abortion to argue the law would be calamitous for U.S. women. Representative Diane Black of Tennessee had the gall to make the abortion-leads-to-breast cancer claim, one that has been disproven many times over. Others repeatedly cited the horrific cases of Kermit Gosnell, insinuating that all abortion providers (abortionists, in their lingo) are predatory and that late term abortions are a common occurrence. In fact, if women had access to safe, comprehensive and intimidation-free care, Kermit Gosnell would have never been in business. Given the opposition\u2019s testimony, you\u2019d never know that late term abortion is actually a rarity. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 90 percent of all abortions occur before 13 weeks gestation, with just over 1 percent taking place past 21 weeks.\n\nAt one point Representative Black argued that abortion is actually not health care. The one in three U.S. women who have undergone the procedure would surely argue otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the most ironic testimony against the WHPA \u2013 and in favor of abortion restrictions \u2013 came from Senator Ted Cruz, who hails from Texas, a state with so many abortion restrictions that women are now risking their health and lives by self-inducing abortions or crossing the border to get care in Mexico. Senator Cruz attempted to validate U.S. abortion restrictions by referencing a handful of European countries with gestational restrictions on abortions. This was a popular argument during the hearing for Texas\u2019 HB2 \u2013 the bill responsible for shuttering the majority of clinics in that state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Specious arguments against the Women's Health Protection Act reveal how misinformed Congress truly is", "author": "Andrea Flynn", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Specious arguments against the Women's Health Protection Act reveal how misinformed Congress truly is", "title": "The Senate flunks basic biology: Inside a disgraceful hearing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/the_senate_flunks_basic_biology_inside_a_disgraceful_hearing_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/ted_cruz11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Specious arguments against the Women's Health Protection Act reveal how misinformed Congress truly is", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/ted_cruz11.jpg", "title": "The Senate flunks basic biology: Inside a disgraceful hearing", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The Senate flunks basic biology: Inside a disgraceful hearing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Kermit Gosnell, Next New Deal, Senate, Ted Cruz, WHPA, Women's Health Protection Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd238c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Kermit Gosnell, Next New Deal, Senate, Ted Cruz, WHPA, Women's Health Protection Act, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Next New DealThe propensity of anti-choice advocates to eulogize false science was on full display on Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing on the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act (WHPA).\nIt prohibits states from applying regulations to reproductive health care centers and providers that do not also apply to other low-risk medical procedures.\nSenator Cruz attempted to validate U.S. abortion restrictions by referencing a handful of European countries with gestational restrictions on abortions.\nAt one point Representative Black argued that abortion is actually not health care.\nThis was a popular argument during the hearing for Texas\u2019 HB2 \u2013 the bill responsible for shuttering the majority of clinics in that state."}
