The company made about $7.5 million in profit as a result of the payments, the SEC said.\n\n\u201cStryker\u2019s misconduct involved hundreds of improper payments over a number of years during which the company\u2019s internal controls were fatally flawed,\u201d said Andrew Calamari, director of the SEC\u2019s New York office, in a statement.\n\nJoe Cooper, the director of communications for Stryker, said in an email the company has enhanced its company-wide anti-corruption compliance program, and was advised that the Justice Department closed its investigation.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe SEC issued an administrative order (pdf) against Stryker requiring the company to pay $13.3 million within 10 days. The payment includes $7.5 million in disgorgement, $2.2 million in interest and a $3.5 million penalty.\n\nThe order details illicit payments made by the company and its affiliates as far back as 2003.\n\nIn one instance, Stryker\u2019s Mexico unit, after learning that a local agency threatened to revoke a contract, directed its outside counsel to make a $46,000 payment to an employee of the agency, the order said. The law firm then billed Stryker for legal services rendered and Stryker Mexico recorded the payment as legitimate legal expenses, the order said.\n\nThe company earned more than $1.1 million in illicit profits on that contract alone, it said.\n\nIn Poland, Stryker\u2019s local unit made 32 payments totaling about $460,000 to get or keep business at public hospitals, resulting in more than $2.4 million in illicit profits, the SEC said.\n\nFor example, in exchange for the promise of future business from the director of a public hospital there, Stryker paid travel costs in May 2004 for her and her husband, the order said. Though the trip was for a one-day tour of a Stryker facility in Mahwah, N.J., the company paid for a six-night stay at a hotel in New York City, attendance at two Broadway shows and a five-day trip to Aruba.\n\nStryker declined to comment on the status of an investigation in Poland of its local unit.\n\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
