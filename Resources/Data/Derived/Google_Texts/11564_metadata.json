So, it\u2019s crunch time. As a reliable and organized bloc, evangelical Christian voters are a target for several of the 14 Republicans vying for one of the so-called three tickets out of Iowa to continue the race for the presidency.\n\nThat Iowa prize \u2014 evangelical voters make up about 60 percent of Republican caucusgoers \u2014 is what brought three GOP presidential hopefuls to Waterloo on Saturday.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee spent about five minutes introducing themselves before being peppered with questions from conservative voters at the Iowa Grassroots Coalition Candidate Honest Assessment Summit.\n\nEach spent about 45 minutes on stage with moderator and conservative author Trevor Loudon.\n\nLoudon made clear the task at hand for the three candidates within the opening minutes of the daylong summit with conservative activists sponsored by the Iowa Grassroots Coalition and Cedar Valley Patriots for Christ. \u201cYou have to inspire the base,\u201d Loudon said.\n\nEach of the three candidates aimed to prove their conservative bona fides \u2014 all talked about their pro-life credentials; mentioned with concern Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who was arrested for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples; and stressed the need for stronger actions on the international stage.\n\nCruz says he has broad appeal\n\nIn addition to stressing his conservative principles, Cruz also argued that he has the appeal beyond social conservatives to unite a fractured Republican Party and sway some disaffected Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is conservatives uniting behind our campaign. It\u2019s the single most encouraging development, and in particular, what we\u2019re also seeing is the (President Ronald) Reagan coalition coming back together,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHe said evangelicals are critical to building the kind of coalition that led to Reagan\u2019s lopsided victory in 1980. But he added that it also includes young people, Reagan Democrats, minorities, tea party activists and libertarians.\n\nCruz also pointed to an advantage conservatives have this cycle that hasn\u2019t happened in years.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there has been a consensus moderate candidate early on in prior Republican presidential primaries and they get all the money, and conservatives historically have been divided like crazy. They fight like cats and dogs, and nobody has any money,\u201d Cruz said after his time on stage in answering questions from the media. \u201cThis election, that\u2019s flipped.\u201d\n\nCruz said he\u2019s hoping to see the base turn out in numbers that haven\u2019t been seen since a Republican last sat in the White House during George W. Bush\u2019s second bid for office in 2004.\n\nJindal, Huckabee Stress pro-Life Action\n\nWhile Cruz painted himself as a uniter of GOP factions, Jindal and Huckabee stressed their gubernatorial successes and the ways that they are distinct from the myriad other candidates.\n\nJindal noted that every time he\u2019s run for election he seeks \u201c100 percent of the voters,\u201d but he stressed that he is a conservative through and through and willing to wage those battles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one candidate that\u2019s actually gotten things done. Everybody else talks about things. We\u2019re the only one that\u2019s cut government spending. We were the first to defund, take on Planned Parenthood, most pro-life state six years running, the first with a plan to get rid of Obamacare,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cSo a lot of these Republicans talk, we\u2019re a doer.\u201d\n\nHuckabee jokingly noted the difference between himself and the \u201cother 327\u201d candidates running for the office. He said he would be the candidate to be honest about ending abortion in the United States.\n\nHe said rolling back the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade would not halt abortions, but would leave the decision up to states, meaning some would continue to perform the procedure. Huckabee said he\u2019d seek alternative means to end abortions nationwide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who has openly and repeatedly said on national television that rather than continuing to make these statements of false hope that we\u2019ll change the Constitution and that we\u2019ll reverse Roe v. Wade,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cFolks, here\u2019s the question, is the unborn child a person?\u201d\n\nHuckabee also distinguished himself by not just opposing abortion and seeking to end it, but also for expressing compassion for both the aborted fetus and the mother, who he said also suffers.\n\nMore christians urged to Vote\n\nWhile wooing those evangelical or conservative voters who turn out, the candidates and other speakers throughout the day also noted with frustration how many Christians stay home on Election Day.\n\nJindal said part of the reason that they and other Republicans stay home is that they are skeptical the Republicans they elect will follow through on their promises.\n\n\u201cThey heard the Republicans last time say give them the majority, they\u2019d stop Obamacare and amnesty, it didn\u2019t happen, so I think they\u2019re looking for somebody who will actually do what they said they were going to do, and that\u2019s why I think our record is so important,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nTaking a dig at not just Democratic President Barack Obama but also Cruz and other Republicans vying for the presidency, Jindal added, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a first-term senator in the White House. We need somebody with a proven track record.\u201d\n\nHuckabee, however, painted a darker picture of the impact of Christian conservatives staying home on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThey need to understand how this affects them,\u201d Huckabee said, pointing to Davis and others who have faced fines for, as he says, following their faith.\n\n\u201cWhen they see that, it starts getting through to them that they\u2019re going to have one of two choices. They\u2019re either going to get involved and protect their religious liberty and their constitutional rights, or they\u2019re going to lose them, and if they don\u2019t see that clearly, they\u2019ll stay home, and they\u2019re going to lose their constitutional rights and their country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | WATERLOO - Republican presidential candidates have 99 more days to make their case to caucusgoers, and even less time to organize that support.
