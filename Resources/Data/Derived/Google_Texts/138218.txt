The financial sector is launching a new advertising campaign to push cybersecurity legislation though the Senate.

The Financial Services Roundtable (FSR) — which represents top banks, insurers and credit card companies — has produced radio, video and social media ads that will run for several weeks in an attempt to get Congress to pass the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA).

CISA is intended to boost the exchange of cyber threat data between the public and private sector, but has been stalled over privacy concerns and worries about the bill’s actual potential to fight cyber crime.

“America needs a team approach to fight this national security threat,” says FSR’s radio spot, airing on WTOP in Washington, D.C. “The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is part of the solution. This bill would enable businesses and the government to voluntarily share cyber threat information, not personal information, to better protect Americans from hackers. Tell the Senate, we need to pass CISA now. Hackers aren’t waiting, so why are we?”

Financial firms and other industries like retailing have long supported the bill, as has a large bipartisan coalition of lawmakers. The White House recently came out in favor, as well.

But digital rights advocates and a small but growing group of privacy-minded senators oppose the bill. In recent weeks, a number of prominent tech firms, such as Apple, have also said they don’t support the bill in its current form.

When CISA hits the floor — perhaps as early as this week — lawmakers will consider at least 22 amendments, many of which are intended to assuage these concerns.

“We urge political leaders to collaborate and get this crucial bill over the finish line,” said FSR CEO Tim Pawlenty.
