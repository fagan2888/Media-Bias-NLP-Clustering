The first one, I probably could have done a little better job of getting it on net.\u201d\n\nSaid DU coach Jim Montgomery: \u201cIt was a sigh of relief when that puck went in. \u2026 It\u2019s funny, we all circled who\u2019s going to get it for us. Two of us had him because he\u2019s just so dangerous, he\u2019s a guy who attacks the net and he\u2019s so strong, he goes right through people. I thought he almost scored twice in the first overtime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much he\u2019s grown throughout this year, his freshman year.\u201d\n\nQuentin Shore and Troy Terry had first-period goals to put the Pioneers up 2-0, but from there DU for a time looked as if might become the second Denver-based hockey team to blow a 2-0 lead and lose Saturday night. But after the Mavericks pulled into 2-2 and 3-3 ties, the Pioneers \u2014 unlike the Avalanche, which lost 3-2 at Winnipeg \u2014 ultimately pulled it out. Sophomore Tanner Jaillet had 51 saves in the Pioneer net in the nearly 89 minutes, and at least a handful were tough ones in the sudden-death.\n\n\u201cTanner Jaillet, wow,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cSome incredible saves.\u201d\n\nIt was the hockey longest game in Magness history. In the second game ever in the building, DU beat Providence 3-2 on Oct. 16, 1999, with Joe Ritson scoring the game-winning goal 4:25 into the second overtime.\n\nThe third-seeded Pioneers, 22-8-5 and ranked sixth nationally, finished 6-0 against Nebraska Omaha this season and will take an 11-game winning streak into the league\u2019s four-team Frozen Faceoff at the Target Center in Minneapolis. After the top four seeds all finished off quarterfinal series sweeps Saturday, the Pioneers will face the league\u2019s second seed, St. Cloud State, in one Friday semifinal, while top-seeded North Dakota will face fourth-seeded Minnesota Duluth in the other.\n\n\u201cGreat college hockey game,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cHats off to UNO, they played great hockey. They competed at an incredible level, and it\u2019s a reflection of their legendary coach (Dean Blais), who I have the utmost respect for. It\u2019s hard to eliminate a team when their season\u2019s on the line, and it\u2019s really hard to do when it\u2019s a Dean Blais-coached team.\u201d\n\nSenior defenseman Nolan Zajac, who came into the night with 14 assists in 35 games this season, set up both of the Pioneers\u2019 first- period goals. First Shore (at 5:29) and then Terry (17:14) had easy tap-ins of his cross-slot passes.\n\nNebraska Omaha didn\u2019t go away, though.\n\nDU defenseman Grant Arnold drew a 5-minute major for kneeing at 7:21 of the second and the Pioneers had killed off a little more than three minutes of the penalty when Zajac was called for tripping at 10:34. Forty-three seconds into the ensuing 5-on-3, Jake Guentzel scored to get the Mavericks within 2-1.\n\nThen UNO\u2019s Austin Ortega beat Jaillet to the short side for the short-handed goal that made it 2-2.\n\nThe Pioneers were back in front when Danton Heinen scored on a breakaway at 1:31 of the third, but Ortega\u2019s second goal, on a power play, tied it up again at 3:57. When neither team scored the rest of regulation, the game went on.\n\nAnd on \u2026 until Staub ended it.\n\n\u201cI mean, we just stuck to our process,\u201d said Staub. \u201cWe just made sure to keep on hitting, just keep in getting pucks behind their \u2018D,\u2019 and kept on doing what we do best. That\u2019s kind of wearing them down and I think we wore them down, especially by the second (overtime).\u201d\n\nThe Pioneers now will face a St. Cloud State team that drilled them twice, 5-2 and 6-2, in mid-December in Denver. Since then, the Pioneers have gone 16-1-3. Regardless of what happens in Minneapolis, DU will get one of the 16 NCAA tournament berths, but the Frozen Faceoff could provide an avenue to maintain momentum.\n\nTerry Frei: tfreidenverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU Pioneers beat UNO in double overtime in hockey to advance", "title": "DU Pioneers beat UNO in double overtime in hockey to advance", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/du-pioneers-beat-uno-in-double-overtime-in-hockey-to-advance/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T22:58:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T22:58:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "In the second game ever in the building, DU beat Providence 3-2 on Oct. 16, 1999, with Joe Ritson scoring the game-winning goal 4:25 into the second overtime.\n\u201cGreat college hockey game,\u201d Montgomery said.\nWhen neither team scored the rest of regulation, the game went on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the second (shot) went in,\u201d said Staub, who came to the Pioneers via the Wichita Falls Wildcats of the North American Hockey League.\nThat\u2019s kind of wearing them down and I think we wore them down, especially by the second (overtime).\u201dThe Pioneers now will face a St."}
