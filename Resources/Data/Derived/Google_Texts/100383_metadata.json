We\u2019re gonna use some reverence here and not be silly about this, but look at what they accomplished with no weapons and just 11 guys who didn\u2019t even speak English? And that proves that sometimes great ideas are actually horrible ideas.\u201d\n\nHow on earth did Hyde get past the conference\u2019s vetting? He explained to Philadelphia magazine:\n\n\u201cI told them I had just returned from Mogadishu where I was shooting war journalism following this group of women cleaning up the neighborhood, and by picking up trash, they had lowered crime rate. So it\u2019s like broken window theory there, or whatever the fuck. A little Malcolm Gladwell. [They] wrote back and said, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s exciting. We got some real hard hitting stuff here.\u2019\u201d\n\nHave a look below at the full speech, via YouTube. It\u2019s well worth it:\n\n\n\n[h/t Uproxx]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Apparently the recent TEDx event at Drexel University had very lax vetting in place, because comedian Sam Hyde was able to pose as a documentary filmmaker and", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tedx-sam-hyde.jpg", "title": "Comedian Pranks TED Talks and Hilariously Lampoons the Whole Concept"}, "twitter": {"description": "Apparently the recent TEDx event at Drexel University had very lax vetting in place, because comedian Sam Hyde was able to pose as a documentary filmmaker and take the stage for 20 minutes of hilarious gibberish tech-speak that lampoons the concept of the lecture series at its core.", "title": "Comedian Pranks TED Talks and Hilariously Lampoons the Whole Concept", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tedx-sam-hyde.jpg", "creator": "@andrewkirell", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-10-12T09:42:27+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda66e\"", "article_summary": "And that proves that sometimes great ideas are actually horrible ideas.\u201dHow on earth did Hyde get past the conference\u2019s vetting?\nWe got some real hard hitting stuff here.\u2019\u201dHave a look below at the full speech, via YouTube.\nHyde lectures about his big ideas like a \u201c2070 paradigm shift,\u201d \u201cteaching Javascript to African refugees,\u201d and \u201cbulletproof coffee,\u201d all while wearing a suit of gold armor.\nOne particularly funny quote from the speech:\u201cGreat ideas come in all shapes and sizes.\nIt\u2019s well worth it:[h/t Uproxx]\u2014 \u2014>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter"}
