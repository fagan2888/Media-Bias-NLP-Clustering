Supporters and detractors agree that the tensions speak to the larger issues looming over mammograms, colonoscopies and screenings for problems such as autism, diabetes and hepatitis C. Evidence and emotion often clash.  \"A woman with breast cancer, with little children - there's nothing that attracts our human emotion more than that kind of suffering,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law expert at Georgetown University.  With the most common prostate-cancer screening tests, the task force found, about 80 percent of positive results were actually false-positive ones that led some men to undergo biopsies, risking infection, bleeding and urinary difficulties.  Kenneth Lin, a former science officer for the task force, was approached last year by a consulting firm interested in knowing whether the panel might support an alternative to colonoscopies in its draft guidelines on colon cancer screening.  When it was created in 1984, with members appointed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, the concept of insurance coverage for preventive services was novel.  Specialists such as gynecologists may choose to follow guidelines for earlier-age mammography, for example, because the most aggressive approach is \"generally more protective\" if a doctor is sued for malpractice, said Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.", "vf": {"section": "lifestyle", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-6885527"}, "author.name": "By Lena H.
