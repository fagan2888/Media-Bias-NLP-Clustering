He added that the bill only says that the government can\u2019t call on people to violate their faith.\n\nDeLay gave examples in Texas where he says individual religious liberties have been trumped by the left\u2019s homosexual agenda.\n\nHe mentioned a city ordinance in San Antonio, Texas, that said if you did not believe in sexual orientation and homosexuality, you couldn\u2019t run for office.\n\nDeLay also discussed Houston\u2019s lesbian Mayor going after pastors that did not support her restroom bill, which was dubbed an \u201cequal rights\u201d ordinance. The restroom bill would have allowed men and women to use restrooms for the opposite sex, as long as they identify themselves.\n\nWhen asked if religious liberty will be a big issue in the upcoming 2016 presidential election, DeLay said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very big issue, mainly because the bigger issue is the Constitution.\u201d\n\nDeLay added that President Obama has pushed conservatives to stand up for the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former House Majority Leader, Tom DeLay, joined \"Breitbart News Sunday\" radio show to discuss the media scrutiny over religious freedom laws.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Former House Majority Leader, Tom DeLay, joined \"Breitbart News Sunday\" radio show to discuss the media scrutiny over religious freedom laws.", "title": "Tom DeLay: The Left Bought into the Homosexual Agenda - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/tom-delay-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/05/tom-delay-the-left-bought-into-the-homosexual-agenda/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former House Majority Leader, Tom DeLay, joined \"Breitbart News Sunday\" radio show to discuss the media scrutiny over religious freedom laws.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/tom-delay-AP.jpg", "title": "Tom DeLay: The Left Bought into the Homosexual Agenda - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Clinton, Breitbart News Sunday, Constitution, Indiana, Indiana religious freedom, lgbt, Mainstream Media, religious freedom law, RFRA, tolerance, Tom Delay,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Faith,tom delay", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Tom Delay", "published_time": "2015-04-05T19:19:30-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb92a\"", "article_summary": "DeLay gave examples in Texas where he says individual religious liberties have been trumped by the left\u2019s homosexual agenda.\nThe restroom bill would have allowed men and women to use restrooms for the opposite sex, as long as they identify themselves.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFormer House Majority Leader, Tom DeLay, joined \u201cBreitbart News Sunday\u201d radio program to discuss the media scrutiny over the Indiana religious freedom law.\nDeLay also discussed Houston\u2019s lesbian Mayor going after pastors that did not support her restroom bill, which was dubbed an \u201cequal rights\u201d ordinance.\n\u201cThey totally bought into the homosexual agenda,\u201d DeLay said when addressing the fact that Bill Clinton had signed the federal RFRA in 1993, but now the Democratic Party seems to have departed from that support."}
