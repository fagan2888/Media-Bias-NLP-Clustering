The flamboyant \u201cNature Boy\u201d is considered perhaps the greatest pro wrestler of all time. In addition to his in-ring athleticism, Rick Flair in his prime cut the best promos of anyone in that sports-entertainment genre during his time in the NWA, WCW, and WWE among other promotions. Out of the ring, Flair has faced a host of legal and family problems.\n\nAccording to The Big Lead, the 49ers were fired up by Flair\u2019s motivational presentation. \u201cThe team was enormously excited, and more than a half-dozen of the players immediately took to their social media accounts to gloat, while offensive lineman Anthony Davis used the opportunity to take a potshot at the Green Bay area.\n\nFlair is actually a Carolina Panthers fan (he lives in the area), and the team has adopted his famous \u201cWhooooo\u201d battle cry. When he learned about what the Panthers are doing, Flair said \u201cIt\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m a champ brother, so I know a thing or two about celebrating victories! I\u2019m humbled to have achieved that much respect by my hometown team. I really believe the Panthers have the weapons to go all the way.\u201d\n\nIronically, the 49ers will now play the Panthers next Sunday as the NFL post-season moves forward. Ric Flair may not be available due to a previous engagement to visit the Panthers\u2019 locker room in person before the game, however.\n\n[top image credit: Matthew Glover]\n\nWhooo!
