The fireworks are erupting. The tributes are growing.\n\nElizabeth Warren is the media\u2019s new heroine.\n\nShe\u2019s been a press favorite roughly forever. But by standing up to a Democratic president and bringing the government to within hours of a shutdown, the freshman senator is being lionized like never before.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren Is Catching Fire,\u201d Politico declares.\n\nPretty amazing, considering that she, um, lost her battle.\n\nThe Washington Post not only hailed her in a front-page headline \u2014\u201cDemocrats\u2019 Warren Wing Sends a Message\u201d\u2014but its Fix column suggested that Hillary Clinton move up the launch of her presidential campaign, saying there\u2019s \u201ca big reason why she should at least consider announcing sooner rather than later. And it's named Elizabeth Warren. Or, at least, the energy and passion among liberals that is, at the moment, channeled through Warren.\u201d\n\nThe press has been trying to draft Warren for the 2016 race, despite months of denials that she will jump in. So now it\u2019s casting the Massachusetts lawmaker in a new role: leader of the liberal opposition to President Obama.\n\nThe hometown Boston Globe offered this glowing piece:\n\n\u201cIn losing Wall Street battle, Warren may gain party clout\u201d\n\nThe Hill went with a declarative headline, \u201cWarren Makes Her Mark\u201d:\n\n\u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s crusade against the $1.1 trillion spending bill backed by the White House firmly establishes the Massachusetts populist as a powerful player in Washington.\u201d\n\nAnd there was this:\n\n\u201cThe fight earned her comparisons to Texas firebrand Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, another relative newcomer to the Senate who has shown outsized clout in his party.\u201d\n\nAh, but the comparison quickly breaks down.\n\nWarren\u2019s reason for working to defeat the bipartisan, $1.1-trillion spending bill was to stop a GOP provision that would roll back some Dodd-Frank restrictions on big banks. The mainstream media are sympathetic to any assault on Wall Street greedheads, so Warren was portrayed as a woman of principle.\n\nCruz, in rallying conservative Republicans against last year\u2019s budget compromise, was trying to halt funding for ObamaCare. The media had decided that battle was over.\n\nSo the Texas lawmaker was portrayed as a Cruz missile, an obstructionist, a hostage-taker, a man engaged in \u201cpolitical terrorism,\u201d as Chris Matthews put it. Slate called him and other Republicans \u201ckidnappers,\u201d and to make sure no one missed the point, ran a picture of Cruz alongside one of Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nNow there are key differences. Warren never threatened to carry her fight all the way to a government shutdown. She mounted her battle over the space of 24 hours as the pro-banking provision emerged in the bill. The House narrowly averted a shutdown as Obama and Joe Biden corralled enough Democrats and John Boehner salvaged enough Republicans who hated the bill because it didn\u2019t derail the president\u2019s executive order on immigration.\n\nCruz, on the other hand, fought the 2013 budget plan for months and made perfectly clear he and his allies had no intention of backing down, even as he tried to shift the blame to Harry Reid. The Republicans were largely blamed for the 16-day shutdown. And even the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page accused Cruz of kamikaze tactics, since it was clear he could not win the fight.\n\nBut political grandstanding and the Green Eggs and Ham filibuster aside, wasn\u2019t Cruz fighting for an issue he believed in?\n\nWhy is Warren depicted as populist true believer and Cruz as a wacko bird?\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to go back to last year to see the contrasting treatment of Ted Cruz. On Saturday, Cruz objected to the proceedings and forced a symbolic vote on Obama\u2019s immigration order, forcing the Senate to stay in session until 1 a.m.\n\nOn Politico, right next to the Warren \u201cOn Fire\u201d headline, was this: \u201cTed Cruz Does It Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fiasco has turned many of Cruz\u2019s colleagues openly against him,\u201d Politico said.\n\nBut Warren also ticked off some in her party by upending the script written by the White House and Reid. Yet the accompanying Politico piece said, \u201cWith every recent anti-establishment move, the Massachusetts Democrat grows more attractive as a 2016 candidate, both in her own right and as a progressive foil for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe media, let\u2019s face it, are turning out to be a major asset for Elizabeth Warren, crowning her the de facto champion of the left.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
