This current tussle, he said, began when he received a letter from the FEC earlier this year requesting details about the PAC.\n\nRelated: Their \u2018No New Taxes\u2019 Vow Is Now Haunting the GOP\n\n\u201cYour committee's name includes the name of a candidate; however, your committee does not appear to be an authorized committee of that candidate,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIf your committee is authorized by a candidate, please amend your Statement of Organization\u2026Otherwise, you must amend your Statement of Organization to change the name of your political committee so that it does not include the candidate's name and/or provide further clarification regarding the nature of your committee.\u201d\n\nHowever, the regulations adopted by the FEC to implement federal election laws are actually very specific about unauthorized committees\u2019 use of candidates\u2019 names, and on a plain reading, at least, appear to support Backer\u2019s position.\n\nThe regulation reads, in part: \u201cAn unauthorized political committee may include the name of a candidate in the title of a special project name or other communication if the title clearly and unambiguously shows opposition to the named candidate.\u201d\n\nIn his response, delivered this week, Backer wrote that the members of his PAC were \u201cunsure, considering the choice to include the verb \u2018STOP\u2019 in the Committee's name, followed by the clear object sought to be stopped, \u2019Hillary\u2019, what further clarification could possibly make clearer the Committee's lack of candidate authorization and, in fact, its open, aggressive, and blatantly obvious opposition to Hillary Clinton.\n\nRelated: As Hillary\u2019s Numbers Dip, Benghazi Rises as an Issue\n\n\u201cThis Committee would encourage the FEC to vigorously investigate who it is that is so stupid that they would think a political committee named \u2018Stop Hillary PAC\u2019 is in any way an authorized committee of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Backer made it clear that he doesn\u2019t think the issue is stupidity at all, as much as it is malice. He said there are obvious parallels between the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s alleged targeting of conservative groups in advance of the 2012 election and the FEC\u2019s demand that the Stop Hillary PAC change its name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual that the regulatory agencies that have long been staffed by Democratic operatives, are more likely to harass conservative groups than liberal groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all about the continued weaponization of government to advance a political agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like an apology from the FEC,\u201d Backer said. Asked what the agency ought to apologize for, he said, \u201cWasting my clients\u2019 time with such trivial nonsense.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the FEC said Thursday that the agency had no comment on the issue or on Backer\u2019s demand for an apology.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A conservative activist, under fire from the Federal Election Commission for naming a political action committee the \u201cStop Hillary PAC,\u201d said Thursday that pressure on his group is an example of \u201cthe continued weaponization of government to advance a political agenda.\u201d", "title": "Are Dems at the FEC Trying to Stop the \u2018Stop Hillary\u2019 PAC?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/05/Are-Dems-FEC-Trying-Stop-Stop-Hillary-PAC", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04282015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/05/Are-Dems-FEC-Trying-Stop-Stop-Hillary-PAC", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04282015_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A conservative activist, under fire from the Federal Election Commission for naming a political action committee the \u201cStop Hillary PAC,\u201d said Thursday that pressure on his group is an example of \u201cthe continued weaponization of government to advance a political agenda.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "He said there are obvious parallels between the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s alleged targeting of conservative groups in advance of the 2012 election and the FEC\u2019s demand that the Stop Hillary PAC change its name.\n\u201cThis is all about the continued weaponization of government to advance a political agenda.\u201d\u201cI would like an apology from the FEC,\u201d Backer said.\nThis current tussle, he said, began when he received a letter from the FEC earlier this year requesting details about the PAC.\nA Republican attorney who serves as treasurer for the anti-Hillary Clinton political action committee Stop Hillary PAC said Thursday that he \u201cwould not back down one iota\u201d in the face of a demand from the Federal Elections Commission that his PAC change its name to avoid confusing voters.\nAttorney Dan Backer, the founder of DB Capitol Partners in Alexandria, Va., is also a founder of the PAC in question, and he is no stranger to battles with the FEC, which he has fought in court on numerous issues."}
