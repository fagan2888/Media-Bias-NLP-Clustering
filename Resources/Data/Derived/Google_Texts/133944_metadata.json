I am also fully aware of the opportunity the Mets have this postseason. Winning the division and getting to the playoffs is our goal.\n\n\u201cOnce we are there, I will be there.\u201d\n\nWe shall see. There are a few innings between now and then, and we don\u2019t know yet what compromise means.\n\nBut, as the Mets arrive in Washington Monday for a key three-game series, Harvey should realize that this isn\u2019t New York. You\u2019re among friends here. We understand.\n\nThe Mets are clumsily struggling with how to handle their young arms \u2014 particularly Harvey, who is coming off Tommy John surgery. They also have the challenge of what to do with Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard, who are both pitching more innings than they ever have, and have all of September ahead of them.\n\ndeGrom and Syndergaard are not like Harvey though. They are not recovering from Tommy John surgery. At least not yet.\n\nBut Harvey is, and since he has Scott Boras as an agent, he has come out and said that \u2014 much like Stephen Strasburg was in 2012 \u2014 he should be on an innings limit this season, and revealed he has the backing of Dr. James Andrews in his position on a cap.\n\n\u201cDr. Andrews said his limit was 180,\u201d Harvey told reporters. \u201cI hired Scott as my agent and went to Dr. Andrews as my surgeon because I trusted them to keep my career going and keep me healthy.\u201d\n\nHarvey has pitched 1661/3 innings so far this year. He is scheduled to start Tuesday against the Nationals. Even with the Mets plan to skip a start in the rotation, Harvey will likely be over 190 innings by the end of the season. Then, if the Mets reach the postseason and have a successful run, Harvey could wind up pitching 220 innings this season.\n\nWhy would he do that?\n\nWhy would Harvey do anything other than what Boras has recommended after seeing what how successful the plan in Washington worked with not just Strasburg, but Jordan Zimmermann, who Harvey will face Tuesday?\n\nEveryone forgets, but it was for Zimmermann \u2014 not a Boras client \u2014 whom Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo implemented the innings limit plan as part of recovery from 2009 Tommy John surgery.\n\nSince then, Zimmermann has pitched 875 innings without incident. He has posted a 66-43 record over that time, and earned $32 million. He is about to become a free agent and about to get paid maybe not as much as everyone thought before this season began, but enough.\n\nThen there is Strasburg, the pitcher most identified with the shutdown limit. Since having Tommy John surgery in 2010, Strasburg, who is scheduled to start Wednesday against New York, has pitched 672 innings. While he has had a number of physical ailments, none have been related to the elbow and the surgery. He has posted a 46-33 record in that time, and earned $25 million since the surgery.\n\nNo one can sure if the Rizzo plan is responsible for that, but that\u2019s the curse of the approach. The Nationals can never be proven right, even as their two prime pieces of evidence have been productive and made money.\n\nIf you\u2019re Harvey, how can you ignore that?\n\nHow can you look at what Zimmermann and Strasburg have done and NOT say, \u201cI\u2019ll have what they\u2019re having?\u201d\n\nHow can you not look at the \u201canti-Strasburg\u201d \u2014 Kris Medlen \u2014 and wonder why anyone would risk a recovery plan other than what Rizzo did here in Washington with Zimmermann and Strasburg?\n\nMedlen, coming off Tommy John surgery, was celebrated as the \u201canti-Strasburg\u201d in a Sports Illustrated article. Atlanta had Medlen pitch out of the bullpen early in the season to limit his innings in 2012 when the Braves, like the Mets now, were battling the Nationals for the NL East division title.\n\nTwo years later, Medlen had his second Tommy John surgery.\n\nWere the Braves wrong? Who knows? But if you\u2019re Harvey, and you want to best preserve your chance at a long major league career, why would you risk anything other than what has worked?\n\nFor the glory of the New York Mets?\n\n\u201cSon, I don\u2019t care if you can\u2019t remember your name. Put your helmet on and get back in the game. We need you to win.\u201d\n\nMets general manager Sandy Alderson has put the target on Harvey\u2019s back \u2014 instead of what Rizzo did, which was to take the pressure off the player.\n\n\u201cMatt\u2019s going to have to make a decision,\u201d Alderson told reporters. \u201cScott (Boras) wants us to make it, and take it out of Matt\u2019s hands. But this is a 26-year-old man here, not some 18-year-old kid. He\u2019s an adult. This paternalistic attitude that Scott might have toward his clients, that\u2019s not going to be duplicated by us. We\u2019ve done our research and our due diligence.\n\n\u201cBut we do need to finalize this with Matt, because it affects all our other pitchers, and our baseball team. We have to have some certainty.\u201d\n\nCan you give Harvey some certainty, Sandy, about his future? I didn\u2019t think so. There is none.\n\nOne thing Alderson did say that is nearly a certainty \u201cit affects all our other pitchers.\u201d It probably will \u2014 and I doubt the Mets will handle it the same way the next time.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But, as the Mets arrive in Washington Monday for a key three-game series, Matt Harvey should realize that this isn't New York.
