Read the rest here.\n\nAK, a 27-year-old in New Jersey, has been in and out of therapy since she was in high school, when she began seeing her mom\u2019s therapist and was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, also known as manic depression.\n\n\n\nThrough college and beyond, AK struggled to find the right treatment as well as the right therapist. She was prescribed medication, which she says didn\u2019t work for her. \u201cI felt worse; I felt depressed all the time,\u201d she says, adding that she stopped taking the medicine a few years ago.\n\nOver time, though, things got better. AK finished college, and got \u2013 and held down \u2013 jobs. She has never mentioned her condition at work.\n\n\u201cI wish someone had told me that \u2013 when I started this \u2013 that life gets better, then it gets worse, then it gets better, then it gets worse,\u201d she says. \u201cIt goes up and down. It\u2019s just how it is. And you just have to keep going, every day.\u201d\n\nRelated: The cost of mental health: \u2018Why do I need to pay someone to listen?\u2019\n\nThe $10 co-pay she paid while on her mother\u2019s insurance wasn\u2019t much of a problem, she says. Scheduling around her jobs in retail and at Comcast, on the other hand, was.\n\n\u201cYou are expected to be available all the time and even when I wasn\u2019t getting 40 hours a week in retail, I still was working two jobs to get as close to 40 hours as I could,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t much money and I couldn\u2019t turn [the hours] down. I had to work all the time, as much as I could, to pay for my student loans.\u201d\n\nA year ago, AK turned 26, aged out of her mom\u2019s insurance, and enrolled on one of the plans offered through the Affordable Care Act. Finding out that her therapist isn\u2019t covered left her saddened.\n\n\u201cI like him so much, and I have been through so many [therapists], it\u2019s a real investment of time and emotions to start again,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen she switched insurances, AK stopped going to therapy and has not gone back since.\n\nRelated: Therapy was 'the best chance I had of feeling OK'\n\nEven if her therapist was covered, she says, \u201cright now my co-pay for a specialist is $30, which is a real hardship for me. I just can\u2019t afford to go\u201d.\n\nAK says those seeking out help need to be patient.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "AK, a 27-year-old who lives in New Jersey, was in therapy on and off until a year ago, when she aged out of her mom\u2019s insurance", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Jana Kasperkevic", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "AK, a 27-year-old who lives in New Jersey, was in therapy on and off until a year ago, when she aged out of her mom\u2019s insurance", "title": "Is therapy worth the cost?
