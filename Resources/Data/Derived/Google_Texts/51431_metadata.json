But they shouldn\u2019t expect much help from the Internal Revenue Service. Got a question for the IRS? Good luck reaching someone by phone. The tax agency says only half of the 100 million people expected to call this year will be able to reach a person. Callers who do get through may have to wait on hold for 30 minutes or more to talk to someone who will answer only the simplest questions. \u201cTaxpayers who need help are not getting it, and tax compliance is likely to suffer over the longer term if these problems are not quickly and decisively addressed,\u201d said a report Wednesday by agency watchdog Nina E. Olson. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen says budget cuts are forcing the agency to reduce taxpayer services and other functions. The number of audits will decline, technology upgrades will be delayed and the agency might be forced to shut down and furlough workers for two days later this year, Koskinen said. The IRS will no longer help low-income taxpayers fill out their returns, and tax refunds could be delayed for people who file paper returns. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be worse timing,\u201d Koskinen said of the budget cuts.\n\nOh, I disagree wholeheartedly, Mr. Koskinen. This is excellent timing to remind Americans of what a disaster Barack Obama dropped in their laps, how utterly callous and incompetent his administration has become, and what a sick tyrannical joke the American tax system has become.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to remind them that for all the velvet-glove rhetoric surrounded by Obamacare, it\u2019s more of a mailed fist \u2013 it\u2019s about control and punishment, not improving the efficiency or fiscal situation of the healthcare system. It was sold to the public as a largely voluntary system they\u2019d be eager to willingly participate in, because it would be so awesome: \u201cIf you like your old plan, you can keep your plan; nobody is going to take it away from you, period.\u201d The reality is mandates, punishment, and enforcement. IRS agents are more appropriate symbols of Obamacare than doctors in lab coats would be \u2013 if you could get an appointment. The only way to improve this timing further would be to officially reschedule Tax Day to fall within a week of Election Day.\n\nThis debacle also provides an excellent case for the long-overdue dismissal of Koskinen and everyone in his chain of command. If Koskinen\u2019s response to losing $346 million out of an eleven billion dollar budget is to throw up his hands and say, \u201cI give up! Taxpayers, you\u2019re on your own,\u201d he\u2019s submitting his resignation, not setting policy. His successor should enter office with a healthy can-do spirit. If nothing else, maybe he or she will spend more time addressing the needs of taxpayers and less time figuring out ways to thwart congressional oversight.\n\nIf there\u2019s someone out there who can manage the immense resources of the Internal Revenue Service in a manner that will efficiently service the needs of taxpayers, rather than terrorizing them in the pursuit of political agendas, I suggest the Republican Congress set about finding that new IRS commissioner without delay. President Obama loves to ignore the law and seize congressional powers; let\u2019s return the favor and fix the IRS, since his administration has consistently demonstrated it cannot be trusted to do so.\n\nLet\u2019s make this disastrous tax season a teachable moment for the American people. They need to understand that Obama-style big government is eager to use its power to fulfill its own ambitions and crush its opponents. They demand power with promises of benevolence, but every bit of control we give them over our lives and fortunes can be twisted into whips for lashing us into obedience. Everything they \u201cgive\u201d you can be taken away later, if you prove troublesome. Cut their budgets, and they\u2019ll make you bleed. Their extravagant vows to selflessly serve the public good are forgotten in a hot second, when it\u2019s time for the bureaucracy to defend itself against reform \u2026 especially the kind of reform that leaves them with less power and money.\n\n$10.9 billion isn\u2019t sufficient to administer the tax code and Obamacare without inflicting undue inconvenience upon the Little People? The only sane conclusion to draw is that the tax code and Obamacare have to go. They\u2019re unworkable, by the government\u2019s own admission. Let\u2019s get back to the drawing board and design a system that doesn\u2019t treat the free people of this great Republic like serfs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IRS to Obamacare Victims: You're On Your Own, Chumps", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "IRS to Obamacare Victims: You're On Your Own, Chumps", "title": "IRS to Obamacare Victims: You're On Your Own, Chumps - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/John-Kosinen-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/15/irs-to-obamacare-victims-youre-on-your-own-chumps/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "IRS to Obamacare Victims: You're On Your Own, Chumps", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/John-Kosinen-ap.jpg", "title": "IRS to Obamacare Victims: You're On Your Own, Chumps - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "budget cuts, irs, john koskinen, obamacare, tax code, tax reform,Big Government,IRS", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "tax reform", "published_time": "2015-01-15T10:00:13-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0e5\"", "article_summary": "The tax agency says only half of the 100 million people expected to call this year will be able to reach a person.\nIRS agents are more appropriate symbols of Obamacare than doctors in lab coats would be \u2013 if you could get an appointment.\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen says budget cuts are forcing the agency to reduce taxpayer services and other functions.\n$10.9 billion isn\u2019t sufficient to administer the tax code and Obamacare without inflicting undue inconvenience upon the Little People?\nThe only sane conclusion to draw is that the tax code and Obamacare have to go."}
