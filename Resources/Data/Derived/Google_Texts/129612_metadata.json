(WPRI) \u2013 Rhode Island\u2019s biggest hospital chain is already seeing a positive financial impact from President Obama\u2019s health law, WPRI.com has learned.\n\nLifespan Corp., the nonprofit owner of Rhode Island Hospital and other facilities, recently revealed that its charity care costs plummeted by more than half for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, declining from $60.7 million in 2013 to $27.3 million in 2014. Its provision for bed debts declined from $30.7 million to $28.7 million.\n\nThe decline was \u201cdue largely to the January 1, 2014, expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the growth of health insurance exchanges, both of which reduced the number of uninsured patients,\u201d Lifespan officials wrote in a disclosure to bondholders. Both policies were enacted as part of the president\u2019s 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNo one expected that the Affordable Care Act would have such a significant impact on Medicaid enrollment in Rhode Island,\u201d Lifespan spokeswoman Gail Leach Carvelli told WPRI.com.\n\nThe number of Rhode Islanders enrolled in Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for lower-income Americans, jumped from about 190,000 to more than 260,000 after the Obama law expanded eligibility at the start of last year. About 28,000 others signed up for private insurance through HealthSource RI, the new insurance marketplace the state created under the law.\n\nLifespan said its net revenue from patients rose to $402.5 million for the Sept. 30 quarter in 2014, up from $384 million in 2013, which it attributed \u201cprimarily\u201d to the decline in uncompensated care. The hospital network is Rhode Island\u2019s biggest private employer, with 13,635 employees at the close of 2013.\n\n\u201cThis was obviously a welcome outcome,\u201d Carvelli said. \u201cThis is especially significant since people now have coverage and can address health issues earlier, hopefully resulting in better outcomes and eventually lower overall costs.\u201d\n\nThe reduction in uncompensated care helped Lifespan narrow its operating loss slightly during the Sept. 30 quarter to $11.3 million, down from $11.8 million in 2013, the disclosure showed. The nonprofit posted a net loss of $15.3 million for the quarter, compared with a net surplus of $20.4 million a year earlier. Its operating expenses rose 5% as 187 new jobs were added, primarily for physicians and IT professionals.\n\nCarvelli cautioned that while the health law has had a positive financial impact on Lifespan so far, the hospital group still wracked up more than $75 million in uncompensated care costs during 2014.\n\n\u201cOur uncompensated care costs today are close to where they were in 2007, when we posted a better operating margin and we received more state support for our uncompensated care,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith continued pressure on overall health care costs we are making major investments in enhancing our care delivery system, and in a new information technology system to position us to be a strong regional health care system and a vital component of our state\u2019s economy,\u201d she added.\n\nTed Nesi ( tnesi@wpri.com ) covers politics and the economy for WPRI.com and writes the Nesi\u2019s Notes blog.
