But this year, there are three other revolutions that overshadow our own.\n\nThe first is the French Revolution. Unlike the Americans, who preserved their religious institutions while overthrowing the monarchy, the French Jacobins destroyed the church to build the state. The Terror soon followed, and France was only \u201crescued\u201d by a despotism more complete than the one that existed before.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThere is a similar Jacobin tendency in America today. As William Kristol writes: \u201cWe see a French Revolution-like tendency to move with the speed of light from a reasonable and perhaps overdue change (taking down the Confederate flag over state buildings) to an all-out determination to expunge from our history any recognition or respect for that which doesn\u2019t fully comport with contemporary progressive sentiment.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to make gay marriage a \u201cfundamental\u201d right not only distorted the Constitution and usurped the power of the people, but encouraged an ongoing campaign against religious institutions and individuals that is undermining freedom of speech and conscience.\n\nTwo centuries ago, the French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville wrote admiringly that the early Americans had \u201cbrought to the New World a Christianity that can best be described as democratic and republican\u2026.From the beginning, politics and religion were in harmony, and have remained so ever since.\u201d That, he believed, prevented the excesses and the abuses of power of the French Revolution. After last week, however, the harmony of politics and religion is now in doubt.\n\nIt is no accident that the same Court decided to entrench the power of the federal government\u2013not just to carry out a staggeringly huge policy like Obamacare, but also to distort the plain meaning of the law on which that policy is based. The decline of tradition and the family only offers incidental liberties to the individual: in the long run, it emboldens the state.\n\nThe second revolution that hangs over our own is the Cuban revolution\u2013and, more generally, the Communist revolution. Under communism, revolution is never just a moment of taking power, but describes the way power is held\u2013and the way dissent is crushed as \u201ccounter-revolutionary.\u201d\n\nWhen President Barack Obama announced the renewal of diplomatic ties relations with the Castro regime, he cast America as the villain, in effect adopting Cuba\u2019s \u201crevolutionary\u201d perspective\u2013and neglecting the political prisoners and dissidents still struggling for the freedom that we Americans have taken for granted.\n\nThe third revolution is the Islamic Revolution. The Iranian regime that came to power in 1979 is brutal and fanatical. It runs global terrorist operations and cultivates hatred of America, of Israel, and of other Muslims. Six years ago, the regime was near collapse. Today, thanks to Obama, it is about to become a nuclear power, fulfilling the revolution\u2019s dark purpose.\n\nThese three revolutions\u2013the French, the Communist, and the Islamic\u2013are all totalitarian in nature. They have always destroyed individual liberty. They have always provoked war. They have always tempted and inspired those among us\u2013like Barack Obama\u2013who yearned to be a part of the \u201cchange\u201d they witnessed in other countries (from a safe distance).\n\nAnd yet we have resisted them, until now, because our faith in our own Constitution was strong, and renewed in every generation.\n\nOur freedom has persisted not, as Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the gay marriage decision, because the Founders gave us \u201ca charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,\u201d but rather a compact that protects timeless liberties, however imperfectly, against the power of the government.\n\nWe are in danger because, in a moment of crisis, we accepted the idea that America needed \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d\u2013that one Revolution was not enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "1776-2015: Is Our Revolution Dead?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "1776-2015: Is Our Revolution Dead?", "title": "1776-2015: Is Our Revolution Dead? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/dont-tread-on-me-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-07-03T15:14:33-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/04/1776-2015-is-our-revolution-dead/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "1776-2015: Is Our Revolution Dead?", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/dont-tread-on-me-ap.jpg", "title": "1776-2015: Is Our Revolution Dead? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "1776, communist revolution, Cuba, French Revolution, Gay Marriage, Iran, July 4, obamacare, revolution,Big Government, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-04T04:00:20-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T15:14:33-07:00", "tag": "revolution", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The first is the French Revolution.\nThe second revolution that hangs over our own is the Cuban revolution\u2013and, more generally, the Communist revolution.\nThe third revolution is the Islamic Revolution.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThere is a similar Jacobin tendency in America today.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJuly 4th marks the climax of the American Revolution, remembered with fireworks, family, and fun."}
