Bernie Sanders level crazy which assumes 5% growth because all the money trees will rise out of the ground once he does a magic hippie rain dance.\n\nSo even these guys have come out against that level of fantasy economics.\n\nFour former White House economic advisers are taking issue with a rosy economic analysis of Sanders' proposal that found that Sanders' plan would spur the U.S. economy to grow by 5.3% per year,median income to soar by more than $22,000, and the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8%.\n\nAnd the unicorns will come out of the clouds and they will dance. And we will all dance with them. And then hug each other. And no one will want money anymore. #FeeltheBern\n\nNot so fast, wrote the economists, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Christina Romer and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Obama and Clinton in a letter addressed to Sanders and Friedman. \"We are concerned to see the Sanders campaign citing extreme claims by Gerald Friedman about the effect of Senator Sanders's economic plan -- claims that cannot be supported by the economic evidence,\" the former chairs wrote. \"As much as we wish it were so, no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes.\"\n\nBut when you rig the numbers to make unrealistic claims (like the ones about ObamaCare) then someone will show up promising even more delicious pie in the sky.\n\nRaise the rate of gross domestic product growth to 5.3 percent per year, more than double the Federal Reserve\u2019s current long-run projection of 2 percent.\n\n\u2022 Reduce unemployment to 3.8 percent, which is way below the Fed\u2019s long-term estimates of 4.9 percent. \u2022 Restore the share of the population in the labor force back to what it was in 1999, even though the Baby Boom generation is much older today and so many more Americans have reached retirement age. If you don\u2019t follow economic statistics closely, these numbers may not mean much to you. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d describe them in laymen\u2019s terms: garbage. It\u2019s not just that these figures assume delusionally large effects. Some show effects that don\u2019t even point in the right direction. Consider the claims about labor force participation. If you actually think about Sanders\u2019s proposals \u2014 such as completely delinking health insurance from employment, making college free and increasing Social Security benefits \u2014 you\u2019ll realize they mostly would reduce workforce participation on the margin. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re unworthy policy choices. Like any other choices, though, they bring tradeoffs \u2014 including making it easier or more attractive for Americans to not have a job. In no known universe would they have the effects Friedman predicts.\n\nWho is Gerald Friedman, the wizard who promises us that doing more of the same terrible things while completely disregarding math will make candy rain from the sky?

They\u2019re certainly right that Bernie Sanders\u2019 plans are incredibly ambitious. Just imagine having to martial an entire nation in order to carry some of his proposals out, never mind getting any of them to pass through congress. And what\u2019s the point in even attempting to break out of the destructive boom-and-bust economic cycle when Wall Street has such a grip on the political process? You know what? Let\u2019s listen to these pessimists: let\u2019s all just give up.\n\nNo, we must believe. We must clap our hands and say we believe in Socialism. Or Socialism will die. (I like the Freudian slip of \"martial\" for \"marshal\". As in martial law.)\n\nBernie Sanders is an idealist, yes, and his plans are ambitious. Nothing of this scale has been proposed since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But what harm would come to the naysayers if Sanders\u2019 supporters voted to at least aim for his something better? What would be wrong with attempting to steer the country towards greater income equality, if there\u2019s a chance even half of Gerald Friedman\u2019s findings coming true? (An 11 grand salary increase still isn\u2019t bad.) And hey, if the Sanders plan fails after four years, we can always just go back to this other system. You know, the one that isn\u2019t working.\n\nLike in Cuba or Venezuela. Or North Korea. All working. So let's ignore the math and march forward for the 101th repetition of the Great Socialist Experiment.\n\nIt reminds me of what Pavlov said, \"If Communism is an experiment, I would not sacrifice a frog's leg for it.\" Bernie Sanders supporters want to sacrifice a nation.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "Even Left-Wing Economists Say Bernie Sanders' Budget is a Fantasy", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261883/even-left-wing-economists-say-bernie-sanders-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/02/bernie_sanders_hey_kids2.jpg?itok=9K6OndOd", "updated_time": "2016-02-19T10:12:24-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261883/even-left-wing-economists-say-bernie-sanders-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/02/bernie_sanders_hey_kids2.jpg?itok=9K6OndOd", "card": "summary", "title": "Even Left-Wing Economists Say Bernie Sanders' Budget is a Fantasy"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-19T10:12:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T10:12:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders level crazy which assumes 5% growth because all the money trees will rise out of the ground once he does a magic hippie rain dance.\nBernie Sanders supporters want to sacrifice a nation.\nBernie Sanders is an idealist, yes, and his plans are ambitious.\nThey\u2019re certainly right that Bernie Sanders\u2019 plans are incredibly ambitious.\nKilling the Future: Centrist Dems are Trying to Destroy the Optimism of Bernie Sanders' Followers Let\u2019s, for a moment, take on board what these people are saying."}
