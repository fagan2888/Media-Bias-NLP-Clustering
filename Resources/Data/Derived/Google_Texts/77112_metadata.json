Jennifer Charlton, the executive director, said it costs about $200,000 per year. The organization recently received a $75,000 donation from the Donald B. and Dorothy L. Stabler Foundation. But it remains about $100,000 short of what it needs for the fiscal year that ends in June, she said.\n\nCharlton believes the organization can reach long-term sustainability if it can increase its local donor base to 250 people, up from about 45. And if it can build sufficient support, it will consider adding two more Harrisburg area visits per month, with the additional ones taking place at a suburban location, she said. The additional visits would decrease waiting times, she said.\n\nEmmitsburg-based Mission of Mercy, which has existed since 1994, is staffed by volunteer doctors and dentists and other health care providers. It exists on donations from churches, businesses, foundations and individuals.\n\nIn addition to the Harrisburg visits, Mission of Mercy makes regular stops in Gettysburg and in Frederick, Brunswick, Taneytown and Reistertown in Maryland.\n\nDuring stops in Gettysburg in 2002, the staff realized some people seeking care were from Harrisburg, and decided to make Harrisburg a regular stop.\n\nServices were eventually expanded to include a portable dental clinic which is set up inside the host church.\n\nSince 2002, Mission of Mercy has served 3,477 patients and conducted 16,669 appointments, according to Diane DeMarco, a spokeswoman. It typically sees 50 or more patients per visit.\n\nMission of Mercy collaborates with Holy Spirit Health System, which donates imaging and lab services, and PinnacleHealth System, which provides a diabetes educator.\n\nPatients pay nothing. They are asked if they have insurance. Those who do are asked to use their coverage to obtain care elsewhere, rather than use free care, DeMarco said.\n\nBut no one is asked to prove their financial status. \"We don't ask them to prove their poverty, because our mission is to restore dignity and healing through love, and that's God's love. If you ask people how poor they are, you are not restoring dignity,\" she said.\n\nCharlton said most are \"working poor.\" They come from Dauphin, Cumberland and Perry counties. Seventy percent have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure, she said.\n\nHealth care coverage expansion related to the Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people who have health insurance. But rising co-pays and deductibles are preventing some people from using their insurance, and driving them to Mission of Mercy, Charlton said.\n\nMission of Mercy provides medications for patients using donated medications or pairing patients with programs that serve the poor.\n\nStill, it is looking for assorted volunteer specialists in the Harrisburg area, including dentists, a physical therapist, a cardiologist and an oral surgeon.\n\nPeople who need a medical appointment should call Mission of Mercy's appointment line at 717-561-2170.\n\nMedical professionals who want to volunteer should call Dr. Michael Sullivan, the medical director, at 717-642-9062, or email him at msullivan@aMissionofMercy.org.\n\nFor more information about donating to Mission of Mercy, call 707-642-9062 or go to www.aMissionofMercy.org/maryland-pennsylvania.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "health care", "title": "Free medical clinic might stop coming to Harrisburg without more donors", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Free medical clinic might stop coming to Harrisburg without more donors \", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/mission_of_mercy_sullivan_talo.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/16872688-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15066116\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-28T14:04:09Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"health care\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@pennlive", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/16872688-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The potential for crime and violence recently pushed a mobile medical clinic to a new location.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DavidRWenner"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, January 30, 2015, 12:57 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/0318-clinic-mf3-8148-ed92c17021d0ceb5.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The potential for crime and violence recently pushed a mobile medical clinic to a new location.", "title": "Free medical clinic might stop coming to Harrisburg without more donors", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/mission_of_mercy_sullivan_talo.html", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_penn.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, January 28, 2015,  9:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The potential for crime and violence recently pushed a mobile medical clinic to a new location."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1d1\"", "article_summary": "Health care coverage expansion related to the Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people who have health insurance.\nIn addition to the Harrisburg visits, Mission of Mercy makes regular stops in Gettysburg and in Frederick, Brunswick, Taneytown and Reistertown in Maryland.\nA Maryland-based mobile clinic that provided free medical and dental care for about 1,300 people in Harrisburg last year says it needs more Harrisburg-area supporters.\nDuring stops in Gettysburg in 2002, the staff realized some people seeking care were from Harrisburg, and decided to make Harrisburg a regular stop.\nMedical professionals who want to volunteer should call Dr. Michael Sullivan, the medical director, at 717-642-9062, or email him at msullivan@aMissionofMercy.org."}
