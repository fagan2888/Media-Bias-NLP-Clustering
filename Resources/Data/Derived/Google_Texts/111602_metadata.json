A typical response I received rebutted my assertion by pointing to such recent progressive successes as Obamacare, the federal bailout of the auto industry and investment in new energy firms, \u201cmaking tax cuts for the middle class the norm\u201d (I\u2019m not sure in which country) and increased financial regulation.\n\nThe list actually makes my point: These are essentially 20th-century solutions. They don\u2019t speak to the governance realities of the 21st century. I addressed these a bit in my prior post on the \u201csharing\u201d \u2013 or, as I called it, \u201cunbottling\u201d \u2013 economy. Now comes a great piece in The Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog by Emily Badger allowing us to explore this subject a bit further. Badger asked:\n\nWhy are hundreds of thousands of people letting strangers rent their bedrooms or drive their cars if society is growing more cynical? Why would you trust a company that ships you a dress worn by another woman last week if you don't actually trust people all that much? How is the economy suddenly creating billion-dollar businesses around the idea of communal consumption at a time when we're not feeling communitarian at all?\n\n[READ: Cheers to the 'Unbottling' Economy]\n\nShe concluded (citing a PricewaterhouseCoopers report): \u201cConfidence in the sharing economy is not so much about trust between individual strangers \u2013 or even one person and one company \u2013 as it is about trust between one person and the crowd.\u201d Hers is basically an argument that crowdsourcing is changing businesses because of the \"law of large numbers\": One person almost never can answer correctly the prototypical carnival challenge of naming how many jelly beans are in a giant bottle \u2013 but the average guess of a large number of equally uninformed individuals usually comes extremely close to the actual answer. Many of our basic institutions, from juries and elections to stock markets and now crowdsourcing, depend upon this \u201cwisdom of crowds.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s really at issue, in my view, is the decreasing cost and increasing pervasiveness of information. Wrote Badger, \u201cMaybe I don't have all that much trust in one woman renting her home on Airbnb, but I do trust the aggregated input of the 24 people who've given her high marks.\u201d Well, 24 people don\u2019t really make for a statistically valid assessment of whether you\u2019ve checked into the Bates Motel. The analytic discipline at work here isn\u2019t statistics \u2013 it\u2019s game theory.\n\nHere\u2019s what game theory tells us about behavior: If individuals can benefit from antisocial behavior, they\u2019ll engage in it. And that depends a lot upon whether they ever have to see you again. Game theory constructs like the \u201cprisoner\u2019s dilemma\u201d \u2013 where everyone sells out everyone else \u2013 paint a dim picture of the prospects for human society. But only if it\u2019s a one-off game; if players have to play the game repeatedly, as they do in real societies, they quickly learn to \u201ccooperate\u201d rather than \u201cdefect.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nTechnologies today that make it easier to report on and learn of the behavior of others are making it harder to defect. You only get to lie or fail to send what you promised once and hope still to do business on eBay. In this way, the entire globe is indeed becoming a village. You don\u2019t need police or transfer programs in a village. As modern technologies make information more widely accessible \u2013 about bad cabs and bed-and-breakfasts, about polluters or exploitive employers, about campaign contributors and voting records \u2013 they make elaborate enforcement mechanisms less necessary. As I wrote in my \u201cunbottling\u201d post:\n\n[R]egulation itself is being not so much eliminated as modernized by these technologies. Like most apps that really take off these days, Uber allows \u2013 in fact, requires \u2013 users to rate each other, both drivers and riders alike. That brings consumer pressure (notably, based on egalitarian voting rather than economic muscle) to bear to regulate performance and punish substandard drivers (and riders).\n\nGovernments have always augmented, or outsourced, enforcement efforts through social regulation \u2013 everything from relying on citizens to report crime to Robert Reich\u2019s \u201cNo Sweat\u201d campaign as U.S. Labor Secretary. The app economy will make it even easier.\n\n\n\n[READ: No, Uber and Lyft Won't Hurt Consumers]\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted before, younger Americans believe more than their elders in all sorts of \u201cprogressive\u201d social values \u2013 but not in government programs as a means for achieving them. This begs the question: How does this generation think it will deal with \u201ccollective action\u201d problems \u2013 the kind of public goods or externalities challenges that form both the need and justification for government? The answer may very well be such social \u2013 rather than classically political \u2013 mechanisms made easier, cheaper and faster by modern information technologies.\n\nAnother Generation Y Washington Post blogger whom I greatly admire, Alexandra Petri, wrote a piece last year responding to the \u201cwhole story of the Hack That Found Everyone\u2019s Nude Photos.\u201d She not only insisted that people should feel free to treat new technologies as part of their zone of privacy, but also that younger Americans possessed a mechanism to enforce these expectations of privacy: a social contract. Don\u2019t post because you\u2019re then responsible for others violating your privacy? \u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThis is a terrible standard. We millennials have gotten by by ignoring it \u2013 reasoning that there is enough material there from each of us that destruction is mutually assured. \u2026 We all know this, and so we decide not to make this our standard.\u201d\n\nIf Petri\u2018s piece is an accurate reflection of her generation\u2019s views \u2013 and my experiences tell me it is \u2013 then younger Americans have a much higher expectation of social cohesion and collective enforcement of norms than is the case generally today. They expect new technologies to have everyone pulling together without coercion.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "App Economy Demonstrates Progressive Potential of Crowdsourcing", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Thanks to the app economy we're seeing a whole new kind of effective social regulation.", "title": "The Progressive Wisdom of Crowdsourcing", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/eric-schnurer/2015/04/21/app-economy-demonstrates-progressive-potential-of-crowdsourcing", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c3/be/d04909024f70b468968819dd36bf/150420-crowd-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Thanks to the app economy we're seeing a whole new kind of effective social regulation.", "card": "summary", "title": "App Economy Demonstrates Progressive Potential of Crowdsourcing"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 21, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Eric Schnurer,TJS,economy,millennials,progressives,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Thanks to the app economy we're seeing a whole new kind of effective social regulation."}, "article_summary": "I addressed these a bit in my prior post on the \u201csharing\u201d \u2013 or, as I called it, \u201cunbottling\u201d \u2013 economy.\nDon\u2019t post because you\u2019re then responsible for others violating your privacy?\nHow is the economy suddenly creating billion-dollar businesses around the idea of communal consumption at a time when we're not feeling communitarian at all?\nAs I wrote in my \u201cunbottling\u201d post:[R]egulation itself is being not so much eliminated as modernized by these technologies.\nWhy would you trust a company that ships you a dress worn by another woman last week if you don't actually trust people all that much?"}
