Cedar Rapids, Iowa (CNN) Chris Christie accused likely presidential rival Ted Cruz of "hypocrisy" for supporting federal emergency aid after last month's devastating floods in Texas but voting against government relief funding two years and a half years ago after Superstorm Sandy wrecked the East Coast.

The New Jersey governor, who was holding a town hall Friday during the final leg of his two-day trip to Iowa, was making the argument that the next president needs to be someone who understands what it's like to sustain a natural disaster -- unlike "some of our friends in Congress, right?"

"We have Senator Cruz -- who voted against Sandy relief -- now he says he's got floods in Texas. He says 'Hey, we need some help down here in Texas.' It's great, right?" asked Christie, who is expected to announce his presidential decision in the coming weeks.

He also referred to Colorado lawmakers who made similar protests to the Sandy bill but supported federal relief when floods hit their state in 2013.

Cruz expressed support for federal funds for his state in late May despite voting against a massive package in early 2013 dedicated to post-Sandy recovery efforts. Standing on what he said was a matter of principle, he and other conservatives argued that the bill contained too much extra money for items unrelated to the storm.
