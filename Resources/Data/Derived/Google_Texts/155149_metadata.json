Besides production, Chinese coal imports fell 39 percent between January and April, per the AP.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe coal industry in China has been hampered by both a slowdown in the country's economy and a push from Chinese leadership to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nEarlier this month, the government released data showing coal consumption fell 7.7 percent during the first four months of 2015, compared to the same time period last year. That trend followed a nearly 3 percent dip in coal consumption during 2014.\n\nOfficials in China hope to see their emissions peak in 2030, and Greenpeace estimated earlier this month that the country's declining coal consumption lowered its emissions by 5 percent.\n\nChina still generates about 66 percent of its energy from coal, compared to about 39 percent in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Coal production in China fell 6 percent during the first four months of 2015 amid declining demand for the fuel in the country.", "description": "Coal production in China fell 6 percent during the first four months of 2015 amid declining demand for the fuel in the country.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Coal production in China fell 6 percent during the first four months of 2015 amid declining demand for the fuel in the country.", "title": "China coal production dips during first four months of 2015", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/243204-china-coal-production-dips-during-first-four-months-of-2015", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/chinapollution03162015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/243204-china-coal-production-dips-during-first-four-months-of-2015", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-27T12:38-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Coal,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-27T12:38:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/243204-china-coal-production-dips-during-first-four-months-of-2015", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Coal production in China fell 6 percent during the first four months of 2015 amid declining demand for the fuel in the country.", "card": "summary", "title": "China coal production dips during first four months of 2015"}, "dcterms.title": "China coal production dips during first four months of 2015"}, "article_summary": "Coal production in China fell 6 percent during the first four months of 2015, The Associated Press reports.\nEarlier this month, the government released data showing coal consumption fell 7.7 percent during the first four months of 2015, compared to the same time period last year.\nThat trend followed a nearly 3 percent dip in coal consumption during 2014.\nThe production dip comes amid declining demand for the fuel in the country.\nBesides production, Chinese coal imports fell 39 percent between January and April, per the AP."}
