The Energy Information Administration, an independent statistical arm of the Department of Energy based in Washington, D.C., said yesterday that prices for Brent, the international crude oil benchmark, will average $59 per barrel in 2015 and $75 per barrel in 2016. Prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. crude oil benchmark, are expected to average $7 per barrel below Brent prices in 2015 and $5 per barrel below Brent prices in 2016.\n\nAs the global economy contracts and issues with Iran\u2019s agreement are not finalized, the market will continue to experience uncertainty, although there will not be large swings in prices, said Timothy Hess, a lead analyst for the EIA.\n\n\u201cWe could see lower prices stimulate demand and push prices back up especially as the global economy took a step backwards,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: How Iran Is Taking Over the Middle East\n\nRegular gasoline retail prices are forecasted to average $2.45 per gallon during the April-through-September summer driving season, compared with $3.59 per gallon last summer, Hess said. Prices could rise to $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon next year.\n\nThe average American household is predicted to spend about $700 less on gasoline in 2015 compared with 2014, as \u201cannual motor fuel expenditures are on track to fall to their lowest level in 11 years,\u201d the EIA report said.\n\nIran Windfall\n\nOil prices could fall again in 2016 if the sanctions against Iran are lifted, because this would allow a \u201csignificantly increased volume of Iranian barrels to enter the market,\u201d the EIA report said. \u201cIf and when sanctions are lifted, the baseline forecast for world crude oil prices in 2016 could be reduced $5 to $15 per barrel\u201d from the forecasted prices.\n\nRelated: Schumer Bucks Obama, Gives GOP Iran Plan a Green Light\n\nThe cost for gasoline will continue to rise as crude oil prices could reach an average of $55 in the U.S. and $60 internationally in the second half of 2015, but will continue to experience volatility, said Rob Desai, an energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis.\n\n\u201cIn the near term, there is likely more downward pressure, which is good for consumers, but we don't expect it to last,\u201d he said.\n\nThe outcome of the Iranian talks will be a driver of oil prices. If the sanctions are lifted, that could result in more oil being available on the international market, which would likely \"push down international prices,\" Desai said. If that occurs, consumers could see lower oil prices.\n\n\"We believe that longer term oil prices will move higher and that this will start to happen in the second half of the year,\" he said. \"Over the summer we expect prices to remain volatile and move aggressively with geopolitical events and the release of supply numbers.\"\n\nCrude oil prices could remain in the $50 range throughout the summer because of continued production in America's shale plays, high levels of output by OPEC members and the likelihood that Iran will ramp up production, said Bernard Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business in Dallas.\n\nRelated: Guess Which States Have the Largest Oil and Gas Fields\n\nComplicating Factors -- Prices Still Low\n\nOf course, oil prices in the U.S. are driven by several factors, and another main element is the high level of oil being stored, reaching near-record levels. While production is expected to decline during the summer due to a \u201cmuch lower rig count, we are still at high inventory levels, so that could push oil prices lower,\u201d Desai said.\n\nOil prices will reach a \u201ctipping point\u201d in July and prices will start to rise again, said Chris Faulkner, CEO of Breitling Energy, a Dallas oil and gas exploration and production company. Breitling Energy's internal models show oil finishing the year at $67 to $69 a barrel for WTI.\n\n\u201cConsumers are definitely taking notice of cheaper gasoline prices as new SUV purchases are on the rise and the increased gasoline demand correlates directly to additional oil demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can use any and all positive triggers right now as we battle to keep our rigs running.\u201d\n\nSince gasoline prices increase each summer, consumers should them to reach $2.65 to $2.70 per gallon this spring, said Kurt Rankin, an economist for PNC Bank in Pittsburgh.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Good First Step in Iran Leaves More to be Done\n\nIncreased demand will put an \u201cupward pressure\u201d on prices despite a record production of oil, he said.\n\nConsumers will still benefit from a huge reduction in prices, which creates a more sustainable recovery, because they are saving money and will have more future buying power, said Jay Hatfield, president of InfraCap, a New York-based registered investment advisor.\n\n\u201cThis is more sustainable in the long run and we are less likely to have recession,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really bullish for longer term growth.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe attractively low gas prices could also net benefits for auto sales.\n\n\u201cWith gasoline prices 40% lower than a year ago, the economy gaining strength and car and light truck sales near record levels, Americans will be hitting the road big time this summer,\u201d said Weinstein of the Maguire Energy Institute. \u201cNonetheless, gasoline and diesel prices should post only modest gains, despite the surge in demand, because of huge inventories of both crude oil and refined products.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in MainStreet.\n\nRead more from MainStreet:\n\nTop 10 Robo Advisors Ranked: Find the Best Automated Online Investing Services\n\n5 Bad Financial Habits You're Teaching Your Kids Without Even Knowing It\n\n5 Hotels Opening in 2015 That Embody Latest Travel Trends", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The price of crude oil will continue to rise slowly in the short-term, but it faces", "title": "Why the Iran Nuke Deal Could Mean Lower Gas Prices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/08/Why-Iran-Nuke-Deal-Could-Mean-Lower-Gas-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-gasoline-demand_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/08/Why-Iran-Nuke-Deal-Could-Mean-Lower-Gas-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-gasoline-demand_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The price of crude oil will continue to rise slowly in the short-term, but it faces", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe could see lower prices stimulate demand and push prices back up especially as the global economy took a step backwards,\u201d he said.\nIf that occurs, consumers could see lower oil prices.\n\u201cIf and when sanctions are lifted, the baseline forecast for world crude oil prices in 2016 could be reduced $5 to $15 per barrel\u201d from the forecasted prices.\nThe outcome of the Iranian talks will be a driver of oil prices.\nPrices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. crude oil benchmark, are expected to average $7 per barrel below Brent prices in 2015 and $5 per barrel below Brent prices in 2016."}
