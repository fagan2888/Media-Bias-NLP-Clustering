The federal reform plan known as Obamacare expanded Medi-Cal and similar insurance systems across the nation in an effort to provide coverage to the uninsured.\n\nThat expansion brought 59,000 new members into Gold Coast, far beyond expectations and increasing total membership to 178,000.\n\nThe state-calculated reimbursement for care of the new members means the health plan took in $30 million more than its costs over the first five months of the fiscal year. That\u2019s about $22 million more than budget projections.\n\n\u201cCompared to where we\u2019ve been, we\u2019re in an unusual circumstance,\u201d said Ruth Watson, interim CEO for the plan, emphasizing that reimbursement reductions and possible increased care costs could push the bottom line down.\n\nThe plan\u2019s net equity \u2014 revenue in excess of costs \u2014 is estimated at about $70 million over more than three years of existence.\n\nAfter its first year of operation, the equity was a negative $6 million. The deficit prompted officials from the California Department of Health Care Services to mandate changes, threatening to pull the plug on Gold Coast if edicts weren\u2019t followed.\n\nThe state\u2019s corrective action plan remains, although monitoring has lessened as the plan\u2019s position has improved. Watson said the turnaround comes from planning and hard work but is also driven by the increase in members.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal for any plan,\u201d she said of the 59,000-member tidal wave.\n\nThe new revenue prompted plan leaders to give many primary-care doctors, specialists and pediatricians who contract with Gold Coast a 20 percent raise as of next month. Watson said the raise is the first since the plan\u2019s 2011 launch.\n\nDoctors say the raise is appreciated but also noted that Medi-Cal has long reimbursed at rates that don\u2019t cover costs and rank among the worst in the nation. Doctors currently are paid at a capitated rate, meaning they receive $8.38 a month for each adult Medi-Cal patient under their care, whether the person needs to see them or not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s under-reimbursed care and it still will be,\u201d said Dr. Josephine Soliz, an Oxnard family doctor. \u201cBut it will be less under-reimbursed.\u201d\n\nGold Coast leaders have other plans, too. They want to pay off $7.2 million borrowed from the county, build financial reserves and launch projects designed to improve care for new members.\n\nThe quality-care initiative is tied in part to the state\u2019s requirement regarding funding of care for the 59,000 people who joined Medi-Cal because of the program\u2019s expansion. All but 15 percent of the new revenue must be spent directly on health care or it could be lost.\n\n\u201cIf you spend less than 85 percent of your total reimbursement on health care, you would have to return the difference,\u201d said Bob Freeman, CEO of a similar Medi-Cal plan that covers Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.\n\nFreeman\u2019s CenCal Health organization has seen its revenue grow from a surge of new members eligible because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNew members in many regions have been slow initially to use their new insurance, meaning plans are being paid more money from the government than they need in order to cover the expense of care.\n\nThat could change at any moment, Freeman said, noting that it is too early to assess finances.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not counting the money as ours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of holding it.\u201d\n\nGold Coast leaders said they\u2019re currently spending about 40 to 50 percent of their new Medi-Cal expansion revenue on health care, far below the 85 percent benchmark. The exact makeup of any new programs that funnel more money to care is unknown. But they could include measures aimed at reducing emergency room visits or helping people navigate a complicated health care system.\n\nThere are reasons for caution. Watson said state leaders already are planning a rate change that, if approved by the federal government, could mean 20 percent less in reimbursement.\n\nWatson said the plan is being conservative. Even the raise for doctors will be reviewed in six months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a temporary situation and we know it,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Medi-Cal plan's revenue surges because of health care reform", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/medi-cal-plans-revenue-surges-because-of-health-care-reform-ep-932622034-348629601.html", "image": {"width": 481, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/goldcoast_13271748_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Once mired in a $6 million hole that threatened to jeopardize its future, the Gold Coast Health Plan now has so much money that its leaders need to find ways to spend it.", "title": "Medi-Cal plan's revenue surges because of health care reform"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/goldcoast_13271748_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Medi-Cal plan's revenue surges because of health care reform", "description": "Once mired in a $6 million hole that threatened to jeopardize its future, the Gold Coast Health Plan now has so much money that its leaders need to find ways to spend it.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf347\"", "article_summary": "But they could include measures aimed at reducing emergency room visits or helping people navigate a complicated health care system.\nAll but 15 percent of the new revenue must be spent directly on health care or it could be lost.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of holding it.\u201dGold Coast leaders said they\u2019re currently spending about 40 to 50 percent of their new Medi-Cal expansion revenue on health care, far below the 85 percent benchmark.\nThe deficit prompted officials from the California Department of Health Care Services to mandate changes, threatening to pull the plug on Gold Coast if edicts weren\u2019t followed.\nFreeman\u2019s CenCal Health organization has seen its revenue grow from a surge of new members eligible because of the Affordable Care Act."}
