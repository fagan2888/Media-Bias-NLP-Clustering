Paul LePage.\n\nThe 85-64 vote was largely along party lines and came one day after the Republican-controlled Senate narrowly endorsed using federal funds to purchase coverage for more low-income Mainers. The measure, however, appears headed for a sixth-straight defeat by LePage, who has argued expansion would cost the state more money down the line.\n\nThe bill \u2013 sponsored by two moderate Republican senators, Tom Saviello of Wilton and Roger Katz of Augusta \u2013 would use the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace to expand Medicaid but require beneficiaries to pay small premiums for their insurance. Such a \u201cprivate option\u201d model has been adopted in several states where Republicans and Democrats share control of the government.\n\nExpanding Medicaid would provide coverage to more than 70,000 Mainers who currently earn between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the expansion costs through 2016, with the federal share declining to 90 percent by 2020. Thirty-one other states have expanded Medicaid as part of the health care law.\n\nThe two sides cited their own statistics and estimates about whether expansion will save or cost Maine money in the long run.\n\nThe outcome in the Democratic-controlled House was known long before Wednesday\u2019s vote. In fact, lawmakers appeared at times to be going through the motions as they read the same exact speeches \u2013 and asked the same exact questions \u2013 as their Senate colleagues had just one day earlier.\n\nBut there were also personal, emotional pleas on the issue.\n\nRep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, recalled how his mother incurred more than $1 million in medical bills for the multiple surgeries, chemotherapy and other treatments for her cancer diagnosis. McLean said his mother fortunately had good insurance, but questioned how someone without coverage \u2013 who was not able to receive preventive care and screenings \u2013 could afford such bills?\n\n\u201cSo many in this state don\u2019t have access to care and they suffer for it,\u201d McLean said.\n\nCancer survivor Rep. Denise Harlow, D-Portland, recalled meeting a woman with Stage 4 ovarian cancer who didn\u2019t have insurance while they were both hospitalized.\n\n\u201cI remember laying in bed that day and thinking, \u2018Why me?\u2019 and not \u2018Why did I have cancer?\u2019 but \u2018Why me? Why do I have insurance when this other person doesn\u2019t'\u201d Harlow said. \u201cMy life is no more valuable than the young woman down the hall.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also cited the surge in heroin and opiate addictions as another reason to expand Medicaid, saying it would help more people receive drug treatment. But Rep. Richard Pickett, a Dixfield Republican and former law enforcement officer, pointed out that neighboring New Hampshire expanded Medicaid and is struggling with an even worse opiate epidemic than in Maine.\n\nRepublicans were claiming victory Wednesday night by the fact that the bill failed to pass by veto-proof margins.\n\n\u201cNo matter how they try to dress it up, Medicaid expansion would be a fiscal disaster for Maine,\u201d Rep. Deb Sanderson, R-Chelsea, said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to look any farther than states like Vermont, Illinois, New Mexico and Kentucky who expanded Medicaid and saw enrollment soar past their projections, blowing massive holes in their budgets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the sixth time that a proposed expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act appears headed for a veto by the governor.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "This is the sixth time that a proposed expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act appears headed for a veto by the governor.", "title": "Maine House passes Medicaid expansion, but not by veto-proof margin - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-13T21:15:05-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/13/maine-house-passes-medicaid-expansion-but-not-by-veto-proof-margin/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is the sixth time that a proposed expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act appears headed for a veto by the governor.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Maine House passes Medicaid expansion, but not by veto-proof margin - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "tag": "Medicaid expansion", "published_time": "2016-04-13T21:04:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T21:15:05-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo matter how they try to dress it up, Medicaid expansion would be a fiscal disaster for Maine,\u201d Rep.
