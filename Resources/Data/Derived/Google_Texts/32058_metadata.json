Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) likened members of the Republican Party to \u2018confederates\u2019 for their stance on the ongoing fiscal battles in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAnchor Ashleigh Banfield asked Rangel about his thoughts on a House GOP proposal that emerged Tuesday to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, and the New York Democrat answered by praising Senate leadership instead, casting aside concerns about rancor between the two chambers or parties and taking a direct shot at a \u2018handful\u2019 of Republicans.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a question of the House and Senate differing. This not even a question of Republicans and Democrats differing,\u201d Rangel said. \u201cThis is all about a handful of people who got elected as Republicans that want to bring down our government. You can see it in the streets. You can see where they\u2019re coming from. And the same way they fought as confederates, they want to bring down the government and reform it.\u201d\n\nStunned, Banfield stopped Rangel and asked him to clarify if he was using that label for Tea Party members of Congress.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this \u2014 if you take a look at the states that they control, take a look at the Dixiecrats, see how they went over to the Republican Party \u2026\u201d\n\nBanfield interrupted the New York representative again.\n\n\u201cMichelle Bachmann is not from Dixie! What are you talking about?\u201d Banfield exclaimed, referring to the Minnesota Republican.\n\nThe Democratic Party was squarely behind the Confederate States of America, and whatever irrelevant point that Rangel was making about the South turning red during the latter portion of the 20th century, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his band of \u2018defunders\u2019 are not the ilk of Jefferson Davis, nor are they using his union-splitting tactics to get their way. They and their policies have nothing to do with the Confederacy, in belief or approach.\n\n(h/t The DC)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "During an appearance on CNN today, Rep.
