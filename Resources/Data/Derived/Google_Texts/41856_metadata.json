The Trust changed its name to the AVMA Group Health & Life Insurance Trust in 1986 to differentiate itself from the AVMA Professional Liability Insurance Trust, now the AVMA PLIT.\n\nThe GHLIT added coverage over the years in areas such as dental, vision, long-term care, professional overhead expense, and maternity. Because of the Affordable Care Act, the Trust had to discontinue directly offering health insurance after 2013, developing a health insurance exchange instead.\n\nThe new name, AVMA Life, and the new brand reflect the Trust\u2019s continuing commitment to offering insurance for AVMA members\u2019 personal lives.\n\nBehind the name\n\nLibby Wallace, chief executive officer of AVMA Life, said almost 28,000 AVMA members have one or more lines of coverage through the Trust, for a total of about 69,500 lines of coverage. The Trust lost only about 4,000 AVMA members following the loss of health insurance.\n\nThe trustees who oversee AVMA Life are nine AVMA members and one AVMA staff member. They work with New York Life Insurance Co., underwriter of the Trust, to develop products for veterinarians. Wallace said the trustees evaluated all the products that the Trust provides while they were working with 88 Brand Partners on the new name and brand.\n\nSurveys and focus groups with AVMA members indicated confusion about the name AVMA Group Health & Life Insurance Trust in light of the loss of health insurance. Wallace said the new name helps bring clarity. The new brand provides a fresh look and feel, she said.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to the membership,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWe want to be there to help support them in any way that we can.\u201d\n\nThe research with AVMA members found that they see the Trust as the expert in insurance. They want the flexibility to change plans with life changes, and they want plans customized for veterinarians. They seek guidance and education on coverage. They see the Trust as responsive to their needs.\n\n\n\nWallace said AVMA Life is focusing on what AVMA members want, even beyond insurance. She said the branding process \u201cgave us an opportunity to look at the Trust and where could we bring more value for members.\u201d\n\nThe Trust has updated its disability insurance, for example, and added insurance for critical illness and life insurance for seniors that includes an early payment benefit for certain medical conditions. The insurance package for members of the Student AVMA now includes a $300 benefit toward rabies vaccination.\n\nWallace said AVMA Life is exploring services such as refinancing of student debt and providing an advocate program for costly or complex medical claims.\n\nThe new brand\n\nMichael D. McGuire, president and chief executive officer of 88 Brand Partners, said research with AVMA members found confusion and frustration over the loss of health insurance\u2014with some members thinking that the Trust was defunct\u2014and confusion between the two insurance trusts.\n\nWhile the AVMA PLIT offers insurance for veterinarians\u2019 professional lives, McGuire said, AVMA Life provides products to make veterinarians\u2019 personal lives better. He said, \u201cThese are products that are unique to veterinarians, but we recognize that veterinarians also have rich personal lives.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the AVMA Life brand follows the launch of the new PLIT brand during the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference in January 2015 and the launch of the new AVMA brand during the AVMA Annual Convention in July 2015. All three organizations worked with 88 Brand Partners.\n\n\u201cThe AVMA Life brand is much more lifestyle-based,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cThe colors tend to be a little bit warmer and richer. The photography is a great juxtaposition between photography of veterinarians in practice situations as well as in personal situations.\u201d\n\nThe new AVMA Life logo is in the same font and style as the new AVMA PLIT logo. The AVMA PLIT logo is green with the tag line \u201cProtecting you through it all.\u201d The AVMA Life logo is orange with the tag line \u201cVeterinarian Inspired Coverage.\u201d\n\nThrough the new brand, AVMA Life aims to share these messages with AVMA members:\n\nWe are your trusted team of insurance experts and experienced veterinarians.\n\nWe deliver the most tailored and relevant personal insurance program available to veterinarians.\n\nSo, you can always be confident you\u2019re supported by the coverage and expertise you need as a veterinary professional.\n\nBehind the tag line\n\nThe Trust always can improve how it communicates and represents itself, Dr. MacAllister said. She said the new name of AVMA Life really represents what the Trust does, is easier to remember than GHLIT, and feels more modern.\n\nDr. MacAllister likes the new tag line, \u201cVeterinarian Inspired Coverage,\u201d even more than she likes the new name. She said, \u201cWe learned that veterinary involvement on the part of the trustees in the development and management of this program was critically important to our members.\u201d\n\nAs an AVMA Life trustee, Dr. MacAllister has interacted with AVMA members in various circumstances, from submitting insurance applications to submitting disability claims. She always had a sense that \u201cthey knew that AVMA was in their corner.\u201d\n\nAdditional information about the new AVMA Life brand is available at www.MyAVMALife.com .
