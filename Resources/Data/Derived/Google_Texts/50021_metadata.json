But according to a Vine uncovered by BuzzFeed, Gilbow had actually participated in some racially-charged singing at SAE herself. Watch that here.\n\nGilbow recently appeared alongside friend Barry Switzer\u2014an SAE alum and former OU football coach\u2014to insist that nothing like this had ever happened:\n\n\u201cDid you ever get any indication there was anything like this going on?\u201d News 9's Kelly Ogle asked. \u201cNo, no, no. Never heard the song,\u201d Gilbow responded.\n\nSwitzer maintained that the infamous video was not representative of the brothers at SAE:\n\nI spent some time over here, and I know what they're like. I wouldn't put up with that crap, and they don't either, and they don't believe in it.\n\nIt's tough to accept his evaluation, however, given that he's sitting next to a liar. The evidence so far suggests that the latest (and final) incarnation of OU's SAE had serious problems with racial insensitivity, and may have illegally discriminated against black applicants to the fraternity. The national organization was right to kick them to the curb.\n\nThe actions of OU President David Boren are less wise. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Hans Bader and The Washington Post's Eugene Volokh have pushed back against Boren's notion that he has any right to expel students for offensive but constitutionally-protected speech. Volokh writes:\n\nOklahoma University president David Boren said, \u201cIf I\u2019m allowed to, these students will face suspension or expulsion.\u201d But he is not, I think, allowed to do that. 1. First, racist speech is constitutionally protected, just as is expression of other contemptible ideas; and universities may not discipline students based on their speech. That has been the unanimous view of courts that have considered campus speech codes and other campus speech restrictions \u2014 see here for some citations. The same, of course, is true for fraternity speech, racist or otherwise; see Iota Xi Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity v. George Mason University (4th Cir. 1993). (I set aside the separate question of student speech that is evaluated as part of coursework or class participation, which necessary must be evaluated based on its content; this speech clearly doesn\u2019t qualify.) 2. Likewise, speech doesn\u2019t lose its constitutionally protection just because it refers to violence \u2014 \u201cYou can hang him from a tree,\u201d \u201cthe capitalists will be the first ones up against the wall when the revolution comes,\u201d \u201cby any means necessary\u201d with pictures of guns, \u201capostates from Islam should be killed.\u201d 3. To be sure, in specific situations, such speech might fall within a First Amendment exception. One example is if it is likely to be perceived as a \u201ctrue threat\u201d of violence (e.g., saying \u201capostates from Islam will be killed\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll hang you from a tree\u201d to a particular person who will likely perceive it as expressing the speaker\u2019s intention to kill him); but that\u2019s not the situation here, where the speech wouldn\u2019t have been taken by any listener as a threat against him or her. Another is if it intended to solicit a criminal act, or to create a conspiracy to commit a criminal act, but, vile as the \u201chang him from a tree\u201d is, neither of these exceptions are applicable here, either.\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education makes the same point:\n\nAs a private organization, the SAE national fraternity is free to punish the chapter, as it has done. Other citizens and groups are free to refuse to associate with the fraternity members based on their expression, and students, faculty, and administrators may of course condemn it. If the expression itself is evidence of other unlawful activity, such activity may be investigated. But the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled time and time again that government institutions like the University of Oklahoma may not punish people for expression protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBy all means, private entities can punish racism whatever way they see fit. And if SAE engaged in illegal, racially discriminatory practices, it can be punished for that. But students can't be formally punished for their statements\u2014no matter how shockingly offensive those statements are. And as I noted previously, expulsion is the exact wrong way to confront racist attitudes in this situation, if the goal is to educate these students about why their words were grossly insensitive.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "First Amendment experts react to the University of Oklahoma news.", "title": "Second SAE Video: Even the 79-Year-Old House Mother Was a Racist", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/10/second-sae-video-even-the-79-year-old-ho", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14260018323561.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First Amendment experts react to the University of Oklahoma news.", "title": "Second SAE Video: Even the 79-Year-Old House Mother Was a Racist", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14260018323561.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-03-10T16:20:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbec6\"", "article_summary": "The same, of course, is true for fraternity speech, racist or otherwise; see Iota Xi Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity v.
