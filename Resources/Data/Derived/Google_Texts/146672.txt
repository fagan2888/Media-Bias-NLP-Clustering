"I am having so much fun!" Patricia Lelie said as she stood amid the gourd artwork she created in the studio where she is an artist-in-residence at Studio Channel Islands Art Center in Camarillo.

"I just kind of fell into the gourds," she said. "It was never my intention to go in this direction."

Lelie will be selling her work in the upcoming Holiday Art Market at SCIART. "Harmony & Mirth" is the theme for this year's event, which will run from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Dec. 5 at 2222 Ventura Blvd., Camarillo.
