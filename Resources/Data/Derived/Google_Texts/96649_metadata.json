Since they don\u2019t ask about citizenship, most hospitals do not track how much it is costing them to care for that cohort of the population.\n\nInstead, said Danny Chun, a spokesman for the Illinois Hospital Association, those costs are lumped into bad debt.\n\n[See also: Stopping the rise in hospital bad debt]\n\n\u201cFor accounting purposes, if a person does not provide financial information and it turns out they can\u2019t pay, that is accounted for as bad debt,\u201d said Chun.
