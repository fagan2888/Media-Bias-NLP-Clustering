CNN's Chris Cuomo reports.\n\nBritney Mathis, 19, along with her mom and her sister, work hard at a German restaurant \u2013 the Kaiserhof Restaurant and Wunderbar \u2013 in Montgomery, Texas.\n\nThat was, until, she went to the hospital, for what seemed like a harmless rash.\n\n\"I went to the hospital and found out it was my blood clotting,\" Mathis told CNN affiliate KHOU. \"So, they wanted to keep me and do CAT scans and MRIs and the next day they came in and told me I had a tumor.\"\n\nBrittany already lost her father to the same type of cancer in 2000. What's worse is, she had to stop treatment, because she doesn't have insurance, or the money to pay for it.\n\nThat was, until the owner of her restaurant, Michael De Beyer, suggested something extraordinary.\n\nHe's decided to sell his business, just to pay for her care.\n\n\"I just can't be standing by and doing nothing,\" said De Beyer. \"I have to try something because it's not right.\"\n\nWe should note that De Beyer has another motivation here\u2013 he's been looking for an excuse to retire for years and spend more time with his family.\n\nThe restaurant could fetch as much as $2 million.\n\nIf you would like to help Brittany, you can make a donation at any Woodforest National Bank. The account is in the name Michael De Beyer. Account # 135437895\n\nSee full story HERE and if you have #GoodStuff news, let us know!
