Colleges employ hundreds of thousands of part-time instructors as a way to contain costs. Adjuncts are especially numerous in community colleges and regional public universities, which are squeezed by tight state budgets. Experts say most adjuncts don\u2019t get health coverage through colleges.\n\nWorried about possible expansion of health-care expenses, community colleges in Virginia and elsewhere have imposed caps on the number of classes part-time instructors may teach. In doing so, the colleges aim to minimize their costs under a new federal mandate that requires large employers to offer health insurance to personnel who work 30 hours a week or more.\n\nRules the Obama administration announced this week say that a \u201creasonable\u201d way to tally hours for part-timers is to assume that they work an hour and 15 minutes on activities such as grading assignments and preparing lessons for every hour spent on classroom teaching. The administration also declared that instructors should be given credit for time they are required to spend in \u201coffice hours\u201d for students or in faculty meetings.\n\nThe rules indicated that more federal guidance could come in the future and that colleges could determine other ways to count the number of hours adjuncts work.\n\nMaria Maisto, president and executive director of New Faculty Majority, an adjunct advocacy group based in Ohio, said she was pleased by the rules because she thinks they set \u201ca floor, rather than a ceiling\u201d for tallying the hours that part-timers work. She said the rules will spotlight what advocates consider often poor working conditions for the instructional staff that form the backbone of many public institutions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing exactly what we wanted, to force the conversation back onto campuses,\u201d Maisto said.\n\nDavid Baime, senior vice president for government relations and research at the American Association of Community Colleges, said his group was happy with the regulation. \u201cWe believe that in most cases, it will not result in required additional health-care expenditures for our institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nExactly how much work instructors perform outside the classroom varies significantly from subject to subject, depending on the number of students in a class and their preparation. \u201cThat is something that\u2019s really almost impossible to estimate,\u201d said Dana Wood, an adjunct instructor of English as a second language at Prince George\u2019s Community College. \u201cSome classes take more time than others.\u201d\n\nWood said he hopes colleges will not cut the amount of work available to part-timers who are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThat is what happened last year to many adjunct faculty members in Virginia. The state\u2019s community college system employed 7,440 part-time instructors in fall 2013, far more than its 2,852 full-time faculty members.\n\nIn May, under orders from state leaders to contain health-care costs for part-time employees, the community college system set new limits on the course load of its adjunct faculty. They were allowed to teach no more than seven credit hours in the summer semester and 10 each in the fall and spring semesters. Credit hours are academic units that roughly correspond to the number of hours a class is in session each week.\n\nGlenn DuBois, chancellor of the 23-college system, told part-time faculty at the time that \u201cmaximum semester credit hours cannot be exceeded under any circumstance; and no waiver can be granted for this policy.\u201d Officials estimate that three-quarters of the system\u2019s adjunct instructors were unaffected.\n\nKevin Pace, 35, an adjunct music instructor at Northern Virginia Community College, saw his course load and pay drop significantly as a result. Pace said he has scrambled to find additional work to support himself and his wife, including offering private guitar and bass lessons and teaching part time in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of teachers move back in with their parents,\u201d Pace said. \u201cThey\u2019re in their 40s. Some people have lost their homes. It\u2019s awful.\u201d Pace said adjunct faculty deserve better pay.\n\nIt is unclear whether Virginia community colleges will ease the limits on adjunct course loads as a result of the new rules from the Obama administration. It appears that faculty members teaching 10 credit hours a semester would be averaging less than 30 hours a week using the new federal definition.\n\nThe new rules \u201cmay result in some adjuncts seeing their hours go back up a bit,\u201d said Steven Bloom, director of federal relations for the American Council on Education, an advocacy group representing college presidents.\n\nJeffrey J. Kraus, a spokesman for Virginia community colleges, said system officials \u201cwill be analyzing\u201d the new rules.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Obama administration rules will not necessarily require colleges to provide part-timers with health care.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216916378", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New Obama administration rules will not necessarily require colleges to provide part-timers with health care.", "title": "New federal health-care rules define workload of part-time college instructors", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/new-federal-health-care-rules-define-workload-of-part-time-college-instructors/2014/02/11/6b1b29c4-9345-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wpnick"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "higher education, higher ed, education, adjuncts affordable care act, adjuncts aca, adjunct obamacare, obama rules adjuncts, obama adjuncts health care, adjunct professors health care, adjunct faculty ACA, adjunct faculty work hours health care, northern virginia community college, prince george's community college, montgomery college", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216916378"}, "news_keywords": "higher education, higher ed, education, adjuncts affordable care act, adjuncts aca, adjunct obamacare, obama rules adjuncts, obama adjuncts health care, adjunct professors health care, adjunct faculty ACA, adjunct faculty work hours health care, northern virginia community college, prince george's community college, montgomery college", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "6b1b29c4-9345-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3585\"", "article_summary": "New rules for the Affordable Care Act spell out for the first time a federal method to define the workload of part-time college instructors, but the formula will not necessarily require schools to provide the instructors with health-care coverage.\nWorried about possible expansion of health-care expenses, community colleges in Virginia and elsewhere have imposed caps on the number of classes part-time instructors may teach.\nThe state\u2019s community college system employed 7,440 part-time instructors in fall 2013, far more than its 2,852 full-time faculty members.\nAdjuncts are especially numerous in community colleges and regional public universities, which are squeezed by tight state budgets.\nColleges employ hundreds of thousands of part-time instructors as a way to contain costs."}
