Greg Abbott speaks to reporters at Texas Public Policy Foundation's grand opening of new building on April 21st, 2015\n\nThe Big Conversation\n\nThe decision earlier this week by Gov. Greg Abbott to get involved in the controversy over a planned military exercise taking place across several Southwestern states continues to draw comment.\n\nThe Tribune's Patrick Svitek reports that Abbott's move \u2014 asking in a letter that the Texas State Guard monitor the exercise \u2014 didn't seem to faze military experts. \"It seems like a lot of ado about nothing\" was the reaction of one Marine Corps Reserve officer.\n\nAmong politicians, the reaction was more harsh, whether from the White House or from a former GOP Texas House member. Former state Rep. Todd Smith, R-Euless, wrote Abbott a letter, Svitek wrote, in which he said Abbott was \"pandering to idiots\" and that he was \"horrified that I have to choose between the possibility that my Governor actually believes this stuff and the possibility that my Governor doesn't have the backbone to stand up to those who do.\"\n\nAnd former Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst wrote in an op-ed in The Dallas Morning News that U.S. soldiers \"love their country and they\u2019re willing to die to defend your liberties. Unfortunately, some Texans have projected their legitimate concerns about the competence and trustworthiness of President Barack Obama onto these noble warriors. This must stop ... Instead of viewing our hard-working troops with suspicion or greeting them with insults, let\u2019s increase our prayers for them and their families as we send a message of welcome and encouragement.\"\n\nAbbott's office is responding by saying his action was just a way to address concerns being raised by the public and that he rejects criticism that he is showing distrust of the military.\n\nTrib Must-Reads\n\nUT's Powers Touts Gains, Has No Regrets, by Matthew Watkins \u2014 Outgoing UT-Austin President Bill Powers said this week that he felt he always acted in the best interest of the school and is proud of the reforms he helped implement.
