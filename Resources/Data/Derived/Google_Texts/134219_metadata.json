Saul suggests that, what they\u2019ve got on their hands is \u201can Old Yeller-type situation,\u201d in which the loyal mutt (ie. Jesse) shows up rabid one day and must be put down by dutiful little Timmy (ie. Walt). It was the prettiest cover line since \u201cgoing to Belize.\u201d\n\nThis episode allowed each character to fantasize and consider next moves. After Jesse poured gasoline around Walt\u2019s house but was interrupted by Hank before setting fire, we get a momentary pause in the action. Taking a breather in a hotel, Sklyer tells Walt she didn\u2019t believe his gas pump lie for a minute, and demands he get serious. Her suggested resolution to the Jesse Pinkman problem is Lady Macbeth-cold \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019ve come this far for us, what\u2019s one more?\u201d \u2014 every bit as cold as Saul\u2019s rabid dog suggestion. Walt firmly rejects it. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he says, referring to his paternal feelings for Jesse even while playing him.\n\nMeanwhile, Marie vents her anger to her therapist and weighs murderous poisoning options. Violence can only make a bad situation worse, the shrink warns, foreshadowing the inevitable really bad mess to come. And Hank thinks playing by the book, getting Jesse on video and having him wear a wire while confronting Walt may be a solution. Of course, it\u2019s not. Walt is smarter and luckier than they are and besides, Jesse says, not for the first time, he\u2019s the Devil.\n\nJesse balks when he sees what looks like a thuggish bald man hovering near Walt. (We see later the man is simply \u201cDaddy\u201d to a little girl in the plaza.) He promises Walt he\u2019s going to come after him. Which forces Walt to make the call to Todd (Jesse Plemons), his latest meth cook trainee and dutiful fixer who previously helped him get rid of Mike Ehrmantraut. Todd was last seen bragging at a coffee shop about his connection with the meth king, hanging with his neo-Nazi pals.\n\nSeveral great visuals: another inside shot of liquid flowing through a tube (this time cleaning fluid for the gas); the \u201cDeadwood\u201d DVD set on Hank and Marie\u2019s bookshelf; Jesse drinking coffee from a DEA mug at Hank\u2019s home; Walt as Santa Claus in family photos, and Walt once again sitting by a pool (at the hotel) thinking through his dilemma. It was a gripping episode giving each character a moment to reflect on who they want to avenge, who they actually want to protect. Nearly everyone seems rabid. Except Junior. And here we had one more heart-wrenching instance of Walt\u2019s loyal son innocently worrying about dear dad\u2019s cancer.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Breaking Bad,Jesse Pinkman,Old Yeller,Rabid Dog,Vince Gilligan,Walter White", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "\"Breaking Bad\" season 5, episode 12, races toward the series finale as each character thinks about who to avenge, and how.", "title": "'Breaking Bad's' 'Rabid Dog'-- an Old Yeller-type situation", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2013/09/01/breaking-bad-an-old-yeller-type-situation/16353/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/files/2013/09/walt-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "\"Breaking Bad\" season 5, episode 12, races toward the series finale as each character thinks about who to avenge, and how.", "title": "\u201cBreaking Bad\u2019s\u201d \u201cRabid Dog\u201d \u2014 an Old Yeller-type situation", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2013/09/01/breaking-bad-an-old-yeller-type-situation/16353/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/files/2013/09/walt-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@ostrowdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "\"Breaking Bad\" season 5, episode 12, races toward the series finale as each character thinks about who to avenge, and how."}, "article_summary": "Violence can only make a bad situation worse, the shrink warns, foreshadowing the inevitable really bad mess to come.\nSaul suggests that, what they\u2019ve got on their hands is \u201can Old Yeller-type situation,\u201d in which the loyal mutt (ie.\nDemonstrating the parallel storytelling from dual viewpoints that \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d does so well, tonight\u2019s episode, \u201cRabid Dog,\u201d also offered one of the great Vince Gilligan hook lines, another gem from Saul\u2019s bank of wicked euphemisms.\nJesse) shows up rabid one day and must be put down by dutiful little Timmy (ie.\nIt was the prettiest cover line since \u201cgoing to Belize.\u201dThis episode allowed each character to fantasize and consider next moves."}
