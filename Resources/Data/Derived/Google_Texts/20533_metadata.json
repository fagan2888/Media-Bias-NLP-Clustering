Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, and Senate President Bill Cadman, R-Colorado Springs are key players in this year's legislative sesson. (CPR News) The Colorado legislative session kicked off Wednesday morning, with speeches from party leaders that framed their priorities for the coming year.\n\nThe largely ceremonial opening day was the start of a 120-day session, where lawmakers will face difficult budget issues -- despite a strong economy, the state faces a budget shortfall made all the more thorny by laws around constitutionally-required taxpayer refunds.\n\nThe session will also see debates over affordable housing, health insurance coverage, women\u2019s reproductive rights, end of life decisions among other issues..\n\nAnd of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Colorado legislative session without marijuana bills and efforts to get rid of red light cameras that many drivers curse while zooming through intersections.\n\nPrize Fight Over Hospital Provider Fee\n\nThe biggest fight will be over a Democratic proposal to reclassify the hospital provider fee. This fee was set up by the Legislature in 2009 to allow the state to obtain federal matching funds, which ultimately expanded Medicaid and other health care options for Coloradans. The fees assessed from the money hospitals collect from patients account for about $700 million in annual revenue for the state.\n\nRight now, the fee is subject to revenue restrictions tied to the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights \u2013 which requires the state to issue tax refunds when revenue exceeds the rate of inflation and population growth. And the hospital provider fees are contributing to a budget situation where revenues will exceed the TABOR cap, resulting in $156 million in refunds on taxpayers\u2019 2015 returns.\n\nRelated:\n\nSo, taxpayers will get small refund checks while funding for K-12, higher education and road projects are cut.\n\n\u201cI would say our budget is our biggest challenge this year,\u201d House Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst said. \u201cWe have a budget that is being hampered by a TABOR mess \u2026 where we cannot invest money from our increased revenues from our great economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same economic realities that forced us to cut our budget in lean times should be blessing us today with the ability to invest for the long-term prosperity in our state,\" she said on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats \u2013 backed by Gov. John Hickenlooper, who has made this his top legislative push this year \u2013 hope to move the hospital provider fee out from under TABOR mandates and into a TABOR-exempt enterprise fund. This, Democrats say, would free up hundreds of millions of dollars in a budget that would otherwise experience a shortfall.\n\nBut Republicans so far are saying good luck with that.\n\n\u201cUnless we can provide a constitutionally sound proposal, it leaves us in a pretty tough place to support it,\u201d said Republican Senate President Bill Cadman of Colorado Springs.\n\nCadman cites a legislative legal staff analysis that indicates the Democrats\u2019 proposal is unworkable \u2013 a non-binding opinion that Hickenlooper budget director Henry Sobanet thinks is \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d\n\nRepublicans say Democrats created their own budget mess by over-spending in years they were in charge at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to spend and spend and spend and now we\u2019re putting ourselves into a position where, no we can\u2019t pay for everything,\u201d said House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso, R-Loveland.\n\n\u201cThe math is simple,\" he added Wednesday. \"And if we don\u2019t prioritize our dollars we will continue to have this same conversation year in and year out.\u201d\n\nCadman says much of the budgetary woes can be attributed to Medicaid expenses. He says the current Medicaid system is unsustainable, with its 350 percent growth over the last 15 years. Much of the growth has come in recent years, on the heels of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which allowed for more people to access Medicaid.\n\nCadman says he will look into ways to rein in Medicaid spending, including a possible revival of legislation that asks Medicaid users to pay a small co-pay.\n\n\u201c[It is] so disproportionate to everything else in the budget,\u201d Cadman said of Medicaid spending. \u201cIt creates an immense amount of pressure on everything else.\u201d\n\nRepublicans will also make a push for increased transportation funding, something they\u2019ve fallen short of in recent sessions.\n\nDelgrosso expects his members will propose multiple transportation funding bills, one of which will be another effort to seek voter-approval for $3.5 billion in bonds for highway project funding. The same effort failed last year, out of concerns from the governor\u2019s office and the Colorado Department of Transportation that repayment logistics would actually negate any funding gains made.\n\nDifferent Tacks For Affordable Housing\n\nDemocrats plan to unveil a package of bills to address affordable housing \u2013 a major issue in Colorado, as the state experiences large and fast population growth, which has contributed to soaring rents.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether you are in an urban area, or even in some of our rural areas of the state, housing prices continue to skyrocket,\u201d said House Majority Leader Crisanta Duran, D-Denver.\n\nDemocrats will seek funding to create more affordable housing options around the state. They will also unveil a proposal that would create a first-time homebuyer\u2019s savings account program, a tax-free account that can be used for new home down payments or closing costs.\n\nBut Republicans argue if Democrats are serious about increasing affordable housing options for Coloradans, they will back efforts to pass condominium construction defects reform legislation.\n\nThis is a perennial effort to rein in lawsuits that target home builders when construction defects occur. Republicans say current laws have led to a chilling effect on developers, who are not building condos out of fear of ending up in court. This has caused many Colorado cities to enact their own construction defects laws.\n\n\u201cThe environment there has become so hostile, there\u2019s nothing for sale in that entry-level [housing market],\u201d Cadman said.\n\nBut Democrats say laws should protect homeowners from shoddy construction. And they argue there is no evidence Republican proposals would do anything to create more affordable housing to begin with \u2013 which is why last year\u2019s attempt failed.\n\n\"As far I\u2019m concerned that [bill] did little to help the average Coloradan with affordable housing, the high cost of housing,\u201d Hullinghorst said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Funding A Target\n\nReproductive rights issues always come up at the Legislature, but there will be increased focus this year, given the recent mass-shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs, where three people were killed and several others injured. The alleged gunman, Robert Dear, made statements in court that indicate his motives were political.\n\nThe reproductive health provider has been targeted by conservatives over allegations that they have profited from the trafficking of fetal body parts \u2013 something the group flatly denies.\n\nRepublicans have concerns over funding received by Planned Parenthood\u2019s Colorado chapter, even though the only state funding the group receives is in the form of Medicaid reimbursements.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to believe that we send them millions of dollars and not think that we\u2019re providing some indirect funding,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Lundberg, R-Berthoud, who heads a Republican study group that has looked into Planned Parenthood operations.\n\nCathy Alderman, a recent spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado, says the group is undeterred by recent events and plans to introduce legislation to expand access to contraceptives. And there may be legislation to increase penalties for a person convicted of blocking access to health services that include abortions.\n\nWill We See Compromise On Other Issues?\n\nMarijuana bills covering a range of issues will also be introduced this session. They could include legislation to address what constitutes as private marijuana consumption and to clarify other pot laws, including how private marijuana clubs can operate.\n\nAnd efforts to curb photo radar technology, including red-light cameras, will once again be debated. Some argue the technology saves and leads to better driving habits. Others question their value and have constitutional due process concerns over their use.\n\nHickenlooper vetoed two red-light-related camera bills last session. Debate on this issue is one of the few inside the Capitol where political lines are blurred.\n\nBut, beyond red-light cameras, there may not be much bipartisanship this session. After all, 2016 is a presidential election year and many lawmakers will be running for re-election in November.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a little bit of partisan activity relative to an upcoming election,\u201d Hullinghorst said. \u201cBut I fully believe that we have some important initiatives we\u2019ll be able to work with [Republicans] on. And that\u2019s probably the way we\u2019ll have to do it or they won\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\nSo, will consensus be reached on important issues?\n\n\u201cI think this session can be as good as both chambers want to make it,\u201d said Sen. Ellen Roberts, D-Durango, who is part of Senate Republican leadership. \u201cWe still have policy challenges and we still hope to get things done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "description": "The budget will likely be a big issue during a session that will also see debates over housing and abortion.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"phone_number": "303-871-9191", "site_name": "Colorado Public Radio", "description": "The budget will likely be a big issue during a session that will also see debates over housing and abortion.", "title": "Taxes, Housing And More: Your Guide To The 2016 Legislative Session", "url": "http://www.cpr.org/news/story/taxes-housing-and-more-your-guide-2016-legislative-session", "region": "Colorado", "locality": "Centennial", "fax_number": "303-733-3319", "email": "info@cpr.org", "street-address": "7409 S Alton Ct", "postal-code": 80112, "type": "article", "image": "http://www.cpr.org/sites/default/files/images/leg-preview.jpg", "country-name": "United States"}, "fb": {"app_id": 851183531577419}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(CPR News) The Colorado legislative session kicked off Wednesday morning, with speeches from party leaders that framed their priorities for the coming year.\n\"As far I\u2019m concerned that [bill] did little to help the average Coloradan with affordable housing, the high cost of housing,\u201d Hullinghorst said.\nBut Republicans argue if Democrats are serious about increasing affordable housing options for Coloradans, they will back efforts to pass condominium construction defects reform legislation.\nAnd they argue there is no evidence Republican proposals would do anything to create more affordable housing to begin with \u2013 which is why last year\u2019s attempt failed.\nDemocrats will seek funding to create more affordable housing options around the state."}
