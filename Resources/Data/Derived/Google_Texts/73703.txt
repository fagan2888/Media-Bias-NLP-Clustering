More than 3,000 customers were left without electricity early Friday after a hit-and-run driver crashed into power poles in Sun Valley.

The power cut happened after a Chevrolet Avalanche smashed into several power poles and a fire hydrant in the 8100 block of Lankershim Boulevard at 1:09 a.m, LAPD said.

The driver fled the scene after the collision, police said, and has not yet been located.

"I thought it was like an earthquake or something. I was like 'what's going on?'" said Omar Bian, who works at nearby ProAudio, car stereo installation shop.

The sheared hydrant was shooting several hundred feet into the air, across downed power lines, which were still live, making access to the vehicle difficult.

Power was out for blocks in all directions.

Lankershim Boulevard was shut in both directions for several blocks while the power and water was shut off. Water gushing from the damaged hydrant was contained.

Around 1,900 of those customers affected had their power restored just after 6:10 a.m, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said.

Just more than 1,000 customers were without power by 10 a.m., and DWP said it would be early afternoon before it is completely restored.

A hazerdous materials clean-up was necessary, as the driver's truck leaked oil after striking the hydrant and poles.
