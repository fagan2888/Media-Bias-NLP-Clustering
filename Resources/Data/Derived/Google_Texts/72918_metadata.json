Be safe,\u2019 \u201d she said Friday. \u201cThe other bad girls \u2014 bad women \u2014 or the ones who like to be naughty, might go out and play and get hurt, and then, you know. But the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks. It\u2019s the same thing with guns. Guns don\u2019t kill people; people kill people. Alcohol doesn\u2019t get you drunk; you get yourself drunk.\u201d\n\nMs. Dash explained in her Facebook post that she, too, is a victim of abuse and that the comment was simply a \u201cfailed attempt at humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a failed attempt at humor about \u2018good girls\u2019 and \u2018naughty girls,\u2019 during my recent appearance on Outnumbered, I transitioned to the very serious issue of men blaming alcohol for their vile behavior,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLET ME BE CLEAR: I am a victim of physical and sexual abuse. My point was that there IS NO EXCUSE for a man taking advantage of women under any circumstances. I believe that these universities focusing on alcohol consumption as a means to stop evil behavior takes the focus off the real issue of the objectification of women and how that can be prevented.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News' Stacey Dash took to her Facebook page this week to apologize for a recent comment she made about \"bad girls\" in which critics accused her of blaming rape victims.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fox News\u2019 Stacey Dash took to her Facebook page this week to apologize for a recent comment she made about \u201cbad girls\u201d in which critics accused her of blaming rape victims.", "title": "Stacey Dash: \u2018Bad girls\u2019 comment was a \u2018failed attempt at humor\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/4/stacey-dash-bad-girls-comment-was-a-failed-attempt/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/08/19/ap974521799739.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/08/19/ap974521799739.jpg", "description": "Fox News' Stacey Dash took to her Facebook page this week to apologize for a recent comment she made about \"bad girls\" in which critics accused her of blaming rape victims.", "card": "summary", "title": "Stacey Dash: \u2018Bad girls\u2019 comment was a \u2018failed attem"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Stacey Dash, Facebook"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe other bad girls \u2014 bad women \u2014 or the ones who like to be naughty, might go out and play and get hurt, and then, you know.\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s ridiculous, and I think it\u2019s a good thing for the good girls \u2026 women to be told, \u2018Stay home.\nFox News\u2019 Stacey Dash took to her Facebook page this week to apologize for a recent comment she made about \u201cbad girls\u201d in which critics accused her of blaming rape victims.\nDash was criticized for comments she made last week about University of Virginia sororities being banned from attending fraternity events.\nDash explained in her Facebook post that she, too, is a victim of abuse and that the comment was simply a \u201cfailed attempt at humor.\u201d\u201cAfter a failed attempt at humor about \u2018good girls\u2019 and \u2018naughty girls,\u2019 during my recent appearance on Outnumbered, I transitioned to the very serious issue of men blaming alcohol for their vile behavior,\u201d she wrote."}
