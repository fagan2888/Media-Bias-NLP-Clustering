ESTES PARK, Colo.—Rocky Mountain National Park is closed and visitors have been escorted out of the park because of heavy rain there and flooding in neighboring Estes Park.

Trail Ridge Road through the park, the nation’s highest, continuous paved road, remained open to essential travel on Friday.

Superintendent Vaughn Baker said Friday residents of Estes Park on the park’s east side can use the road to evacuate. However, visibility on the road over the Continental Divide is low and drivers need to watch out for debris.

Storms that have knocked out roads and stranded residents have left the park with only limited telephone and Internet access.

Baker says all employees inside the park have been accounted for and some have been evacuated from park housing as a precaution.
