MNsure is simply the device used to go out and shop. It's very similar to a Travelocity website,\" said Layla Lang, insureDULUTH navigator.\n\nTo clear up those misconceptions, navigators will walk applicants like Pohjola step-by-step through the MNsure process and even get people enrolled with quality coverage.\n\n\"It's very important to stress, going in and setting up an account and walking through the application process, knowing they're not locked into anything, they don't want to get. It's simply getting information for them so they can make a decision about what's best for them and their family for their healthcare,\" said Lang.\n\nWith navigators available at 16 organizations across Duluth, including the Duluth Public Library, organizers say chances are there's assistance available in your neighborhood.\n\n\"If you're struggling on the website yourself, don't get frustrated call somebody for help. They will help you and it will alleviate a lot of stress and misunderstanding,\" said Lang.\n\nA coalition of helping hands that could take the pain out of finding quality Minnesota health care coverage.\n\nFor more information on the coalition InsureDULUTH or to find your nearest navigator click here.\n\nJeremy Brickley\n\nBio - Facebook - E-Mail", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KBJR 6 & Range 11 | KDLH 3", "description": "Duluth, MN (NNCNOW.com) - With the new Minnesota Health Insurance Marketplace, MNsure up and running, organizations across Duluth are opening their doors to offer free healthcare advice.", "title": "Unsure about MNsure?
