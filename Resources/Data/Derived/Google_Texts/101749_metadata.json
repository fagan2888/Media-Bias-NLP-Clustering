Frank Pavone of continuing to stonewall on financial reforms, and Dolan said he is cutting ties with his group, Priests for Life.\n\nIn a Nov. 20 letter to other US bishops, Dolan said he did not know if the Vatican would now step in to take action against the New York-based priest, who for years has angered various bishops by rejecting oversight of the organization by Church authorities and for refusing to sort out his group\u2019s troubled finances.\n\n\u201cMy requests of Father Pavone were clear and simple: One, that Priests for Life undergo a forensic audit; two, that a new, independent board be established to provide oversight and accountability,\u201d Dolan wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Catholic World News.\n\n\u201cAlthough Father Pavone initially assured me of his support, he did not cooperate. Frequent requests that he do so went unheeded. I finally asked him to comply by October 1st. He did not,\u201d Dolan wrote.\n\nDolan, who had been asked by the Vatican to help Pavone restructure Priests for Life, said in the letter that he has informed Rome that \u201cI am unable to fulfill their mandate, and want nothing further to do with the organization.\u201d\n\nThe cardinal said he had \u201cno idea\u201d what the Vatican intends to do now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement emailed to Religion News Service on Monday, the Staten Island-based Priests for Life rebuffed Dolan\u2019s criticisms, contending that the group has had \u201cclean\u201d audits for 15 years and saying the dispute is, in fact, \u201cabout control.\u201d\n\nPriests for Life is \u201cworking with the Vatican to fully implement all the Church\u2019s expectations,\u201d the group said, adding that the Vatican \u201chas been consistently supportive and favorable towards Priests for Life.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the Vatican and Pavone agree that \u201cit does not serve the needs of the Church or the cause of life to argue a matter in public that is still being worked out in private,\u201d and said it would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d to comment further.\n\n(Read Pavone\u2019s interview with Crux about Pope Francis in September.)\n\nDespite Pavone\u2019s ties to influential Church conservatives and his long-standing promotion of a cause that has topped the Church\u2019s agenda, there are signs that Pavone could be wearing out his welcome.\n\nFor decades, the outspoken Pavone has often clashed as much with his own bishops as he has with abortion-rights foes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Anti-abortion activist: Don't worry about Francis\n\nPavone had tense relations with Dolan\u2019s two immediate predecessors, the late Cardinal John O\u2019Connor and retired Cardinal Edward Egan, and in 2005 he moved to the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, where the bishop there promised him greater freedom. But Pavone\u2019s grand plans to build a $130 million seminary there went south; when a new bishop, Patrick Zurek, was installed in Amarillo in 2008, he demanded a full accounting of Pavone\u2019s $10 million annual budget, one of the largest among anti-abortion groups in the US.\n\nIn 2011, Zurek denounced Pavone\u2019s \u201cincorrigible defiance of my legitimate authority as his bishop\u201d and suspended his ministry. It then emerged that Priests for Life had been badly mismanaged, running an unsustainable $1.4 million deficit and failing to make key tax filings or allow proper financial oversight and safeguards.\n\nPavone moved back to New York, saying he had the Vatican\u2019s support and that he would not be cowed by any bishop. Then earlier this year, he and Zurek said they reached a settlement in their standoff and the problems seemed on their way to a resolution.\n\nBut that apparently wasn\u2019t the case, and Pavone\u2019s fate now seems to rest with Rome.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2014/12/15/ny-cardinal-timothy-dolan-cuts-ties-with-anti-abortion-crusader-frank-pavone/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RevFrankPavone-C.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, asked by the Vatican to restructure Priests for Life, has accused the Rev.
