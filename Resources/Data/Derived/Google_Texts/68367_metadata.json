States have historically defined small employers as those with 50 or fewer employees.\n\nBecause many organizations with 51 to 100 employees will be reclassified as small employers, they will have to offer a package of \u201cessential health benefits\u201d specified by the health law \u2014 in some cases more generous than what they now offer. Insurers will no longer be allowed to set premiums for such groups based on their claims history, industry or size \u2014 factors now commonly considered.\n\nThe American Academy of Actuaries, a nonpartisan professional organization, said \u201cthe new rules may result in significant premium-rate changes for some groups\u201d and would, in particular, increase costs for groups with relatively healthy workers or a younger work force. In theory, the new requirements could cause rates to decline, the academy said, but \u201cfactors exerting upward pressure on premiums are more likely to dominate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongress originally ordered the change because Democrats believed that it would stabilize the insurance market for small employers by bringing in millions of new customers.\n\nBut experts worry that it could have the opposite effect in many states. \u201cMarket disruptions could occur,\u201d said Monica J. Lindeen, a Democrat, who is the insurance commissioner of Montana and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. \u201cDefining the small-group market should be left to the states.\u201d\n\nLegislation to let states keep the current definition of \u201csmall employer\u201d has won support from 229 House members, including 43 Democrats. The legislation has been endorsed by 43 senators, including 10 Democrats. Among the supporters: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the senior Democrat on the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.\n\nIn addition, the legislation has the support of some significant business and industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe chief sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said the measure would \u201censure that small and midsize businesses are not faced with drastic premium increases as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nObama administration officials have sent mixed signals about their position on the legislation. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said she was studying the issue and wanted \u201ca smooth transition to the new requirements,\u201d but the administration has not offered or endorsed any proposals.\n\nThe White House has generally resisted changes in the 2010 health law. President Obama said the law had been immensely successful, providing coverage to millions of uninsured people, despite \u201cthe constant doom-and-gloom predictions, the unending Chicken Little warnings\u201d from Republicans.\n\nThe expanded definition of \u201csmall employer\u201d would bring new companies into the small-group insurance market. These companies could obtain coverage through health insurance exchanges created especially for small businesses. The small-business exchanges have gotten off to a slow start, with enrollment far below expectations. Some officials see expansion of the small-group market as a way to revive these exchanges, whose technical and operational problems have been a political embarrassment to the administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the health panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he was pleased to see Republicans and Democrats working together to \u201cimprove and strengthen\u201d the law.\n\nThat cooperation represents \u201ca turning point,\u201d said Mr. Pallone, a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act. He said it might make sense to delay the new definition of \u201csmall employer\u201d for a few years.\n\nSabrina Corlette, a consumer advocate and professor at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University, said the new definition might be \u201cmore trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d The main risk, she said, is that \u201cpremium rates for many midsize employers will rise, perhaps significantly.\u201d\n\nAlissa Fox, a senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said that \u201cabout two-thirds of midsize employers can expect substantial rate increases\u201d after the new rules take effect. Congress needs to act soon, she said, because many employers decide in September and October on the coverage they will offer employees in the coming year.\n\nNicholas A. Moriello, an insurance agent in Delaware, said the health care law included two contradictory provisions affecting employers with 51 to 100 employees.\n\nOn the one hand, he said, such companies are required to offer coverage to workers or pay a tax penalty, just like big corporations. On the other hand, companies with 51 to 100 employees will be defined and regulated as small employers starting next year.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150920183643, "twitter": {"description": "Some lawmakers want to head off changes to the Affordable Care Act that could subject more small companies to greater insurance requirements.", "title": "Bipartisan Effort Fights Health Law Rule That Could Raise Premiums", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/us/bipartisan-effort-fights-health-law-rule-that-could-raise-premiums.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003922021"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/us/bipartisan-effort-fights-health-law-rule-that-could-raise-premiums.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003922021", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/us/bipartisan-effort-fights-health-law-rule-that-could-raise-premiums.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Bipartisan Effort Fights Health Law Rule That Could Raise Premiums", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 20, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Small Business,Law and Legislation,House of Representatives,United States Politics and Government,Senate", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Some lawmakers want to head off changes to the Affordable Care Act that could subject more small companies to greater insurance requirements.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Some lawmakers want to head off changes to the Affordable Care Act that could subject more small companies to greater insurance requirements.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-09-21", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Senate", "published": "2015-09-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "21health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150921170621, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/us/bipartisan-effort-fights-health-law-rule-that-could-raise-premiums.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Some lawmakers want to head off changes to the Affordable Care Act that could subject more small companies to greater insurance requirements.", "title": "Bipartisan Effort Fights Health Law Rule That Could Raise Premiums"}, "pdate": 20150920, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003922021, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Bipartisan Effort Fights Health Law Rule That Could Raise Premiums", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The White House has generally resisted changes in the 2010 health law.\nNicholas A.
