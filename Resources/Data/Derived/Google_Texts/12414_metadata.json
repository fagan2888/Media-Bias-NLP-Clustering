Without those subsidies, the law pretty much falls apart. Slate will have a bunch of coverage on the decision today (here's Dave Weigel), but for the time being, it's worth pointing out a glaring irony about this whole lawsuit: It\u2019s actually an amazing advertisement for Obamacare.\n\nMuch of the case rests on the complaints of one David Klemencic, a West Virginia man who says he doesn\u2019t want to buy health insurance, and that were it not for the government's generous subsidies, he wouldn't have to. Below is how the court describes his predicament:\n\nThe district court determined that at least one of the appellants, David Klemencic, has standing. Klemencic resides in West Virginia, a state that did not establish its own Exchange, and expects to earn approximately $20,000 this year. He avers that he does not wish to purchase health insurance and that, but for federal credits, he would be exempt from the individual mandate because the unsubsidized cost of coverage would exceed eight percent of his income. The availability of credits on West Virginia\u2019s federal Exchange therefore confronts Klemencic with a choice he\u2019d rather avoid: purchase health insurance at a subsidized cost of less than $21 per year or pay a somewhat greater tax penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "obamacare, obamacare subsidies, obamacare subsidies struck down, federal court strikes
