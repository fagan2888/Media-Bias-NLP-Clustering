The announcement comes a week after House Speaker John Boehner told Obama immigration reform would not get a vote in the chamber this session.\n\nYou can already see the steam shooting out of Tea Partyers\u2019 ears. As House Republicans prepare to sue the administration \u2014 ironically, for extending an Obamacare deadline they\u2019d prefer he\u2019d have blown off altogether \u2014 and right-wing groups demonstrate against illegal immigration around the country, the president\u2019s unilateral action is bound to ramp up calls for his impeachment. The move will also likely affect the midterm elections, in which 21 of the 35 seats up for grabs are held by Democrats.\n\nObama should go it alone anyway \u2014 and go big. Under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which started in 2012, the administration has already granted two-year deportation deferrals and work permits to more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors. Under one proposal the White House is considering, their parents would get the same treatment; another would grant relief to those with U.S.-citizen children.\n\nBut either of these options would only cover about 5 million of the 9 million who would have qualified for legalization under the immigration bill the Senate passed last year. If indeed the president seeks to address as much of the problem as he can on his own \u2014 and since the whole point is to remedy the House\u2019s failure to act on the Senate bill \u2014 there\u2019s no principled reason his executive order shouldn\u2019t cover the full 9 million. Any short-term political consequences are far outweighed by the long-term support such a move will garner among Latino voters. But more important, it\u2019s the only sensible policy alternative short of congressional action.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the ins and outs of our immigration system, such broad action on the part of the president may seem like an overreach. But that\u2019s because, while it\u2019s commonly said our immigration system is \u201cbroken,\u201d most members of the public have no idea just what a disaster it is. That\u2019s largely because all most of us had to do to become citizens was be born.\n\nAt heart, the presence of 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country today is not a failure of enforcement. It\u2019s a policy failure. The last time Congress amended our country\u2019s immigration laws \u2014 in 1996 \u2014 it failed to anticipate our economy\u2019s demand for unskilled labor. While many other countries have standing commissions that adjust quotas to respond to the economy and broader migration trends, the U.S.\u2019s approach has been to set the rules every 20 years or so and undergo a massive overhaul only once the system is falling apart.\n\nThe economic expansion of the 1990s created demand for millions of unskilled jobs, largely in the service and construction industries. But our immigration system only allots a total of 5,000 visas for unskilled workers per year. No, that\u2019s not a typo, and that\u2019s not per country \u2014 that\u2019s overall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Damn the House's insane response: Obama's plan for relief to undocumented immigrations is the best way forward", "author": "Gabriel Arana", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Damn the House's insane response: Obama's plan for relief to undocumented immigrations is the best way forward", "title": "Impeach him, we dare you: Obama\u2019s executive order right on the merits and the politics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/01/impeach_him_we_dare_you_obamas_executive_order_right_on_the_merits_and_the_politics/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/barack_obama_lights.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Damn the House's insane response: Obama's plan for relief to undocumented immigrations is the best way forward", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/barack_obama_lights.jpg", "title": "Impeach him, we dare you: Obama\u2019s executive order right on the merits and the politics", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Impeach him, we dare you: Obama\u2019s executive order right on the merits and the politics", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, DACA, Editor's Picks, Immigration, Impeachment, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At heart, the presence of 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country today is not a failure of enforcement.\nBut our immigration system only allots a total of 5,000 visas for unskilled workers per year.\nBut that\u2019s because, while it\u2019s commonly said our immigration system is \u201cbroken,\u201d most members of the public have no idea just what a disaster it is.\nFor those unfamiliar with the ins and outs of our immigration system, such broad action on the part of the president may seem like an overreach.\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,\u201d the president told reporters in the Rose Garden on Monday."}
