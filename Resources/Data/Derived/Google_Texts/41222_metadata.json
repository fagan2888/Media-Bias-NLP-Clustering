While fees have been a boon to the airline industry \u2013 U.S. airlines posted record profits of $12.7 billion in 2013, up from $98 million in 2012, in part due to fees \u2013 passengers are getting hit on all sides and it\u2019s not uncommon to discover new fees on your bill even as you board a plane.\n\nRelated: Fourth of July Travel: Red Hot This Year\n\nWhile 91 percent of travelers say the overall cost of flying is a very important or somewhat important factor in deciding whether to purchase a ticket, 71 percent of passengers strongly agree that airlines fees have become more frustrating over the last year, according to a survey conducted last month by the U.S. Travel Association.\n\nThe problem with fees is that airlines lack transparency with most of them, making it nearly impossible for travelers to compare flight options and to accurately budget for trips.\n\n\u201cTravelers have no choice,\u201d said Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com. \u201cPeople have come to the point where they accept the fees, so it\u2019s working for the airlines.\u201d\n\nEither way, make sure you\u2019re aware of these six airline fees:\n\nChecked-in baggage fees: \u201cThe bag fee is the bad one,\u201d said Klee. \u201cWhen you\u2019re shopping for a ticket, you don\u2019t see the bag price, so it\u2019s difficult to compare.\u201d Airlines typically charge $25 for the first bag, $35 for the second and more than $100 for the third bag. There\u2019s one exception, though: Southwest doesn\u2019t charge for luggage and lets you check in two bags for free. JetBlue lets you check in your first bag for free, but charges $50 for the second bag and $100 for a third bag.\n\nCarry-on baggage fees: Since it\u2019s becoming more expensive to check bags, travelers are increasingly carrying on luggage \u2013 but now the boarding process takes much longer. Some airlines \u2013 Spirit, Allegiant and Frontier \u2013 have started charging passengers for carry-on bags. The fee varies depending on when you pay. With Spirit, if you pay when you buy your ticket, it will cost you $35, but if you wait until you\u2019re at the gate the airline will charge you at least $50.\n\nPreferred seat fees: \u201cAirlines are increasingly charging for the best seats on a plane,\u201d said Klee. In some cases, all window and aisle seats have an extra fee -- problematic for families or other groups who want to sit together. Klee says the fee varies depending on the distance of your flight \u2013 it can range from $9 to $80. There are a few perks attached to these fees, though, including the ability to board in the first group and sometimes extra leg room on the plane. \u201cNow, every seat is a premium seat except for a middle seat,\u201d said Ike Anand, senior director of strategy and business development at Expedia.\n\nRelated: Another Reason to Hate the TSA\n\nIn-flight fees: These can include entertainment systems, premium content on these systems, headphones, and lcohol and food. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t really bother to think about them, but they can add up,\u201d said Anand of Expedia. Flyers actually spend more money on alcohol than on any other in-flight purchase, according to a study by onboard tech company GuestLogix.\n\nPassenger security fees: These fees were set up after Sept. 11, 2001, to help cover the cost of the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s baggage and behavior screening programs. Built into the total price of a ticket, these fees are going up later this month from $2.50 per flight to a flat rate of $5.60 each way.\n\nChange fees: Most people don\u2019t think about these fees, though they can cost you dearly if you need to change your ticket. Most airlines, with the exception of Southwest, typically charge $200 per ticket, up from $150 a year ago, just to allow you to change your reservation. Then you have to pay for the difference between your old ticket and the new one.\n\nTravelers should research different fees for each airline ahead of time, so they can more easily compare airfares. They should also speak up. \u201cConsumers should object and talk to agents or complain to the airlines or on social media,\u201d said Anand. \u201cSome fees should be basic amenities included in the fare.\u201d\n\nThe only services you\u2019re guaranteed to get for free are water and the use of restrooms \u2013 but how long it will remain that way is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Air travel is becoming more frustrating every year, with flight cancellations, delays and long security lines \u2013 not to mention the fees.
