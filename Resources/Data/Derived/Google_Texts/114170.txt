With just hours to spare before Christmas day, Bradley Fair shopping center in Wichita was bustling with people checking off the final items on their holiday shopping lists.

"Shopping for my girls, my two daughters and my wife," said Zachary Thoman.

"I'm with my friends, kind of looking around for some last minute things, unfortunately," Stephanie Chakron said.

For those feeling guilty about waiting until the last minute to find the perfect present for that special someone, at least they're not alone.

Around 17 million shoppers are expected to hit the stores and malls this Christmas Eve.

"I think it's so much fun. Everyone coming together. I love buying things for other people," Chakron said.

"I dread it," Makala James said.

Some blame procrastination: "I'm just lazy," Chakron said.

Others blame busy work schedules for running down the clock.

"This is my 12th day in a row working. Finally today, I had a little bit of time left before everything was shut down," Thoman said. "So I'm running around with my head cut off trying to get everything done at once."

But amid the bright lights, bargains and bags of goodies, families say it's important to not lose sight of what really matters this holiday season.

"We're together," James said. "And for us, that's what Christmas is about, being together."
