I\u2019m a Rove junkie, and just as a snobbish fan of any popular band must have some obscure album he finds superior to the band\u2019s most popular work, the Rove career function I find most delightful and rewarding is his work as a Wall Street Journal op-ed columnist. This is the medium that truly pulls back the curtain on Rove\u2019s fascinating combination of insularity from facts outside the conservative pseudo-news bubble, delusional optimism, and utter lack of self-awareness. The Journal column is a weekly gift to amateur Rove psychoanalysts everywhere.\n\nToday\u2019s column begins with Rove\u2019s bizarre belief that the health exchanges in Obamacare are a \u201csingle-payer\u201d system, reflecting his apparent confusion about what this term means. (The single-payer in a single-payer system is the government, not the insurance companies in the exchanges.) But the main point is the Orwellian proposition that \u201cMr. Obama's pattern is to act, or fail to act, in a way that will leave his successor with a boatload of troubles.\u201d What kind of president would bequeath a boatload of troubles to his successor? Oh, the irresponsibility. The first count in Rove\u2019s indictment is the budget deficit, which \u201cwas equal to roughly 40% of GDP when Mr. Obama took office. At last year's end it was 72% of GDP.\u201d One possible cause of this deficit might be the over-trillion-dollar annual deficit, that one George W. Bush handed over when he left office, along with the massive economic collapse.\n\nThe missions had been accomplished. Now Obama has un-accomplished it.

For five years, Mr. Obama has failed to offer a plan to restore Medicare's fiscal health as he is required by the law establishing Medicare Part D. When Medicare goes belly-up, he will be out of office.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects the Affordable Care Act will reduce deficits by more than a trillion dollars in its second decade. Yes, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is expected to reach insolvency by 2026, but when Bush left office, that projected insolvency date was nine years earlier. Meanwhile, Medicare\u2019s projected spending has fallen by nearly $600 billion since the passage of Obamacare:\n\nYou can plausibly argue that these changes, combined with other cuts to long-term deficits, including partial expiration of the Bush tax cuts, don\u2019t go far enough. But Rove is trying to make the case that Obama\u2019s policies made the long-term budget outlook worse, which is false.\n\nYou know whose policies made the long-term outlook way, way worse? Yes, of course you do. Literally the entire Bush agenda \u2013 tax cuts, new domestic spending, major expansions of the military \u2014 was financed by debt. Rove tries to paint Bush as fiscally responsible because Obama has \u201cfailed to offer a plan to restore Medicare's fiscal health as he is required by the law establishing Medicare Part D.\u201d\n\nThat sentence is really the best. The point of the column is that Obama is terrible for leaving deficits to his successor. Rove is supporting this charge by citing a law his president passed, that created a major new debt-financed entitlement that Obama inherited. And he's presenting this as Obama's irresponsibility because the debt-financed entitlement Bush passed required the next president to come up with a law solving Medicare's problems. And because Obama has alleviated but not completely solved Medicare's problems, this shows that Obama has sloughed problems off onto the future. What a slacker, Obama is, sloughing off problems onto his successor rather than solve them as the president who came before him required him by law to do.\n\nThis leads us to the most Rove-ian paragraph in the column, and possibly in the entire history of the Rove oeuvre:\n\nFrom the record number of Americans on food stamps to the worst labor-force participation rate since the 1970s to rising political polarization to retreating U.S. power overseas and increasing Middle East chaos and violence, Mr. Obama's successor\u2014Republican or Democratic\u2014will inherit a mess.\n\nWhat kind of president would leave his successor with a bad economy and a violent Middle East?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "He's a treasure trove.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "He's a treasure trove.", "title": "Karl Rove: Presidents Who Leave Deficits, Bad Economies, and War Are the Worst", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/rove-obama-has-ruined-bushs-paradise.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/05/30/30_karlrove.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He's a treasure trove.", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2012/05/30/30_karlrove.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "title": "Rove: Obama Has Ruined Bush\u2019s Paradise", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, karl rove", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,karl rove", "published_time": "2014-02-13T15:44:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, karl rove", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "And because Obama has alleviated but not completely solved Medicare's problems, this shows that Obama has sloughed problems off onto the future.\nRove is supporting this charge by citing a law his president passed, that created a major new debt-financed entitlement that Obama inherited.\nBut Rove is trying to make the case that Obama\u2019s policies made the long-term budget outlook worse, which is false.\nThe point of the column is that Obama is terrible for leaving deficits to his successor.\nWhat a slacker, Obama is, sloughing off problems onto his successor rather than solve them as the president who came before him required him by law to do."}
