Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee said Sunday that prior indiscretions of former President Clinton should not be fair game in the 2016 race for the White House.

“I don’t know if we have to go there because Hillary’s record gives us all the ammunition we need,” Huckabee said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The former Arkansas governor said he has gone toe-to-toe with the Clintons in this home state and that gives him the unique status of being the only candidate to have experience on that front.

Huckabee said that he is the only candidate on the GOP stage who understands the Clintons very well and who has “effectively challenged” their political machine.

Hillary Clinton’s role in Benghazi while she was secretary of State and the questions surrounding the emails on a private server relating to the attack should be the focus, he said, not her husband.

“I don’t think it’s necessary, he’s not on the ballot,” Huckabee said.
