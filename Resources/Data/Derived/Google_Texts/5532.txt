Kids have a lot to do these days. Math, science, and even running a city.

"This is a great way of informing the students, exposing them to city government because we're always looking for future leaders," Rich Musgrave said, the Mayor of Parker.

Musgrave is more than happy to hand over the reigns of his city to these three fifth graders.

Jaice Jensen, Janay Harrell, and Taylor Jordan are the winners of an essay contest. The prize?

They get to be the honorary Mayor, Police Chief, and Fire Chief of Parker for a day!

"I learned that having responsibilities is really hard and you always have to be paying attention and on task," Taylor Jordan said, the honorary Fire Chief from Parker Elementary.

The young honorary three have some ideas as to how they would change the city of Parker if it were all up to them.

"Make the world a better place," Janay Harrell said, the honorary Police Chief from Parker Elementary.

"Provide and get new equipment for the police for $68,000 so they could have the weapons that they need for the criminals that are more intelligent," Jaice Jensen said, the honorary Mayor from Parker Elementary.

In addition to upgrading equipment, the student leaders want to fill potholes and clean up city buildings..

Ideas officials say are spot on!

After a hard day at work and a quick lunch at the firehouse, Jaice, Janay, and Taylor joined their classmates back at school for a new flag ceremony.

And perhaps with a better appreciation for American government., after their hands-on lesson!
