The legality of that action, as law school professor Nicholas Bagley has pointed out, is questionable. But the lawsuit also implies that the executive branch should have limited discretion in implementing laws. And Republicans only have to look toward Governor Chris Christie to show how that doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nIn 2013, Obama delayed for a year the employer mandate, which requires all businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance to their employees or pay a penalty. Infuriated, Republicans called the president\u2019s unilateral action illegal. On this count, they may be right. But it will be nearly impossible for Boehner to convince the courts that the House has suffered concrete damage that gives them the constitutional authority to challenge the action. In all likelihood, the lawsuit is meaningless.\n\nHowever, this case has implications beyond its legal importance. Simon Lazarus, the senior counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, testified on Wednesday before the House Rules Committee about the historic discretion afforded presidents to implement laws.\n\n\u201cThe Administration has not postponed the employer mandate out of policy opposition to the ACA, nor to any specific provision of it,\u201d he said, according to his prepared remarks. \u201cIt is ludicrous to suggest otherwise, and at best misleading to characterize the action as a 'refusal to enforce' at all. Rather, the President has authorized a minor temporary course correction regarding individual ACA provisions, necessary in his Administration\u2019s judgment to faithfully execute the overall statute, other related laws, and the purposes of the ACA\u2019s framers.\u201d The key is that Obama delayed the employer mandate in order to prioritize the success of the entire law. It does not fundamentally change the legislation or attempt to undermine it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Why the GOP should cut Obama some slack on enforcing laws", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Christie admits he ignored the law to help Tesla.
