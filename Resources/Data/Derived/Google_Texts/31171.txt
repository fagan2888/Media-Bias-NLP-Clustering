The craze of going gluten-free has spread all over, and some experts believe that it may have gotten out of hand.

A video by ASAP Science, explains what gluten actually is. "Simply put, gluten is a combination of two proteins found primarily in wheat and related grains, like barley and rye. That's it. It's just protein," according to the narrator of the video.

The funny part is that many people have no idea what gluten actually is when asked about it. It’s neither detrimental nor essential for your health the narrator says.

However, for people with Celiac disease, eating gluten can cause a number of issues such as abdominal bloating, pain, gas, diarrhea, pale stools, and weight loss. For people without the disease, nothing actually happens.

Fitness experts claim that eating a gluten-free diet, even if you don’t suffer from Celiac disease, can help with weight loss. This might be true, because when people cut gluten from their diets, they're more inclined to eat healthier, less-processed foods. Yet, if they choose to consume gluten-free products, they might be getting extra sugar and fat, which is used to help replace the lost ingredients in the food.

The bottom line? Eating a gluten-free diet without having Celiac disease shows no significant health benefits, and you should also consult with your doctor before beginning any specific diet regimen.
