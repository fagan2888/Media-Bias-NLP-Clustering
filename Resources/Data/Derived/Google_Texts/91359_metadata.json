The so-called \u201chealth care sharing ministries\u201d reportedly require their members to pay for each other\u2019s medical procedures as needed.\n\nDespite the services they provide, the ministries do not guarantee that medical costs can be entirely paid for, reports The New York Times. The Christian organizations do not have significant monetary reserves, and rely largely on informal commitments.\n\n\u201cOur only assets are the good will and continued participation of our members,\u201d said James Lansberry, vice president of Illinois sharing ministry Samaritan Ministries.\n\nMuch of the interest in the health care sharing ministries may be stemming from the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The bill exempts members of ministries from the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d and any fines, for not being insured.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, membership of health care sharing ministries has risen from roughly 200,000 to 530,000, reports U.S. News & World Report.\n\nChris and Sarah Doyle of Texas, who recently canceled their health insurance to join a sharing ministry, say that they pay $405 monthly for the ministry\u2019s coverage. Their previous health care plan cost $600 monthly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of fear going into it. What if people don\u2019t pay their share and what if money doesn\u2019t come in? But that\u2019s where the faith-based part comes in -- I\u2019m really going to rely on God,\u201d said Sarah.\n\nThe Samaritan Ministry reportedly requires members to pay the first $300 for all medical bills. Members of the Samaritan sharing ministry reportedly pay more than $16 million monthly. In 2015, its membership expanded by roughly 50,000.\n\nMany critics of the of health care sharing ministries question their reliability in providing quality health coverage.\n\n\u201cOur message has consistently been that this is not a health insurance product that we regulate, so buyer beware. A premature baby could cost $1 million pretty easily, so it wouldn\u2019t take very many of those to put a significant strain on any group, let alone an unregulated group like this,\u201d said Nick Gerhart, Iowa insurance commissioner.\n\nSarah Doyle said the informality of her sharing ministry makes her appreciate its personal nature.\n\n\"There's something different about writing my checks to someone who needs it. I feel like I'm loving on somebody instead of just paying my premiums,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"theme-version": "1.2.4", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "description": "Christians are reportedly increasingly joining ministries that assist in paying their members\u2019 health care c...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Christian Ministries Help Members Pay Medical Bills", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/christian-ministries-help-members-pay-medical-bills", "image": "http://images.opposingviews.com:8080/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2016/03/church-1457714888.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Christians are reportedly increasingly joining ministries that assist in paying their members\u2019 health care c...", "title": "Christian Ministries Help Members Pay Medical Bills"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-11T14:56:05+00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "publish_date": "2016-03-11T14:56:05+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "ov": {"id": 872173}, "theme-color": "#0e0e0e"}, "article_summary": "The so-called \u201chealth care sharing ministries\u201d reportedly require their members to pay for each other\u2019s medical procedures as needed.\nMuch of the interest in the health care sharing ministries may be stemming from the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nThe Samaritan Ministry reportedly requires members to pay the first $300 for all medical bills.\nMany critics of the of health care sharing ministries question their reliability in providing quality health coverage.\nMembers of the Samaritan sharing ministry reportedly pay more than $16 million monthly."}
