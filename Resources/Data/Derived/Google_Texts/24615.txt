Three of Iowa's largest hospital-and-clinic systems have signed contracts to provide care to patients who will be enrolled in new Medicaid managed-care programs.



Gov. Terry Branstad's office announced Thursday that the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, UnityPoint Health and Genesis Health System have signed such contracts.



The Des Moines Register reports that Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern that Branstad's plan to turn over administration of the $4 billion Medicaid program to private, for-profit companies is moving too quickly. The new system is to take effect Jan. 1.



Genesis spokesman Craig Cooper says his system has the same concerns, but that it signed up with two of the four managed-care contracts so as not to leave patients in the lurch.
