Maher said, “[B]efore Americans can laugh at how pathetic Cubans are for driving those old patched-up cars instead of getting new ones. We have to explain why that’s what we’re doing with our healthcare system, our voting system, our energy policy, and our infrastructure.”

He later described Obamacare as a “Rube Goldberg monstrosity of exchanges, and tax credits, and insurance industry concessions.” And advocated for a single-payer system.

On energy, Maher said, “Let’s switch to solar and wind by actually switching.”
