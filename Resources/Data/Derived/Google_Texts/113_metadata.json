Joe Kennedy III shares his experience growing up in a political dynasty, providing insight to the potential presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Rand Paul.\n\nRep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass. (Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate is dedicated in Boston, the newest member of the Kennedy family to serve in Congress cautions against taking a gauzy view of how bipartisan and productive things used to be.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, the third generation of Kennedys on Capitol Hill, says he loves hearing from those in Washington who remember his great-uncle as one of the Senate's most renowned legislators. And the critique that the capital is now gripped by partisanship \"certainly holds water at the moment,\" he said in an interview with Capital Download.\n\n\"But I do think that the idea back in the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s that Congress was some well-oiled machine where people didn't have their disagreements and where everybody got along and you could pass major pieces of legislation without issue \u2014 that might be a little bit of rose-colored glasses.\"\n\nHe tells USA TODAY's video newsmaker series: \"The process was designed to be hard. It was designed to be difficult.\"\n\nThat's a point the institute being opened in the late senator Kennedy's honor \u2014 \"Uncle Teddy\" to this Kennedy \u2014 tries to make. Visitors will be able to walk onto a replica of the Senate chamber and use an interactive program to try to navigate a bill through legal and political hurdles to become law. President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Biden are among those slated to attend the dedication ceremony Monday.\n\nAt 34, Joe Kennedy III has a lineage that is hard to mistake, from the shock of copper-colored hair to the signature lantern jaw. His family has fielded three senators (including his grandfather, Robert F. Kennedy) and several House members (including his father, Joe Kennedy II). At the moment, he is the only Kennedy in Congress, now serving his second term.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, left, confers with his brothers Edward Kennedy, center, and John F.

Indeed, other serious Democratic hopefuls cleared the field once he announced he was running for the seat being vacated by Barney Frank. Even though he had never run for office before, he was able to raise more than $4 million for a race in a safely Democratic district.\n\n\"There are some structural aspects of our campaign system at the moment that perhaps make it easier for folks who have access to networks or fundraising schemes that make it easier to run,\" he says, quickly adding that he supports campaign finance reform.\n\nBut he blanches at the suggestion there was anything inevitable about him going into, or succeeding at, what in some ways is the family business.\n\n\"You have to want to do this, and if it's not coming from you, people will find out, so better run because it's something you want to dedicate yourself to rather than any sort of idea that somebody else has designs for you,\" he says. Your family name is no protection from the rigors of politics: \"The point of a campaign, the objective of a campaign is to poke at the weaknesses of a candidate, and eventually find those flaws and highlight them for everybody to see, and see how the candidates are going to respond, and see if you can weather the pressure.\"\n\nThen-senator Edward M.

Kennedy had served in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and worked as an assistant district attorney in Massachusetts before entering politics.\n\nIn Washington, he has kept a low profile, something he describes as only appropriate for \"a freshman member of the minority party.\"\n\nHe serves on the powerhouse Energy and Commerce Committee, which includes oversight of the Affordable Care Act. Supporters and opponents of the health care law are braced for a Supreme Court decision on a challenge that aims to strip government subsidies from those who buy health insurance through the federal exchange because their states haven't set up their own.\n\nJoe Kennedy III, in the midst his House campaign, speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 4, 2012. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nIf that happens, Kennedy says he hopes Congress will pass the \"legislative fix\" to reinstate the subsidies for everyone.\n\nWhat are the odds of that by the Republican-controlled Congress, which has made opposition to Obamacare its mantra?\n\n\"We have voted, since I've been here, 56 times to repeal part or all of the Affordable Care Act,\" he says. \"That being said, it's a different decision when you've got 16.4 million people that have had access to insurance, that have been able to improve their health care, that have been able to actually get coverage that they didn't have before. You're talking about taking that away from millions of people. And that is a different political calculus than trying to take away something that never actually was in place in the first place.\"\n\nStill, he adds: \"I grant you that this is probably not going to be easy.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bsY119", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "As the Edward M.
