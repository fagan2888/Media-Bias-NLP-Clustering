Go back to the past to change the future. Use Gary Kubiak as the vehicle instead of a DeLorean time machine. Match him with a future Hall of Fame quarterback on the sunset side of his career. And to give this real punch, make a Super Bowl victory the measure of success.\n\nThis experiment creates skepticism because of Peyton Manning\u2019s age. He\u2019s 39 in a new system that would have fit a lot better at 29. He\u2019s embraced rollouts, scrambles (How about that 1-yard jaunt last week?) and huddles. Heck, he\u2019s even gone gloveless. Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders joined multiple teammates when he said Manning is playing with an edge, with a chip on his shoulder pads.\n\nWATCH: Six things Peyton Manning will be doing on the sideline against the Seahawks\n\nIt\u2019s August, of course. But these are the guys practicing with him, and they are praising him without hesitation.\n\nPredicting Manning to fail is a longshot. He never has during the regular season since his rookie year. He falls out of bed and wins 10-to-12 games. It\u2019s what he does.\n\nManning will provide an initial read on his comfort level in this offense during the second exhibition game at Houston. He will figure it out, adjust accordingly as long as he\u2019s healthy. Even as the offense establishes a physical identity, there\u2019s no reason to think he can\u2019t throw for 4,000 yards and 30 to 35 touchdowns. It\u2019s who he is.\n\nIt won\u2019t be what determines whether this season becomes special.\n\nThat lies on the defense.\n\nWhen teams go from good to carving out room in trophy cases, it requires improvement across the board. The defense contains plenty of room for growth. It\u2019s not the acorn that becomes the tree, but let\u2019s be honest, the group didn\u2019t meet expectations, a point driven home with the uninspired performance against the Colts, amplified by Jack Del Rio\u2019s inexplicable decision not to use Chris Harris to cover T.Y. Hilton.\n\nLost in the unit\u2019s ability to stop the run at a franchise-record level were troubling issues.\n\nThe defensive ranks: tied for 14th in turnovers with 25; tied for 23rd in fumbles recovered with seven (there was definitely some bad luck involved here, but too few fumbles were created) and 16th in points allowed at 354. The league average was 361. The top-ranked Seahawks yielded 254.\n\nIt underlines that a leap forward depends more on the defense than Manning rebounding from his last five regular-season games when he threw five touchdown passes and six interceptions.\n\nRELATED: Brock Osweiler gets chance as Peyton Manning sits for Broncos\n\nWade Phillips has a history of caffeinating defenses, especially in his first season in charge. He revived Houston and Dallas. And rarely in his previous two decades-plus as a defensive coordinator has he inherited such a talented group. The Broncos feature five Pro Bowlers. Even more salient, they man positions that function as flux capacitors for Phillips\u2019 scheme: defensive backs who excel in man coverage and edge rushers who harass quarterbacks.\n\nThe stakes are high. The Broncos have won four consecutive AFC West titles. Yet, general manager John Elway mutually parted ways with coach John Fox. It represented a risk.\n\nBut if this defense reaches its potential \u2014 which it clearly did not last season \u2014 it will be a move that is easy to defend.\n\nTroy E.
