He did not mince words when he called climate change \u201cperhaps the world\u2019s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nGiven his hesitance to weigh in on the State Department\u2019s anemic position on the Keystone XL pipeline, Kerry\u2019s words come across as hollow\n\nAll of peer-reviewed science would say that Kerry\u2019s language is accurate and hardly hyperbole. It is refreshing to see that some mainstream policy makers have elevated climate change to the same level of importance held by WMD\u2019s. Perhaps the issue of climate change will get as much attention as have WMD\u2019s in Syria and, under the previous administration, in Iraq.\n\nHowever, given his hesitance to weigh in on the State Department\u2019s anemic position on the Keystone XL pipeline, Kerry\u2019s words come across as hollow. It is interesting that Kerry has rhetorically elevated the issue of climate change to be on par with WMDs, given that his State Department has not appreciated the implications of the pipeline from an environmental, diplomatic, and symbolic standpoint. The State Department\u2019s recent report disappointed environmentalists due to the potential conflict of interest of those who worked on the report. The report also didn\u2019t highlight the fact that the completed pipeline could add the equivalent emissions of 37.7 million automobiles or 51 new coal plants.\n\nA troubling disconnect emerges: If climate change is a threat comparable to that posed by weapons of mass destruction, shouldn\u2019t we put a halt to such a weapon on our own continent? Perhaps this inconsistency is not surprising given that both the current and preceding White House administrations have criticized weapons of mass destruction in the hands of others, but fail to provide leadership on landmines, white phosphorus, depleted uranium, cluster munitions, nuclear disarmament, and, of course, climate change. We are quite selective in what we label as a weapon of mass destruction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He compares global warming to WMD but seems unwilling to push for stringent action on the home front", "title": "John Kerry\u2019s inconsistent, incomplete stance on climate change", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "He compares global warming to WMD but seems unwilling to push for stringent action on the home front", "title": "John Kerry\u2019s inconsistent, incomplete stance on climate change", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/22/john_kerrys_inconsistent_incomplete_stance_on_climate_change_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/john_kerry2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He compares global warming to WMD but seems unwilling to push for stringent action on the home front", "title": "John Kerry\u2019s inconsistent, incomplete stance on climate change", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/john_kerry2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bjorn Philip Beer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Climate Change, Earth Island Journal, John Kerry, Keystone XL pipeline, Secretary of State, State DEpartment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb964\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Climate Change, Earth Island Journal, John Kerry, Keystone XL pipeline, Secretary of State, State DEpartment, Sustainability News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Earth Island JournalIn Indonesia on Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry boldly called for international action on climate change.\nIt is refreshing to see that some mainstream policy makers have elevated climate change to the same level of importance held by WMD\u2019s.\nPerhaps the issue of climate change will get as much attention as have WMD\u2019s in Syria and, under the previous administration, in Iraq.\nHowever, given his hesitance to weigh in on the State Department\u2019s anemic position on the Keystone XL pipeline, Kerry\u2019s words come across as hollow.\nA troubling disconnect emerges: If climate change is a threat comparable to that posed by weapons of mass destruction, shouldn\u2019t we put a halt to such a weapon on our own continent?"}
