Over the course of the four year period, 611 \u201csuicide tourists\u201d between the age of 23 and 97 visited Switzerland from 31 different countries. Just over 58 percent of assisted suicide cases were women and the average age was 69.\n\nAround half of people seeking assisted suicide were suffering from a neurological condition such as paralysis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, or multiple sclerosis. Others reported cardiovascular disease, rheumatic disease, or cancer, and many were suffering from more than one condition. Among the 31 different countries \u201csuicide tourists\u201d came from, 268 were from Germany, 126 from the UK, 66 from France, 44 from Italy, 21 from the United States, 14 from Austria, 12 from Canada, eight from both Spain and Israel, and even one reported case from India.\n\n\"We need to start asking questions such as: Is it appropriate to give antibiotics to a terminally ill patient who develops a chest infection? It is possible that a tendency to carry on with curative treatment even in those clearly dying explains the general public's support for (assisted suicide),\" said Alison Twycross of London South Bank University. \"Autonomy is important, but it could be that, in matters of life and death, you cannot create freedom for the few without taking away adequate safeguards for the many.\"\n\nThere are six \u201cright to die\u201d organizations in Switzerland, four of which open up their services to people from other countries. The preferred method of most euthanasia clinics is sodium pentobarbital which paralyzes the patient\u2019s respiratory system and stops them form breathing. Dignitas, a right to die organization started back in 1998, charges upward of $10,000 for their services.\n\nSource: Bartsch C, Reisch T, Mausbach J, Gauthier S.
