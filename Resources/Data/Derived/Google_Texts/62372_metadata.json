The company now has 125,000 active daily users, and 25 million messages per week are sent with its platform.\n\nThe company brings in $3.5 million in annual recurring revenue, and sees 93% of the 13,000 active teams using the software decide to stick with the product, Mr. Butterfield said.\n\nSlack has never paid for advertising, he added.\n\nThe company\u2019s platform is an enterprise collaboration tool that aggregates information from business applications\u2013including Google Drive, Twitter, Trello, MailChimp, GitHub and Dropbox\u2014and makes it easily available to other members of a pre-established team.\n\nThe product is designed to give team members access to information without constantly toggling between one application and another, Mr. Butterfield said.\n\nSlack is actually five years old, originally intended to sell games under the name Tiny Speck Inc. Developers based in different cities spent about four years building and launching a multi-player game called Glitch.\n\nAfter four years of game development, the team working on Glitch was less interested in games and more fascinated with the \u201980s era communication tool they were using to collaborate over long distances and over long periods of time. Even though the tool pre-dated the Internet, it was still popular with some developers because it filters out the noise associated with standard email accounts and lets users focus on the project at hand, he said.\n\nThe company decided to pivot from games and soon began building a comparable communications tool, albeit one that would work in various industries and one designed for the modern workplace.\n\nThe company has gone on to raise nearly $60 million from venture capitalists, including a $42.8 million Series C round that Slack raised in April from the Social+Capital Partnership, Accel Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and angels associated with Twitter Inc., Yelp Inc. and other technology companies.\n\nThe company had a post-money valuation of $250 million in April, and the company\u2019s internal valuation has climbed above $500 million since then, Mr. Butterfield said.\n\nThe company has thousands of customers, including media giants like Times of London, ESPN, HBO and the Wall Street Journal, and tech companies like Tumblr Inc., Yelp Inc. and Foursquare Inc.\n\nIt aims to double its staff of 45 over the next year, the CEO said, and wants to bring aboard sales-support and customer-support specialists.\n\nWrite to Timothy Hay at timothy.hay@wsj.com. > Follow him on Twitter at @timwhay", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Its workplace collaboration tool has caught on quickly despite no advertising or marketing.", "title": "Enterprise App Slack Gaining Momentum At Six-Month Mark", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/08/12/enterprise-app-slack-gaining-momentum-at-six-month-mark/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Enterprise App Slack Gaining Momentum At Six-Month Mark", "description": "Its workplace collaboration tool has caught on quickly despite no advertising or marketing.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Timothy Hay", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Venture Capital Dispatch Blog", "page.subsection": "Venture Capital Dispatch", "article.summary": "Its workplace collaboration tool has caught on quickly despite no advertising or marketing.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-12T15:00:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/08/12/enterprise-app-slack-gaining-momentum-at-six-month-mark/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-VCDB-15202", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Its workplace collaboration tool has caught on quickly despite no advertising or marketing.", "title": "Enterprise App Slack Gaining Momentum At Six-Month Mark", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/08/12/enterprise-app-slack-gaining-momentum-at-six-month-mark/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Venture Capital Dispatch", "article.id": "BL-VCDB-15202", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-11T23:06:42-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd127\"", "article_summary": "The product is designed to give team members access to information without constantly toggling between one application and another, Mr. Butterfield said.\nStewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack.\n\u201cThings have really gone, of an order of magnitude, better than expected,\u201d said Mr. Butterfield, who founded Flickr and sold it with his partners to Yahoo in 2004.\nThe company had a post-money valuation of $250 million in April, and the company\u2019s internal valuation has climbed above $500 million since then, Mr. Butterfield said.\nThe company now has 125,000 active daily users, and 25 million messages per week are sent with its platform."}
