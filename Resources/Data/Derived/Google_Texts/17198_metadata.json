The law requires individuals to buy a minimum level of coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nAs insurance companies have tried to make their plans offered on health exchanges more affordable, they have adopted a strategy of limiting their networks of medical providers. These networks have come under scrutiny as individuals have begun to realize their new plans may exclude their preferred doctor or hospital.\n\nBoth Harrington and Talon, who were previously uninsured, purchased health plans from Blue Shield of California to comply with the new insurance requirement, known as the individual mandate, the complaint said.\n\nHarrington bought a so-called silver plan on California's online exchange while Talon bought a platinum plan through the insurer's website. They said they made their choices based on Blue Shield's alleged representations that their doctors would be covered.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Blue Shield of advertising \"one of the largest networks in the state\" - with more than 60,000 physicians and 351 hospitals - and of failing to disclose that the networks for certain plans were substantially smaller.\n\nAfter receiving medical treatment numerous times between January and March, Harrington and Talon later discovered that their providers were not covered, forcing them to pay the charges out-of-pocket, the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged claims of false advertising, unfair business practices and breach of contract under California law.\n\nThe case is Harrington et al v. Blue Shield of California et al, San Francisco Superior Court, No. 14-539283.\n\n(Reporting by Terry Baynes in New York; Editing by Ted Botha and Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Terry Baynes", "Author": "Terry Baynes", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Consumers who purchased new health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued the insurer, claiming they were misled into thinking the insurance would cover their desired doctors and hospitals.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "California consumers say duped by Blue Shield's limited Obamacare plans", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, HEALTHCARE, BLUESHIELD", "DCSext.ChannelList": "domesticNews;Inspiration;SAP;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;Adfriendly1;VerizonMap;echoActivityStream;Boston;Suntrust_SmallBiz;AllianzRetirement;AllianzInsurance;HSBC_US;everythingButHugin;SprintNow;AXAinsurance;OutloudFeed;HPEnterprise;Allianz;CFA;sapawarenesstech;sapawarenesslife;sprintxpert2;samsung;Pfizersafe;cfaglobal;merrilledge;aa48hours;ernstyoung;Xerox;nonegative;citianniversary;citgroup;Bosneg;Intel;MarshallTest;PFG", "keywords": "US,USA,HEALTHCARE,BLUESHIELD,Corporate Governance,United States,Healthcare Services (TRBC),Lawmaking,US Government News,Financials (TRBC),Crime / Law / Justice,Healthcare (TRBC),Corporate Litigation,Government / Politics,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,California,Corporate Events,General News,Health / Medicine,Regulation,Financials (Legacy),Insurance (TRBC),Americas", "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USBREA4E0VN20140515", "description": "Consumers who purchased new health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued the insurer, claiming they were misled into thinking the insurance would cover their desired doctors and hospitals.", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-05-15T19:41:39+0000", "sailthru.title": "California consumers say duped by Blue Shield's limited Obamacare plans", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "California+consumers+say+duped+by+Blue+Shield%27s+limited+Obamacare+plans", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBREA4E0VN20140515", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "news_keywords": "US;USA;HEALTHCARE;BLUESHIELD;Corporate Governance;United States;Healthcare Services (TRBC);Lawmaking;US Government News;Financials (TRBC);Crime / Law / Justice;Healthcare (TRBC);Corporate Litigation;Government / Politics;Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions;California;Corporate Events;General News;Health / Medicine;Regulation;Financials (Legacy);Insurance (TRBC);Americas", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Terry Baynes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "Consumers who purchased new health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued the insurer, claiming they were misled into thinking the insurance would cover their desired doctors and hospitals.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Consumers who purchased new health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued the insurer, claiming they were misled into thinking the insurance would cover their desired doctors and hospitals.", "title": "California consumers say duped by Blue Shield's limited Obamacare plans", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-blueshield-idUSBREA4E0VN20140515", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,HEALTHCARE,BLUESHIELD,Corporate Governance,United States,Healthcare Services (TRBC),Lawmaking,US Government News,Financials (TRBC),Crime / Law / Justice,Healthcare (TRBC),Corporate Litigation,Government / Politics,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,California,Corporate Events,General News,Health / Medicine,Regulation,Financials (Legacy),Insurance (TRBC),Americas", "published_time": "2014-05-15T19:41:39+0000", "modified_time": "2014-05-15T19:41:39+0000", "author": "Terry Baynes"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Thu May 15 19:41:39 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca48c\"", "article_summary": "Blue Shield of California spokesman Sean Barry said in an emailed statement that the company was reviewing the complaint.\nThe case is Harrington et al v.
