Richard Burr Richard BurrThe Trail 2016: Hell breaks loose Burr, Ross in statistical dead heat in NC Senate race Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (R-N.C.) is gambling on lawmakers to pass an even shorter term extension of the law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s up to the leadership to determine what type of extension is reasonable \u2014 that could be anywhere from five days to four weeks,\u201d Burr told reporters off the Senate floor.\n\nThen, they would be able to move to his backup plan, which \u201cwould be a win-win for those that want to transition the data from NSA to the telephone companies,\u201d he said Thursday evening.\n\nThe week- or month-long extension would require quick and quiet action from House leaders next week, while the chamber is in recess. That would surely enrage many lawmakers, and House GOP leadership aides have attempted to throw water on the prospect.\n\nBurr\u2019s backup plan \u2014 called the FISA Improvements Act \u2014 would mirror the most prominent feature of the USA Freedom Act, the surveillance reform bill that would end the bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records and which sailed through the House last week. Instead of collecting phone records itself, the USA Freedom Act would have the NSA request a narrow set of records from private companies.\n\nWhile the USA Freedom Act would allow for six months to transition the program, Burr\u2019s plan would give the agency two years.\n\nThe NSA has said that six months is plenty of time to transition to the new program.\n\nThe agency \u201cassesses that the transition of the program\u201d to the scheme envisioned by the USA Freedom Act \u201cis achievable within 180 days,\u201d NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers said in a letter to Senate leaders this week.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of no technical or security reasons why this cannot be tested and brought on line within the 180-day period.\u201d\n\nBurr disagrees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think six months is long enough,\u201d he said on Thursday.\n\nRogers\u2019s letter \u201csaid they thought it was achievable and on the day of enactment they would get together with the telecom companies and begin to work on a transition,\u201d Burr said.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is I can\u2019t necessarily agree to something that they think they can do and there\u2019s such a big national security gap at stake.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 who has vocally opposed the USA Freedom Act \u2014 seemed to lend his support to Burr\u2019s plan.\n\nThe Obama administration \u201ccould not guarantee whether a new system would work as well as the current system,\u201d he said.\n\nBurr\u2019s bill also deviates from the USA Freedom Act in its creation of a new expert advisory panel on the secretive federal surveillance court.\n\nAdditionally, it would make permanent the two expiring Patriot Act provisions that don\u2019t cover the NSA\u2019s phone records program \u2014 which cover suspected lone wolf terrorists and people who switch through multiple \u201cburner\u201d phones. The USA Freedom Act would extend those two to 2019.\n\nCritics were quick to jump on the proposal as a last-ditch effort to come up with a plan.\n\n\u201cThis is not a responsible way to legislate, nor is this the extensive process the Republican majority promised when they blocked the USA Freedom Act last year,\u201d Sen Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) \u2014 one of the authors of the USA Freedom Act \u2014 said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The plan \u201cwould be a win-win,\" said Sen.
