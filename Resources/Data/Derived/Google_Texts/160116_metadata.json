The push was prompted by the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn of Ohio, who wrote in a suicide note in December that her parents forced her to attend conversion therapy.\n\nThe petition has received more than 120,000 signatures, more than enough to merit a response from the White House on its \u201cWe the People\u201d forum.\n\nCalifornia, New Jersey and the District of Columbia have banned licensed professionals from using conversion therapy on minors. Lawmakers in 18 other states have introduced similar legislation.\n\nChristopher Doyle, president of Voice of the Voiceless and a licensed clinical professional counselor who supports sexual orientation change efforts, has said there can\u2019t be a scientific basis for the claim that the therapy is harmful to children because there are no studies on sexual orientation change efforts and the impact on minors.\n\nMs. Jarrett said efforts to change a person\u2019s gender identity \u201chave also been shown in countless instances to have dangerous effects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American Psychological Association has repeatedly affirmed its stance against these practices, recently stating that efforts to change an individual\u2019s sexual orientation can pose serious health risks\u201d to gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, she said.\n\nIn support of its argument, the White House cited the example of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who said while signing his state\u2019s law in 2013 that \u201cexposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of the benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nGroups such as the New Jersey Family Policy Council have sought to overturn New Jersey\u2019s ban. In February, a New Jersey judge ruled that advertising a service that could change a person\u2019s sexuality is fraudulent and violates the state\u2019s consumer protection laws.\n\nMs. Jarrett said a national ban would require congressional action, suggesting such a move by the Republican-majority Congress is unlikely. But she added, \u201cWe are hopeful that the clarity of the evidence combined with the actions taken by these states will lead to broader action that this administration would support.\u201d\n\nCalifornia enacted the nation\u2019s first ban on sexual orientation change efforts in 2012. That law was contested in court but was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama called for an end Wednesday to \"conversion therapy\" that counsels gay teens and children on how to become straight.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama called for an end Wednesday to \u201cconversion therapy\u201d that counsels gay teens and children on how to become straight.", "title": "Valerie Jarrett hails Obama efforts to end gay \u2018conversion therapy\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/8/valerie-jarrett-hails-obama-efforts-to-end-gay-con/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/27/Obama.JPEG-0fb8a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/27/Obama.JPEG-0fb8a.jpg", "description": "President Obama called for an end Wednesday to \"conversion therapy\" that counsels gay teens and children on how to become straight.", "card": "summary", "title": "Valerie Jarrett hails Obama efforts to end gay \u2018conversion thera"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Valerie Jarrett, White House"}, "article_summary": "President Obama called for an end Wednesday to \u201cconversion therapy\u201d that counsels gay teens and children on how to become straight.\nCalifornia, New Jersey and the District of Columbia have banned licensed professionals from using conversion therapy on minors.\nThe push was prompted by the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn of Ohio, who wrote in a suicide note in December that her parents forced her to attend conversion therapy.\nChristopher Doyle, president of Voice of the Voiceless and a licensed clinical professional counselor who supports sexual orientation change efforts, has said there can\u2019t be a scientific basis for the claim that the therapy is harmful to children because there are no studies on sexual orientation change efforts and the impact on minors.\nIn a posting on the White House\u2019s website, senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett said the administration \u201csupports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors.\u201d\u201cThe overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said."}
