They addressed a largely African-American crowd that stretched for hundreds of yards from the steps of the Capitol.\n\nSpeakers at the rally, which followed a number of high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of police, called for reforms to law enforcement\u2019s use of force and greater access for poor people to health care and higher education.\n\nDuring his more than two-hour speech, Farrakhan urged listeners to avoid sexual immorality, abortion and violence, even as he criticized \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and said the United States could face a series of natural calamities.\n\n\u201cAmerica has now entered the time of divine judgment,\u201d Farrakhan said.\n\nIn 1995, Farrakhan led the Million Man March in Washington, which drew about 800,000 people, according to private researchers, and marked a significant moment for African-American political activism in the U.S.\n\nHis Justice or Else march on Saturday drew a far smaller crowd that numbered in the thousands. Many watched speakers on jumbo screens.\n\nA representative for the National Park Service declined to provide a crowd estimate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, attended the Million Man March in 1995.\n\nSome speakers at the rally said the U.S. is making progress in resolving racial inequalities, such as by electing Obama in 2008 as the nation\u2019s first black president.\n\nBut they also described other instances of racial inequality, such as U.S. immigration policies they said were unfair to Hispanics.\n\nAva Muhammad, a black Muslim minister and spokeswoman for Nation of Islam, struck an aggressive tone during her speech.\n\n\u201cThe Quran says fight with those who fight with you,\u201d she told the crowd.\n\nFarrakhan, 82, has led the Nation of Islam since 1977.\n\nIn the past, his rhetoric has been criticized as strident and prejudiced toward Jews and gays, and he has called white people \u201cdevils.\u201d\n\nMembers of the audience said they drew inspiration from the rally.\n\nR.J. Moss, a 34-year-old Atlanta attorney, said he attended the Million Man March rally 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe message is the same, come together, respect one another, love one another,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe message is the same, come together, respect one another, love one another,\u201d R.J.
