Those doctors will function as a sort of first line of defense for identifying health problems and recommending treatment. Additionally, patients are required to get a physical every year.\n\nThe system is referred to as a Patient Centered Medical Home, a model designed in recent years to try to reduce unnecessary medical costs. Some have compared it to an HMO in that patients pick a primary doctor, but it\u2019s slightly different. Policy holders can go outside of the network, but it costs more.\n\nUnder the union\u2019s new plan, patients who don\u2019t stay within the network must pay upward of a $600 deductible as well as higher copays. The plan also doesn\u2019t include coverage for preventive care outside the network, among other cutbacks.\n\nThe union picked the system because it\u2019s expected to save the health trust money \u2014 around $9.6 million, according to CCEA executive director John Vellardita. That, combined with $9.8 million in premium increases CCSD recently agreed to pay, should keep the trust afloat for the foreseeable future, Vellardita said.\n\n\u201cIf we do what we need to do at the trust \u2026 we not only will have savings, we will restore financial stability and be able to build reserves,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the past, the trust was forced to burn through its reserves in order to keep the trust going when the economy tanked and education spending was slashed following the recession.\n\nThe THT\u2019s outgoing plan is called the Diamond PPO, which even Vellardita described as a \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d\n\nIn a world of rising costs and a changing health care industry due to the Affordable Care Act, it just wasn\u2019t working out. Critics have accused the union of mismanaging the trust, while its defenders have pointed to the fact that the Clark County School District refused to pay enough into the fund to keep it self-sustaining. Until recently, the school district\u2019s premium payments had remained stagnant since 2008.\n\n\u201cThe type of revenue needed to sustain a plan like that has essentially been flat for several years,\u201d he said.\n\nSo they started looking for another model around a year ago. It turns out they didn\u2019t have to look far. MGM Resorts\u2019 highly praised DirectCare health care plan also operates like a patient-centered medical home, and so the union started consulting with health care experts about a possible switch.\n\n\u201cWe thought that model was a perfect match for us,\u201d said Vellardita.\n\nThey decided to contract with WellHealth, a local provider founded in 2011, to administer the new plan.\n\nTeachers have been understandably skeptical of the changes, as reflected on the Teachers Health Trust\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI'm a tad confused. Right now I can just pick up the phone, call my doctor, and make an appointment,\u201d read one comment. \u201cAre we still able to do this or do we have to use a computer and/or a health care advocate now? Seems like a lot of hoops to jump through to see a doctor.\u201d\n\n(Answer: You can still pick up the phone and make appointments directly through your doctor.)\n\nAnother added, \u201cNone of this means nothing to me if my wife has to find a new general doc for her and a new pediatrician for our girls.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s where much of the confusion exists now. Teachers want to know whether their existing doctors are choosing to stay on under the new plan. The trust has not yet released a complete list and noted that some providers won\u2019t be renewed due to their charging more than the trust is willing to pay.\n\nThe union is expected to reveal more information about the provider list in a series of mandatory open enrollment sessions, which start Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here\u2019s something nobody ever wants to hear: Brace for changes to your current health care plan.
