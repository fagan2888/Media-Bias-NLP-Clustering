If one hospital systems buys the latest cardiac technology, competing systems buy it too \u2013 and hire staff to use it, creating what he calls \u201coverproduction of capacity\u201d that leads to \u201csome cities having 10 times more procedures than other cities, not because it\u2019s needed. We do overdo quite a lot of things.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s administrative costs. \u201cWe have a byzantine system,\u201d said Gorman, with an estimated $350 billion difference in the cost of administration between the Canadian and U.S. health systems and makes health literacy almost impossible. When his attorney son was struggling to choose a health plan, Gorman and his wife, both physicians, couldn\u2019t help figure which health plan was best.\n\nWill the current trend in consolidation of health plans, hospitals and health systems help or create too much market power?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said McConnell, who sees interesting \u201ctinkering on the edges\u201d with Medicare pilots bundling rates for hip replacements in random communities and Medicaid reform throughout the country.\n\nSome audience questions seemed beyond the professors\u2019 pay grade: Could a Medicare for all system slowly be achieved by reducing the age limit to qualify for Medicare each year? What will happen to health reform with a Republican president and Congress? Why is change so hard?\n\n\u201cMythology is more powerful than facts,\u201d said Gorman, noting that even medical students sometimes think the US has the best healthcare in the world while tribalism \u2013 who is proposing the reform \u2013plays a role.\n\nObamaCare succeeded at getting more people insured, especially those with pre-existing conditions, Gorman said, but 29 million people remain uninsured and high deductibles make access difficult for many. \u201cCo-pays reduce access for patients in the lowest social economic strata.\u201d\n\nAnd, with more people going on Medicaid, the healthcare system can\u2019t always provide sufficient care \u2013 and except for emergency rooms, providers are not required to take Medicaid patients.\n\nUnder a single payer system, \u201c95 percent of households would save money,\u201d Gorman said. But the feasibility of such a system is \u201cchallenging politically\u201d because the healthcare industry comprises 18 percent of the economy, McConnell said.\n\nStill, McConnell was pleased with the broader conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s neat to see people this energized about it. There\u2019s a lot of passion and interest in public health.\u201d\n\nJan can be reached at janjohnson6@earthlink.net.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "Will the current trend in consolidation of health plans, hospitals and health systems help or create too much market power?\nWhat will happen to health reform with a Republican president and Congress?\nBut the feasibility of such a system is \u201cchallenging politically\u201d because the healthcare industry comprises 18 percent of the economy, McConnell said.\nWhen his attorney son was struggling to choose a health plan, Gorman and his wife, both physicians, couldn\u2019t help figure which health plan was best.\n\u201cWe have a byzantine system,\u201d said Gorman, with an estimated $350 billion difference in the cost of administration between the Canadian and U.S. health systems and makes health literacy almost impossible."}
