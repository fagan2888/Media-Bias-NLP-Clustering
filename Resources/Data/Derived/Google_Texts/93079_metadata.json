Despite the cringe-worthy ads, it was a success. 9.5 million Americans now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a huge step forward for President Obama\u2019s vision of universal healthcare for the country. The rate of uninsured adults has dropped from 20% last year to 15% this year (1). Given the disastrous roll-out phase of the program, this surge in enrolment is encouraging to those who view Obamacare with a glass half-full attitude. However, there are still roadblocks on the path to equitable and affordable health care for Americans. One of these is the fact that young Americans simply aren\u2019t signing up for health insurance as much as they should.\n\nAccording to the just-released Commonwealth Fund poll, 18% of young adults (ages 19-34) are currently uninsured (1). This figure is much lower than last year, but is still higher than the nationwide-average of 15%. It\u2019s strange, because the idea of universal healthcare was likely a big draw for young democratically-minded Americans hoping for a more equal society under Barack Obama. So why aren\u2019t we buying in?\n\nBeing young, we feel invincible. And rightly so \u2013 young people enjoy the best health. In fact, as a young person, it can be more expensive to visit the ER if you are insured versus not. A recent study estimated that an uninsured young adult visiting the ER once in 2014 will pay an average of $2,022 in out-of-pocket costs (2). On the other hand, the average insured young adult visiting the ER once will pay $2,791 in the 2014 year for their insurance premium and the remaining out-of-pocket cost of the ER visit. This example is a bit extreme, since it assumes that the only healthcare used in one year would be one ER visit. More realistically, the insured person would win out in the end if he or she uses other healthcare services as well. But, it exemplifies how you wouldn\u2019t necessarily save money as a young person if you have a medical emergency. Even with the cost of the penalty for not buying insurance (which will go significantly up in future!), it can still be cheaper to go uninsured.\n\nThe question of whether or not to buy health insurance as a young person is a game of risk, and how much of it we\u2019re willing to bear.\n\nAnother issue is that we don\u2019t bother to educate ourselves about health insurance, and the government doesn\u2019t do much to help us. Over one-quarter of Americans aged 19 to 29 didn\u2019t even know that the \u2018Health Insurance Marketplace\u2019 \u2013 the online portal for getting information, comparing plans, and purchasing health insurance \u2013 even exists. That\u2019s a huge problem. But, it\u2019s not entirely our fault. Even for highly educated young adults, the HealthCare.gov website can be remarkably difficult to navigate. A study recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine recorded the following problems with the website (3):\n\n\u2013 Poor explanations of technical health insurance terms\n\n\u2013 An overwhelming amount of information\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s not clear that preventive health services like cancer screenings are always free (they are!)\n\n\u2013 It\u2019s difficult to figure out which plan is best suited to you and your needs\n\n\u2013 The \u2018catastrophic\u2019 insurance category sounds scary\n\nIf young, highly-educated people encounter these seemingly basic problems, then that\u2019s a scary thing. Think about how older adults with lower education, or whose first language isn\u2019t English might do when trying to make a good decision when buying health insurance. It\u2019s really difficult to communicate complex risk information, and as a result most people (even young, highly educated people!) have low \u2018risk literacy\u2019. Check out this 3-minute Risk Literacy to see how well you do \u2013 you might be surprised.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the take-home message? As always, no matter whether you are old or young, or whether you have health insurance or not, take the time to educate yourself so that you can make the best decisions and be in control of your own health and how it\u2019s taken care of. The benefit of Obamacare to the country is obvious now after this open enrolment period. The new Commonwealth Fund report states that:\n\nBy June [2014], six of 10 adults with new marketplace or Medicaid coverage said they had used their insurance to go to a doctor or hospital or to fill a prescription. A majority said they would not have been able to access or afford this care before enrolling.\n\nIf you are a young American and don\u2019t have health insurance, you really should look into getting some. You might find that it\u2019s not worth it for you, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a politicized issue too, so it\u2019s good to decide what stance you take on it. Every citizen plays a role in the future of Obamacare, and be extension, the future of equality and the welfare state in America. And, the penalty fee is going to be quite hefty in the next few years if you don\u2019t sign up (4).\n\nImage source: http://doyougotinsurance.com/\n\nReferences\n\n1) Collins SR, Rasmussen PW, Doty MM.
