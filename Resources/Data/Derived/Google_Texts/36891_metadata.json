High avalanche danger means that both natural and human-triggered avalanches are likely. Avalanches could break into old snow layers, creating large and dangerous slides,\u201d according to the CAIC.\n\nThe winter storm warning is in effect until 5 a.m. Friday, and northern and central Colorado could see 14 to 24 inches of snow and high winds.\n\nThe fresh fall of snow could reach 30 inches in some areas.\n\nA high wind watch is in effect in areas between 6,000 and 9,000 feet, with winds from 20 to 40 mph and in some places gusts higher than 70 mph.\n\n\u201cThis is going to cause some travel headaches on all mountain routes, there is so much snow, and wind with it,\u201d Friden said.\n\nThe high wind watch is in effect through late Wednesday night.\n\nThe storm is normal for this time of year, Frieden said. \u201cThis is how that portion of the state gets the moisture it wants. This type of storm is what we like to see this time of year and that is normal.\u201d\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Slam!
