If you didn\u2019t just read that and think, \u201cDUH,\u201d then you must not have ever been a teen, because we can confidently file that one under \u201ctell me something I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, as much as we would like to believe there\u2019s no use for these types of studies, researchers argue they need them to influence policy decisions by drawing constant attention to certain problems. Others say publishing these papers, no matter their use, is the only way they\u2019ll get promotions. While these are perfectly understandable reasons, we\u2019re still here wondering, what do we get out of knowing most teens go digging for that green-gray gold?\n\nStudies like this are published all the time. And with about 28,000 peer-reviewed journals publishing upward of 1.8 million articles a year, it makes sense that some nonsensical studies would slip through the cracks. With that said, here are seven studies published this year that\u2019ll make you appreciate the \u201cvalue\u201d in science.\n\nYour Closeness To Fast Food Is Making You Fat\n\nIf given the choice, on a drunken night at home with friends, to eat either a fast food burger from down the block or a more trustworthy burger from 20 blocks away, which would you choose?\n\nChances are most of us would choose the fast food burger. And that\u2019s exactly what a study from March found, with the added \u201cduh\u201d effect that it will make us obese. Researchers from Cambridge University found that of the 5,400 people surveyed, those who had fast food nearest their home, job, or commuting route averaged 1.21 more points in body mass index. These people consumed 5.7 more grams of food than the least exposed group. \u201cIn a week, this translates into an additional 39.9 grams of takeaway food,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nOf course, if you have a fast food place down the block from where you live, you probably already knew this.\n\nFendi, Gucci, Prada: Borrowing It Is Just Making You Feel Bad\n\nWhat\u2019s a better way to make yourself feel poor than to borrow your friend\u2019s $1,000 designer handbag?\n\nIt should come as no surprise that borrowing a person\u2019s luxury items won\u2019t feel as good as owning them. You\u2019ll understand why the second someone asks you about the item, and all you can say is, \u201cUhh, my friend let me borrow it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well then\u2026\u201d the other person will say, before trying to quickly, awkwardly change the subject.\n\nAfter giving participants either luxury or cheap versions of a pen or a bar of chocolate, researchers found that those who were able to keep the items after the study were \u201cmore satisfied with life\u201d than those who could only test or taste the products. Dr. Liselot Hudders, a professor at Ghent University where the study was conducted, said this fell in line with prior research (because that\u2019s always necessary) \u201cthat equates consumption with ownership. In contrast, the mere use or mere knowledge of luxury products seems to be detrimental for one\u2019s satisfaction with life.\u201d\n\nNow, feel terrible as you give me my pen back.\n\nSpeaking About Gaining Weight\n\nIt\u2019s going to happen if you don\u2019t stick to a diet. And apparently, we needed a study to tell us that.\n\nResearchers from Canada\u2019s McMaster University were interested in seeing how effective diets like Weight Watchers, Atkins, Jenny Craig, the Zone, Nutrisystem, and South Beach were in getting a person to lose weight. By looking at 48 previous studies on each one, they found that six months after beginning, obese and overweight people on low-carb diets lost 19 pounds more than those who weren\u2019t dieting, while those on low-fat diets lost 17 pounds more. At a year\u2019s follow-up, there was no difference between the diets\u2019 effectiveness.\n\nAll diets are meant to help you lose weight, whether it\u2019s by limiting carbs, fat, meat, etc. It\u2019s the willpower that it takes to stick to them that\u2019s the most difficult part, but of course, we all knew that, too.\n\nLet\u2019s Get A Beer Together, And Love Each Other\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a scientist to know how bars and alcohol affect men\u2019s interactions with one another. Just stand outside a bar around the end of the night, and more often than not, you\u2019ll find at least one group of guys professing their love to each other. \u201cI love you, bro!\u201d It also doesn\u2019t take a scientist to see that men tend to suppress emotions around each other. Society teaches us early on that we\u2019re supposed to internalize them to \u201cman up.\u201d\n\nInterested in the circumstances in which we\u2019ll become expressive, researchers found that bars or pubs were the primary place men felt completely comfortable expressing their emotions. \u201cThere is a stereotype that men are strong and silent about their mental health, and it is something they never talk about,\u201d Dr. Carol Emslie, study leader, told The Scotsman. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t what we found. It was very much the idea that alcohol or drinking in these communal groups had this positive effect on your mental health.\u201d\n\nAlcohol lowers inhibitions, allowing men to show vulnerability without feeling weak. Thus, men who drank with friends were more likely to report looking out for one another, opening up through laughter and jokes, and feeling compelled to uplift each other.\n\n'It\u2019s Cold Outside,' Says Everyone Who Doesn\u2019t Actually Want To Exercise\n\nIt is 32 degrees and cloudy here in New York City today, and I\u2019ve been putting off going out for a run ever since the temperature dipped below 50. I\u2019m not the only slacker up in here; many people slack in the winter. It\u2019s just too cold! And a new study shows me and all you slackers out there that we\u2019re not alone \u2014 but we already knew that.\n\nThose who work on Jawbone, the fitness-tracking company, were interested in seeing how much the weather affected a person\u2019s workout. They found that users of their devices logged five percent more steps in 70-degree weather than in 40-degree weather. That became a 15-percent difference on the weekends.\n\nMost of us will admit that with the holidays approaching, there\u2019s no point in exercising as hard. But physical activity is one component of a lifestyle that should remain consistent, at least if you want to maintain some semblance of your summer self come the spring. With that said, I should put my running shoes back on.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "so, pointless, 5, studies, proved, obvious, 2014", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "From fast food making you fat to beer helping men show their emotions, these are five studies that proved the most obvious in 2014.", "title": "In 'Duh' News: 5 Of 2014's Most Pointless Studies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/so-pointless-5-studies-proved-obvious-2014-313484", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/5-studies-proved-obvious-2014.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From fast food making you fat to beer helping men show their emotions, these are five studies that proved the most obvious in 2014.", "title": "In 'Duh' News: 5 Of 2014's Most Pointless Studies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/so-pointless-5-studies-proved-obvious-2014-313484", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/5-studies-proved-obvious-2014.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/5-studies-proved-obvious-2014.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": 2014, "published_time": "2014-12-08T16:18:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-09T11:30:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "From fast food making you fat to beer helping men show their emotions, these are five studies that proved the most obvious in 2014."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf95b\"", "article_summary": "From fast food making you fat to beer helping men show their emotions, these are five studies that proved the most obvious in 2014.\nOf course, if you have a fast food place down the block from where you live, you probably already knew this.\nYour Closeness To Fast Food Is Making You FatIf given the choice, on a drunken night at home with friends, to eat either a fast food burger from down the block or a more trustworthy burger from 20 blocks away, which would you choose?\nChances are most of us would choose the fast food burger.\nWith that said, here are seven studies published this year that\u2019ll make you appreciate the \u201cvalue\u201d in science."}
