She said staff members were regularly attacked by their developmentally disabled clients.\n\nOver the past week, News 9 has aired a couple different cases where people who have been living in group homes for the developmentally disabled have apparently been abused by their caretakers.\n\nIn one case, a young man suffered severe bruising on his face. In another case, a staffer can be seen on security camera hitting a resident then spraying him with an aerosol can. In Both cases, the group homes were managed by a company called Supported Community Lifestyles.\n\nGayla Miller worked for the company for six years. She said staff members were regularly attacked by their developmentally disabled clients. \u201cYou could be attacked on a daily basis. I have been poisoned with liquid glass in my drink\u201d, Miller said, \u201cI\u2019ve been punched several times. I\u2019ve had busted lips. My hair pulled out in clumps.\u201d\n\nMiller said because of state cutbacks, pay is too low to attract good caregivers. \u201cI mean it\u2019s hard to find anyone that wants to take care of the disabled that truly cares.\u201d Miller said, \u201cAnd then the public wants to do an outcry, you know, about the treatment. They don\u2019t want to take care of them.\u201d\n\nMiller said no one wants to end up bloodied and bruised for eight bucks an hour.\n\nA spokeswoman for DHS said the vast majority of the clients they serve are not violent. She acknowledges caretakers should be paid more but with the state's budget woes, she says, that's just not possible.\n\nMiller said, \u201cThe answer is more funding. The state keeps cutting, cutting, cutting until we have nothing left for the disabled. And that puts not only the staff in danger, the direct care staff, but it also puts the community in danger.\u201d\n\n12/31/15 Related Story: Mother Seeks To Press Charges For Alleged Caretaker Abuse At Stillwater Facility", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Over the past week, more and more families are coming forward claiming a loved one has been abused in a care facility for the disabled and mentally challenged.", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30911639/former-caretaker-for-mentally-disabled-says-reform-is-needed-to-stop-abuse", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9602945_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Over the past week, more and more families are coming forward claiming a loved one has been abused in a care facility for the disabled and mentally challenged.", "title": "Former Caretaker For Mentally Disabled Shares Experiences"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9602945_G.jpg", "description": "Over the past week, more and more families are coming forward claiming a loved one has been abused in a care facility for the disabled and mentally challenged.", "card": "summary", "title": "Former Caretaker For Mentally Disabled Shares Experiences"}, "wnreadableurl": "former-caretaker-for-mentally-disabled-says-reform-is-needed-to-stop-abuse", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/07", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22ab\"", "article_summary": "The state keeps cutting, cutting, cutting until we have nothing left for the disabled.\nOver the past week, News 9 has aired a couple different cases where people who have been living in group homes for the developmentally disabled have apparently been abused by their caretakers.\nShe said staff members were regularly attacked by their developmentally disabled clients.\nGayla Miller worked for a company for six years.\nAnd that puts not only the staff in danger, the direct care staff, but it also puts the community in danger.\u201d12/31/15 Related Story: Mother Seeks To Press Charges For Alleged Caretaker Abuse At Stillwater Facility"}
