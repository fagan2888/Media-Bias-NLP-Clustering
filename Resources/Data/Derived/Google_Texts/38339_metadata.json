As we noted recently, giving away money seems to do the trick. But for the cash-strapped or cost-conscious, newly published research suggests an enjoyable alternative: Engaging in a creative activity.\n\nIn a study of college students, \u201cpeople who reported feeling happy and active were more likely to be doing something creative at the time,\u201d a research team led by Paul Silvia of the University of North Carolina-Greensboro writes in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the researchers add, you don\u2019t have to be a master poet or painter to reap the emotional rewards. Even if the results of one\u2019s creative activity are \u201cfrivolous, amateurish or weird,\u201d this research suggests \u201cthe creative process that yielded them appears important to positive psychological development.\u201d\n\nThe week-long study featured 79 students at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, 26 of whom were pursuing an arts-related major.

They replied to each call by answering the question \u201cAre you doing something creative?\u201d and describing their emotional state at that moment. Specifically, they reported the extent to which they were currently experiencing a variety of feelings, including happy, sad, anxious, angry, and restless.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data suggest students who major in an artistic discipline or take part in creative pursuits report being happier", "title": "David Foster Wallace is an exception: Artists aren\u2019t so tortured after all", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Data suggest students who major in an artistic discipline or take part in creative pursuits report being happier", "title": "David Foster Wallace is an exception: Artists aren\u2019t so tortured after all", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/20/forget_the_stereotype_artists_may_not_be_so_tortured_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/david_foster_wallace.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Data suggest students who major in an artistic discipline or take part in creative pursuits report being happier", "title": "David Foster Wallace is an exception: Artists aren\u2019t so tortured after all", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/david_foster_wallace.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, artists, College, creativity, Pacific Standard, Positive thinking, Students", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc433\"", "article_summary": "But for the cash-strapped or cost-conscious, newly published research suggests an enjoyable alternative: Engaging in a creative activity.\nTopics: artists, College, creativity, Pacific Standard, Positive thinking, Students, Entertainment NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nSpecifically, they reported the extent to which they were currently experiencing a variety of feelings, including happy, sad, anxious, angry, and restless.\nWhat\u2019s more, the researchers add, you don\u2019t have to be a master poet or painter to reap the emotional rewards.\nThey replied to each call by answering the question \u201cAre you doing something creative?\u201d and describing their emotional state at that moment."}
