Takano assured older voters in his district that Obamacare wouldn\u2019t impact their benefits.\n\n\u201cAs far as affecting Medicare, nobody\u2019s benefits were touched,\u201d he said.\n\nBut at least one website, Don\u2019t Cut Our Medicare, said residents in the area will see there benefits cut by $1,718.79 per senior.\n\nRep.
