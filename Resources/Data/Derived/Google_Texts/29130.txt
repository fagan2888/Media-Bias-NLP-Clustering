Trader Joe’s have their own parking lots, and no they are not inside of the store. An elderly woman on Friday backed into three parked cars in a Long Island Trader Joe’s before putting her car in drive, ramming over a curb, and smashing 20 feet into the building. Fifteen were injured, reports Fox 5 out of New York on Friday.

An elderly woman's car is hauled out of the gaping hole she left in a Long Island Trader Joe's after she lost control and smashed into the building, injuring 15.

The accident occurred at the Trader Joe’s in Oceanside, Long Island around 1 p.m. on Friday. Oceanside’s First Assistant Fire Chief Kevin Klein said two were injured seriously, but that it could have been much worse.

“It’s a miracle there were no fatalities,” Klein said. “The store was crowded, and she entered through the front, right where the cash registers are, where people were lined up. . . . It was the worst-case scenario where she hit them.”

The unnamed driver of the white sedan was said to be unhurt but “disoriented.”

A dozen people were taken to hospitals, most with injuries from broken glass. At least one person was pinned by the woman’s out-of-control car.

"I looked back and realized what had happened someone drove through the front of the store, and the fact that it happened is unexplainable," said witness Eric Lemberg, who was in a checkout line when the car came smashing though.
