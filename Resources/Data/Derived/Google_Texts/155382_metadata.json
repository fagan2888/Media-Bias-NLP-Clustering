The Midwest premium paid to producers on top of the LME price has fallen more than 60 percent to around 8.9 cents a pound from record highs hit last year. Alcoa has distanced itself from the aggressive stance against China taken by rival U.S. producer Century Aluminum , which is considering launching a trade case. \"The fact that [Warrick] has to close due to illegal Chinese trade practices is a very powerful data point for a trade case,\" said Will Dempster of the China Trade Task Force, a pressure group comprised of Century, whose largest shareholder is Glencore , and the United Steelworkers. The closure could provide a boost to the premium, as Alcoa plans to keep its rolling mill open and demand from the U.S. automotive industry grows. \"It'll attract more metal to the middle of the U.S.,\" one U.S. trader said. \"Now, it's a little more bullish premiums.\" (Reporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Sandra Maler and Chris Reese)\n\nLondon Metal Exchange aluminum prices", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Warrick is the largest currently-operating smelter in the United States and the bigges", "title": "Alcoa smelter closure to bring U.S. aluminum output to post-WWII levels", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/07/Alcoa-plans-close-largest-US-aluminum-smelter-amid-tumbling-prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-alcoa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/07/Alcoa-plans-close-largest-US-aluminum-smelter-amid-tumbling-prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-alcoa_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Warrick is the largest currently-operating smelter in the United States and the bigges", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "(Reporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Sandra Maler and Chris Reese)London Metal Exchange aluminum prices\nAlcoa has distanced itself from the aggressive stance against China taken by rival U.S. producer Century Aluminum , which is considering launching a trade case.\nFive U.S. smelters will operate following Warrick's closure, compared with eight at the beginning of 2015 and 23 in 2000.\nIn a statement, Alcoa global primary products president Roy Harvey said \"these assets are not competitive\" amid \"challenging market conditions.\"\nThe closure could provide a boost to the premium, as Alcoa plans to keep its rolling mill open and demand from the U.S. automotive industry grows."}
