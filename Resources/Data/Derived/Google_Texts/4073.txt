A fire at an auto wrecking yard in the San Fernando Valley sent a huge plume of thick, black smoke over Los Angeles that could be seen for miles around before the blaze was brought under control.

The fire at Self Service Auto Recycler in Sun Valley engulfed dozens of vehicles that were tightly stacked together.

The Fire Department called the situation a major emergency. But no injuries have been reported, and no buildings are threatened.

The fire broke out shortly before 4 p.m. Sunday and churned out dark smoke for about two hours before about 150 firefighters were able to knock it down.

The Fire Department said some firefighters will stay on the scene to make sure the blaze doesn't reignite.

The cause has not yet been released.
