Unfortunately, it turns out that both of these promises were falsehoods.\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, in 2014 taxpayers funded over a thousand Obamacare health plans that subsidize abortion on demand\u2014even late-term abortion\u2014in defiance of the Hyde Amendment Obama publicly said he would honor.\n\nAdditionally, countless people have come forward and said that Obamacare actually denied them care. For example, in Utah three mothers haven\u2019t been able to add their new babies to their health insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act. According to KUTV, Maggie Long, Robin Williamson and Shawnsi Szerszen attempted to add their newborns within the 30-day window of the child being born but each was denied.\n\nMaggie explained that before she applied for health insurance through Obamacare, she was required to apply for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Policy (CHIP), which is a program offered by the state of Utah to help insure kids whose parents can\u2019t afford it. However, each of these mothers didn\u2019t qualify for CHIP because of their incomes but the marketplace insisted that they apply with them anyway.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nMaggie said, \u201cWe knew we wouldn\u2019t qualify. We didn\u2019t want to, but they said we had to.\u201d In emails and phone calls, marketplace workers assured Maggie that the enrollment window would be extended to allow for CHIP to consider her application. Of course, CHIP denied her baby and then when she turned to the marketplace to try and add her daughter, they turn her away as well. \u201cThey denied us, saying we went over our time limit and there was no evidence we tried adding her to our insurance,\u201d said Maggie.\n\nNow Maggie says she\u2019s protesting by sending marketplace workers copies of their own emails promising to extend the window. Robin and Shawnsi have similar stories and are trying to figure out how they will pay their unexpected labor and delivery bills. Robin said, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to pay $3500 out of pocket with all the other medical bills we have to pay off right now. I just want him covered.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s more:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare Will Pay for Your Abortion But Won't Include Your Baby in Your Health Insurance", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "President Obama promised that under the Affordable Care Act those who needed health insurance would be covered and that the American people wouldn\u2019t be fundin", "title": "Obamacare Will Pay for Your Abortion But Won\u2019t Include Your Baby in Your Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/02/25/obamacare-will-pay-for-your-abortion-but-wont-include-your-baby-in-your-health-insurance/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/baby41.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "obamacare will pay for your abortion but won\\'t include your baby in your health insurance", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6a4\"", "article_summary": "For example, in Utah three mothers haven\u2019t been able to add their new babies to their health insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act.\nPresident Obama promised that under the Affordable Care Act those who needed health insurance would be covered and that the American people wouldn\u2019t be funding abortions.\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, in 2014 taxpayers funded over a thousand Obamacare health plans that subsidize abortion on demand\u2014even late-term abortion\u2014in defiance of the Hyde Amendment Obama publicly said he would honor.\nMaggie explained that before she applied for health insurance through Obamacare, she was required to apply for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Policy (CHIP), which is a program offered by the state of Utah to help insure kids whose parents can\u2019t afford it.\nOf course, CHIP denied her baby and then when she turned to the marketplace to try and add her daughter, they turn her away as well."}
