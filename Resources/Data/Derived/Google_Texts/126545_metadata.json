That\u2019s what God is telling us. Er, um\u2026well that\u2019s what Ben Carson is telling us God is telling us.\n\nLook, let\u2019s just run down the checklist here, because we need to do this for all the people who have proven themselves too, shall we say, \u201coff-kilter\u201d to be trusted with high office.\n\nPlagiarist Ben Carson wants to assure us that he is not crazy. He told the winter meeting of the Republican National Committee Thursday (what the National Journal calls an \u201cestablishment-friendly\u201d audience) in California that \u201cthe liberal media\u201d is to blame for all the things he said, not all the things he said.\n\nThe National Journal reports that,\n\nCarson defended, among other things, his statements about Obamacare being the worst thing since slavery; comparing present-day America to Nazi Germany; and calling last year\u2019s Veterans Affairs scandal \u201ca gift from God\u201d because it revealed holes in the system. \u201cI stand by those\u201d remarks, Carson told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything crazy at all.\u201d\n\nNot \u201ccrazy at all.\u201d Now this is the same Ben Carson, as Justin Baragona related on Friday, who used the same meeting to compare ISIL militants to America\u2019s Founding Fathers.\n\nOh dear. But hey, at least he\u2019s not crazy. It\u2019s just a \u201ccraziness narrative.\u201d For which the liberal media is responsible. Not anything he said.\n\nYou know, like that ISIL is like the Founding Fathers.\n\nJust the fact that he thinks there is a liberal media calls his sanity into question. After all, he\u2019s not one of the yokels of the base who has been brainwashed to believe this hooey. This is one of the politicians doing the convincing.\n\nAnd he\u2019s telling a crowd that knows better. I mean, they\u2019re the ones spreading those stories.\n\nThe National Journal tells us,\n\nCarson failed to bring the crowd to its feet, save for his entrance and exit from the stage. But some lines drew sporadic applause. He decried the \u201cvictimhood\u201d mentality in America; reiterated his staunch opposition to same-sex marriage; and declared that \u201cthis is a country that is based on Judeo-Christian values and we should not throw those away.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t you think that the very need to reassure people in your own party that you are not crazy is a sign that perhaps you should not run?\n\nApparently, Carson did not make this connection, because next thing you know\u2026\n\nThe Iowa Republican is telling us Friday in an exclusive, that Carson has \u201ctabbed Iowa political operative Ryan Rhodes to oversee his presidential campaign in our First-in-the-Nation caucus state.\u201d\n\nCarson is expected to launch an exploratory committee \u201cwithin the next two or three weeks\u2019, according to national campaign chairman Terry Giles. Carson plans to officially announce his bid for the presidency by May 1.\n\nAs for Rhodes\u2026well, birds of a feather perhaps. The Iowa Republican tells us,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really something people are looking for. It\u2019s not politics as usual. There\u2019s a huge niche for him,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to turn America around, we need to make major changes. People need to take back their country from the ruling class that has set itself up in Washington, D.C. Certainly on the liberal left. That\u2019s what we intend to do,\u201d Giles added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have confidence in any of the other candidates in the race that will make changes fast enough to turn this ship around.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Rhodes hasn\u2019t noticed. The \u201cruling class\u201d in Washington is currently Republican, occupying both House and Senate. The \u201cliberal left\u201d (as opposed to the liberal right?) controls only the White House.\n\nRhodes wants to \u201cturn this ship around.\u201d Let\u2019s look at that for a minute, at the America of George W. Bush, the car, as President Obama once put it, driven into the ditch. Locked in two wars with no end in sight, our economy in shambles. Obama took us away from that. Rhodes apparently wants to bring us back.\n\nSwell. He\u2019s got plenty of company.\n\nBut what does Carson have that other Republicans don\u2019t have?\n\nGod?\n\nThey all have God, to listen to them. Carson told the Brody File over at CBN that he\u2019s feeling \u201cfingers from God\u201d to run for president.\n\nWow, how convincing is that?\n\nBut Carson\u2019s problems don\u2019t end at his imagined \u201cliberal media.\u201d Even conservatives have a problem with him:\n\nDavid Brody concluded that, if \u201cDr. Carson runs for president, he\u2019s going to shake up politics and politicians\u201d because \u201cHe\u2019s not your typical, lunch bucket Republican\u201d (I\u2019m not too sure of that).\n\nHe tells us that \u201cThere will be pitfalls for sure as the mainstream media takes aim during the vetting process\u201d (gee, I wonder why?) but that Carson will \u201cappeal to apply reason and logic to a number of issues in a precise, surgical way.\u201d\n\nHe will what?\n\nThis is the same Ben Carson who attacked Obamacare on the grounds that it\u2019s unconstitutional because it doesn\u2019t help everybody, even though the law\u2019s table of contents, which we can be sure Carson hasn\u2019t read (if he had, he\u2019d be a liberal) says, \u201cQUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS.\u201d\n\nThis is the same Ben Carson who exposed a Marxist plot to \u201cgay-up\u201d America. Because those Bolsheviks are all about the gay.\n\nThis is the same Ben Carson who said that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen to America since slavery.\n\nAnd this is the same Ben Carson who blamed Michael Brown\u2019s death not on a whole bunch of police bullets fired into his body but on his lack of a father figure, and who said protesters were part of a \u201cme generation.\u201d The alleged \u201cme generation\u201d he blamed on women\u2019s libbers. Of course.\n\nReason and logic, eh?\n\nWe\u2019ll hear from Ben Carson again in a few days, because he is confirmed to be at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 24, along with the rest of the Republican brain trust, including Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Perry, who announced on Friday he is \u201cready\u201d for a White House run. No word on if he is also awaiting a final okay from God.\n\nYellow Dog Yankee pointed out here yesterday that we need to take the 2016 general election seriously, and we do. It\u2019s just that it would be so much easier if they could give us a candidate we could take seriously.\n\nDavid Brody says Carson will \u201cbe a breath of fresh air.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s one way of putting it, but I wouldn\u2019t breathe too deeply", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feeling \"fingers from God\" but assuring us he is not crazy, Ben Carson has appointed an Iowa operative for a possible presidential run in 2016", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Feeling \"fingers from God\" but assuring us he is not crazy, Ben Carson has appointed an Iowa operative for a possible presidential run in 2016", "title": "It's On!
