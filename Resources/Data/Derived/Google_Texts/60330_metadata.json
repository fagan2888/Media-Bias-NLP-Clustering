The authors identified 662 residents with claims from an RHC, 975 from a FQHC and 1,793 from a CAH.\n\nThe percentage of physicians practicing in a safety-net setting in 2009 after training in a similar setting from 2001-2005 was 38.1 percent (RHCs), 31.2 percent (FQHCs) and 52.6 (CAHs).\n\nEven though theirs wasn't the first research on the topic, the team didn't expect such dramatic results. \"The association was surprisingly potent,\" said Phillips. \"About one-third to one-half of young physicians who train in one of these underserved settings -- rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers and critical access hospitals -- will return to work in one of those settings after they complete training. This is 10-20 times higher than usual.\"\n\nResearchers said that although they did not compare residents in the study with those who did not train in safety-net settings, \"We do know that just 2 percent of all graduating M.D. residents go on to practice in an FQHC or RHC.\"\n\nRecommendations Moving Forward\n\n\n\nTo prepare for the anticipated surge in health care demand fueled by the Affordable Care Act, the authors made several recommendations that could spur an increase in training of residents in safety-net settings and ultimately put more primary care physicians in underserved areas.\n\nThey suggested that medical education policymakers\n\n\n\nexpand and modify the teaching health center (THC) graduate medical education (GME) program that was created to establish new residency programs in FQHCs and RHCs;\n\n\n\nredistribute unfilled GME positions but with clearer guidance than was done by Congress when it redistributed 3,000 position in 2005;\n\n\n\nincrease current GME funding with the caveat that new funding be used to train residents in RHCs, CAHs and FQHCs; and\n\n\n\nremove indirect medical education payments that go beyond training expenses, and use that money to fund a new performance-based GME program.\n\n\"We recommend reauthorizing and expanding the THC-GME program, increasing the use of cost-based GME reimbursement in CAHs, or expanding training at safety-net sites as a condition for receiving additional GME funding,\" concluded the authors.\n\nIn addition, Phillips urged family physicians to support the AAFP in advocating for changes in GME funding that support family medicine training in rural and underserved areas \"as recommended by the Institute of Medicine in 1989 and by the U.S. Council on Graduate Medical Education at least five times since.\"\n\n\"At a time when less than one in five trainees is choosing primary care, less than one in 10 is interested in working in primary care, and less than one in 20 goes to work in a rural area, we are identifying important strategies for GME funding that could improve the effectiveness and accountability of our teaching hospitals,\" said Phillips, pointing out that teaching hospitals receive $13 billion each year to train physicians.\n\nRelated ANN Coverage\n\nRobert Graham Center Research\n\nBuilding More Medical Schools Won't Solve Patient Access
