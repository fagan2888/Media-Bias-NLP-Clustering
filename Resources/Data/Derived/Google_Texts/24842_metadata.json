However, applicants will instead be offered cost-free drug treatment, and their children and dependents will still be able to access assistance funds through a third party protective payee who can accept the benefits on their behalf.\n\nIn a 2012 Heritage Foundation report on welfare spending, research fellows Robert Rector and Katherine Bradley argue that as welfare spending approaches $1 trillion per year, taxpayers deserve to know their money is being spent wisely.\n\n\u201cThose who pay for the welfare state can properly insist that their aid go to those who are truly in need and not be wasted on frivolous or self-destructive activities, such as illegal drug use,\u201d Rector and Bradley wrote.\n\nSchaffer and Maag\u2019s new legislation seeks to \u201ccontinue the fight against the drug epidemic that is ravaging our state,\u201d said Schaffer.\n\n\u201cThis program will not be a means to deny benefits, but rather a means to identify those who need treatment,\u201d Schaffer explained.\n\n\u201cIt will keep taxpayer dollars out of the hands of drug dealers, protect children and get folks off of drugs and back on their feet,\u201d he added.\n\nThe introduction of this bill comes after a report cited by Schaffer and Maag that studied how to best reform the OWF program. In its findings, it showed that substance abuse and inability to pass a drug test were the top barriers to economic independence and reducing reliance on welfare aid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug addicts would be offered treatment, not welfare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Drug addicts would be offered treatment, not welfare.", "title": "Ohio Lawmakers Push to Drug-Test Welfare Recipients", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/805drugs.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-05T23:13:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1eT3i39"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Drug addicts would be offered treatment, not welfare.", "title": "Ohio Lawmakers Push to Drug-Test Welfare Recipients", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/805drugs.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "entitlement reform", "published_time": "2015-08-05T12:49:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T23:13:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ohio, welfare, drug testing, tim Schaffer, rob Maag, substance abuse, treatment, benefits"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb037\"", "article_summary": "Ohio lawmakers are expected to formally introduce legislation Wednesday that will require welfare recipients to pass a drug test before receiving benefits.\nIn the event that the drug test is positive, the person will not receive any welfare benefits.\nIn its findings, it showed that substance abuse and inability to pass a drug test were the top barriers to economic independence and reducing reliance on welfare aid.\nIf the screening shows that a person is likely to be dependent on drugs, the applicant must take a drug test to proceed.\n\u201cThis program will not be a means to deny benefits, but rather a means to identify those who need treatment,\u201d Schaffer explained."}
