RAGBRAI: Official site

* * *

After stops in Iowa’s biggest cities the past two years, RAGBRAI will return this year to its small-town roots.

The Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will begin this year in Rock Valley, a northwestern Iowa town of 3,354, and end 418 miles away in Guttenberg, a northeastern Iowa town of 1,919. This year’s ride will be July 20 to 26.

Riders will stop overnight in Okoboji, Emmetsburg, Forest City, Mason City, Waverly and Independence. Mason City is the only overnight city on the route with a population over 10,000.

“There are no massive towns,” RAGBRAI Director T.J. Juskiewicz told the Des Moines Register. “We’re getting back to smaller communities, which are the perfect size for RAGBRAI.”

RAGBRAI has spent nights in Iowa’s two biggest cities in the past two years, Des Moines in 2013 and Cedar Rapids in 2012.

At 418 miles and with 11,316 feet of climb, the 2014 ride will be the third-shortest and second-flattest in history.
