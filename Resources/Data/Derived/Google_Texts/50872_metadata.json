The vote went directly along party lines, with the Republicans overwhelming the Democratic minority.\n\nThe bill proposal is the third time in the three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed in which state lawmakers engaged in an extended debate over Medicaid expansion. Democratic Senator Paul LeVota, who proposed the bill, said he wants to continue to fight for Medicaid expansion in the face of the greater Republican opposition.\n\n\u201cI think that we have to keep pressing the issue,\u201d LeVota said. \u201cI think we have to try to explain to more people in Missouri why this is a good idea, and we have to keep those elected representatives who aren\u2019t doing the right thing by Missourians accountable.\u201d\n\nThe proposed expansion would provide medical coverage to able-bodied Missouri residents with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or a yearly income of $32,913 for a four-person family. Approximately 300,000 Missouri residents would be eligible for Medicaid if the expansion were approved.\n\nRepublican Senator Will Kraus said the two-hour debate ultimately proved futile, and he added he is not optimistic for the future of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI do not know if (the expansion proposal) will ever move forward,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cI know that there are some Republicans that are working on a compromise. But straight up expansion, the way it was proposed, the answer is no.\u201d\n\nMatthew Patterson, the executive director of Missouri Pro Vote, a pro-Medicaid expansion activist organization, said he feels the debate serves as a healthy step forward in the fight to get Medicaid expansion passed.\n\n\u201cI think it will open up more of a dialogue between our party leaders on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut I think that this needs to happen, and the discussion is now, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree with what we\u2019re trying to do, then what can we work together on?\u2019\u201d\n\nA University of Missouri study found Medicaid expansion could potentially create 24,000 additional healthcare jobs in Missouri.\n\nCorrection: A previous Web version of this story incorrectly stated that a University of Missouri study found Medicaid expansion could create 240,000 additional healthcare jobs in Missouri.
