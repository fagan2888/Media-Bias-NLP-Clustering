TOM BEVAN, RCP EXECUTIVE EDITOR: [Hillary Clinton] has foreign policy experience -- and will have more than anyone who the Republicans put forward – from her time as Secretary of State. But the question is, will she make the case that she made a positive impact?



Republicans are already pointing towards Benghazi-- It is where the first American ambassador died on her watch since 1979. And they point to the reset with Russia – a total failure, and Obama’s foreign policy in the Middle East that is a mess.



Foreign policy; it may not be a strong suit for Clinton. Events can change, there is a long time to go, but it is an open question whether that foreign policy experience will be a plus or minus for her...



Last time around she was ridiculed for her announcement; She said “I am in it to win it.” It was about her and it was about winning. This way she is going out of her way to make sure it is about everybody else. And watching her video her team is making that clear. It is a reaction. She will try to portray herself as a champion of every day working Americans.



Whether that comes off as phony and contrived or she's able to rewrite the script and make that connection we'll have to see. It will be interesting…



It is not only on foreign policy, although that is where she is most tied to the president, but on Obamacare and other issues as well, right?



She doesn't want to run for Barack Obama's third term. That doesn't work. She has to find ways to differentiate herself and yet doing that without alienating the base that elected Obama twice. She needs to keep them together to win the general election. That is an interesting needle to thread and she is not a great campaigner and she might be rusty. It is interesting to see how she would be able do that in the coming months.
