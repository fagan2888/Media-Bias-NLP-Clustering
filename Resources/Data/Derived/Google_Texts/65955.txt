Dancing offers moderate-intensity, health-enhancing physical activity

"One, two, three and four," calls out dance instructor, Debra Endres, as a group of 15 dancers move through the steps for West Coast swing. "This move is getting our brains to really fire on both sides," laughs Endres, while the group performs a complicated maneuver. Endres teaches "couples dance" with Okay Dance Studio, which she created in 2007.

A renewed interest in dancing has emerged over several years as people have watched television shows such as "Dancing with the Stars" and "So You Think You Can Dance."

Endres, who teaches swing, Latin, ballroom and country, has seen the increased interest among both individuals and in the community at large. Last year the Loveland Chamber of Commerce hosted a "Dancing with the Stars" competition with local "stars" dancing with their more experienced counterparts. Canyon Concert Ballet hosted a "Dancing with the Stars" on Feb. 21, in which Endres performed a swing with a local star.

There has also been an increase in the number of men coming to dance classes wanting to learn to dance for the father/daughter dance at their daughter's wedding. "Here are these dads that are very accomplished in their business life and now they freak out," says Endres. "They have to get in front of their peers and family. The dads will come in and really want to put on something very nice. They work very hard at trying to do the best for their daughter."

Anyone who's danced a West Coast swing, a country two-step or any number of Latin dances, knows that while dancing is fun and a great social activity, it can also have huge physical benefits for individuals of all ages.

Dancing can be a great aerobic workout, if it is active enough to raise a person's heart rate. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health promotion considers dancing a moderate-intensity, health-enhancing physical activity. "Any of the dances that have your feet moving faster, such as jitterbug, swing, salsa and country two-step, will work your heart more," says Endres.

"It's like anything," she says. "It is how much energy you put into it. A waltz can be energetic, if you're moving around the floor."

Endres sees dancing as the "culmination" of other types of fitness workouts. "Working out in the gym is fine, but dancing brings in the element of the partnership, the music, the touch, the smiles," she shares. "It's also going to develop your balance, your posture, your attitude.

"My goal and mission is to bring dance to people and let them see the benefits of going outside their comfort zone. It's communicative and develops patience and awareness."

The dancers at Okay Dance's recent West Coast Swing workshop were a diverse group. Some came as couples, others as singles. Some were a little older. One couple was quite young. Perhaps that's the beauty of dance. It is a medium for all ages and abilities.

"What's fun about partner dancing is that you forget that it's exercise," shares Endres. "Once the music starts and someone asks you to dance, you're on floor and you keep it going for the duration of the song. Then often right after, someone else asks you to dance."

Endres encourages those who think they can't learn to dance, to "Give it a try first." Start slowly with things that you can do. If you don't give up, you can be dancing."

The benefits of dancing are numerous, notes AARP magazine, listing that it can:

• Strengthen bones and muscles without hurting your joints.

• Tone your entire body.

• Improve your posture and balance, which can prevent falls.

• Increase your stamina and flexibility.

• Reduce stress and tension.

• Build confidence.

• Provide opportunities to meet people.

• Ward off illnesses liked diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoporosis and depression.

"Dancing is movement," adds Endres. "It's about moving rhythmically to the music and helping your partner feel comfortable. You might just do the 'high school sway' — but you're still dancing."
