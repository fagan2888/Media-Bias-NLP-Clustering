Tulsa police officers arrested a hit and run driver on Friday, exactly two years to the day after 43-year-old Lelah "Missy" Kelley, died.

The Gilcrease Traffic Unit arrested Sandra Gunnells Friday afternoon on warrants.

Prosecutors charged her with felony leaving the scene of a fatal accident that happened January 9 on North Saint Louis, in Tulsa.

Police say Kelley was walking when she was hit by a vehicle and left to die.

She passed away the next day.

Police say they were first called to the scene on a report of an assault victim, but instead they found a woman who had been run over by a vehicle.

Officers and the victim's family have been working the case hard, but, had no leads on a vehicle or a suspect until recently.
