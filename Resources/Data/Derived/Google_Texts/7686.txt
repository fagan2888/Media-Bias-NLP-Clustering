Barbers and hair stylists from across the area gathered at the Frank Cochran Center Saturday evening, for their annual Barbers & Beauticians Ball.

Well over a thousand people gathered in the center for a night of fellowship and entertainment. One barber says there is more to the job than just cutting hair.

"There's more to being a barber or a stylist, than just cutting or styling hair," Barber Rickey Boggan said. "It's a form of art and it's all about being better than the barber or stylist on the next block."

That show wrapped up at 9 o'clock that evening.
