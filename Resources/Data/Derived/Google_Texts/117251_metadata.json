Agee, pictured, who oversees Carilion's $1.7 billion integrated healthcare system that includes seven hospitals, 1,000 physicians and 80 primary care physicians, called the pace of change in the past decade as staggering. For Carilion, the evolution, or what Agee refers to as a revolution, began seven years ago when the hospital system began its transformation to a clinic environment and divided the organization into eight departments, with a physician and non-physician chair overseeing each department.\n\nTo meet the demand of consumers, Carilion's physician leaders advocated for the organization to transition patients from primary care settings patient-centered medical homes. The practice model offers a proactive team-based approach to care, with physicians as team leaders, and a particular focus on higher risk patients with three or more chronic illnesses. If patients' needs extend beyond what is available in the practice, the care coordinator at the medical home will identify and connect patients to those resources.\n\nThe organization is now beginning to see promising results, according to Agee, including a 34 percent decrease in patients' use of the emergency department (ED) and a 44 percent decline in readmissions. Patient satisfaction rates are also up, she said, noting that they are above the 75th percentile, but Carilion's goal is to get above 90 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During the American Hospital Association's annual meeting Tuesday, the presidents and CEOs from\u00a0Carilion Clinic\u00a0in Roanoke, Virginia, Cedars-Sinai\u00a0in Los Angeles and\u00a0Trinity Health\u00a0in Livonia, Michigan, discussed the new initiatives to address the demands of a consumer-driven market.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "During the American Hospital Association's annual meeting Tuesday, the presidents and CEOs from\u00a0Carilion Clinic\u00a0in Roanoke, Virginia, Cedars-Sinai\u00a0in Los Angeles and\u00a0Trinity Health\u00a0in Livonia, Michigan, discussed the new initiatives to address the demands of a consumer-driven market.", "title": "Consumer-driven healthcare: How three organizations respond to the demands of patient-centered care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/consumer-driven-healthcare-how-three-organizations-respond-demands-patient/2015-05-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "AHA15,Anthem Blue Cross,Care Delivery,Carilion Clinic,Cedars Sinai Medical Center,consumer-driven healthcare,Operations & Business Management,Partnerships,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient-centered medical homes,Trinity Health,Urgent Care Centers,Vivity", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To meet the demand of consumers, Carilion's physician leaders advocated for the organization to transition patients from primary care settings patient-centered medical homes.\nNancy H.
