Q: Is it a good idea to buy sports drinks and bottled water with vitamins and minerals added?

A: Even though the amounts of added nutrients in these drinks are typically small, some nutrition scientists are concerned that many people may be ingesting levels of vitamins and other nutrients that are not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful.

“You have vitamins and minerals that occur naturally in foods, and then you have people taking supplements, and then you have all these fortified foods,” said Mridul Datta of Purdue University. “It adds up to quite an excess. There’s the potential for people to get a lot more of these vitamins than they need.”

One study analyzed 46 beverages sold in supermarkets alongside bottled water.

It found many of the drinks contained vitamins B6, B12, niacin and vitamin C in quantities “well in excess” of average daily requirements for young adults.

Particularly concerning, experts say, is the explosion of beverages marketed for their high levels of antioxidants. The body requires antioxidants to neutralize free radicals that can damage cells and their DNA. But it also uses free radicals to fight off infections and cancer cells, and when antioxidants are present in excess, it can throw things off balance.

“It’s very hard to figure out the logic the manufacturers are using to do this fortification,” said Valerie Tarasuk, a nutrition scientist the University of Toronto.

“There’s no way that the things that are being added are things that anybody needs or stands to benefit from.”
