The decision was not totally unexpected, given that Bryant has said many times in recent weeks that he was considering making his 20th NBA season his last.\n\nThere\u2019s no more wondering now.\n\nAfter two decades, two Olympic gold medals, five championship rings, 17 All-Star selections, an 81-point game that ranks as the second-best in NBA history and more than 32,000 points, Bryant\u2019s career is officially winding down.\n\n\u201cThis season is all I have left to give,\u201d Bryant said in what he called a letter entitled \u201cDear Basketball.\u201d\n\nBryant said in an interview on Sirius XM Radio just last week that \u201cif something changes,\u201d he would come back and play next season. Only a few days later, that\u2019s apparently no longer an option.\n\n\u201cMy heart can take the pounding. My mind can handle the grind. But my body knows it\u2019s time to say goodbye,\u201d Bryant wrote in the post. \u201cAnd that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m ready to let you go. I want you to know now. So we both can savor every moment we have left together. The good and the bad. We have given each other all that we have.\u201d\n\nBryant ranks third on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list, and only 13 players in league history played on more championship teams. Bryant helped the Lakers to titles in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010.\n\n\u201cKobe Bryant is one of the greatest players in the history of our game,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cWhether competing in the Finals or hoisting jump shots after midnight in an empty gym, Kobe has an unconditional love for the game. I join Kobe\u2019s millions of fans around the world in congratulating him on an outstanding NBA career and thank him for so many thrilling memories.\u201d\n\nThis season has been a struggle for Bryant, whose young and rebuilding Lakers are mired at the bottom of the Western Conference standings while he\u2019s shooting a career-worst 32 percent. Injuries have dogged him in recent years as well, limiting him to 41 of a possible 164 games in the previous two seasons. And even this season, back issues have kept him from playing as much as he would like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to see one of the absolute greatest competitors go through this,\u201d Miami guard Dwyane Wade told The Associated Press on Sunday, prior to Bryant making his announcement. \u201cYou can put a team around a guy to help a guy, especially late in his career. They\u2019re just not in position right now to do that. He\u2019s won five championships, so no one feels bad for him from that standpoint. But from a standpoint of seeing one of this era\u2019s greatest players go out in a rebuilding process, it\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers have 66 games remaining after Sunday and it will likely turn into a adoration tour for Bryant, who has already gotten long ovations on road trips this season, particularly in places like New York and Miami where crowds sensed that they might be seeing him as an opponent for the final time.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 next road game is, perhaps not coincidentally given the timing of Bryant\u2019s announcement, on Tuesday in Philadelphia \u2014 his hometown.\n\n\u201cPhilly is where I grew up,\u201d Bryant told AP in an interview in Miami earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s always a different emotion there than anywhere else.\u201d\n\nBryant came into the NBA straight out of high school, won the dunk contest at All-Star weekend as a rookie, played in the All-Star game for the first time the following year and a star was fast born. The 81 points he scored against Toronto on Jan. 22, 2006, are second only to Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s 100-point game in NBA history, and he\u2019s the only player to spend 20 consecutive seasons with the same team.\n\nAP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kobe Bryant says he will retire at end of 2015-16 season", "title": "Kobe Bryant says he will retire at end of 2015-16 season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/kobe-bryant-says-he-will-retire-at-end-of-2015-16-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129_051240_kobe-bryant-1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129_051240_kobe-bryant-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T17:14:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:47:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers has decided to retire after this season.\n\u201cKobe Bryant is one of the greatest players in the history of our game,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.\nThe decision was not totally unexpected, given that Bryant has said many times in recent weeks that he was considering making his 20th NBA season his last.\nThe 37-year-old Bryant made the announcement in a post on The Players\u2019 Tribune on Sunday.\n\u201cPhilly is where I grew up,\u201d Bryant told AP in an interview in Miami earlier this month."}
