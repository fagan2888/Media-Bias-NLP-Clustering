Bill Young (R-Fla.) have been tripped up by unforced errors this week in a race that\u2019s expected to come down to the wire.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring a Tuesday debate, Democrat Alex Sink gave an inelegant rationale for the need for immigration reform, and her Republican opponent, David Jolly , is calling on her to apologize for them.\u201cImmigration reform is important in our country ... because we have a lot of employers over on the beaches that rely upon workers, and especially in this high-growth environment, where are you going to get people to work to clean out hotel rooms or do our landscaping?\u201d she said in a clip of the debate posted on conservative site Newsmax \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need to put those employers in a position of hiring undocumented and illegal workers,\u201d she added.The comments were picked up by a number of local blogs, and Republicans immediately pounced on them, with the Sarasota Republican Party blasting out the video with the label \u201cRacist Liberal Democrat Alex Sink.\u201d\n\nJolly's campaign called the remarks \"truly disturbing and offensive,\" and said they indicate she's out of touch with the district.\n\n\"Alex Sink's comments during the debate this week were truly disturbing and offensive. She should apologize immediately. These comments are inappropriate and show just how out of touch Alex Sink truly is with the people of Pinellas County,\" said spokeswoman Sarah Bascom in an email to The Hill.\n\n\n\nSink has made several poorly worded statements that quickly went viral in the race. She previously said of Democrats\u2019 hopes of taking back the House, \u201cit\u2019s not happening.\" And Republicans have turned her comments on the \u201cexciting prospect\u201d of ObamaCare resulting in Americans working fewer hours into an attack ad.\n\n\n\nBut it remains to be seen how much traction the comments will get, as Republican David Jolly is grappling with issues of his own this week.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s had to answer questions about a decades-old car crash in which he was driving and a man died. Jolly was never charged for the death and, he said, \u201cexonerated of any culpability,\u201d but it nonetheless generated negative headlines for the Republican.\n\n\n\nAnd on Tuesday, a Tampa Bay Times report revealed Jolly received a tax break on both his Washington, D.C., and Pinellas County, Fla., homes by declaring both as his principal residence.\n\n\n\nA campaign consultant later clarified that Jolly paid back the D.C. tax credit after realizing it was incorrect.\n\n\n\nBut the news threatens to undercut one of the advantages Jolly's tried to build in the race: that because he\u2019s been a full-time resident of Pinellas County since buying a condo there in 2005, he has deeper connections to the area than Sink, who moved to the district to run for office there.\n\nMultiple polls of the race, both public and private, have shown it to be close, and outside groups and the candidates have already poured a reported $8.2 million into the district in advertising, not including hundreds of thousands more spent on mailers.\n\nA survey out Wednesday from the conservative Chamber of Commerce, which has endorsed Jolly, put the Republican just two points ahead of Sink, 44 to 42 percent support. The two candidates are tied, however, with voters who say they\u2019re definitely going to vote in the March 11 election.\n\nThe swing district has become more competitive for Democrats with Young's passing. But the error-prone candidates have made it anything but a slam-dunk for either party.\n\n\u2014This piece was updated at 2 p.m. to reflect comment from Jolly's campaign and the Chamber poll.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "In a debate, the Democratic candidate gave an inelegant rationale for the need for reform.", "description": "In a debate, the Democratic candidate gave an inelegant rationale for the need for reform.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "In a debate, the Democratic candidate gave an inelegant rationale for the need for reform.", "title": "Sink: Immigration reform needed to provide housekeepers", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/199311-sink-immigration-reform-needed-to-provide-hotel-housekeepers-and", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/housekeeping_maid_hotel_061111getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-26T13:59:29-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-02-26T13:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/199311-sink-immigration-reform-needed-to-provide-hotel-housekeepers-and", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-26T12:12-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Alexandra Jaffe", "author": "Alexandra Jaffe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "FL-13 Special Election,Alex Sink, David Jolly,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-26T12:12:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T13:59:29-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/199311-sink-immigration-reform-needed-to-provide-hotel-housekeepers-and", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "In a debate, the Democratic candidate gave an inelegant rationale for the need for reform.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sink: Immigration reform needed to provide housekeepers"}, "dcterms.title": "Sink: Immigration reform needed to provide housekeepers"}, "article_summary": "These comments are inappropriate and show just how out of touch Alex Sink truly is with the people of Pinellas County,\" said spokeswoman Sarah Bascom in an email to The Hill.\nSink has made several poorly worded statements that quickly went viral in the race.\n\"Alex Sink's comments during the debate this week were truly disturbing and offensive.\nAnd on Tuesday, a Tampa Bay Times report revealed Jolly received a tax break on both his Washington, D.C., and Pinellas County, Fla., homes by declaring both as his principal residence.\nA survey out Wednesday from the conservative Chamber of Commerce, which has endorsed Jolly, put the Republican just two points ahead of Sink, 44 to 42 percent support."}
