Many have pointed to the heinous acts going on at the VA, secret waiting lists that have led to the death of veterans and the suffering of many more, as an example of government\u2019s incompetence to run such a large bureaucracy. Those that will suffer are the individuals who entrust their health care to the almighty big government.\n\nKristol echoed the concerns of Americans at the inefficiency and danger of government run healthcare, despite large increases in funding under Obama, as demonstrated by the VA Scandal. With the inability to fire individuals, there is little that can be done for incompetence or apathy.\n\nHis resolution involved a fundamental reformation of the VA in a manner that he likened to the G.I. Bill. His idea on what needs to be done in order to provide better health care to our veterans came after Smiley attempted to change the subject and play the blame game by bringing up the fact that many Republicans want to repeal Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "06-02-14", "dc.format": "text/html", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "06-02-14", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/06/02/watch-bill-kristol-takes-down-tavis-smiley-va-scandal-one-sentence", "type": "article", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/Kristol-Smiley.jpg", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "title": "WATCH: Bill Kristol Takes Down Tavis Smiley on VA Scandal With One Sentence"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/Kristol-Smiley.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"WATCH: Bill Kristol Takes Down Tavis Smiley on VA Scandal With One Sentence\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/06\\/02\\/watch-bill-kristol-takes-down-tavis-smiley-va-scandal-one-sentence\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/Kristol-Smiley.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-02T21:18:19-04:00\",\"identifier\":\"65133\"}", "prism.section": "nation", "dc.date": "2016-05-25", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"WATCH: Bill Kristol Takes Down Tavis Smiley on VA Scandal With One Sentence\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/06\\/02\\/watch-bill-kristol-takes-down-tavis-smiley-va-scandal-one-sentence\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/Kristol-Smiley.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-02T21:18:19-04:00\",\"post_id\":\"65133\"}", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "dc.language": "en-US", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "WATCH: Bill Kristol Takes Down Tavis Smiley on VA Scandal With One Sentence"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8027\"", "article_summary": "TPNN:On ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, The Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol appeared alongside former BET and NPR host Tavis Smiley to discuss the VA Scandal.\nKristol echoed the concerns of Americans at the inefficiency and danger of government run healthcare, despite large increases in funding under Obama, as demonstrated by the VA Scandal.\nThose that will suffer are the individuals who entrust their health care to the almighty big government.\nHis resolution involved a fundamental reformation of the VA in a manner that he likened to the G.I.\nWith the inability to fire individuals, there is little that can be done for incompetence or apathy."}
