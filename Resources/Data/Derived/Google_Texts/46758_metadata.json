We regret that error. The post has been edited so that it no longer contains the incorrect information.\n\nBy Elaine Korry\n\nMaria Ramirez began caring for her granddaughter when the girl was just a toddler. Her granddaughter began hurting herself \u2014 cutting her arms and swallowing things \u2014 before she was 10. Soon, says Ramirez, she couldn\u2019t let the girl out of her sight. \u201cShe was running in front of cars, just really impulsive,\u201d says Ramirez. \u201cIt was out of control, and I was really scared.\u201d\n\nRamirez has a job and health insurance, so she did what any parent or guardian would do: she took her granddaughter to her local hospital for treatment. But instead of finding help, she always got the same reply, \u201cNo beds, no beds.\u201d\n\nRamirez, a Bay Area artist who loves gardening, says she knew early on that her granddaughter was going to need help. \u201cShe was a hard child to make smile. She was very serious,\u201d says Ramirez.\n\nShe was also very anxious. The girl couldn\u2019t leave the bathroom if there was water in the tub. A wrinkled bedspread could ruin her day. By the time she was 12 she was taking medication and seeing a therapist. But she was not getting better.\n\nThen one day she stabbed herself. Ramirez rushed her to a psychiatric emergency service, where she remained for days.\n\n\u201cIt had been five days, and she was not getting helped,\u201d says Ramirez. \u201cShe was confined. There was no intervention, there was no therapy, there were no services. There was nothing.\u201c\n\nFinally the girl was admitted to a child psychiatric facility.\n\nNo Regional Planning\n\nLiz Stallings is the chief operations officer at John Muir Behavioral Health Center in Contra Costa County and expert on child mental health care. She, says the scarcity of hospital beds is a problem throughout California. \u201cWe have 12 child beds here at John Muir Behavioral Health, and they are occupied all the time from all over the state,\u201d says Stallings.\n\nStallings, a psychiatric nurse, also chairs the California Hospital Association Center for Behavioral Health. The CHA has been sounding an alarm over the steady loss of hospital beds for adult and child psychiatric emergencies. In the entire state there are now fewer than 100 beds reserved for children 12 and under. Most of those beds are in the Bay Area or the Los Angeles basin; the overwhelming majority of California\u2019s 58 counties have no beds at all for your children experiencing a psychiatric emergency.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen overnight, according to Stallings. Lawmakers decentralized mental health care in the 1990s, which gave counties more local control \u2014 at the expense of regional planning. Both private and county hospitals started closing psychiatric wards to save money. \u201cThere is no planning process,\u201d says Stallings. \u201cThey just expect me to absorb these patients.\u201d\n\nSince John Muir\u2019s beds are always occupied, local children can wind up stalled in the ER, like Ramirez\u2019 granddaughter. Or they are sent far away, where their parents can\u2019t visit or attend family therapy.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem officials in some counties are working to address.\n\nGail Price was appointed to the Santa Clara County Mental Health Board after her own son\u2019s psychiatric emergency. Now she co-chairs of the Family, Adolescents & Children\u2019s Committee At 17 he had an episode of bipolar mania, which took the entire family by surprise. \u201cIt is very anxiety-producing, and most people are not prepared for this,\u201d says Price.\n\nPrice was shocked to find that wealthy Santa Clara County doesn\u2019t have a single hospital psychiatric bed for adolescents. So she rallied all her connections and finally got her son admitted to a hospital about an hour away. He\u2019s doing better now, but Price never forgot the experience. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable. We speak English; we have transportation and resources. We were very fortunate, but I often think of individuals who did not have the advantages we had,\u201d says Price.\n\nSome of the hospital closures were done with the best intentions: public health officials and some mental health advocates insist psychiatric patients respond better to treatment in community settings, instead of being locked in a hospital. Price says that may be true for stable patients, but in a real emergency such as her son\u2019s, Price says people need more structured intervention. Not only that, she adds, budget cuts have left most county services, including mental health, in tatters. \u201cFrankly, I think it\u2019s a lack of political will,\u201d says Price. \u201cThe data\u2019s there, and it\u2019s clear we have a moral responsibility to do something.\u201d\n\nWhen mental illness is treated, people can recover. But left untreated, their jobs and relationships can suffer. Many people with a serious mental illness wind up homeless or in jail. Earlier this year, state lawmakers recognized that after years of deep budget cuts, they needed to shore up the mental health system. Under the leadership of Sen. Darrel Steinberg, (D-Sacramento), the legislature approved $206 million in new mental health funding.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s lacking in the system is the crisis beds that allow somebody to get stable and the people who can help somebody get from those settings to a place where they can begin to get help,\u201d says Steinberg.\n\nRamirez\u2019s granddaughter now lives in a psychiatric residential program for teenagers.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the second of three stories about psychiatric inpatient services airing this week on The California Report. In part one, reporter Elaine Korry looked at the lack of psychiatric inpatient services for adults. In part three, Korry looks at how new mental health funding will be implemented.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "(Debora Bogaerts/Flickr) CORRECTION: Due to a reporting error, the original version of this story incorrectly identified John Muir Medical Center, Concord as", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"How California's Mentally Ill Children Suffer -- Few Hospital Beds Statewide\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2013\\/12\\/17\\/how-californias-mentally-ill-children-suffer-few-hospital-beds-statewide\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-17 01:01:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-12-18 22:53:02\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":16746,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Hospitals\",\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/12\\/8493582332_d74b0a775d_b-e1387240744953.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "CORRECTION: Due to a reporting error, the original version of this story incorrectly identified John Muir Medical Center, Concord as the facility where Mari", "title": "How California\u2019s Mentally Ill Children Suffer \u2014 Few Hospital Beds Statewide", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2013/12/17/how-californias-mentally-ill-children-suffer-few-hospital-beds-statewide/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-16-at-9.25.34-PM-300x334.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,hospitals,mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9cf\"", "article_summary": "The CHA has been sounding an alarm over the steady loss of hospital beds for adult and child psychiatric emergencies.\nShe, says the scarcity of hospital beds is a problem throughout California.\nUnder the leadership of Sen.
