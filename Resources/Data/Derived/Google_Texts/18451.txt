— The West End lawsuit had been assigned to Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Scully, according to the Monmouth County Courthouse.

News tips received by the Asbury Park Press late Friday afternoon that it has been switched back to Superior Court Judge Lisa Thornton could not be confirmed.

The lawsuit, filed in June by West End-based attorney Scott M. Kelly on his own behalf, is challenging the legality of the new West End Overlay District. Kelly wants the zoning overturned.

The lawsuit names the city, the mayor and council as defendants.

The West End is a mix of small businesses — pizza and ice cream shops, jewelry stores and bars — and residences one block from the beach. The city rezoned the West End district in April to include new conditional uses, such as religious, performing arts and multi-family dwelling units that weren't permitted before.

Kelly alleges the city used spot zoning — the use of the zoning power to benefit particular interests rather than the collective interests of the community — when it created the West End Overlay Design. He is asking the court to grant an injunction that would temporarily prohibit the city from approving any applications in the new zone until a final ruling is made on his challenge.

It has not been assigned a court date yet.

The city has filed a motion to dismiss the case, alleging Kelly's complaint is frivolous, and potentially libelous.
