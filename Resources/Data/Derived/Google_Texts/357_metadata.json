She continues to take art to a higher level by sharing her knowledge. She is one of six advanced art students who are combined with an Art 1 class. Recently, the advanced students were asked to connect art and science through drawing. Plex brought one of her chickens into the art class to draw. She also shared her chicken with all her classmates by leading a drawing session outside. She also has been a guest student artist on occasion for the sixth-grade exploratory class. Last year, Plex was the only seventh-grader to receive a Scholastic Art Award at Southern Hills, receiving a silver key award for a 3D sculpture.\n\nWhat do you like about art?\n\nI get to express my feelings.\n\nWhat kind of art do you like best?\n\nI enjoy working on ceramics and mostly pencil for sketching. When I draw, I usually draw a fox or a dragon. I draw mostly animals. Their anatomy is more interesting, and I feel closer to nature.\n\nDo you have a favorite piece that you've done?\n\nLast year, I was working with pen and ink. I drew this bird, a robotic crow, and painted it with metallic watercolors. It was really cool and interesting. I've used it to enter in to contests.\n\nWhat advice do you have for younger students?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they think that they messed up on something, they're probably wrong. No one is ever satisfied with what they do. Just keep trying to make it better.\n\nDo you have pets?\n\nI have 21 chickens, two cats and ducks. They're happy chickens. We have different breeds, but we have the most of the Silver Spangled Hamburg. We just got the three ducks. Ducks are messy and smelly and annoying, but duck eggs are really good.\n\nWhat do you like about school?\n\nI love school. I do really well in math and science, so those are subjects I really like.\n\nWhat are you not looking forward to about the school year?\n\nNational History Day. My brain doesn't work with history. I might fail it miserably.\n\nDo you play any sports?\n\nVolleyball. I like volleyball a lot. It's fun.\n\nWhat do you like to do for fun?\n\nI go outside and play with the animals and draw.\n\nWhat's your dream job?\n\nBrain surgery. I like taking things apart.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_26665727/student-spotlight-plex-deangelo-13-year-old-eighth", "endDate": "2024-10-04T21:01:54-0600", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26665727:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-04T23:04:47-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Plex  DeAngelo, 13-year-old  eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlex DeAngelo is an extremely gifted art student, and also has a deep appreciation for animals.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Plex  DeAngelo, 13-year-old  eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle School", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_26665727/student-spotlight-plex-deangelo-13-year-old-eighth", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1004/20141004__05DCASPO~2_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-10-04T23:05:57-0600", "description": "Plex  DeAngelo, 13-year-old  eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlex DeAngelo is an extremely gifted art student, and also has a deep appreciation for animals.", "pubDate": "2014-10-04T23:08:19-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-04T23:04:47-0600", "sailthru.title": "Student Spotlight: Plex  DeAngelo, 13-year-old  eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle School", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_26665727/student-spotlight-plex-deangelo-13-year-old-eighth", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Plex  DeAngelo, 13-year-old  eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlex DeAngelo is an extremely gifted art student, and also has a deep appreciation for animals.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Plex  DeAngelo, 13-year-old  eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle School"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1004/20141004__05DCASPO~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe015b\"", "article_summary": "Click photo to enlarge \u00ab12\u00bbPlex DeAngelo, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Southern Hills Middle SchoolPlex DeAngelo is an extremely gifted art student, and also has a deep appreciation for animals.\nShe is one of six advanced art students who are combined with an Art 1 class.\nPlex brought one of her chickens into the art class to draw.\nLast year, Plex was the only seventh-grader to receive a Scholastic Art Award at Southern Hills, receiving a silver key award for a 3D sculpture.\nShe also has been a guest student artist on occasion for the sixth-grade exploratory class."}
