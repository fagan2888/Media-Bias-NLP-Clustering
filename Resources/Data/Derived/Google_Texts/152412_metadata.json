It was so small it was held at a lake house owned by the late Tom Woldert, a legendary duck hunter in Tyler for decades.\n\n\u201cFrank Fite was the first chairman, but then he got sick and I took over,\u201d recalled Rob Caton. \u201cThere were maybe 30 of us, and I think we made something like $2,000, or something like that.\u201d\n\nThe list of those attending were some big names in Tyler at the time including Tommy Swann, Barry Quick, Raymond Hedge, John Hudnall, Lloyd Waldron, Russel Watson, Woody Brookshire, Henry Bell, Watson Wise, Jim Collum and Jim Deakins. Like Woldert, many of them have died.\n\nAt that time they all had one thing in common, they lived to duck hunter in the winter. While most of them hunted ducks around the area, the state and in some cases the country, their home base then was the original Lake Palestine and then the expanded lake. Full of timber the hunting was awesome.\n\nAlso, deer hunting wasn\u2019t the force it is today. Almost no one hunted in East Texas. Those that did hunt went to South Texas or the Hill Country. Caton said the hardest of the hardcore duck hunters liked it when deer and duck season opened the same day because it reduced the number of duck hunters on the lake.\n\n\u201cIt was perfect timing,\u201d Caton said of the first banquet. \u201cIt just went wild after that and has grown and grown.\u201d\n\nSince 1990 when DU computerized its records, the Tyler chapter has raised $865,000. Last year alone Texas\u2019 49,000 DU members raised more than $6.8 million.\n\nTexas has long had a history of supporting Ducks Unlimited. The first record of the state\u2019s participation was in the early beginnings of the organization in the late 1930s when Texas duck hunters donated about $8,000. That would be the equivalent of about $135,000 today.\n\nSome of the fundraising activities enjoyed at banquets today also have their roots in Texas banquets. The Lufkin chapter is believed to be the first to hold a raffle, having started the practice in the 1960s.\n\nIn recent years the Gregg County chapter has consistently been a DU Top 100 chapter, a list that includes chapters who raised $100,000 in a year. The Tyler chapter has also found its way onto the list in previous years.\n\nThat money helps underwrite projects throughout North America.\n\nWithin Texas, DU has conserved in one fashion or another more than 228,000 acres of waterfowl habitat. Much of that has been in major wintering grounds along the coast.\n\nIn 2014 the organization provided protection funding for 2,200 coastal acres, land that is disappearing quickly. That has brought the total amount of coastal acreage protected, restored or enhanced to more than 68,000 acres in just the past 10 years.\n\nHowever, the organization has also worked with private landowners and government agencies in developing wetlands throughout the state as part of the Texas Prairie Wetlands Project and other initiatives. During the last year DU helped fund projects on 1,000 acres of public property in the state.\n\nAmong the featured items at most of this year\u2019s DU banquet are the 2014 DU Gun-of-the-Year, a Benelli Montefeltro Silver in 12-gauge and the 2014 DU Handgun-of-the-Year, a Beretta 92 FS 9-mm semi-automatic pistol.\n\nJacksonville, which will be holding its 37th banquet and auction Sept. 23 at The Legacy, kicks off the local banquet season.
