Shudder.\n\nWith \u201cThe Donald\u201d and his outsized ego as the nominee, there may not even be room on the GOP ticket for a VP pick.\n\nROBERTS: How the GOP could have saved itself from Trump\n\nRegardless, it would be a dream come true for Democrats. No need to spend time and resources dragging Trump\u2019s reputation through the mud when he\u2019s been doing that job quite nicely all on his own, thank you very much. Alienating Latinos. Juvenile name-calling. Boorish antics. This is the guy my Republican Party intends to nominate?\n\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\nTrump does not reflect the values and priorities of the GOP in 2016. Sure, he can get a crowd fired up on illegal immigration, but he has not brought anything productive to the debate. \u201cSecure the border\u201d is not a strategic plan any more than \u201csell lots of stuff\u201d is a business plan.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, illegal immigration and border security are critically important. Immigration fixes are long overdue. But we need a GOP nominee capable of leading a rational conversation without drifting into the kinds of petty mocking that has marked Trump\u2019s campaign thus far.\n\nIf we really want to Make America Great Again, as Trump sported on his baseball cap while visiting the U.S.-Mexico border, then we need to send \u201cThe Donald\u201d back to his penthouse in Manhattan.\n\nLorna Romero is associate director at Veridus, LLC, and former senior aide to Gov. Jan Brewer.\n\n----------------------------\n\nA FLIP-FLOPPER WON'T WIN\n\nBarry Dill (Photo: handout)\n\nIf Donald Trump is the GOP presidential nominee we can expect at least four more years with a Democrat as president.\n\nHowever, please don\u2019t get overly enthusiastic, my fellow Democrats. Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning the GOP nomination are about equal to an ice cube surviving an hour in the summer Phoenix sun.\n\nYou see, at one time Trump was pro-choice but now says he isn\u2019t. He hates Obamacare but has supported universal health care.\n\nHe says he support veterans then disparages the character of U.S. Sen. John McCain, a bonafide war hero. While McCain was tortured as a POW during the Vietnam War, Trump obtained three deferments.\n\nHe says he is opposed to gun control but supported banning certain weapons.\n\nIn 2013 he said he was for traditional marriage but said his views on same-sex marriage are evolving. By the way, he considers his two divorces and three marriages as \u201ctraditional.\u201d\n\nHe supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2006 and gave money to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nNot exactly a platform that mainstream Republicans are looking for.\n\nMy Republican friends' heads are spinning at the thought he may win the nomination. He is an opposition researcher\u2019s dream candidate.\n\nWhat really leaves my GOP friends depressed, and my Democrat colleagues rejoicing, is the possibility that Trump will lose the GOP primary and run as an independent. That is a much more likely scenario, which would split the GOP vote and ensure another Democrat victory.\n\nMany things have been said about Trump recently, but the Des Moines Register really hit the nail on his terribly coiffed head: \u201cHe\u2019s a feckless blowhard.\u201d\n\nBarry Dill is a partner at First Strategic Communications and Public Affairs.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1S2GQab", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "What if Donald Trump is the GOP presidential nominee?
