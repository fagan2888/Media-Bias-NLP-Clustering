Two people were seriously hurt in a bar fight in southeast Wichita.

It happened around 2 a.m. at the 300 Discoteque Bar, at 1621 S Woodlawn Blvd.

Police responded to a report of a large disturbance and found two people who were laying on the parking lot. Both were taken to a local hospital with serious injuries.

Police do know if the victims were kicked, stomped, or hit with bottles.

"It was a large fight. It started inside of the club and came outside. There are numerous people that were involved but only two had to go to the hospital," said Wichita Police Sgt. Kevin Kochenderfer.

Police are looking for surveillance video from surrounding businesses.
