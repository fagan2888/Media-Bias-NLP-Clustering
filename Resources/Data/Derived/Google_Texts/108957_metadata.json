Caption On Wednesday, Congress voted to extend funding for the federal government through early December, averting what a week ago appeared to be a likely government shutdown. Oct. 7, 2013 Ominous clouds fill the sky in front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Democrats and Republicans are still at a stalemate on funding for the federal government as the shutdown goes into a seventh day. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nShortly after the end of the government shutdown in 2013, The Washington Post and ABC News conducted a poll. \"Major damage to GOP,\" the headline stated -- and with good reason.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans disagreed with the shutdown, which lasted more than two weeks after Republicans declined to pass a budget that funded components of the Affordable Care Act before an Oct. 1 deadline. Despite attempts by the GOP to blame the event on their opponents, most Americans believed that it was congressional Republicans who were responsible.\n\nPeople responding to the Post-ABC News poll believed that the shutdown had hurt our international reputation and our economy -- with about half in each case thinking that the damage was \"serious.\"\n\nIn the midst of the shutdown, Gallup conducted a regular survey gauging how people felt about each party. The Republican Party hit \"a record low,\" Gallup reported -- the lowest favorability for either party since 1992. You can see that low point on the graph below, which shows net favorability for each party.\n\nYou can also see how, one year later, Republicans' favorability was back to normal levels -- even passing the Democrats' at around the time of the 2014 election.\n\nDuring and after the shutdown, there were regular reports that the damage to the GOP would hurt their chances the following November. It didn't. Republicans gained a dozen seats in the House (earning their biggest majority since the Great Depression) and retook the Senate.\n\nPeople often also point to the shutdown during Bill Clinton's first term as an object lesson in the danger of shutdowns. The Clinton-era shutdown overlapped with New Year 1996, and the Republicans got the blame for that one, too. In a Post-ABC poll in January 1996, 50 percent of respondents blamed the GOP.\n\nThat November, Republicans lost just three House seats, easily holding on to the majority they won in an electoral wave in 1994, and added two seats to their Senate majority. The Republican candidate for president lost, yes -- but by a huge 8.5-point spread.\n\nCongress must pass a budget before Sept. 30, or it faces partially shutting down the government for the second time in two years. Here's how we got to another potential shutdown. (Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\nNone of which is to say that another government shutdown in 2016 wouldn't negatively affect the Republican Party. The year 2016, unlike 2014, should be a high-turnout year for Democrats, which is a critical factor in those congressional races. And part of the turnaround in the GOP's fortunes after the 2013 shutdown was the failure of the Obamacare Web site to work as intended -- also in late 2013. There are a lot of ancillary things that come into play.\n\nBut the lesson of that Gallup graph is this: A year is an awfully long time in politics. If there is a repeat of the government shutdown, how it affects 2016 -- if at all -- is probably impossible to predict.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was assumed that the 2013 shutdown would damage the GOP in 2014.
