Carriers are taking various steps in order to prepare for the delayed employer mandate, and strategies for dealing with increased costs, such as they are (whether having to cover more of the employed workforce or more expensive premiums for quality coverage), such strategies have shifted.\n\nTo my mind, the most interesting thing is the percentage of carriers near-doubling \u2014 from 13 percent to 24 percent \u2014 who \u201canticipate opting out of the program altogether,\u201d according to TCP, \u201cby using independent contractors,\u201d whether with outright leased owner-operators or by developing lease-purchase programs.\n\nThe dynamic described there is somewhat like the one I hit on in discussion of Avik Roy\u2019s guesses on the employer-provided health care market here, the notion that the Affordable Care Act incentivizes \u201cskinny\u201d coverage from employers, which could force individuals to the exchanges\u2026\n\nIn any case, for the owner-operators among you leased to carriers, the TCP survey data could mean the future looks good for the business model, at least. However, if a large shift of employer costs for health care is shifted from employer plans to a new legion of independent-contractor owner-operators, as I started this post with, whether those IC business models will be viable will be dependent on the cost of all of that. As it is, we know well that costs in the individual market for health insurance pre-Obamacare can be prohibitive \u2014 hopefully we\u2019ll get a clear sense of that market on the Obamacare exchanges soon.\n\nSee more on this from reporting over the last couple weeks in my post on Avik Roy\u2019s assessment of exchange premium costs \u2014 and Max Heine\u2019s distillation of it all over on Overdrive Extra.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only if insurance rates get reasonable, as it were, on the long-term basis.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Overdrive", "og": {"site_name": "Overdrive", "description": "Only if insurance rates get reasonable, as it were, on the long-term basis.", "title": "Obamacare upside for independent contractor model?", "url": "http://www.overdriveonline.com/obamacare-upside-for-independent-contractor-model/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.overdriveonline.com/files/2013/10/Transport-Capital-Partners-fleet-health-insurance-activity-stats-420x234.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.overdriveonline.com/files/2013/10/Transport-Capital-Partners-fleet-health-insurance-activity-stats-420x234.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.overdriveonline.com/files/2013/10/Transport-Capital-Partners-fleet-health-insurance-activity-stats-420x234.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@OverdriveUpdate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.4.3", "fb": {"pages": 201594073189}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-02T21:37:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-03T22:01:38-05:00"}, "google-site-verification": "WW2QzrYsbQWBq40KQCalege4Ob8OQq4Xr9lN_5tT-ng", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, costs, employer provided insurance, health care exchanges, health insurance, individual market, insurance, ObamaCare, premiums, rates, subsidies, Transport Capital Partners"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b5a\"", "article_summary": "Recent dynamics in the health insurance market are on display in the graphic below, from the Transport Capital Partners group\u2019s survey of fleets over the last three years.\nAs it is, we know well that costs in the individual market for health insurance pre-Obamacare can be prohibitive \u2014 hopefully we\u2019ll get a clear sense of that market on the Obamacare exchanges soon.\nOnly if insurance rates get reasonable, as it were, on a long-term basis.\nSee more on this from reporting over the last couple weeks in my post on Avik Roy\u2019s assessment of exchange premium costs \u2014 and Max Heine\u2019s distillation of it all over on Overdrive Extra.\nHowever, if a large shift of employer costs for health care is shifted from employer plans to a new legion of independent-contractor owner-operators, as I started this post with, whether those IC business models will be viable will be dependent on the cost of all of that."}
