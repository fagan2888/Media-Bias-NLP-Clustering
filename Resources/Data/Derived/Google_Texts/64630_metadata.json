The two senators in question are Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham, and they can\u2019t seem to agree whether the Second Amendment serves as bulwark against government \u201ctyranny.\u201d\n\nIt all started with a fundraising email Cruz sent making the case that \u201cThe 2nd Amendment to the Constitution isn\u2019t for just protecting hunting rights, and it\u2019s not only to safeguard your right to target practice. It is a Constitutional right to protect your children, your family, your home, our lives, and to serve as the ultimate check against governmental tyranny \u2014 for the protection of liberty.\u201d TPM\u2019s Sahil Kapur asked Graham what he thought of his Texan colleague\u2019s view of the Second Amendment, and the South Carolina senator was not impressed. He even invoked the Civil War, which should make Cruz\u2019s people plenty upset. \u201cWell, we tried that once in South Carolina,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go down that road again.\u201d\n\nThis view of gun rights that casts personal firearm ownership as a check on the abuses of government doesn\u2019t make a great deal of practical sense, and it betrays a lack of faith in our democratic institutions. But it\u2019s become increasingly popular among high-level Republican officials who quite literally scare up votes by telling voters they\u2019re right to keep their Glocks cocked just in case the feds come for them. Iowa\u2019s new Republican senator Joni Ernst famously remarked that she supports the right to carry firearms to defend against \u201cthe government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.\u201d\n\nThe obvious question raised by statements like those from Cruz and Ernst is: when does the shooting start? What is the minimum threshold for government \u201ctyranny\u201d that justifies an armed response from the citizenry? In 2014, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy was ready to start a shooting war with the feds to defend his illegal grazing practices, and he garnered the support of top-level Republican officials (they only abandoned him after he started wondering aloud whether black people would be better off as slaves).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz thinks Americans should arm themselves against \"tyranny,\" and Lindsey Graham thinks that's crazy VIDEO", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s frightening gun fanaticism: When a presidential contender encourages armed insurrection", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ted Cruz thinks Americans should arm themselves against \"tyranny,\" and Lindsey Graham thinks that's crazy VIDEO", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s frightening gun fanaticism: When a presidential contender encourages armed insurrection", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/17/ted_cruzs_frightening_gun_fanaticism_when_a_presidential_contender_encourages_armed_insurrection/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/ted_cruz15.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz thinks Americans should arm themselves against \"tyranny,\" and Lindsey Graham thinks that's crazy VIDEO", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s frightening gun fanaticism: When a presidential contender encourages armed insurrection", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/ted_cruz15.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, cliven bundy, gun rights, Guns, Joni Ernst, Lindsey Graham, Second Amendment, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd484\"", "article_summary": "What is the minimum threshold for government \u201ctyranny\u201d that justifies an armed response from the citizenry?\nHe even invoked the Civil War, which should make Cruz\u2019s people plenty upset.\n\u201cWell, we tried that once in South Carolina,\u201d Graham said.\nBut it\u2019s become increasingly popular among high-level Republican officials who quite literally scare up votes by telling voters they\u2019re right to keep their Glocks cocked just in case the feds come for them.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go down that road again.\u201dThis view of gun rights that casts personal firearm ownership as a check on the abuses of government doesn\u2019t make a great deal of practical sense, and it betrays a lack of faith in our democratic institutions."}
