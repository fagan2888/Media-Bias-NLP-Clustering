Studies have shown that a healthy workforce is a productive one. Work Healthy Lynchburg wants to test the theory firsthand, and see if, in the long-run, it also can help decrease employers\u2019 healthcare costs.\n\nWork Healthy Lynchburg is an offshoot of Live Healthy Lynchburg, launched by former mayor Joan Foster in 2012 to address local health concerns.\n\n\u201cI do believe we will see improved health and clarity, concentration and energy levels,\u201d Lynchburg Regional Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Christine Kennedy said. The chamber is one of the driving forces behind the latest effort to develop healthy workplaces.\n\nOn June 16, treadmill desks were installed and workplace studies begun at Bank of the James, City Hall and Lynchburg\u2019s Department of Human Services; two were installed at Genworth because of its size. The desks are free to companies.\n\n\u201cThis is really just to get people moving,\u201d said Brown, as she led the way recently to a council chamber-turned-treadmill room. \u201cAny type of standing or moving is what we want to encourage.\u201d\n\nWithin the past week, Work Healthy Lynchburg announced the acquisition of 10 more treadmill desks to add to the three that have yet to be distributed. In August, four will be given to health departments in Amherst, Appomattox, Bedford and Campbell counties.\n\n\u201cThis is also a way for us to incorporate worksite wellness among our employees,\u201d said Leslie Hoglund, senior health educator with the Central Virginia Health District.\n\nThe remaining treadmill desks will go to companies whose employees have high stress, but sedentary jobs. Distribution is expected to happen this month. The group has yet to determine which businesses will receive the desks. Work Healthy Lynchburg already has a waiting list.\n\nThe response so far has been positive.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hearing so far is that timeslots are full. People want activity, and what this tells us is that we are on to something,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nEmployees reserve the treadmill desk when it suits them, record their perceived stress and productivity levels on a scale of 1 to 10 before and after walking, stroll at their own pace and, at city hall, can work on everything from email to in-house training while using the desk.\n\n\u201cAnything that we can to do to help facilitate health management and wellness in the workplace is a good thing,\u201d said Bonnie Svrcek, Lynchburg\u2019s deputy city manager. The city is one of the major partners in the Work Healthy Lynchburg initiative.\n\nIvetta Campbell, Lynchburg City administrative services associate, has used the treadmill desk every day of the week since it was installed in city hall. It\u2019s gone so smoothly, she\u2019s taken to bringing a flash drive down to the first floor with her so she can continue working on what she was doing up on the third floor.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a personal thing,\u201d Campbell said recently, as she walked in her dress and running shoes. \u201cIt depends on your priorities. It may not be for everybody. But for me it\u2019s just a good break from the desk and I think it\u2019s worthwhile.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s one of 25 people in city hall \u2013 and 70 across the city \u2013 who use the work station during work hours. Work Healthy Lynchburg encouraged all companies to design their own treadmill desk schedules and workspace, one that would fit their unique work culture.\n\nThe only requirements were the pre- and post-participation surveys, which the health department will to determine the impacts of the active work stations. Prior to using the treadmill desks, employees recorded baseline data such as high blood pressure, body mass index and chronic conditions like diabetes. At the end, the same data will be collected.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 10 Aug 2014 10:54:07 -0400", "Description": "LYNCHBURG, Va. \u2014 By late afternoon on a typical work day, Heather Brown usually craves a snack.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "LYNCHBURG, Va. \u2014 By late afternoon on a typical work day, Heather Brown usually craves a snack.", "title": "Treadmill lets Lynchburg employees walk and work", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/treadmill-lets-lynchburg-employees-walk-and-work-20140810/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140810/ARTICLE/140819946/EP/1/1/EP-140819946.jpg", "height": 2624}, "updated_time": "2014-08-10T10:54:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "LYNCHBURG, Va. \u2014 By late afternoon on a typical work day, Heather Brown usually craves a snack.", "title": "Treadmill lets Lynchburg employees walk and work", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140810/ARTICLE/140819946/AR/0/AR-140819946.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-08-10T10:54:07Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-08-10T10:54:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd185b\"", "article_summary": "Work Healthy Lynchburg is an offshoot of Live Healthy Lynchburg, launched by former mayor Joan Foster in 2012 to address local health concerns.\nWork Healthy Lynchburg encouraged all companies to design their own treadmill desk schedules and workspace, one that would fit their unique work culture.\nThe treadmill desks are part of an initiative spearheaded by Work Healthy Lynchburg, a coalition comprised of local business leaders that aims to help companies keep their employees healthy.\nWork Healthy Lynchburg wants to test the theory firsthand, and see if, in the long-run, it also can help decrease employers\u2019 healthcare costs.\nPrior to using the treadmill desks, employees recorded baseline data such as high blood pressure, body mass index and chronic conditions like diabetes."}
