These big businesses don\u2019t pay their water bills and they can go for years and the water company doesn\u2019t collect it. Then in return the private citizen, they raise their bills, to help pay for it. It\u2019s a shame. Someone ought to get after them and do something about it.\n\nConcerned Citizen Who Pays His Water Bill\n\nI wonder why the Pottstown police do nothing about the car that parks on Manatawny and Walnut streets at the fire hydrant all night long and the police keep going by and leave him go. No tickets, no nothing. Does he have diplomatic immunity?\n\nSo let me get this straight. People can\u2019t afford Obamacare now and they\u2019re going to raise it from 9 percent to 37 percent, in between there, and people can\u2019t afford it now? Thanks to all you Obama voters. You\u2019re digging yourself in a hole deeper and deeper. Go Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig John, North Coventry\n\nThis message is for the people who claim that Donald Trump is a racist because he wants to build a wall to protect our borders with Mexico. I guess the same people must feel that President Obama is a racist because he sends troops over to protect the borders of other countries overseas. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nI think people in Pennsylvania and all across the country are being taken for a ride. Mr. Trump is not a conservative. The establishment, the Republicans including John Boehner, put him up as their candidate because they\u2019re so afraid of a conservative candidate like Ted Cruz. I think that\u2019s been the whole idea all along and it\u2019s coming to fruition now. So those of you who think you have a real outsider as a candidate in Trump, surprise, you\u2019re being taken for a ride.\n\nTime To Get Off The Horse\n\nThanks a lot Jim Fitch, now that Spring-Ford has access to free water they will probably build that pool.\n\nRofo D\n\nTo quote JT regarding how can any Catholic be Democrat, you happen to forget about John Kennedy, both Catholic and Democrat.\n\nRead Up On Your History\n\nGambone is going to develop 20 acres of land across from Upland Square Shopping Center right behind the newly constructed Citadel Bank. The problem is they\u2019re going to put another bank behind the bank and then they\u2019re going to put retail shopping space, a 100-room hotel and gas station, all which we have just across the street or down the road. Doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\n\nThe protesters at the Trump rally in California is what the entitlement mentality breeds.\n\nReally, another shopping center when we have an empty one sitting on State Street, empty stores at Coventry Mall, some empty stores at Upland Square? Why don\u2019t they try and fill the empty ones before building any new ones?\n\nN\n\nThis is to Al who says that they\u2019re going to allow 200 convicted felons to vote. Al, are they going to vote Democrat? You must be a wizard if you know how they\u2019re going to vote. Then you must know how the rest of the country is going to vote too, who\u2019s going to win. I also see where the governor of Michigan left two million people drink lead-contaminated water. How about that Al?\n\nA good Christian church doesn\u2019t ask its followers or its congregation for money. They simply pray to God and God answers them. That\u2019s how you can tell the difference my friends. You go to a church that doesn\u2019t reach into your pockets or your handbag or wallet. You pray to God, it\u2019s that simple.\n\nThis is in regards to the patch job on Berks and Walnut streets in that intersection. It\u2019s like riding on a roller coaster. I wish it can be repaired. I\u2019m tired of driving over it. That\u2019s where the water main broke at one time and they repaired and now it\u2019s horrible to drive over.\n\nMrs. Catbird\n\nIt\u2019s amazing they want to take God out of the government, out of the schools and other places but when something terrible happens all over the world, very important people say to please pray for the victims and their families and those who are hurting from wars and so forth. Figure it out.\n\nA Christian\n\nAl, the convicted felons in Washington that will be permitted to vote applies only to those who have completed their sentences and have been released from supervised probation or parole. Doesn\u2019t everyone deserve to have their basic rights returned after they have completed their time or does it bother you that the majority of these people are black and will probably vote Democrat?
