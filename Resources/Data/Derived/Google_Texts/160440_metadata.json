It sinks because the filmmakers\u2019 only idea is that profanity and gross-out behavior are sufficiently comic. Tammy presents McCarthy as a blue-collar fast food worker who, despite her slovenly appearance and unfriendly behavior, falls in love. That this mash-up of various condescensions (from minimum wage to lesbian stock figures) was produced by McCarthy herself, and directed and co-written by her husband Ben Falcone, exposes a desperate calculation that puts one out of the mood to laugh.\n\nMcCarthy has the right to turn herself into a bankable nasty pig but Tammy also dares ridicule segments of the population that deserve better. The film\u2019s white trash caricatures emulate reality-TV personalities from Honey Boo Boo to Duck Dynasty: Tammy, an obese illiterate termagant goes on a road trip with her horny alcoholic grandmother who suffers from gout (Susan Sarandon) to visit her lesbian pyromaniac aunt (Kathy Bates). Their obnoxious behavior is meant to draw sympathy, then appear adorable. Sarcasm and Revulsion \u2014 a strange brew. The combination might have something to do with Hollywood social pretense; when Tammy sets fire to a stolen car she complains about gas prices: \u201c$4 a gallon. Thanks Obamacare!\u201d Making fun of political ignorance and psychotic behavior confirms we have reached the nadir of movie culture.\n\n***\n\n\u201cF\u2014 Pauline Kael!\u201d says a friend of the late Roger Ebert in the documentary Life Itself. It\u2019s a bizarre way to pay tribute to Ebert \u2014 who, the film argues, was the world\u2019s most famous movie reviewer. But the strange slam of Kael (greeted with laughter in the screening room) is consistent with the downturn in critical circles that happened as a result of Ebert\u2019s rise to prominence.\n\nLife Itself makes a case for Ebert\u2019s fame as a way of commemorating him. He died in 2013 following years of suffering thyroid cancer. The sight of Ebert\u2019s disfigurement and suffering is so truly horrifying it seems to preclude all responses besides pity (and self-pity). It becomes nearly impossible to react to the film as anything besides a eulogy. But this unfair, shameless tactic from director Steve James (who works no other way \u2014 James\u2019 career was made when Ebert overpraised his condescending 1994 poor-blacks-and-basketball documentary Hoop Dreams) inadvertently turns Life Itself into a eulogy for film criticism itself.\n\nAs James assembles the mourners (filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Werner Herzog; reviewers Richard Corliss, A.O. Scott and Jonathan Rosenbaum; TV producers Thea Flaum, Donna La Pietra, Gene Siskel\u2019s widow and Ebert\u2019s wife Chazz; and several Chicago Sun Times journalist friends including Kael-basher William Nack), he merely plumbs the shallows of Ebert-devotion which, in the context of celebration, slants perception of the journalistic profession to Ebert\u2019s own particular definition of it. Criticism is seen only in terms of its popularity \u2014 through television broadcasting, tabloid simplicity or using celebrity as ultimate proof of eminence and value.\n\nThose are, undeniably, the terms of our contemporary social valuation. But they are also, unfortunately, the very terms by which criticism has recently lost its standing as a counterpoint to commercial production and artistic arrogance, as a guide to social usefulness and esthetics, and as a form of literature. TV producer Flaum recalls encouraging Ebert to learn to write for TV (i.e., simply) and a high-positioned reviewer and former Eber employee suspiciously corroborates Flaum\u2019s directive by citing Ebert as \u201cthe definitive mainstream film critic in American letters.\u201d Whatever that means exactly, it reduces the legacy of criticism \u2014 especially film criticism \u2014 from the rigorous practice and high aim of James Agee, Kael, Andrew Sarris, Stanley Kaufmann and a few others to something dubbed \u201cpopulist.\u201d\n\nOne eulogist credits to Ebert the phrase \u201cdemocratizing criticism\u201d (a notion parroted by bloggers) but the ass-kissing term is peculiarly inaccurate since the expertise that is inherent to professionalism cannot be \u201cdemocratized.\u201d Praising Ebert for his Average Joe approach to movies may flatter Internetters but it encourages criticism to aim low. Ebert\u2019s lowest common-denominator style recalls old journalist mythology, reeking of barroom arrogance and newsroom smugness, yet James\u2019 film doesn\u2019t follow that mythos to TV, the consecutive news medium that gave Ebert a larger audience than print criticism ever had (a dubious achievement now mistaken for proof of importance).\n\nEssayist George W. Trow once reasoned that children have three parents: mother, father and television. But recent generations of film reviewers have a fourth: Ebert, whose significance is one with TV\u2019s perceived omnipotence. His corporatized omnipresence reduced the impact of critics who worked traditionally, using language, knowledge, experience and literary complexity. And Ebert\u2019s followers are like children who adore the bad parent who lacks discipline. Ebert fools them with \u201clove of movies\u201d candy. One on-screen mourner describes the Siskel & Ebert TV show debates (with the Chicago Tribune\u2019s Gene Siskel) as \u201cTowering figures clashing. Because they couldn\u2019t agree, that raised the temperature of the movies they discussed.\u201d That\u2019s just publicist gibberish. It confuses Marshall McLuhan\u2019s media theory with belief in hype as cultural determinant. The clips of Siskel and Ebert\u2019s chew-toy growling over Benji: The Hunted shows the level of their erudition.\n\nJames reiterates the news of Ebert\u2019s Pulitzer Prize (he was the first of several indistinguishable film reviewers to win) conflating it with critical worth even though nobody in the doc can mention a single esthetic or cultural idea that Ebert originated. James quotes Ebert\u2019s review of Bonnie & Clyde (1967), implying that it announced a revolution in American movies and movie criticism (credit that rightly belongs to Pauline Kael\u2019s long New Yorker essay that both changed the film\u2019s fortune and reshaped the culture \u2014 an historical fact that Internet mavens are ignorant about.\n\nAlso repeated is Ebert\u2019s \u201cMovies are like a machine that generates empathy\u201d\u2013a motto favored by epigones equally prone to intellectual banalities. Ebert\u2019s banalities subverted criticism\u2019s esthetic and moral ambitions and its toughness. His producer\u2019s advice \u201cPeople are interested in what you have to say not how you say it\u201d is outrageous, beat only by Ebert\u2019s disingenuous humility: \u201cA youth will understand that people can make up their own minds.\u201d A presumption refuted by his Internet disciples who all yell the same juvenile opinions at each other. Ebert clones were criticism\u2019s first rotten tomatoes, the end of true discourse.\n\nEbert\u2019s popularity comes from how he ingrained resistance to hard-thought ideas. His quote \u201cI think Raging Bull is one of the great American pictures of the year\u201d sussed the 1980 cultural mood but his hype lingo corrupted the mood. How many \u201cgreat American films\u201d were there that year? It\u2019s as hollow as his L\u2019Argent clip praising Robert Bresson as \u201ca man filled with unlimited passion.\u201d Such TV gossip reveals how Ebert\u2019s careerism outstripped his criticism (he maneuvered from public television to Disney sponsorship and personal copyrighting\u2013all overlooked in this documentary). Ebert found a way to make reviewing work commercially, turning him into an icon for the era of Hollywood-journalism collusion. He won followers by appointing various Siskel replacements but bonhomie and patronage do not make a critic great.\n\nIt is necessary to separate Ebert\u2019s real influence from his suffering. Chazz Ebert\u2019s loving dedication is deeply admirable and evokes great sympathy for her. But further promoting Ebert\u2019s widely imitated sophomoric style is not a proper paean, even though it is now popular to do. And that popularity, based in intellectual insecurity and defensive derivativeness, can get extremely resentful and hostile \u2014 which explains the Kael obscenity. Director James\u2019 petty means of sentimentalizing and misrepresenting Ebert\u2019s criticism \u2014 and its impact on film criticism\u2019s current state \u2014 corrupts an old adage: When the lie becomes legend, film the lie.\n\n\u2014 Film critic Armond White is author of What We Don\u2019t Talk About When We Talk About the Movies.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "On-screen Obscenities: Tammy and Life Itself", "sailthru.author": "Armond White", "description": "Melissa McCarthy\u2019s first line of dialogue in Tammy is an obscenity, and the movie goes downhill from there.

TV producer Flaum recalls encouraging Ebert to learn to write for TV (i.e., simply) and a high-positioned reviewer and former Eber employee suspiciously corroborates Flaum\u2019s directive by citing Ebert as \u201cthe definitive mainstream film critic in American letters.\u201d Whatever that means exactly, it reduces the legacy of criticism \u2014 especially film criticism \u2014 from the rigorous practice and high aim of James Agee, Kael, Andrew Sarris, Stanley Kaufmann and a few others to something dubbed \u201cpopulist.\u201d\n\nOne eulogist credits to Ebert the phrase \u201cdemocratizing criticism\u201d (a notion parroted by bloggers) but the ass-kissing term is peculiarly inaccurate since the expertise that is inherent to professionalism cannot be \u201cdemocratized.\u201d Praising Ebert for his Average Joe approach to movies may flatter Internetters but it encourages criticism to aim low. Ebert\u2019s lowest common-denominator style recalls old journalist mythology, reeking of barroom arrogance and newsroom smugness, yet James\u2019 film doesn\u2019t follow that mythos to TV, the consecutive news medium that gave Ebert a larger audience than print criticism ever had (a dubious achievement now mistaken for proof of importance).\n\n#page#\n\nEssayist George W. Trow once reasoned that children have three parents: mother, father and television. But recent generations of film reviewers have a fourth: Ebert, whose significance is one with TV\u2019s perceived omnipotence. His corporatized omnipresence reduced the impact of critics who worked traditionally, using language, knowledge, experience and literary complexity. And Ebert\u2019s followers are like children who adore the bad parent who lacks discipline. Ebert fools them with \u201clove of movies\u201d candy. One on-screen mourner describes the Siskel & Ebert TV show debates (with the Chicago Tribune\u2019s Gene Siskel) as \u201cTowering figures clashing. Because they couldn\u2019t agree, that raised the temperature of the movies they discussed.\u201d That\u2019s just publicist gibberish. It confuses Marshall McLuhan\u2019s media theory with belief in hype as cultural determinant. The clips of Siskel and Ebert\u2019s chew-toy growling over Benji: The Hunted shows the level of their erudition.#ad#\n\nJames reiterates the news of Ebert\u2019s Pulitzer Prize (he was the first of several indistinguishable film reviewers to win) conflating it with critical worth even though nobody in the doc can mention a single esthetic or cultural idea that Ebert originated. James quotes Ebert\u2019s review of Bonnie & Clyde (1967), implying that it announced a revolution in American movies and movie criticism (credit that rightly belongs to Pauline Kael\u2019s long New Yorker essay that both changed the film\u2019s fortune and reshaped the culture \u2014 an historical fact that Internet mavens are ignorant about.\n\nAlso repeated is Ebert\u2019s \u201cMovies are like a machine that generates empathy\u201d\u2013a motto favored by epigones equally prone to intellectual banalities. Ebert\u2019s banalities subverted criticism\u2019s esthetic and moral ambitions and its toughness. His producer\u2019s advice \u201cPeople are interested in what you have to say not how you say it\u201d is outrageous, beat only by Ebert\u2019s disingenuous humility: \u201cA youth will understand that people can make up their own minds.\u201d A presumption refuted by his Internet disciples who all yell the same juvenile opinions at each other. Ebert clones were criticism\u2019s first rotten tomatoes, the end of true discourse.\n\nEbert\u2019s popularity comes from how he ingrained resistance to hard-thought ideas. His quote \u201cI think Raging Bull is one of the great American pictures of the year\u201d sussed the 1980 cultural mood but his hype lingo corrupted the mood. How many \u201cgreat American films\u201d were there that year? It\u2019s as hollow as his L\u2019Argent clip praising Robert Bresson as \u201ca man filled with unlimited passion.\u201d Such TV gossip reveals how Ebert\u2019s careerism outstripped his criticism (he maneuvered from public television to Disney sponsorship and personal copyrighting\u2013all overlooked in this documentary). Ebert found a way to make reviewing work commercially, turning him into an icon for the era of Hollywood-journalism collusion. He won followers by appointing various Siskel replacements but bonhomie and patronage do not make a critic great.\n\nIt is necessary to separate Ebert\u2019s real influence from his suffering. Chazz Ebert\u2019s loving dedication is deeply admirable and evokes great sympathy for her. But further promoting Ebert\u2019s widely imitated sophomoric style is not a proper paean, even though it is now popular to do. And that popularity, based in intellectual insecurity and defensive derivativeness, can get extremely resentful and hostile \u2014 which explains the Kael obscenity. Director James\u2019 petty means of sentimentalizing and misrepresenting Ebert\u2019s criticism \u2014 and its impact on film criticism\u2019s current state \u2014 corrupts an old adage: When the lie becomes legend, film the lie.\n\n\u2014 Film critic Armond White is author of What We Don\u2019t Talk About When We Talk About the Movies.", "card": "summary", "title": "On-screen Obscenities: Tammy and Life Itself, by Armond White, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 2014-07-03 18:59", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "On-screen Obscenities: Tammy and Life Itself", "keywords": "Armond White", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "On-screen Obscenities: Tammy and Life Itself, Armond White, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Armond White, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "One on-screen mourner describes the Siskel & Ebert TV show debates (with the Chicago Tribune\u2019s Gene Siskel) as \u201cTowering figures clashing.\nAlso repeated is Ebert\u2019s \u201cMovies are like a machine that generates empathy\u201d\u2013a motto favored by epigones equally prone to intellectual banalities.\nWhat's worse: bad movies or bad movie criticism?\nIt\u2019s a bizarre way to pay tribute to Ebert \u2014 who, the film argues, was the world\u2019s most famous movie reviewer.\nEbert found a way to make reviewing work commercially, turning him into an icon for the era of Hollywood-journalism collusion."}
