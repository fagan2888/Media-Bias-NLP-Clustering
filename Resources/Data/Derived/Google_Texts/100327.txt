A Dallas student was sent to in-school suspension Monday after an administrator caught him wearing an American flag T-shirt under his hoodie.

Shelly Goode says her son, Jaegur, is passionate about ROTC and hopes to earn a scholarship through the program.

“He wants to go into the military,” she told a local Fox affiliate. “He wants to help people, and any bad marks doesn’t look good.”

On Monday, an administrator asked Jaegur to lift his grey hoodie, and once he saw the flag underneath sent him to in-school suspension for violating the dress code, Ms. Goode said.

It is against the rules at Seagoville High School to wear clothing that is not a solid color, excluding school and college logos or shirts supporting the military, Fox reported. The administrator had apparently misinterpreted that rule.

“If [Jaegur] was breaking the rules, he would be punished and he would have to honor whatever they give him, but he wasn’t, and I have to stand by him for that,” Ms. Goode said.

On Tuesday, she received a call from the principal, who apologized for all the trouble and insisted that the American flag is allowed to be worn in school. He said he was off-campus when the incident occurred, Fox reported.

“The fact that acknowledging it is huge, and the fact that they’re willing to stand by and see mistakes and grow from them, that means a lot,” Ms. Goode said.

The principal also explained to her that the in-school suspension will not go on her son’s disciplinary record.

The Dallas Independent School District has also confirmed that American flags can be displayed on clothing, Fox reported.
