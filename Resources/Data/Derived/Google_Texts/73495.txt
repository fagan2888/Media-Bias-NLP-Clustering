PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) — President Barack Obama has touched down in Hawaii for his annual Christmas vacation in his native state.

Air Force One, carrying the president, his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Malia and Sasha, landed early Saturday at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.

Obama plans to spend about two weeks at a vacation rental on the island of Oahu. He is scheduled to return to the White House in early January to begin his final year in office.

He typically spends the down time playing on the island’s lush golf courses, dining out in Honolulu and joining his kids for hikes and treats of shave ice.

Obama has no public events planned during the vacation.
