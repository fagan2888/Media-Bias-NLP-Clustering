Man, was that weird. But the project served a great purpose, reminding kids that sex has consequences, and the responsibility of taking care of a child is very real. Such campaigns are now jumping into the digital era, with one of the latest ones using text messages to remind teens that before they sit down to watch their favorite TV show, they have to clean the baby\u2019s bib.\n\nBrought to us by DoSomething.org, the campaign aims to start conversation among teens about teen pregnancy. \u201cOur goal is just to start a conversation,\u201d DoSomething.org\u2019s Alyssa Ruderman told the NY Daily News. \u201cThere\u2019s no real way for us to know if teens are using more condoms or if they\u2019re having sex, but we do know they\u2019re engaging in a conversation and they\u2019re sharing this with friends.\u201d\n\nThe campaign, which begins March 25, was made to be as \u201cinteractive as possible,\u201d Ruderman said. Teens who sign up, or who are signed up by friends, get text messages sent to their phones in the form of babies\u2019 demands. \u201cI know you\u2019re running late bu-GRRGLEBARFFFF. Oops, sorry about your shirt. Rappers spit rhymes, I spit up,\u201d one text says. Teens are expected to respond to the texts, after which they\u2019ll get another message from the \u201cbaby.\u201d After 12 hours of sending and receiving texts to the \u201cbaby,\u201d the \u201cparenting\u201d session ends.\n\nThe Pregnancy Text campaign is the third that DoSomething.org has sponsored \u2014 over 125,000 teens signed up last year. The people involved with the campaign believe that talking about teen pregnancy is the most effective way of preventing it, \u201cand that shame and fear tactics don\u2019t work,\u201d Colleen Wormsley, a marketing associate for DoSomething.org told the Daily News.\n\nCampaigns like DoSomething.org\u2019s and others have had a huge effect on teen sexual activity and pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates have dropped steadily over the past decades, reaching a record low recently. Between 2010 and 2011, birth rates among teenage girls ages 15 to 19 dropped eight percent to 31.3 births per 1,000 women. With that, sexual activity among younger teenagers has also fallen. Between 1995 and 2008, teens, ages 15 to 19, who reported having sex before 15 dropped from 19 percent among girls and 21 percent among boys to 11 percent and 14 percent, respectively, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a sexual and reproductive health research organization.\n\nAs campaigns like DoSomething.org\u2019s continue to spark conversation, helping to lower teen pregnancy rates, TV shows like MTV\u2019s Teen Mom may one day be unnecessary.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "teenage pregnancy, talking about teen pregnancy, teens talk about sex, teen pregnancy, preventing teen pregnancy, dosomething.org, teen pregnancy and texts", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hoping to spark conversation about teenage pregnancy, DoSomething.org is turning teens' cell phones into \"babies\" with lighthearted texts reminding them about the responsibilities of child care.", "title": "New Teen Pregnancy Campaign Turns Cell Phones Into Crying Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-pregnancy-campaign-turns-cell-phones-crying-babies-reminds-teens-sex-has-consequences-271492", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/18/teen-pregnancy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hoping to spark conversation about teenage pregnancy, DoSomething.org is turning teens' cell phones into \"babies\" with lighthearted texts reminding them about the responsibilities of child care.", "title": "New Teen Pregnancy Campaign Turns Cell Phones Into Crying Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-pregnancy-campaign-turns-cell-phones-crying-babies-reminds-teens-sex-has-consequences-271492", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/18/teen-pregnancy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/18/teen-pregnancy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-18T13:00:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-18T13:00:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hoping to spark conversation about teenage pregnancy, DoSomething.org is turning teens' cell phones into \"babies\" with lighthearted texts reminding them about the responsibilities of child care."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81bd\"", "article_summary": "Teen pregnancy rates have dropped steadily over the past decades, reaching a record low recently.\nThe Pregnancy Text campaign is the third that DoSomething.org has sponsored \u2014 over 125,000 teens signed up last year.\nAs campaigns like DoSomething.org\u2019s continue to spark conversation, helping to lower teen pregnancy rates, TV shows like MTV\u2019s Teen Mom may one day be unnecessary.\nBrought to us by DoSomething.org, the campaign aims to start conversation among teens about teen pregnancy.\nCampaigns like DoSomething.org\u2019s and others have had a huge effect on teen sexual activity and pregnancy."}
