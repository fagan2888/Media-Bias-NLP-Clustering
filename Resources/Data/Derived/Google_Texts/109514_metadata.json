Because the road the GOP is going down is getting really, really weird.\n\nRelated: The 2016 Presidential Election Is Already a Dumpster Fire\n\nOn Tuesday, the single most qualified person to throw his hat in the ring, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, announced his candidacy, and was essentially drowned out by a playground spat between real estate mogul Donald Trump and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, which began with name-calling and escalated to the point of Trump giving out Graham\u2019s personal cell phone number to the public and encouraging people to call him.\n\nGraham on Monday had gone after Trump for comments Trump made over the weekend questioning the heroism of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who endured five years of beatings and torture as a prisoner of war, and declined early release so that others could be freed before him.\n\nSaying that he was angry with Trump for attacking McCain, Graham added, \u201cHe's becoming a jackass at a time when we need to have a serious debate about the future of the party and the country.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Surges in New Poll While GOP Splits Over His McCain Attack\n\nTrump responded Tuesday at a rally in Graham\u2019s home state, calling the senator an \u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201clightweight\u201d before taking out a piece of paper with a phone number on it, and reading the digits out loud before urging listeners to try calling it.\n\nAfter giving out the number, which was, in fact, Graham\u2019s cell phone, the abuse continued. \u201cI see your senator \u2013 what a stiff, Lindsey Graham, by the way, he\u2019s registered zero in the polls, and he\u2019s on television all the time.\u201d\n\nProbably getting a new phone. iPhone or Android? \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 21, 2015\n\nMeanwhile, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been lagging in the polls, released a new video that shows him \u201ckilling\u201d the federal tax code. Clad in jeans and a t-shirt that reads \u201cDetroit Republican,\u201d the clip shows Paul using a chainsaw to attack a pile of paper that he identifies as the tax code.\n\nHe also feeds it into a woodchipper. And sets it on fire. The musical accompaniment appears to be someone imitating Jimi Hendrix\u2019s famous rendition of the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock.\n\nShut it down. Everybody take August off and go to the beach or something. Come back in September. After all, there will still be 14 months to the election, even then.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Tuesday, the single most qualified person to throw his hat in the ring, Ohio Gov.
