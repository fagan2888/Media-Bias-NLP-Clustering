That man was Winslow H. Randall, an orange grower who passed away in the 1980s.\n\nRandall, it turns out, was \u201cthis phenomenal bridge player,\u201d Spiller told CBS in Los Angeles \u2013 someone who had been \u201celected president of the American Contract Bridge League, a national organization with 85,000 members at that time,\u201d reported Redland Daily Facts.\n\nWinslow, who no doubt traveled for bridge tournaments or related business, had reached out to the local Chamber of Commerce for lodging details. In the letter, two rooms were quoted as costing between $8 and $10 a day.\n\nRelated: Post Office Banking Plan Gains Support\n\n\u201cAbove prices include breakfast,\u201d the letter said, according to Redland Daily Facts. \u201cWe are located near hotels, beaches and within 1/2 mile of shopping circle, churches, artists studio, etc. Thanking you for your interest in the Kennebunk area and hoping to see you.\u201d\n\nAs luck would have it, Spiller is a museum director and collections manager and cares about preserving American history, so it\u2019s no surprise that the idea of donating the letter to the Redlands Historical Museum Association has already been floated.\n\nBut the reason for the letter\u2019s 57-year delay is curious, or infuriating, depending on your point of view. Stamped in red bold letters on the envelope\u2019s front was this message from the postal service: \u201cDelayed due to incorrect zip code.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It was written more than half a century ago, when people still penned \u201chard copy\u201d lett", "title": "Talk About Snail Mail: Letter Arrives 57 Years Later", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/12/Talk-About-Snail-Mail-Letter-Arrives-57-Years-Later", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06122014_Snail_Mail.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/12/Talk-About-Snail-Mail-Letter-Arrives-57-Years-Later", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06122014_Snail_Mail.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It was written more than half a century ago, when people still penned \u201chard copy\u201d lett", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Post Office Banking Plan Gains Support\u201cAbove prices include breakfast,\u201d the letter said, according to Redland Daily Facts.\nThe letter wasn\u2019t addressed to Spiller, though: It was addressed to the previous owner of the post office box that Spiller has been using for the past 33 years.\nBut the reason for the letter\u2019s 57-year delay is curious, or infuriating, depending on your point of view.\nIn the letter, two rooms were quoted as costing between $8 and $10 a day.\nWinslow, who no doubt traveled for bridge tournaments or related business, had reached out to the local Chamber of Commerce for lodging details."}
