The candidate promises to hit D.C. with a head full of steam to tackle issues important to the district such as the controversial RLUIPA religious land use law, Common Core, health care and what he calls HUD overreach. The latter point Westchester County Executive and NY gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino has made a hallmark of his administration.\n\nChris Day\u2019s name recognition and good will from the recent campaign are sure to give him a boost west of the Hudson, but the 17th Congressional District is 58 percent comprised of Westchester County residents, so he must cover new ground in his quest to reach D.C.\n\nLowey beat Republican Joe Carvin by a comfortable margin in 2012 and has been in office since 1989, in three different districts (districts are rearranged every 10 years). Since the election of 2012, the district covers all of Rockland and most of western Westchester (see the graphic below). Prior to 2012, three separate Congressional districts covered Rockland County.\n\nLowey is also one of the wealthiest members of Congress and is pushing 80-years-old, two points that might give the young Republican some traction in the race.\n\nOn top of that, 2014 may be a good year for Republicans due to backlash from the Obamacare rollout and the president\u2019s sagging approval ratings. Astorino\u2019s gubernatorial candidacy may also push some Westchester voters toward the Republican side.\n\nThough the district is close to two-to-one Democrat, both counties have Republican executives and Day said, \u201cI think the voters will be open to an independent Republican instead of a party-line politician.\u201d\n\nIf he does win, it will scuttle the long expected succession of Lowey\u2019s seat to a young Democrat such as David Carlucci or David Fried.\n\nFollowing the county executive campaign, Day announced he was becoming a political consultant. Now he will be busy with his own campaign.\n\nHe also works in private equity and is a father.\n\nHis father, County Executive Ed Day, released a statement via social media, which read in part: \u201c\u2026if you look at his resume, he is more qualified for office than any other elected official in the area, myself included. He has served his country with distinction, he is a family man, and he brings a fresh perspective to government. I am confident he will serve this district with the same dedication with which he served his country \u2013 and those qualities have nothing to do with what his last name is. I wish him best of luck in his tremendous endeavor.\u201d\n\nBarring something unforeseen, the 2014 election is hereby set. Day is not expected to receive any primary competition from within the GOP.\n\nYou can watch Chris Day\u2019s first campaign video here:\n\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3G5Jdu_TEUg&feature=youtu.be1", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Rockland County Times", "description": "He was his father's secret weapon during his successful run for Rockland County executive.
