There, however, the problem is less about what Trump says, and more about what he\u2019s actually done \u2014 run roughshod over protected dunes to build an elite golf course, attack an offshore wind energy project because it \u201cruined\u201d his view, cajole politicians into supporting his every whim. He\u2019s also run into trouble for the promises he\u2019s failed to keep \u2014 when the deal ultimately went sour, he flew off in his private jet, leaving behind none of the economic prosperity he\u2019d sworn the project would create. His fate as one of the country\u2019s top villains was sealed with Anthony Baxter\u2019s 2011 documentary, \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Trumped,\u201d which documented a saga so egregious it inspired a folk song, and made such waves that Trump finally agreed to sit down with Baxter on camera.\n\nThat interview could be read as the climax of Baxter\u2019s newest documentary, \u201cA Dangerous Game,\u201d which picks up where the last left off. But Trump knows how to hold his own against angry activists \u2014 or, at least, he knows how to deflect their questions. With no evidence to back himself up, he explains at one point that he himself is a \u201cgreat environmentalist.\u201d The film\u2019s more alarming revelation is that it\u2019s not just Trump: elitist billionaires, in Baxter\u2019s telling, have co-opted golf, creating vast artificial environments for play that strain local resources and shut out all but the wealthy, and which all too often subvert democracy. This plays out as tragedy in Dubrovnik, Croatia \u2014 a World Heritage Site \u2014 where residents\u2019 efforts to keep out a golf resort result in the passing of a local referendum with an 84 percent majority, only to see the project green-lighted anyway.\n\nSalon spoke with Baxter about the golf industry\u2019s need to embrace a more sustainable model, and about his continued pursuit of America\u2019s would-be 45th president. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nTo start, it would be great to hear about how you went from this one local Donald Trump story, and then branched out into this larger problem of elite golf courses.\n\nIt was through taking it to communities that really led me to make this film, because people kept saying to me at screenings around the world that they were having the same type of thing happening to them in their communities. It\u2019s not always Donald Trump, but it\u2019s people like him. That was really the journey I set out on.\n\nI also wanted to focus in on the ludicrous situation of these golf courses being built in places like the California desert, for example, which has experienced the worst drought in history. And when you consider that the average golf course uses 312,000 gallons of water per day, and the average American family of four uses 400 gallons/day, it really is shocking, the scale of this stuff. I wanted to explore how our planet cannot afford these gated, super-luxury resorts for very wealthy people like Donald Trump, yet they keep being built in places that are so unsustainable.\n\nDonald Trump recently announced plans to build a new golf course designed by Tiger Woods in Dubai, and it\u2019s just crazy. I don\u2019t think anybody could make a case as to why, environmentally, that is a sound idea. They\u2019re so vulnerable as well to an economic downturn, as we\u2019ve seen: the first golf course of Tiger Woods\u2019 design of the desert in Dubai has now been reclaimed by the desert because the whole plan went belly up.\n\nSo yes, it was a case of wanting to explore that, but also to continue to tell the story of what was happening in Scotland, because, despite having had the first film on the BBC, where there is a real backlash against Donald Trump, his organization, and the way they had treated those local people, I was so shocked to find that that treatment was continuing, even after that. So 90 year-old Molly Forbes still didn\u2019t have a proper working water supply several years after Donald Trump\u2019s work was cut off while building the golf course, and there were still mounds of earth being built next to the residents\u2019 homes and Donald Trump was telling the media that he was treating them well. I think that those things were really the powerful driver to want to continue to follow the story.\n\n\n\nYou really have a clear-cut villain in this one of Trump. I keep thinking back to that image of Molly carrying the water up from her well to wash her dishes \u2026\n\nYes, I think the problem with Donald Trump, and the reason these late-night chat shows have so much fun with him, are the inflammatory things he says. Just take his comments about Mexico sending rapists and drugs dealers and crime into the U.S., and his big idea to build a Berlin Wall-style barrier between the two countries. That, of course, allows people to have a laugh about those ridiculous ideas, but the point is, as we show in the film, that it\u2019s not just what he says that is bad and dangerous, but it\u2019s what he does.\n\nIn Scotland, he claimed that he was going to be creating 6,000 jobs, and he invested one and a half billion dollars into what he claimed was going to be the greatest golf course in the world. Now, that was 10 years ago, and to date we have one golf course built, we have less than 200 jobs created, we have tens of millions of dollars having been invested, and not the $1.5 billion \u2014 which was such a stupid number under any scrutiny. But the Scottish government believed his promises, and that\u2019s also part of the problem with this whole thing, because we look to our governments to protect us from these kinds of developments, and the Scottish government completely failed in this case to protect a site of special scientific interest, which was supposed to be protected for future generations to enjoy, and that\u2019s now been lost because of the golf course built there.\n\nDonald Trump has now stabilized the dunes, he\u2019s nailed them down, so that they don\u2019t move and shift as nature intended. He\u2019s built a golf course, which is for wealthy people to play, and he had plans to build another one, which he pulled the plug on after the Scottish government won the battle against him over the wind farm which he took great umbrage over.\n\nThe things that he does that we document in the film are simply dangerous and worrying, and I hope as many people as possible in the United States can see the film. Even seeing those polling numbers Tuesday, where he\u2019s polling No. 2 in New Hampshire, you have to ask yourself: Do people really know what he does? They enjoy his entertainment value, maybe, but take a look at this film and you\u2019ll see what he actually does.\n\nAbout those ridiculous things he says: As somebody who\u2019s confronted Donald Trump a few times, and then being finally able to sit and talk with him, did you get the impression that he kind of plays dumb as part of a strategy he uses for getting away with things?\n\n\n\nYes, well, he\u2019s used to inviting people up to the boardroom in Trump Towers for interviews, and the first question I\u2019ll ask is about his hair, which he obviously loves. But the point is, it\u2019s that kind of deflection that\u2019s the real problem. He\u2019ll make points to journalists that they\u2019ll just repeat as facts, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so concerning.\n\nIn the Scottish case, for example, he said he was going to be investing $1.5 billion and clearly wasn\u2019t. The thing is, he\u2019s such an expert at manipulating the media, and he also has access to the airwaves and the lawyers that ordinary people don\u2019t have; he just needs to jump onto Fox and Friends for anything he wants to say, and it\u2019ll just be believed. It\u2019s a very, very worrying situation. Yes, it\u2019s entertaining, but it\u2019s concerning that a man who thinks he stands a chance of becoming the next president of the United States could be making such ludicrous claims and saying such inflammatory things on prime-time television.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Filmmaker Anthony Baxter on how elitist billionaires are destroying the environment in the name of golf", "title": "Donald Trump is even more of a monster than you think: Why his golf courses are environmental disasters", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Filmmaker Anthony Baxter on how elitist billionaires are destroying the environment in the name of golf", "title": "Donald Trump is even more of a monster than you think: Why his golf courses are environmental disasters", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/27/donald_trump_is_even_more_of_a_monster_than_you_think_why_his_golf_courses_are_environmental_disasters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/donald_trump_golf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Filmmaker Anthony Baxter on how elitist billionaires are destroying the environment in the name of golf", "title": "Donald Trump is even more of a monster than you think: Why his golf courses are environmental disasters", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/donald_trump_golf.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California Drought, Conservation, development, Documentaries, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Golf", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03de\"", "article_summary": "Donald Trump recently announced plans to build a new golf course designed by Tiger Woods in Dubai, and it\u2019s just crazy.\nIt\u2019s not always Donald Trump, but it\u2019s people like him.\nDonald Trump has now stabilized the dunes, he\u2019s nailed them down, so that they don\u2019t move and shift as nature intended.\nTo start, it would be great to hear about how you went from this one local Donald Trump story, and then branched out into this larger problem of elite golf courses.\nI wanted to explore how our planet cannot afford these gated, super-luxury resorts for very wealthy people like Donald Trump, yet they keep being built in places that are so unsustainable."}
