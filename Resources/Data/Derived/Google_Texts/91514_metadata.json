Edwards, a planner and advisor in Boca Raton, Fla.\n\n\u201cTo protect family from tragic events,\u201d said Satoru (San) Asato, a planner and advisor in Bloomington, Minn.\n\n\u201cLife insurance is something responsible people do to make sure their family will be OK. It is one less worry to keep you up at night,\u201d said Lora J. Hoff in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cLife insurance is designed to ensure that your loved ones who are dependent on your income will be taken care of in the event of your premature demise,\u201d said Gilbert A. Armour, who is based in San Diego, Calif.\n\n\u201cLife insurance is finishing life well knowing the people you love have provision for the life they will carry on without you,\u201d said Edward W. Kramer, a planner and advisor in Columbia, S.C.\n\n\u201cAfter you are gone, it is a love letter to your family. You have proved to them that you cared enough about them to spend money in the past to make sure they comfortable even when you are not there,\u201d responded Richard W. Kagawa of Huntington Beach, Calif.\n\n\u201cThe value of life insurance is the security for your dependents to know that if you pass, that financial hardship will not be an additional obstacle for them. You know that you have loved and provided for your family,\u201d added Angela Giboney of Mill Creek, Wash.\n\n\u201cLife Insurance can be a gift of love,\u201d said planner and disability insurance expert Robert Wesley Shannon of Hurst, Texas.\n\n\u201cLife insurance provides resources for survivor income needs. In other words, by putting life insurance in place, you insure that your family won't experience economic hardship along with emotional distress. I always tell clients, \u2018Just because you purchase life insurance doesn't mean you'll die and just because you don't, doesn't mean you won't.\u2019 Life insurance is part of every family's sound financial plan because of the peace of mind it provides,\u201d responded Marguerita M. Cheng of Potomac, Md.\n\n\u201cTo keep financial disaster away for those dependent on your income if you die during your working years,\u201d added Kristi C. Sullivan, an advisor based in Denver, Colo.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the lives of the survivors (spouse, children, etc.) remain financially secure and to give peace of mind to the life insurance purchaser that his family will not face financial ruin if their main breadwinner is gone,\u201d said Barry R. Eckstein in Wantagh, N.Y.\n\nAgents\u2019 testimonials about the value of life insurance speak for themselves, but getting consumers to buy the coverage is another story, said Marvin H. Feldman, president and CEO of the life, disability and long-term care educational nonprofit Life Happens.\n\nIn an interview with InsuranceNewsNet, Feldman said that a priority for the life insurance industry is to find a way to renew the ranks of its agents, the average age of which is 59 years old.\n\nAs much as 40 percent of the approximately 300,000 licensed life agents will retire from the industry over the next 10 years, a loss of about 12,000 agents a year. With a retention rate of 15 percent over four years, the industry estimates it will need 80,000 new agents to come into the business every year just to stay even.\n\nBut the industry is hiring only about 35,000 agents a year at most, which means the net number of new agents entering the ranks will not be enough to replace those who retire. The number of net new producers, therefore, will decline.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, it represents an opportunity for agents active in the industry because you have fewer numbers of people working with a larger population base and the upper middle market,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem yet a significant opportunity for people in our industry.\u201d\n\nJoining the industry is a great reason for young people \u201cto come into the business and want to do good for the industry and people, and make a better-than-average living,\u201d and maybe even \u2026 fall in love.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
