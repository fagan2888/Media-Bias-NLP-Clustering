It had a not-exactly-subtle message that an oppressive, militarized law enforcement culture, fed by corporate cronyism, can be just as dangerous as the crime it was intended to fight.\n\nThe movie is 25 years old now, and we can track the militarization of our police forces since that time, sans cyborgs. There\u2019s a remake on the way, scheduled for 2014. The Los Angeles Times, through its Hero Complex blog, sat down with Brazilian director Jos\u00e9 Padilha to talk about how its message has been updated for our current situation:\n\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re in the future, and drones have been replaced by robots and are being used all over the world for foreign policy and war. Kind of like instead of sending soldiers to Iraq, you send robots to Tehran. This is how we open the movie, with American robots in Tehran, because Iran has been invaded. The idea is, now soldiers don\u2019t die in wars, so there\u2019s no political pressure at home to end wars. Because the reason why the Vietnam War ended is because soldiers were dying. When you take the soldiers away and you have robots, that opens a can of worms. The premise of the movie is everywhere in the world, robots are allowed, except in America, because Americans won\u2019t accept that a robot can pull the trigger, that the robot can decide to take or not to take a person\u2019s life in law enforcement. So this company is losing lots of money because it can\u2019t sell robots in North America, so the solution is, \u201cLet\u2019s put a man in the machine and sell that.\u201d That was the premise of the movie that I said to them in the very first day, and because they wanted to do it, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nPadilha, who was a documentary maker before moving into features, explained how the movie will explore the ethics of accountability:\n\n\u201cWhen you mechanize and when you create automatic law enforcement, accountability goes down the drain. I\u2019ll give you an example, and it has to do with drones. Say you look at a controversial war thing, like the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. At the end of the day, somebody ordered the bomb, in that case Eisenhower. So you can judge Eisenhower. You can say he was right, or he was wrong. You can have an opinion about it, and pass moral judgment on what happened. Now, when a robot pulls the trigger, because a robot doesn\u2019t have a conscience, who is accountable? If the robot makes a mistake and let\u2019s say shoots a kid by mistake, whose fault is it? It\u2019s clearly not the robot\u2019s fault because it doesn\u2019t make sense to attribute fault to an entity that doesn\u2019t have a conscience (and this is a very contemporary philosophical issue, by the way, that\u2019s being debated in the academic world). Once you have automatic robots making decisions on the spot that can decide whether to take or not take somebody\u2019s life, then accountability becomes very fluid. \u201c\n\nEven with drones having remote pilots, documents show that our government frequently has no idea who it is killing when it launches strikes in Pakistan.\n\nJoel Kinnaman (the absolute best thing about The Killing this past season) will be playing the titular character this time around.
