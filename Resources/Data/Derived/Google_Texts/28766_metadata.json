Wagner once lived in Riga, to escape his creditors back in Germany, and it is where he started working on \"Rienzi\".\n\nIn July, a series of concerts, \"Born in Riga\", will bring together world-renowned Latvian performers, including violinist Gidon Kremer and opera singers Maija Kovalevska, Inese Galante and Aleksandrs Antonenko.\n\nThe same month the \"world choir games\" will bring together around 20,000 singers from 70 countries in Latvia, which is famous for its choral-singing tradition.\n\nContemporary art works of Latvian-born American artist Vija Celmina will be on display from April to June.\n\nThe Baltic state suffered the worst economic downturn in the European Union in 2009, but after several years of austerity has become one of the fastest growing economies in the bloc. The country of 2 million adopted the euro on Jan. 1.\n\nInitiated in 1985, the European Capital of Cultures programme is intended to highlight the richness and diversity of culture in Europe, according to the EU's website.
