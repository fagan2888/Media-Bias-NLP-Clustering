Andrew Cuomo had some harsh words for teachers unions in a recent interview with the New York Daily News:\n\n\u201cIf (the public) understood what was happening with education to their children, there would be an outrage in this city,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, they would take City Hall down brick by brick. \u201cIt\u2019s only because it\u2019s complicated that people don\u2019t get it.\u201d Cuomo referred to the teacher unions and the entrenched education establishment as an \u201cindustry\u201d that is more interested in protecting the rights of its members than improving the system for the kids it is supposed to be serving. \u201cSomewhere along the way, I believe we flipped the purpose of this,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis was never a teacher employment program and this was never an industry to hire superintendents and teachers. \u201cThis was a program to educate kids.\u201d ... He said he openly disagreed with a teacher union member who said he represents the students. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Cuomo said he told the person. \u201cYou represent the teachers. Teacher salaries, teacher pensions, teacher tenure, teacher vacation rights. I respect that. But don\u2019t say you represent the students.\u201d\n\nThe fact that this fiery anti-union tirade passed the lips of a blue state Democrat tells you everything you need to know about just how thoroughly teaches union have alienated many of their natural political allies. And this isn't merely some quirk of New York politics, as the same thing has happened on a local scale in numerous cities such as Chicago, Detroit, and Los Angeles. Democratic politicians everywhere are more willing to take on teachers unions than ever before.\n\nI suspect that's because they recognize the long-term unsustainability of this alliance. Teachers unions have continued to extort delusional concessions from lawmakers and taxpayers, even as their leaders' antics grow more distracting and hateful. Their demands are so unreasonable, so out of step with the very moderate package of school reforms that a growing consensus of politicians on the left and right now support, even people like Cuomo and former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2014who are not exactly friends of libertarianism\u2014can't help but object to the shrill divisiveness of Michael Mulgrew, Karen Lewis, Steven Cook, etc.\n\nToday is the first day of National School Choice Week.
