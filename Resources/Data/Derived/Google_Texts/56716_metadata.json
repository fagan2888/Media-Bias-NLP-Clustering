The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study followed people who were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 and also surveyed the survivors\u2019 siblings as a comparison group.\n\nThe cancer survivors were mostly in their thirties or older when they and their siblings answered questions about their employment status, education level and living situation. They also rated their own emotional states and cognitive functioning, including their organizational abilities, task efficiency and memory.\n\nThe researchers found that, compared with their siblings, teenage cancer survivors were less likely to have completed post-high school education, to be working full time, to be married or to live independently.\n\nThe researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that these social outcomes were related to the survivor\u2019s neurocognitive symptoms. For example, participants with task efficiency issues were about three times more likely to be unemployed.\n\nCancer survivors were also about 50 percent more likely than their siblings to report depression and twice as likely to report anxiety. And survivors rated themselves as having more problems with regulating their emotions and with memory.\n\nThese findings are useful for this older group of teenage cancer survivors, said Heather Conklin, an associate faculty member at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. But because cancer treatment has changed over time, the results \u201cmay be less applicable for those patients receiving modern therapy.\u201d\n\nConklin, who was not involved in the study, also said future research should involve formal assessments of the survivors\u2019 emotional states, since self-reporting can be unreliable.\n\nPrasad told Reuters Health that because the biology of tumors and cancers in teens is different from that of adults, their treatments tend to be more aggressive.\n\nTeen cancer survivors may also struggle later in life because their treatment came at a time of such rapid social and emotional development, Prasad added. \u201cCancer treatment at this time interferes with development of relationships, academic achievement, participation in social activities and the development of autonomy from parents,\u201d she said.\n\nConklin said teenagers\u2019 increased expectations for independence and autonomy from parents can make the already challenging process of treatment even more difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is important to continue to learn more about this vulnerable population through clinical studies so they do well through cancer therapy and as survivors,\u201d Prasad said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1JXbWc1 Journal of Clinical Oncology, online July 6, 2015.\n\n(By Madeline Kennedy)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "survivors, teen, cancer, struggle, jobs, emotions, later, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Even decades later, people diagnosed with cancer in their teenage years are less likely to have college degrees, to work full time, to be married or to live independently, a study found.", "title": "Survivors Of Teen Cancer Struggle With Jobs, Emotions Later In Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/survivors-teen-cancer-struggle-jobs-emotions-later-life-342506", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/survivors-teen-cancer-more-likely-struggle-jobs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even decades later, people diagnosed with cancer in their teenage years are less likely to have college degrees, to work full time, to be married or to live independently, a study found.", "title": "Survivors Of Teen Cancer Struggle With Jobs, Emotions Later In Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/survivors-teen-cancer-struggle-jobs-emotions-later-life-342506", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/survivors-teen-cancer-more-likely-struggle-jobs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/survivors-teen-cancer-more-likely-struggle-jobs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-11T10:54:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T10:56:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Even decades later, people diagnosed with cancer in their teenage years are less likely to have college degrees, to work full time, to be married or to live independently, a study found."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8a4\"", "article_summary": "Teen cancer survivors may also struggle later in life because their treatment came at a time of such rapid social and emotional development, Prasad added.\nThese findings are useful for this older group of teenage cancer survivors, said Heather Conklin, an associate faculty member at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\nCancer survivors were also about 50 percent more likely than their siblings to report depression and twice as likely to report anxiety.\nSurvivors of teenage cancer also faced higher rates of depression and anxiety, as well as issues with memory and task efficiency, compared to their siblings who did not have cancer.\nThe cancer survivors were mostly in their thirties or older when they and their siblings answered questions about their employment status, education level and living situation."}
