Ben Carson in 2016? See His Vision.

The legal sale of recreational marijuana began in Colorado on Jan. 1, but Dr. Ben Carson sees it as society's latest step downward.The use of medical marijuana in some cases has been proven to be useful, Carson said Thursday on Fox News Channel's "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren." But, he added, it is a gateway drug."I don't think this is something we really want for our society," Carson said. "You know, we're gradually just removing all the barriers to hedonistic activity. We're changing so rapidly to a different type of society, and nobody is getting a chance to discuss it because it's taboo."Carson, a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, has previously said marriage is between a man and a woman , even as states have begun to legalize same-sex marriages.Van Susteren pointed out that some people think making things such as marijuana illegal restricts people's choice."Well, do those same people argue for freedom of choice when someone says, 'I want to buy a gun, I want to buy an Uzi?'" Carson responded. "Let's be consistent with this thing."Carson also has been a strident foe of Obamacare, at one point calling it the worst thing to happen to the nation since slavery People already are having problems finding primary care doctors under Obamacare, Carson told Van Susteren.Doctors and hospitals will be forced to do more with with less, he said, meaning a reduction in services and quality of services as well as an extension of wait times for patients."These are just small things compared to what is going to happen after the election this year," Carson said, noting that so far, only 2 percent of Americans have been affected since President Barack Obama delayed until 2014 the implementation of the "employer mandate," which will force more people off their current insurance plans."Of course, it was carefully timed to occur after the election," Carson said.The recently retired chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John's Hopkins University Medical School has hinted at his own run for the presidency in 2016.
