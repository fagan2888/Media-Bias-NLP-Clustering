Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a possible 2016 presidential contender, is scheduled to hit the road and head to Iowa Thursday to boost GOP U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst.

The Houston Chronicle reports the trip is Mr. Perry’s eighth to the Hawkeye State since last year and that he’s been using his political action committee, RickPAC to boost Republican candidates for office there.

Mr. Perry recently delivered a foreign policy speech in London on the Islamic State terrorist group, but cut a planned European trip short to come back to Texas and deal with the Ebola crisis.

A new Quinnipiac poll showsMs. Ernst with a two-point lead among likely voters, 48 percent to 46 percent, over Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley — within the survey’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
