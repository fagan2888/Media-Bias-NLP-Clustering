The reported narrative, to be published today, gives new details about her reaction to the killings of four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and her plans for a possible 2016 presidential run.\n\nSitting to the right of Obama at a Sept. 10, 2009, cabinet meeting, Clinton listened with alarm as other secretaries asked whether health-care legislation was worth sacrificing much of the rest of the president\u2019s agenda, the book says. \u201cThis is the time to do it,\u201d Clinton says in a pep talk the authors recount in the book. \u201cWe\u2019re all in it. Everyone in this room knows how important this is.\u201d\n\nHer own experience with pushing for a health-care revamp informed her advice to senior Obama administration officials and lawmakers, the authors write. In 1994, during President Bill Clinton\u2019s first term, the first lady lost a fight to change the country\u2019s health-insurance system.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Look, the president had more support in Congress than my husband did back in \u201993, \u201994, so he could put together a majority,\u2019\u201d Clinton says in the book. \u201cIf the Republicans stonewalled, which they were beginning to show they would, despite his best efforts, he could still put a package on the floor and get it passed in both houses, which doesn\u2019t come along every first term of a president.\u201d\n\nObama signed the Affordable Care Act -- dubbed Obamacare -- into law March 23, 2010. Democrats are still experiencing repercussions; the issue cost them the House of Representatives in 2010 and has returned as a dominant theme of this year\u2019s congressional races. Republicans are positioned to retain the House and need a net of six seats to take the Senate.\n\nThe book also traces Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew\u2019s path through Obama\u2019s administration. In a twist, the former Citigroup Inc. executive began in the State Department in 2009 after Obama\u2019s then-chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, objected to installing him at the Treasury Department.\n\nEmanuel was \u201cworried that it wouldn\u2019t look good to put a Citigroup executive in that job in the midst of a Wall Street bailout,\u201d the book says.\n\nClinton came to regard Lew as her \u201csecret weapon,\u201d the book says, detailing how he was able to fight off a late 2009 budget plan that called for a minor cut in State Department funding when she wanted a double-digit increase. After Lew\u2019s intervention, the White House budget request for State and aid programs represented a 10.6 percent increase over the previous year, to $56.6 billion, the book says.\n\nHRC opens with a scene of Clinton watching video of an April 5, 2010, attack on an American consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan, and deciding that the U.S. \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to leave vacuums in troublesome regions.\u201d\n\nIt serves as a preview of what would become the most controversial event during her time at State, the Sept. 11, 2012, assault on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, in which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. The book recalls that day.\n\nThere was \u201ceuphoria,\u201d as former Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides put it, when an official at the Tripoli embassy sent word that Stevens might still be alive, followed by shock and grief over a second attack and confirmation Stevens was dead.\n\n\u201cI saw it in real time, and she handled a real crisis,\u201d Nides, now vice chairman of Morgan Stanley, says in the book. \u201cAnd you know, she wasn\u2019t mechanical, screaming at people, but she was emotional, she was firm in getting facts and getting the issues resolved.\u201d\n\nClinton declined to appear on Sunday talk shows immediately after the attacks. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice appeared on all five of them in her place, erroneously saying that spontaneous protests, rather than a planned terrorist attack, had morphed into the assaults.\n\n\u201cWhat difference at this point does it make?\u201d Clinton said in January 2013 when asked by a senator at a congressional hearing whether the deaths were officially the result of terrorism. The book says that Clinton\u2019s longtime aide, Philippe Reines unwittingly inspired that line during a prep session.\n\nWhat transpired in Benghazi, and the administration\u2019s reaction afterward, will re-emerge in the 2016 presidential race should Clinton choose to run. The book makes it clear that she\u2019s preparing for a second run after having lost the 2008 race for the Democratic nomination to Obama, then a U.S. senator from Illinois.\n\nThe former first lady is publishing her own account of her time at the State Department later this year. She also has been meeting privately with donors and other political allies since early last year, the authors assert.\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s own recitation of her political life, she insists that she has been drafted for her offices, including the 2000 New York Senate race she won as she was preparing to leave the White House. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d run for office, and then circumstances kind of conspired to suck me into the Senate race in New York,\u201d she says in the book.\n\nDescribing her future plans, she says: \u201cI never know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hrc,book,hillary,obamacare,ally", "pubdate": "2014-02-11T07:03:18", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Hillary Clinton, once President Barack Obama's political foe, emerged as his top ally on what would become his signature policy achievement: revamping the U.S. health-care system.She quietly advised administration officials and lawmakers uneasy after a summer of attacks by...", "title": "Book: Hillary Emerged as President's Best Obamacare Ally", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hrc-book-hillary-obamacare/2014/02/11/id/552071/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=d29948b2-206f-4ca3-a51b-6a0ca85e352c&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hrc-book-hillary-obamacare/2014/02/11/id/552071/", "title": "Book: Hillary Emerged as President's Best Obamacare Ally", "description": "Hillary Clinton, once President Barack Obama's political foe, emerged as his top ally on what would become his signature policy achievement: revamping the U.S. health-care system.She quietly advised administration officials and lawmakers uneasy after a summer of attacks by...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1392102198, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "hrc,book,hillary,obamacare,ally", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-02-11T07:03:18"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hrc-book-hillary-obamacare/2014/02/11/id/552071/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Hillary Clinton Emerged as Top Obama Health-Care Ally, Book Says"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton, once President Barack Obama\u2019s political foe, emerged as his top ally on what would become his signature policy achievement: revamping the U.S. health-care system.\n\u201cThis is the time to do it,\u201d Clinton says in a pep talk the authors recount in the book.\nWhat transpired in Benghazi, and the administration\u2019s reaction afterward, will re-emerge in the 2016 presidential race should Clinton choose to run.\nIn 1994, during President Bill Clinton\u2019s first term, the first lady lost a fight to change the country\u2019s health-insurance system.\nThe book says that Clinton\u2019s longtime aide, Philippe Reines unwittingly inspired that line during a prep session."}
