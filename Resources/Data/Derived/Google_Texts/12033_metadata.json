The Koch Brothers have helped elect governors across America who support transvaginal ultrasound bills.\"\n\nThe spoof was created by The Other 98%, a grassroots progressive nonprofit that opposes corporate lobbying.\n\nRepublican-controlled state legislatures have passed a record number of laws in the past three years that restrict access to abortion and contraception, and require women to undergo ultrasound procedures before having an abortion. Ten states have adopted mandatory ultrasound laws, and four of those states require a woman to undergo a more invasive transvaginal ultrasound procedure if a regular ultrasound fails to make the fetal heartbeat audible.\n\nIn addition to giving Generation Opportunity $5 million to roll out its anti-Obamacare campaign, the Koch brothers have funded a number of conservative advocacy groups that have pushed states to adopt mandatory ultrasound laws.\n\nEvan Feinberg, president of Generation Opportunity, responded to the ads in a statement. \"The feigned outrage on the left shows that they're genuinely terrified that young people will hear our message,\" Feinberg said. \"Obamacare supporters are using millions of taxpayer dollars in an attempt to brainwash my generation into signing up for an expensive, unfair, and, quite frankly, creepy pyramid scheme.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't have celebrities and taxpayer dollars like Enroll America so we are relying on creativity and grassroots activism to reach our fellow millennials.\"\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Generation Opportunity's \"tasteless\" Uncle Sam ad is only going to hurt the conservative cause.\n\n\"This ad is brought to you by the same people who force the government between our legs when it comes to abortion access, forced ultrasounds and birth control,\" she said. \"At a time when the gender gap between parties is significant, this ad will only further alienate women.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Curious Campaign Ads Curious Campaign Ads\n\n1 of 23 Motorcycle To Change Candidate: Jon Huntsman Race: 2012 Republican Presidential Primary Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "To kick off its new anti-Obamacare campaign, a conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch released a web ad last week that ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-25 12:53:32 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "To kick off its new anti-Obamacare campaign, a conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch released a web ad last week that ...", "title": "WATCH: Koch-Funded Creepy Gynecologist Ad Gets Spoofed", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/24/creepy-uncle-sam_n_3982674.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1370888/images/o-CREEPY-UNCLE-SAM-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To kick off its new anti-Obamacare campaign, a conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch released a web ad last week that ...", "creator": "lebassett", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1370888/images/o-CREEPY-UNCLE-SAM-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "WATCH: Koch-Funded Creepy Gynecologist Ad Gets Spoofed", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-24 12:53:32 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3982674", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "koch brothers uncle sam,creepy uncle sam ad,video,the other 98%,generation opportunity,koch brothers obamacare ad,koch brothers ultrasound", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "koch brothers uncle sam,creepy uncle sam ad,video,the other 98%,generation opportunity,koch brothers obamacare ad,koch brothers ultrasound", "published_time": "2013-09-24 12:53:32 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-25 10:35:50 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dae\"", "article_summary": "Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Generation Opportunity's \"tasteless\" Uncle Sam ad is only going to hurt the conservative cause.\nOne progressive group is firing back this week with a spoof of the ad that features creepy Uncle Sam hovering over the same woman with a transvaginal ultrasound wand.\nThe Koch Brothers have helped elect governors across America who support transvaginal ultrasound bills.\"\n\"At a time when the gender gap between parties is significant, this ad will only further alienate women.\"\nAlso on HuffPost: Curious Campaign Ads Curious Campaign Ads1 of 23 Motorcycle To Change Candidate: Jon Huntsman Race: 2012 Republican Presidential Primary Share this slide:"}
