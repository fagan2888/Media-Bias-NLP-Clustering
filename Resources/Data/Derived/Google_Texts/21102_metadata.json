Jeb Bush on Thursday said the USA Patriot Act is constitutional, has not violated civil rights and should be reauthorized. More\n\nAsked during a meeting with Granite State lawmakers and business leaders to say where, other than the Iraq War, there is \u201cbig space\u201d between himself and President George W. Bush, the former Florida governor said, \u201cI think in Washington during my brother\u2019s time, Republicans spent too much money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he could have used the veto. He didn\u2019t have line-item veto power, but he could have brought budget discipline to Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nBut Bush quickly added: \u201cThat seems kind of quaint right now, given that since he left, spending has gone up astronomically. But having constraints on spending across the board during his time would have been a good thing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel compelled, though, to go out of my way to criticize Republican presidents,\u201d Bush said. \u201cCall me a team player here. It just so happens the last two Republican presidents happened to be my dad and my brother. But you\u2019ll never hear me complaining about Ronald Reagan, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery president makes mistakes. The question is, what have you learned from those mistakes? Past doesn\u2019t have to be prologue. You can learn from your predecessors, in business, in life and certainly in politics.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Iraq War, he said: \u201cIn hindsight, based on the faulty intelligence and security issues, I wouldn\u2019t have gone in, and mistakes were made, and my brother concurs, along with a lot of other people.\u201d\n\nBush spoke to members of the New Hampshire House Business Caucus and Concord Chamber of Commerce at The Draft. The pub is owned by state Sen. Andy Sanborn \u2013 a supporter of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul -- and state Rep. Laurie Sanborn, who chairs the business caucus.\n\nBush later wrapped up his latest two-day New Hampshire swing with a visit to the Tuscan Kitchen in Salem.\n\nBush's comments on his brother drew criticism from the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush can\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t like that they spent money, but he liked what they spent it on,\u201d DNC spokeswoman Holly Shulman said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. Jeb Bush is desperately trying to prove there\u2019s \u2018space\u2019 between him and his brother where none exists.\u201d\n\nBush spoke about his experience creating a business in Florida and his efforts as governor to substantially slow the growth of state government spending while growing a rainy day fund.\n\n\u201cI vetoed over 2,700 line items in the budget, for Republicans and Democrats alike,\u201d he said, noting that he was known as \u201cVeto Corleone.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor five of my eight years, we led the nation in job growth,\u201d he said of his time as governor. \u201cWe should not create a perpetual dependence on government.\n\nA key factor in growing the nation\u2019s economy is energy independence, Bush said. He said Washington uses the federal tax code in \u201cpicking winners and losers\u201d and is \u201cusing the code to determine which energy source should be the appropriate one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think all of that ought to be phased out, whether it is the oil and gas sector, wind or solar or renewable mandate for ethanol,\" he said. \"Over time in a thoughtful way, we ought to be phasing that out and let free market economics apply.\u201d\n\nHe praised fracking as a technology that has driven down the price of natural gas.\n\n\u201cI trust the marketplace to be the source of innovation in our country. Instead of trying to impede that development, we should be encouraging it over the long haul,\u201d Bush said.\n\nIn Salem, Bush praised the energy production boom.\n\n\u201cThere should be marching bands celebrating this. Instead, we have an administration that feels like this is a real defeat for them.\u201d\n\nBush in Concord defended the Common Core education program, saying that it is flexible and allows states to decide the amount of testing given to students. He said Common Core standards were higher than the standards in his home state when he became governor.\n\nHe said that Florida, under his leadership, set up its own testing program, graded schools and established a voucher program to allow parents of failing schools to send their children elsewhere. He said Florida has tens of thousands of students involved in voucher programs.\n\n\u201cCall it what you want, but advocate higher standards,\u201d Bush told Republican lawmakers, who, generally in New Hampshire, are opposed to Common Core.\n\nBush was Florida\u2019s governor from 1999 to 2007.\n\nOn immigration, Bush said the border should be secured, \u201cand we need to make it a lot harder to come here illegally than to come here legally.\u201d He called for ending \u201cchain immigration.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cFor the 11 million people here illegally, we need to have them come out from the shadows. They should pay a fine, receive a provisional work permit, not receive federal government assistance, work, learn English, and over an extended period of time, achieve legal status, but not necessarily citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat, in a practical society, is how you get to where immigration is part of a solution to things, rather than a problem.\u201d\n\nOn health care, Bush said that if the U.S. Supreme Court rules the Affordable Care Act federal exchange unconstitutional, Republicans should be ready with an alternative that is \u201cconsumer-directed\u201d and has \u201ccatastrophic coverage with low premiums, where the government\u2019s role is providing premium support for people and the insurance itself has no mandates and fewer mandated benefits, which currently creates the exorbitant consumer costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpowering people to make more of these decisions is key a key element to the change,\u201d he said, calling the ACA \u201ca perpetual root canal.\u201d\n\nIn Salem, Bush said: \u201cPeople want access to affordable health care insurance. And they should have \u2013 and they should feel that way. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad motivation at all. But we could deliver that to them without all of the massive controls.\u201d\n\nBush also called for a review of government agencies\u2019 roles under the 10th Amendment and said authority should be \u201cdelegated back\u201d to the states in many cases.\n\nHe cited the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rules, and also said, \u201cI think Medicaid ought to be state-run.\u201d\n\nBush also called for a stronger U.S. presence in the world. He said Iran and Cuba are the only two nations with which the United States has better relations now than it did when Barack Obama became president.\n\n\u201cThink about that,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfriendly nations \u201cnow see us as weak and vacillating,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world needs United States leadership.\u201d\n\nIn Salem, Bush said he has enjoyed his visits to New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a blast interacting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re respectful, they have a lot of great questions, a lot of great dialogue. It\u2019s a great way to campaign. I think New Hampshire ought to export this style of campaigning to the rest of the country, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n(WMUR Political Reporter Adam Sexton contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 21 May 2015 17:53:39 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Jeb Bush said Thursday that while his brother was in the White House, he and his fellow Republicans spent too much of the taxpayers\u2019 money.", "title": "Jeb Bush says brother spent too much as president", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/jeb-bush-says-brother-spent-too-much-as-president/33148366", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/33144452/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/5332v2/-/Jeb-Bush-521-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/jeb-bush-says-brother-spent-too-much-as-president/33148366", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/33148366", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/33148366", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/33148366"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/33148366", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/33148366", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/jeb-bush-says-brother-spent-too-much-as-president/33148366"}, "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "keywords": "Jeb Bush, George W.
