Think of the magic that Madison, Hamilton, and the rest of those schlubs could have produced if they\u2019d only had pizza and Mountain Dew and been willing to pull a few all-nighters at Philadelphia in 1787. Somewhere between the idealism and the curling slice of last night\u2019s pepperoni, Macon Phillips, the administration\u2019s director of new media, happened to come across a tweet by Edward Mullen of Jersey City in which he twitpiced his design for what a health-insurance exchange could look like. So Phillips printed it out to show his fellow administration officials: \u201cLook, this is the sort of creativity that is out there,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing led to another and he left Jersey City to come to D.C. and helped push us through an information architectural process.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t you just love it! This is way cooler than the decline and fall of the Roman Empire: The only \u201carchitectural process\u201d they had was crumbling viaducts. I think we can all agree that Barack Obama is hipper than all other government leaders anywhere, ever, combined. Unfortunately, the dogs bark and the pizza-delivery bike moves on, and, in the cold grey morning after of the grease-stained cardboard box with the rubberized cheese stuck to it, Obamacare wound up somewhat less hipper and, in fact, not even HIPAA \u2014 the unpersuasively groovy acronym for federally mandated medical privacy in America. Appearing before Congress on Thursday, the magicians of Obamacare eventually conceded that, on their supposedly HIPAA-compliant database, deep in the \u201cinformation architectural process\u201d is a teensy-weensy little bit of \u201csource code\u201d that reads, \u201cYou have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication of any data transmitted or stored on this information system.\u201d\n\nDemocrat members of the House committee professed to be bewildered at why anyone would be either surprised or upset to discover that his information can be shared with anyone in the federal government, including a corrupt and diseased IRS that uses what confidential information it can acquire to torment perceived ideological enemies. And at a certain level the more blas\u00e9 of the people\u2019s representatives such as New Jersey\u2019s Frank Pallone have a point: If Obama thinks nothing of tapping Angela Merkel\u2019s cell phone (as she had cause to complain to him on Wednesday, in what was said to be a \u201ccool\u201d conversation, and not in the hepcat sense), why would he extend any greater privacy rights to your Auntie Mabel?\n\nIncidentally, do you think we need a congressional oversight committee to look into the effectiveness of congressional oversight committees? Every time I\u2019m stuck at Gate 37 and glance up at the 24/7 Wolf Blitzer channel there\u2019s somebody testifying about something: Benghazi . . . Lois Lerner . . . Obamacare . . . No one gets fired, no agency gets closed, nothing changes.\n\nThe witness who coughed up the intriguing tidbit about Obamacare\u2019s exemption from privacy protections was one Cheryl Campbell of something called CGI. This rang a vague bell with me. CGI is not a creative free spirit from Jersey City with an impressive mastery of Twitter, but a Canadian corporate behemoth. Indeed, CGI is so Canadian their name is French: Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique. Their most famous government project was for the Canadian Firearms Registry. The registry was estimated to cost in total $119 million, which would be offset by $117 million in fees. That\u2019s a net cost of $2 million. Instead, by 2004 the CBC (Canada\u2019s PBS) was reporting costs of some $2 billion \u2014 or a thousand times more expensive.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know, we\u2019ve all had bathroom remodelers like that. But in this case the database had to register some 7 million long guns belonging to some two-and-a-half to three million Canadians. That works out to almost $300 per gun \u2014 or somewhat higher than the original estimate for processing a firearm registration of $4.60. Of those $300 gun registrations, Canada\u2019s auditor general reported to parliament that much of the information was either duplicated or wrong in respect to basic information such as names and addresses.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nAlso, there was a 1-800 number, but it wasn\u2019t any use.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSo it was decided that the sclerotic database needed to be improved.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nBut it proved impossible to \u201cimprove\u201d CFIS (the Canadian Firearms Information System). So CGI was hired to create an entirely new CFIS II, which would operate alongside CFIS I until the old system could be scrapped. CFIS II was supposed to go operational on January 9, 2003, but the January date got postponed to June, and 2003 to 2004, and $81 million was thrown at it before a new Conservative government scrapped the fiasco in 2007. Last year, the government of Ontario canceled another CGI registry that never saw the light of day \u2014 just for one disease, diabetes, and costing a mere $46 million.\n\nBut there\u2019s always America! \u201cWe continue to view U.S. federal government as a significant growth opportunity,\u201d declared CGI\u2019s chief exec, in what would also make a fine epitaph for the republic. Pizza and Mountain Dew isn\u2019t very Montreal, and on the evidence of three years of missed deadlines in Ontario and the four-year overrun on the firearms database CGI don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re pulling that many all-nighters. Was the government of the United States aware that CGI had been fired by the government of Canada and the government of Ontario (and the government of New Brunswick)? Nobody\u2019s saying. But I doubt it would make much difference. Asked by Mother Jones to explain why Obama the candidate uses the Internet so effectively but Obama the government is a bust, his 2008 tech maestro Clay Johnson put it this way: \u201cThe first person that you need in order to start a Web company would be a Web developer; the first person you need to start a government-contracting firm is an attorney.\u201d The problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t the website design, it\u2019s the nature of government procurement in an unaccountable bureaucracy serving 300 million people.\n\nDespite the best efforts of President Obama and doting tweeters in Jersey City, government isn\u2019t groovy. The standard rap on Obamacare is that it\u2019s turned America\u2019s health system into the DMV. If only. I had cause to go to the DMV in Twin Mountain, N.H., the other day. In and out in ten minutes. Modest accommodations, a little down-at-heel, nothing cool about it at all. But it worked just fine. Friendly chap, no complaints. Government can do that at the town level, county level, even (more sparingly) at the state level.\n\nBut a national medical regime for 300 million people? Not in a First World country. And, when you\u2019re mad enough to try it, the failure is not the insignificant enrollment numbers, but the vaporization of the existing health plans of 119,000 Pennsylvanians, 160,000 Californians, 300,000 Floridians, 800,000 in that tech tweeter\u2019s New Jersey . . . That\u2019s the magic that happens when you disdain the limits of prosaic, humdrum, just-about-functioning government. Perhaps things will get so bad the coolest president ever will no longer seem quite so hip. But, alas, you\u2019ll have to wait three years for a hip replacement.

Every time I\u2019m stuck at Gate 37 and glance up at the 24/7 Wolf Blitzer channel there\u2019s somebody testifying about something: Benghazi\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0Lois Lerner\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0Obamacare\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0No one gets fired, no agency gets closed, nothing changes.\n\nThe witness who coughed up the intriguing tidbit about Obamacare\u2019s exemption from privacy protections was one Cheryl Campbell of something called CGI. This rang a vague bell with me. CGI is not a creative free spirit from Jersey City with an impressive mastery of Twitter, but a Canadian corporate behemoth. Indeed, CGI is so Canadian their name is French: Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique. Their most famous government project was for the Canadian Firearms Registry. The registry was estimated to cost in total $119 million, which would be offset by $117 million in fees. That\u2019s a net cost of $2 million. Instead, by 2004 the CBC (Canada\u2019s PBS) was reporting costs of some $2 billion \u2014 or a thousand times more expensive.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know, we\u2019ve all had bathroom remodelers like that.\u00a0But in this case the database had to register some 7 million long guns belonging to some two-and-a-half to three million Canadians. That works out to almost $300 per gun \u2014 or somewhat higher than the original estimate for processing a firearm registration of $4.60. Of those $300 gun registrations, Canada\u2019s auditor general reported to parliament that much of the information was either duplicated or wrong in respect to basic information such as names and addresses.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nAlso, there was a 1-800 number, but it wasn\u2019t any use.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSo it was decided that the sclerotic database needed to be improved.\n\nSound familiar?#page#\n\nBut it proved impossible to \u201cimprove\u201d CFIS (the Canadian Firearms Information System). So CGI was hired to create an entirely new CFIS II, which would operate alongside CFIS I until the old system could be scrapped. CFIS II was supposed to go operational on January 9,\u00a02003, but the January date got postponed to June, and 2003 to 2004, and $81 million was thrown at it before a new Conservative government scrapped the fiasco in 2007. Last year, the government of Ontario canceled another CGI registry that never saw the light of day \u2014 just for one disease, diabetes, and costing a mere $46 million.#ad#\n\nBut there\u2019s always America! \u201cWe continue to view U.S. federal government as a significant growth opportunity,\u201d declared CGI\u2019s chief exec, in what would also make a fine epitaph for the republic. Pizza and Mountain Dew isn\u2019t very Montreal, and on the evidence of three years of missed deadlines in Ontario and the four-year overrun on the firearms database CGI don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re pulling that many all-nighters. Was the government of the United States aware that CGI had been fired by the government of Canada and the government of Ontario (and the government of New Brunswick)? Nobody\u2019s saying. But I doubt it would make much difference. Asked by Mother Jones to explain why Obama the candidate uses the Internet so effectively but Obama the government is a bust, his 2008 tech maestro Clay Johnson put it this way: \u201cThe first person that you need in order to start a Web company would be a Web developer; the first person you need to start a government-contracting firm is an attorney.\u201d The problem with Obamacare isn\u2019t the website design, it\u2019s the nature of government procurement in an unaccountable bureaucracy serving 300 million people.\n\nDespite the best efforts of President Obama and doting tweeters in Jersey City, government isn\u2019t groovy. The standard rap on Obamacare is that it\u2019s turned America\u2019s health system into the DMV. If only. I had cause to go to the DMV in Twin Mountain, N.H., the other day. In and out in ten minutes. Modest accommodations, a little down-at-heel, nothing cool about it at all. But it worked just fine. Friendly chap, no complaints. Government can do that at the town level, county level, even (more sparingly) at the state level.\n\nBut a national medical regime for 300 million people? Not in a First World country. And, when you\u2019re mad enough to try it, the failure is not the insignificant enrollment numbers, but the vaporization of the existing health plans of 119,000 Pennsylvanians, 160,000 Californians, 300,000 Floridians, 800,000 in that tech tweeter\u2019s New Jersey\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0That\u2019s the magic that happens when you disdain the limits of prosaic, humdrum, just-about-functioning government. Perhaps things will get so bad the coolest president ever will no longer seem quite so hip. But, alas, you\u2019ll have to wait three years for a hip replacement. That\u2019s government health care for you.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u00a0Mark Steyn, a\u00a0National Review\u00a0columnist, is the author of\u00a0After America: Get Ready for Armageddon. \u00a9 2013 Mark Steyn", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Magical Thinkers, by Mark Steyn, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Fri, 2013-10-25 18:30", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare\u2019s Magical Thinkers", "keywords": "Mark Steyn", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Obamacare\u2019s Magical Thinkers, Mark Steyn, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Mark Steyn, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad9e\"", "article_summary": "Not even the coolest president ever can conjure up a national medical regime for 300 million people.\n\u2014 Mark Steyn, a National Review columnist, is the author of After America: Get Ready for Armageddon.\nBut a national medical regime for 300 million people?\nI think we can all agree that Barack Obama is hipper than all other government leaders anywhere, ever, combined.\nObamacare ."}
