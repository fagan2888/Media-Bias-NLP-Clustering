While we\u2019re all concerned about the more serious and highly beneficial transformations both digital design and manufacturing have to offer the world, we\u2019ll have to get back to you after snacktime.\n\nAnd while having a delicious 3D printed sugary delight is one treat, just imagine if it were combined with another indulgence we all secretly love and often are quite prolific in creating on our own en masse\u2013the selfie. If these are a couple of life\u2019s small pleasures that you enjoy, then the services offered by Candy Mechanics should have you jumping up and down on your bed with delight, one arm pumping overhead in epicurean victory and the other holding a 3D printed candy on a stick.\n\nOnce your mom yells at you to stop doing that, you may be thrilled to check out the services and flavors Candy Mechanics has to offer\u2013and they promise that no matter what your mug might look like in person, undoubtedly it will be very attractive, 3D printed in candy form on a stick. This isn\u2019t just one of most yummy looking creations we\u2019ve seen\u2013it\u2019s a very creative combination of technologies\u2013and the team really offers a sense of humor; there\u2019s no way offering one of these candied treats as a gift wouldn\u2019t procure a smile from even the stodgiest of recipients.\n\nFounded recently by Londoners Sam Part and Ben Redford, they are on a self-professed and very noble mission to see that candy-eating tech lovers everywhere have the dubious distinction of saying that they ate their own faces. Imbued with a deep passion for \u201cmaking ridiculously awesome stuff,\u201d the Candy Mechanics team is now just about to launch their first run of numerous delectable flavors. As part of the seven-member Makerversity popup in London at Selfridges, composed of three teams (see video below), the duo completed a six-week \u2018trial by fire\u2019 creation of their line of 3D printed candy.\n\nPositioned in one of the busy areas of London, the members were basically on display as they created brands for new businesses. Using off-the-shelf scanners and 3D printing, they were able to use the six weeks to create their product while in the public view, making for an intense\u2013and fulfilling\u2013project scope and experience, as they developed a business with some seriously savvy flavor.\n\nIf you are hungry, this next part might get you in some high-caloric trouble. If the stomach\u2019s rumbling and the wallet\u2019s opening, you\u2019ll have to literally \u2018head over\u2019 to Candy Mechanics to order a taste of the following in your likeness:\n\nFreeze-dried raspberry and salted pistachio\n\nLemon and biscuit crumb\n\nSalted corn and chocolate crumb\n\nPeanut and chocolate crumb\n\nBanana and salted peanut\n\nFreeze-dried raspberry and black sesame seed\n\nOnce at their office, the team uses a handheld scanner to digitize your countenance. If you live outside of London, contact them to see about how to get a scan of your likeness to their headquarters.\n\nOrders are required to be for at least 100 3D printed candies, and they can be prepared for large events like weddings, parties, office events, and more. Candy Mechanics can also take into account varying dietary requirements as well as some, ahem, more xxx requests.\n\nAre you interested in contacting Candy Mechanics for their 3D printed products, or are you planning to pop in and see them in London?
