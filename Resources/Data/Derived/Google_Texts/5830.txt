An Illinois woman tried to used the popular crowdfunding website GoFundMe to raise money for a late term abortion so she can continue to party.

The funding page, “Bailey’s Abortion Fund” has been taken down, but Life Site News reported Friday that 106 people had already donated $1,654 towards the woman’s goal of $2,500.

The page was created by Bailey and her boyfriend touting “Bailey needs an abortion,” in the description, the website reported.

“Bailey is currently unemployed, completely broke, in debt, and in no position to hold down a job due to severe symptoms of a rough, unplanned and unexpected pregnancy,” the page reads. “Aside from having no desire to raise a child, she is economically unstable and can barely afford to support herself, which means having enough money to pay rent, smoke cigarettes, drink rockstar, support her friends in prison, and if she’s really busted her [expletive], maybe go to a show or two.”

The page was written by Bailey’s current boyfriend, Lücifer Ryzing, who is not the father of her unborn child.

In an interview with Vice News, Bailey said “I’m hoping people will [donate], but it’s also totally fine if people don’t. I know if I saw something like this I’d be like, ‘I want to help this person to make sure they live the life they want to live.’ It’s more time-sensitive than some of the other things that you see.”
