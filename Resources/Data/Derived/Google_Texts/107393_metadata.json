Or rather, a group of sex workers operating out of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Mound House, Nevada, under the management of their outspoken boss.\n\nAs numerous news outlets have reported, the Hookers 4 Hillary campaign was the brainchild of Dennis Hof, owner of seven legal brothels in Nevada including the Bunny Ranch, and author of the scumbag manifesto \u201cThe Art of the Pimp.\u201d\n\n\u201cHookers 4 Hillary came about about six months ago when Hillary came out and decided she was gonna run,\u201d Hof told The Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019d previously got all the girls and talked to \u2018em, and the majority like Hillary.\u201d\n\nHof freely admits the group is a bit of a publicity stunt, but one he sees as benefitting both the Bunny Ranch and Clinton. (Because all the religious Nevadans she\u2019s currently trying to court are bound to love it?) Via The Guardian:\n\nHookers for Hillary is \u201ca great way to get, not only the Bunny Ranch\u2019s name out there, but to get more support for Hillary \u2026 Hopefully maybe people who were not really [political] followers before kind of looked into it and went, \u2018Wow, this is big! What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201cAnd perhaps,\u201d said the chatty registered Democrat in skin-tight lavender, \u201cthey researched Hillary a little more, and perhaps they researched us as well. So it was kind of beneficial on both sides.\u201d\n\nThe Bunny Ranch is offering \u201cextras\u201d to people who claim they are caucusing for Clinton, although there\u2019s really no way to know if they\u2019re telling the truth. Hookers 4 Hillary: Come for the hawkish neoliberalism, stay for the extra blow job!\n\nHookers 4 Hillary represents a bit of a left turn from 2008 and 2012, when Hof\u2019s \u201cPimpin\u2019 for Paul\u201d campaign attempted to propel Libertarian Party candidate Ron Raul into the White House. His second choice for president this election: Donald Trump. To read between the lines, it seems he will accept anyone socially liberal enough not to go on a holy crusade against prostitution, but fiscally conservative enough not to raise top tax rates too much. That an extremely wealthy business owner would even consider Clinton in the same ball park as Paul or Trump speaks volumes about Clinton\u2019s tax policies.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s AVN press release names healthcare reform, foreign policy experience, and a mistrust of supply-side economics as reasons for supporting Clinton. Many of the \u201cgirls\u201d say they had trouble buying health insurance before the Affordable Care Act, as their status as sex workers often led insurance companies to reject them for being \u201ctoo risky,\u201d despite their six-figure incomes. Taylor Lee, a major supporter of Obamacare, told the Guardian she went into sex work partly because her epilepsy medicine was too expensive to afford on a server\u2019s salary. (Lee, on whose quotes much of the Guardian article is hung, said she plans to caucus for Bernie Sanders, despite pressure from her employer to caucus for Clinton.)\n\nYet another reason for supporting Clinton: Like many around the country, the Bunnies think it\u2019s time to get a woman in the White House \u2014 a woman who, they believe, respects them as workers and people. \u201cWe\u2019re helping Hillary, and we\u2019re helping ourselves. Women should help other women, right?\u201d Entice Love told the Guardian in an eerie echo of Madeline Albright\u2019s words.\n\nHof was slightly less politically correct about it. \u201cThey think it\u2019s time a woman should be elected,\u201d he told The Huffington Post. \u201cIt should have happened before a black. Many of the women earn six-figure incomes, but they couldn\u2019t get health care before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she could work with the members of Congress who refuse to work with Obama,\u201d Caressa Kisses told HuffPost. \u201cPlus, I think she would be understanding to what we do as sex workers. I think she sees everyone as a person and doesn\u2019t judge.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that last statement from Kisses might not be totally accurate. Back in 2007, when trying to win the very same caucus, Clinton was asked her stance on \u201clegalized prostitution\u201d (or decriminalized sex work, to put it more accurately) by the Reno Gazette-Journal. Her reply:\n\n\u201cI do not approve of legalized prostitution or any kind of prostitution. It is something that I personally believe is demeaning to women. I have worked against it and I have certainly taken a very strong stand against what happens in many parts of the world where young girls and women are forced into prostitution against their wills. I understand Nevada has a regulated system and it is within the authority of the state. So that is not a federal issue that we will have any role to play in when I am president. But I would obviously speak out against prostitution and try to persuade women that it is not \u2014 even in a regulated system \u2014 necessarily a good way to try to make a living. Let\u2019s try to find other jobs that can be there for women who are looking for a good way to support themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nSounds pretty judgmental to me. Maybe that\u2019s why the Clinton campaign has thus far refused all requests for comment on Hookers 4 Hillary, including ours.\n\nIn an effort to press Hof on this discrepancy, I gave him a ring. Was he aware of Clinton\u2019s opposition to his industry?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he answered without hesitation. \u201cDo I believe that she really thinks that way? No, not at all. It\u2019s something that sounds good for a quick sound bite, but the reality is she\u2019s not gonna take any jobs away from women. She understands that the legal way is a lot better than the illegal way. She doesn\u2019t like sex trafficking any more than you or I do.\u201d\n\nJust to be clear, I asked if he believed Clinton was lying about her anti-sex work beliefs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about it at all, and neither are the girls,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe girls are more concerned about things like before Obamacare, because they were prostitutes, they could not get health insurance even though some of them had six-figure incomes. They couldn\u2019t get health insurance because the industry painted them all with the same brush. Prostitutes, illegal prostitutes, lots of disease, lots of mortality, lots of drug usage. So now they can. So that\u2019s very important to them that they be able to keep their health insurance.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of health insurance, I asked him what he thought of Sanders\u2019 plan for universal healthcare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the Bern. I don\u2019t follow him. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any hope of him winning anything. It\u2019s really nice to tell everybody what they wanna hear, but how you gonna back it up? They\u2019re not giving us any specifics at all.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t ask how he knew Sanders\u2019 healthcare plan sucked if he didn\u2019t follow him or know anything about him. I did, however, ask why Trump was his second choice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we get a businessman in there,\u201d Hof proclaimed. \u201cIf Hillary\u2019s not gonna win, I definitely think she will. We\u2019re all excited about that \u2014 it\u2019s time for a woman to be in the White House, and it\u2019s also reassuring for me to know that when Hillary\u2019s having her green shake in the morning, she\u2019s able to talk things over with the best president ever, Bill Clinton. [During his presidency] I paid more taxes than I ever paid, I made more money than I ever made. I\u2019d like his input on things.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Hof and (some of) his employees support Clinton because she\u2019s a woman, because she\u2019s married to Bill Clinton and listens to his advice while she drinks her girly breakfast, because her policies are good for business, because Obamacare helped high-earning sex workers purchase insurance from private companies, because they erroneously believe she respects them, and because a woman president \u201cshould have happened before a black.\u201d And you thought it was just a craven publicity stunt.\n\nAt the outset of this story, I thought I\u2019d be highlighting yet another group of people voting against their own interests. But Hof and his employees are smarter than that. Whether or not Clinton is sincere in her distaste for sex work is far less relevant to their lives than the material effects she\u2019d have on the Nevada sex industry. Under a centrist, non-evangelical Democrat, the regulation of prostitution would remain up to the states. Rich clients would still have money to burn on the girlfriend experience. The economy would remain business-friendly (avoiding the disastrous supply-side economics of Republicans as well as the redistributionist policies of a more progressive Democrat), and independent contractors taking home $500,000 a year would not be taxed too heavily, nor would they have restrictions placed on what fancy private insurance they could buy.\n\nLike most people, Hof and company vote with their wallets, and will do so regardless of whatever microaggressions Clinton\u2019s committed \u2014 or, um, pretended to commit \u2014 against them.\n\nAs for the vast majority of sex workers in America, who are much more marginalized than those at the Bunny Ranch and would benefit greatly from European style social democracy \u2026 they\u2019re not Hookers 4 Hillary\u2019s problem, now are they? I suppose they can always go work at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, that is, if they\u2019re female, cisgender, able-bodied and blonde enough.\n\nI leave you with this photo of Bill Clinton posing with two Bunny Ranch employees at a charity event in 2014:\n\nI guess he\u2019s not as scared as his wife is to associate with certain constituents.\n\n[h/t The Guardian]", "article_metadata": {"description": "How strange.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "How strange.", "title": "'Hookers 4 Hillary' supports Clinton in Nevada even though she opposes sex work", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/281297/hookers-4-hillary-supports-clinton-in-nevada-even-though-she-opposes-sex-work/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2016/02/hookers-4-hillary.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How strange.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "dennis hof,hookers 4 hillary,moonlite bunny ranch,features", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-18T15:27:26Z", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T15:37:38Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d81\"", "article_summary": "As Nevada\u2019s Democratic caucus draws near, Hillary Clinton has received support from an unlikely group of people: Sex workers.\nOr rather, a group of sex workers operating out of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Mound House, Nevada, under the management of their outspoken boss.\nWhether or not Clinton is sincere in her distaste for sex work is far less relevant to their lives than the material effects she\u2019d have on the Nevada sex industry.\nTaylor Lee, a major supporter of Obamacare, told the Guardian she went into sex work partly because her epilepsy medicine was too expensive to afford on a server\u2019s salary.\nI suppose they can always go work at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, that is, if they\u2019re female, cisgender, able-bodied and blonde enough."}
