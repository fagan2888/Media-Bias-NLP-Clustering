FXX is finally making use of its $750 million deal to rebroadcast The Simpsons on cable and online. On Monday, the network announced the dates for its ludicrous back-to-back marathon of all 522 episodes of the cartoon — maybe plan to call in sick Aug. 21 to Sept. 1? — and disclosed the details of a nefarious, time-sucking plot to post all 207 hours of Simpsons glory online, in a searchable, on-demand streamable new website called Simpsons World.

The full library of Simpsons episodes, online and on a new mobile app, will be available to "authenticated" (read: paying) FXX subscribers, but everybody with an internet connection will be able to watch some clips. Simpsons World is scheduled to go live in October.

FXX executive producer Al Jean marked the promised birth of the Simpsons binge-watching phenomenon with an ObamaCare joke: "I don’t want to over-promise, but I think this website will provide you with affordable health care." Most Simpsons fans are more likely to celebrate like "Comic Book Guy" Jeff Albertson. --Peter Weber
