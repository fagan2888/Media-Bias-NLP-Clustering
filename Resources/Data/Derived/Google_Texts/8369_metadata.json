Ted Cruz, R-Texas, insisted Sunday his filibuster to kill President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act did not \u201cremotely\u201d hurt the Republican Party. Appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union with Candy Crowley,\u201d Cruz said his filibuster had actually strengthened the GOP.\n\nWhen asked whether his anti-Obamacare filibuster had harmed the Republican Party, Cruz replied, \u201cNot remotely. But I also think far too many people are worried about politics.\u201d According to the legislator: \u201c[I]f we worry about what\u2019s impacting the American people, the politics will take care of itself. The politicians that are gazing at polls -- there is a reason why the most common sentiment across this country is that politicians aren\u2019t listening to us, there\u2019s a reason why Congress has a 10 to 15 percent approval rating.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst\n\nPhoto: Reuters Previous Next\n\nIn response, Crowley noted that while a notable proportion of Americans do not favor the Affordable Care Act, the overwhelming majority of them disapproved of the House Republicans\u2019 tactic of shutting down the federal government in an attempt to defund Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhy not just get out there and win elections and overturn it with a Republican Senate and a Republican House and a Republican in the White House instead of shutting down the government, which I think you would concede hurts people who had nothing to do with Obamacare?\u201d Crowley asked.\n\nCruz did not answer the question directly, but instead said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was helping to kill children with cancer by not passing bills funding the National Institutes of Health, as per a Republican plan to fund the federal government piecemeal. According to Cruz: \u201cThe response from the Democrats was, \u2018How dare you question us; we\u2019re going to shut down everything and we don\u2019t intend to budge. That\u2019s not a reasonable position.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nWatch the interview with Cruz below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, sen ted cruz, ted cruz obamacare, ted cruz filibuster, obamacare, government shutdown, affordable care act, obama, federal government, shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "U.S. Sen.
