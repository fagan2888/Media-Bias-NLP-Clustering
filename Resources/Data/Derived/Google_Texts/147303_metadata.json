Circuit that he shouldn\u2019t have to pay a tax for flouting the law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d because his objection to being forced into Obamacare-compliant coverage was just as valid as ones from religious sects.\n\nThe case presented a high-level test of President Obama\u2019s flawed promise that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nThat vow proved untrue when millions received cancellation notices in fall 2013 saying their non-grandfathered plans no longer met Obamacare\u2019s requirements. Under political pressure, the administration allowed policy holders to renew non-compliant plans through late 2016, although states and insurers could choose not to participate.\n\nMr. Cutler, whose plan was canceled, didn\u2019t want to be forced to get health insurance, even though he could afford it and didn\u2019t object on religious grounds.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides religious exemptions from the mandate for members of recognized religious groups, such as the Amish, that tend to care for their own without transferring the cost to the general public.\n\nMr. Cutler\u2019s lawsuit argued that allowing people to duck the law\u2019s for religious reasons, but not secular ones, was an unconstitutional establishment of religion.\n\nUnlike the District Court, the Circuit judges felt Mr. Cutler had the right to sue. He lost, anyway, when the judges said the religious exemptions were narrowly tailored to long-standing groups who are exempt from Medicare and Social Security taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, just like the Social Security exemption, is carefully calibrated to protect the government \u2014 and thus taxpayers who do not share the religious sensibilities of those covered by the exemption \u2014 from later having to pick up the tab from which the adherent has been exempted,\u201d Circuit Judge Patricia Ann Millett, an appointee of President Obama.\n\nMr. Cutler, who represented himself at the District-court level, said that discriminates between religions. But the court said, \u201cthe qualifications for exemption are not drawn on sectarian lines; they simply sort out which faiths have a proven track record of adequately meeting the statutory goals.\u201d\n\nThe court said Mr. Cutler\u2019s had no standing to sue under the second plank of his argument \u2014 that a White House plan to help people transition to new plans was implemented differently from state to state, violating his constitutional right to equal protection.\n\nAccording to the court, Mr. Cutler erroneously claimed Arkansas \u2014 unlike his state of Pennsylvania \u2014 forced insurers to continue to offer non-compliant plans.\n\n\u201cA quick glance at the Arkansas insurance bulletin upon which Cutler relies (but declines to quote) reveals that Arkansas, like Pennsylvania, permits but does not compel the continuation of non-compliant plans during the transition period,\u201d the court said.\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d it added, \u201cCutler has not even colorably alleged a differential-treatment injury because there is no differential treatment.\u201d\n\nThe court said the policy was applied evenly across the U.S., so if Mr. Cutler cannot obtain the insurance he desires and others can, that is because his own insurer cancelled his policy.\n\n\u201cCutler\u2019s injury,\u201d Judge Millett wrote, \u201cis thus the result of the action of his private insurer, not the transitional policy, and it is purely speculative whether an order in this case would alter or affect the non-party insurers\u2019 decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal appeals court Friday ruled against a Pennsylvania man who lost his health plan because of Obamacare and complained that religious exemptions from the law left secular objectors in the cold.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal appeals court Friday ruled against a Pennsylvania man who lost his health plan because of Obamacare and complained that religious exemptions from the law left secular objectors in the cold.", "title": "Jeffrey Cutler, a Pa. man, loses court bid to keep the Obamacare plan he liked", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/14/jeffrey-cutler-pa-man-loses-court-bid-keep-obamaca/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/41335d878e7c481f7c0f6a7067004b74.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/41335d878e7c481f7c0f6a7067004b74.jpg", "description": "A federal appeals court Friday ruled against a Pennsylvania man who lost his health plan because of Obamacare and complained that religious exemptions from the law left secular objectors in the cold", "card": "summary", "title": "Jeffrey Cutler, a Pa. man, loses court bid to keep the Obamacare plan"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Jeffrey Cutler, District Court"}, "article_summary": "According to the court, Mr. Cutler erroneously claimed Arkansas \u2014 unlike his state of Pennsylvania \u2014 forced insurers to continue to offer non-compliant plans.\nMr. Cutler, who represented himself at the District-court level, said that discriminates between religions.\nUnlike the District Court, the Circuit judges felt Mr. Cutler had the right to sue.\nMr. Cutler, whose plan was canceled, didn\u2019t want to be forced to get health insurance, even though he could afford it and didn\u2019t object on religious grounds.\nUnder political pressure, the administration allowed policy holders to renew non-compliant plans through late 2016, although states and insurers could choose not to participate."}
