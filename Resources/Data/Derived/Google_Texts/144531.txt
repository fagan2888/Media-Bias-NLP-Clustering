Green Bay, WI

Green Bay rallied from an 11-point deficit as Aaron Rodgers threw for two fourth-quarter touchdowns to beat Dallas 26-21 Sunday in an NFC divisional-round playoff.



The Packers (13-4), helped immensely by a video reversal with 4:06 remaining, went undefeated at Lambeau Field this season. They head to Seattle for the NFC title game. The Seahawks (13-4) beat Green Bay in the season opener 36-16.



Dez Bryant's leaping catch at the Packers 1 on fourth-and-2 was reversed by referee Gene Steratore after Green Bay challenged.



Instead of first-and-goal for Dallas (13-5), the ball went over to the Packers.



The Cowboys' first postseason trip to Green Bay since the 1967 Ice Bowl for the NFL championship was their first road defeat of the season after eight victories.



All-Pro Rodgers, bothered by a left calf injury hit Davante Adams for a 41-yard score to make it 21-20, and threw a 13-yard bullet to backup tight end Richard Rodgers for the lead.
