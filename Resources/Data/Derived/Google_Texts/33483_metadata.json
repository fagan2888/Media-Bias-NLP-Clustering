White House press secretary Josh Earnest said last week that the president hoped that they would have a chance to talk face-to-face \u201crelatively soon.\u201d The person who said the meeting may happen next week asked for anonymity because the timing hasn\u2019t been settled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need partisanship, we don\u2019t need demagoguery.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether other congressional leaders would take part. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nDoug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said that \u201cnothing is currently scheduled.\u201d Jen Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, declined to comment.\n\nObama, 54, and Ryan, 45, have enough in common personally and in some policy areas for the foundation of a relationship, if either of them desired one. They also have enough accrued tension to dissuade either from bothering in Obama\u2019s final year in office.\n\nFront Row\n\nRyan was offended in April 2011 when Obama disparaged his proposal to overhaul the federal budget while Ryan sat in the front row at a speech. At the time, the president and congressional Republicans were wrangling over strategies to reduce the federal deficit. In a speech at George Washington University, Obama said that a proposal by then-House Budget Committee chairman Ryan was less a fiscal plan than a stab at \"changing the basic social compact in America\" by cutting programs including Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps and education while reducing top income tax rates.\n\nRyan was sitting in the front row of the audience.\n\n\"What we heard was a partisan broadside from our campaigner-in-chief,\u201d Ryan told reporters afterward. \"We don\u2019t need partisanship, we don\u2019t need demagoguery.\"\n\nObama later said his approach was a mistake. The relationship between the two was further strained during Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election, in which Republican challenger Mitt Romney named Ryan as his running mate.\n\nShared Goals\n\nWhile Ryan has sought to repeal Obama\u2019s health care expansion, the Affordable Care Act, the speaker has supported Obama\u2019s 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Ryan has proposed an anti-poverty program, including support for expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income families, a goal shared by Obama. Ryan also largely agrees with Obama\u2019s proposal to overhaul the criminal justice system by reducing prison sentences for nonviolent drug crimes.\n\nMore often, though, they clash. When Obama answered questions from the public on Twitter last week, Ryan posted a query Obama\u2019s plans to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba terrorist prison. Obama ignored the query.\n\nWhile Ryan and Obama represent significantly different constituencies, they fill somewhat parallel roles in their parties as dynamic leaders with broad appeal, including to independents. They also share a reputation for preferring pragmatism over ideology.\n\nBoth men have children at home and both have made parenting and family life central to their public identities. They are also both famously athletic, though their preferences again diverge. Ryan is a workout fanatic who doesn\u2019t share the president\u2019s love of golf and basketball; Obama has shown no interest in hunting.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margaret Talev,Angela Greiling Keane", "description": "President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan may sit down together at the White House for a long-anticipated meeting as soon as next week, a person familiar with their plans said.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAAZng1roaCg/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan may sit down together at the White House for a long-anticipated meeting as soon as next week, a person familiar with their plans said.", "title": "Obama and Ryan, Long at Odds, Said to Meet as Soon as Next Week", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-22/obama-and-ryan-long-at-odds-said-to-meet-as-soon-as-next-week", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAAZng1roaCg/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan may sit down together at the White House for a long-anticipated meeting as soon as next week, a person familiar with their plans said.", "title": "Obama and Ryan, Long at Odds, Said to Meet as Soon as Next Week", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-22/obama-and-ryan-long-at-odds-said-to-meet-as-soon-as-next-week", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAAZng1roaCg/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan may sit down together at the White House for a long-anticipated meeting as soon as next week, a person familiar with their plans said."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Obama and Ryan, Long at Odds, Said to Meet as Soon as Next Week", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "O1D58Q6K50Y001", "parsely-author": "Angela Greiling Keane", "date": "2016-01-22T20:02:56.027Z", "keywords": "White House,Barack H Obama", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "White House,Barack H Obama", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-22T20:02:56.027Z", "parsely-tags": "White House,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-22/obama-and-ryan-long-at-odds-said-to-meet-as-soon-as-next-week"}, "article_summary": "\"We don\u2019t need partisanship, we don\u2019t need demagoguery.\"\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need partisanship, we don\u2019t need demagoguery.\u201d House Speaker Paul RyanIt wasn\u2019t clear whether other congressional leaders would take part.\nPresident Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan may sit down together at the White House for a long-anticipated meeting as soon as next week, a person familiar with their plans said.\nWhen Obama answered questions from the public on Twitter last week, Ryan posted a query Obama\u2019s plans to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba terrorist prison.\nDoug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said that \u201cnothing is currently scheduled.\u201d Jen Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, declined to comment."}
