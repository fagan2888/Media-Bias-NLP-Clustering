If it seems like South Bend has received a lot of rainfall recently, that's because it has.

The rainfall total at South Bend International airport for June through midnight Sunday -- before Monday's storms -- was 6.01 inches, which is 3.16 inches more than normal, according Lonnie Fisher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in North Webster.

And you might want to keep those umbrellas handy.

WSBT meteorologist Cari Peugeot predicted scattered showers through today, but noted "we may see some sun on Wednesday and Thursday."

A cold front was expected start to edge through northern Indiana Monday night and today, bringing more hit-or-miss showers and perhaps some mini thunderstorms, added Fisher of the weather service.

Like Monday, we can expect pop-up storms today that could include "heavy rain and isolated stronger storms," Fisher said.

Rainfall totals have varied considerably throughout the region, based on the direction of the quick storms, he said. Some rural areas where storms have been heavy are experiencing standing water, he said.

Benton Harbor's unofficial rainfall total so far for June is 3.22

inches, which is 0.71 inches above normal, Fisher said.

But the rainfall total in Fort Wayne for June through midnight Sunday was 5.28 inches, which is 2.12 inches above normal, he said.

After sunny skies on Wednesday and Thursday, a 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms will return on Friday, when a high is expected near 79.
