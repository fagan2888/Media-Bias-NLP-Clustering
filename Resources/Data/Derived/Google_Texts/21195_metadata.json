Sometimes the reason Americans \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d do them is because they\u2019ve been escorted from the premises by security after cleaning out their desks.\n\nThe good news? Corporate America\u2019s doing its part to make sure newly legalized illegals don\u2019t end up on welfare. The bad news? Given the state of the Obama economy, the citizens they laid off are probably already cashing unemployment checks.\n\nThe officials represent companies with a vast array of business interests: General Electric, The Walt Disney Company, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, McDonald\u2019s Corporation, The Wendy\u2019s Company, Coca-Cola, The Cheesecake Factory, Johnson & Johnson, Verizon Communications, Hewlett-Packard, General Mills, and many more. All want to see increases in immigration levels for low-skill as well as high-skill workers, in addition to a path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants currently in the U.S. illegally\u2026 In addition, at the same time the corporate officers seek higher numbers of immigrants, both low-skill and high-skill, many of their companies are laying off thousands of workers. For example, Hewlett-Packard, whose Executive Vice President for Human Resources Tracy Keogh signed the letter, laid off 29,000 employees in 2012. In August of this year, Cisco Systems, whose Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer Kathleen Weslock signed the letter, announced plans to lay off 4,000 \u2014 in addition to 8,000 cut in the last two years. United Technologies, whose Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Organization Elizabeth B. Amato signed the letter, announced layoffs of 3,000 this year. American Express, whose Chief Human Resources Officer L. Kevin Cox signed the letter, cut 5,400 jobs this year. Procter & Gamble, whose Chief Human Resources Officer Mark F. Biegger signed the letter, announced plans to cut 5,700 jobs in 2012.\n\nIn fairness, the money saved from paying lower wages to legalized illegals can be used to expand operations, which means creating more jobs \u2026 which will presumably also be filled by newly legalized illegals. But who knows? Maybe there\u2019ll be a few crappy part-time jobs created too that can be staffed by Americans who don\u2019t mind reduced hours in the name of ObamaCare compliance.\n\nBy the way, has Syria finally killed off amnesty, at least for the rest of the year? Reform advocates are nervous that there\u2019s too much on Congress\u2019s plate and too little time left in the session to get through it for the GOP to take up a hot potato like immigration when they don\u2019t have to. The silver lining if the GOP had voted for a Syria attack is that it would have made them wary about further angering the base by voting for amnesty too, but now that that\u2019s off the table, they still have some political capital to spend. Will there be any left after the bound-to-disappoint debt-ceiling saga plays out? Fingers crossed for \u201cno\u201d!\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Trade-offs.", "title": "Corporate execs responsible for thousands of layoffs send letter to Congress calling for \u2026 immigration reform", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/09/11/corporate-execs-responsible-for-thousands-of-layoffs-send-letter-to-congress-calling-for-immigration-reform/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Congress, corporate, hire, house, immigration, labor, layoffs, Republicans, Senate, wages, workers,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T22:41:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T20:59:50+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa80\"", "article_summary": "Corporate America\u2019s doing its part to make sure newly legalized illegals don\u2019t end up on welfare.\nFor example, Hewlett-Packard, whose Executive Vice President for Human Resources Tracy Keogh signed the letter, laid off 29,000 employees in 2012.\nUnited Technologies, whose Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Organization Elizabeth B.
