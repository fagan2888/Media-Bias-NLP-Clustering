Even though the majority of patients who seek medical care at the Free Clinic qualify for Medicaid, \"Only about 20 percent of patients are enrolled,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a lot of suspicion from people who applied [for Medicaid] in the past and didn't get it,\" Korn said. \"A lot of people also don't understand the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nThe Free Clinic is typically open every other Saturday as a walk-in clinic. The July 26 event is for everyone \u2013 including teens and people who have Medicare coverage.\n\nIn addition to Medicaid enrollment, people can get testing for STIs and dental education. The event also will feature food, fresh produce, and door prizes.\n\nFor information, call (216) 707-3438.\n\nNAMIWalks 2014\n\nKick-off Luncheon\n\nNAMI (The National Alliance on Mental Illness) will hold a free luncheon from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday, July 25 for people who want to create a team for 2014 NAMIWalks or who want to volunteer with the annual 5K fund raising event.\n\nThe luncheon will be held at Slovenian National Home, 6409 St. Clair Ave., Cleveland. Registration is required.
