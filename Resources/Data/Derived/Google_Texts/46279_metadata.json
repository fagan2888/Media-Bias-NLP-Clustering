Immigration law reformers\n\nAnswer: Tea Party House Republicans\n\nIn Washington, every day, there are factions that vie to make their voices heard and to change policy accordingly. But none of the aforementioned are as close to imperiling the nation as the score of Congressmen who have brought government to a stand-still and who, by their actions, also seem capable of putting our debts into default.\n\nIn the lexicon of the playmaker, we are only a few news cycles away from Barack Obama and his surrogates (read: Harry Reid or AG Eric Holder) from running the mother of all Label plays -- accusing Cruz & Co. of criminal negligence in their congressional duties and following with plays like the Ping or Trial Balloon to test the public appetite for their removal from office, even perhaps their arrest. They did as much to draft dodgers. Why not health care deniers? The play is sure to incite the anarchists, hostage-takers, ransomers, and spoiled brats (those are the labels they've already born) and invite calls by GOP rank-and-file for Obama's impeachment (which has already been said, but never with serious intent). Thus, the strategy gridlock we are witnessing in Washington will only reach new heights.\n\nA half-century ago, it was the likes of The Chicago Seven and so many anti-establishment hippies that appalled conservatives and challenged an imperious war. Now, it is the likes of the Tea Party, Ted Cruz and so many gerrymandered district voters who are appalling liberals and challenging social programs.\n\nIn either case, their actions are serious, dangerous and some are soon to say illegal. So the question is: Will today's establishment endure or compromise with a vocal and radical minority? Or will it attempt to crush a rebellion, this one of a legislative ilk? History suggests that the restive will win, certainly not overnight, but in the long run.\n\nFollow Alan Kelly on Twitter: www.twitter.com/@playmakeralan", "article_metadata": {"description": "If I were to tell you that in Washington, D.C., right now there is mounting pressure among an entrenched minority to correct grievous oversights of gover...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-11 16:20:49 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-kelly/civil-disobedience-it-wor_b_4074521.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "If I were to tell you that in Washington, D.C., right now there is mounting pressure among an entrenched minority to correct grievous oversights of gover...", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "creator": "@playmakeralan", "description": "If I were to tell you that in Washington, D.C., right now there is mounting pressure among an entrenched minority to correct grievous oversights of gover...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-10 16:20:49 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4074521", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "60s,vietnam war protests,civil disobedience,obamacare,Ted Cruz,oneida indian nation,peace protesters,Harry Reid,hippies,tea party,Eric Holder", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "60s,vietnam war protests,civil disobedience,obamacare,Ted Cruz,oneida indian nation,peace protesters,Harry Reid,hippies,tea party,Eric Holder", "published_time": "2013-10-10 16:20:49 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-12-10 05:12:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd00d\"", "article_summary": "Tea Party House RepublicansB.\nTea Party House Republicans working to abolish Barack Obama's Affordable Care ActB.\nNow, it is the likes of the Tea Party, Ted Cruz and so many gerrymandered district voters who are appalling liberals and challenging social programs.\nMembers of the Oneida Indian NationC.
