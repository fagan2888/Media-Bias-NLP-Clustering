Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once.\"\n\nTexan James Moore, a self-described progressive pundit and communications consultant, took note of a Texas U.S. senator's latest stop in Iowa by posting a comparative tweet on March 20, 2014.\n\n\"Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once,\" Moore wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nCruz, a Republican lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has been flitting in and out of Iowa, home to the quadrennial party caucuses kicking off each presidential election year. We were curious whether Moore's contrast holds up, especially per the infrequency of Cruz's forays to the valley, the region closest to the state\u2019s southeastern border with Mexico.\n\n'Anybody will tell you'\n\nMoore, who was in McAllen when we talked to him, told us by phone that his claim -- meant to refer to Cruz\u2019s time as a senator, he said -- was based on what Moore had heard while in the valley. \"Everybody and anybody in the valley will tell you,\" Moore said, adding that Cruz had spoken at a club and then at a border park.\n\nAfter emailing Cruz's office about the accuracy of Moore\u2019s statement, we searched the Nexis database of news stories for accounts on Cruz trips to the valley and Iowa.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Texas mention, then count Cruz trips to Iowa.\n\nSeveral valley stops on Sept. 3, 2013\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s nearly 15 months as senator, he spent a weekday in the valley, according to regional news stories. That day was Sept. 3, 2013, when Cruz spoke at a sold-out luncheon in Mission and a stop at the Anzalduas International Bridge in Mission, according to news stories posted that day by the McAllen Monitor and San Antonio Express-News.\n\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Cruz did three events that day in the valley--going to McAllen for a Department of Public Safety border tour and roundtable with landowners to discuss border/immigration policy and to Mission for a \"Rio Grande Partnership\" lunch.\n\nCruz, Frazier said, looks forward to more events in the valley, \"one specific region in the state.\" \"Since being sworn in,\" she said, \"he has traveled to 38 Texas cities for 118 events.\"\n\nCruz also stumped in the valley before his election. According to a Monitor news story posted online Oct. 13, 2012, Cruz was featured at a weekend event hosted at a Mission club by the McAllen Tea Party Association. Nearly 250 people paid $25 each to attend, according to the article. Cruz said then: \"We are campaigning all across the state of Texas. From the day we started this campaign nearly two years ago, we\u2019ve gone 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, crisscrossing the state.\"\n\nMoore told us the fact that his tweet didn\u2019t say he was speaking to Cruz\u2019s time as senator wasn\u2019t significant, partly because Twitter posts are limited to 140 characters. A Moore commentary published by the Huffington Post a few hours after he wrote his tweet was direct about focusing on Cruz's Senate time. Cruz, Moore wrote, \"has been to Iowa four times in the... months he has been in office but has made one appearance here in the subtropical region along the border.\"\n\nFour Iowa trips\n\nNow let's look north, where news stories indicate Cruz has been to the Hawkeye State four times since joining the Senate.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2014, a Dallas Morning News news blog post datelined Washington, D.C., opened by saying Cruz \"returns to Iowa next month -- his fourth trip in eight months, ensuring ongoing speculation about his 2016 ambitions.\" The newspaper made the same fourth-time-in-eight-months reference in its March 18, 2014, news story on Cruz\u2019s appearance before the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators.\n\nAnd before?\n\nCruz made his initial senatorial trip to Iowa in July 2013, according to a July 19, 2013, Associated Press news story , giving a private speech to the conservative American Renewal Project and headlining a GOP fundraiser.\n\nA commentary by Wayne Slater of the Morning News, posted online that day, said that when reporters in Iowa inquired into Cruz\u2019s presidential ambitions, he demurred. \"I've been in office all of seven months,\" Cruz said. \"Prior to that, the last elective office I held was student council. It's been quite a whirlwind.\"\n\nThe senator\u2019s second Iowa stop occurred Aug. 10, 2013 when he spoke to hundreds of evangelical Christians and social conservatives at a summit in Ames, Iowa, according to a news story posted online that day by the Ames Tribune.\n\nAnother Iowa stop, Politico reported , entailed Cruz stirring Iowa Republicans at an annual fundraising dinner Oct. 25, 2013 before heading to a pheasant hunt in the state. In an Oct. 26, 2013, news story, the Omaha World-Herald summed up: \"This was Cruz's third visit to Iowa this year...\"\n\nThe 'fair comparison'\n\nOn Cruz's behalf, Frazier said by email the \"fair comparison to make is that the senator has been to Iowa 4 times and travels back to Texas almost every weekend.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMoore tweeted: \"Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once.\"\n\nThis is correct if limited to Cruz\u2019s year-plus as the state\u2019s junior senator, which is what Moore made clear in his subsequent blog post. We rate this claim as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texan James Moore, a self-described progressive pundit and communications consultant, took note of a Texas U.S. senator&#39;s latest stop in Iowa by posting a comparative tweet on March 20, 2014. &quot;Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times.
