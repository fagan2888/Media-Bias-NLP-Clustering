The big family clan \u2013\u2013 held together by forceful personalities and connected across states and theologies and basketball rivalries and socioeconomic divides \u2013\u2013 is rare anymore, but it is so important. One of the earliest condolences we received after the death of my husband\u2019s older brother, J.B. Crouse, said, \u201cA great tree has fallen.\u201d I can think of no better description of how we feel as we mourn the loss of a great leader who is also \u2013\u2013 first and foremost to us \u2013\u2013 our dearly loved brother.\n\nThe shade of that big tree fell on all of us; that tree \u2014 a focal point in our whole extended family \u2013\u2013 covered our lives and interactions with his personality, presence, and prayers.\n\nFor me, it began when he checked me out \u2013\u2013 coming to a college basketball game to watch me as a cheerleader \u2013\u2013 so he could pass judgment on this unknown girl his \u201clittle\u201d brother (who was the taller one) was dating. I think I passed muster, but the point is that he was concerned with everything that related to his family\u2019s well-being and that included younger siblings, cousins, and even \u201cshirt-tail relatives\u201d (those really close friends who were, perhaps, related to those who married into the family).\n\nOthers will write about J.B.\u2019s extraordinary leadership gifts and his contributions in those areas; I leave that significant task to them. I want to write about the importance of his leadership of his family. When the \u201cBig Papa\u201d \u2013\u2013 J. Byron Crouse, father of J.B., Charlotte, Betty Jean, and Gilbert \u2013\u2013 died, J.B. stepped in as leader of the Crouse Clan. He made the phone calls on holidays to wish everyone a Merry Christmas or Easter or Birthday or whatever the occasion. He twisted arms to get everyone to family gatherings. He organized the annual siblings\u2019 reunion so that we stayed in touch and in harmony with each other. His standard telephone greeting was \u201cHello brother, you got Washington straightened out yet?\u201d\n\nHis role as spiritual leader of the family will be hard to fill. He was a man of prayer and our \u201cmorning\u201d devotions sometimes took more than half the day on family vacation as we prayed for the causes and loved ones close to his heart and heard the taped messages that he had saved to share with his brother and two sisters and us spouses. Like his father before him, he kept up a voluminous correspondence and had dear friends everywhere around the world. He would invite us to go out to dinner and it would end up being a group of 12 to 20 people.\n\nJ.B. and Bette were consummate host and hostess; their home was a welcoming place for travelers and family. There were wonderful breakfasts, great evenings of singing around the piano with homemade ice cream churning out back, sweet fellowship together with cousins, aunts, and uncles, and various friends who just happened to be in town. There was always singing with numerous pianists and song leaders taking turns at drawing together beautiful harmony.\n\nThere is no way to think of J.B. without thinking of J.B. and Bette together. They were a team \u2013\u2013 and what a dynamic team. They were partners, with J.B. working alongside Bette to get everything up to their exacting standards \u2013\u2013 whether for entertaining or planning special occasions for family and friends, writing a Christmas letter, crafting an article for a missionary publication, preparing a speech for a major international event, or J.B. performing a solo with Bette at the piano.\n\nGreat trees, though, have to have strong root systems that enable them to weather storms and the strong winds of adversity. The authenticity of J.B. and Bette\u2019s faith and the depth of their character were tested at pivotal points, and they came through shaken to the core, but shining witnesses to the power of faith, family, and forgiveness. No one looking on could miss the pain they experienced at key points in their lives, nor underestimate the challenges that they faced at other points, but their faith held and their family held. They came through life\u2019s experiences strengthened in their love for each other, for all the members of the family, for the whole clan, and for their Savior and God. They proved faithful and, in the process, they became real people \u2014 and no one ever doubted that J.B. and Bette had earned their position as role models for faithfulness and forgiveness.\n\nI am so thankful that I fell in love with Gilbert Crouse and through marriage to him became part of the Crouse Clan, and that I experienced the eras of the \u201cBig Papa\u201d and then J.B. Crouse. I am grateful that our small branch of the family contributes to the strong root system that is necessary for a big, close clan \u2013\u2013 that each branch is important in shaping the impact of the whole.\n\nNow, I \u2013\u2013 and our children and grandchildren \u2013\u2013 are part of that great cloud of witnesses that will gather at J.B.\u2019s funeral to attest to the impact of \u201cgreat trees\u201d and celebrate their strong presence as \u201cgiants of the faith\u201d who lead organizations and families. Of such close-knit families are great nations built, and through them will a great nation like America continue to exist.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03ae\"", "article_summary": "The death of the leader of a family clan marks the ending of an era.\nOf such close-knit families are great nations built, and through them will a great nation like America continue to exist.\nThe big family clan \u2013\u2013 held together by forceful personalities and connected across states and theologies and basketball rivalries and socioeconomic divides \u2013\u2013 is rare anymore, but it is so important.\nWhen the \u201cBig Papa\u201d \u2013\u2013 J.
