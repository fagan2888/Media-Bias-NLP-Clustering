The 710 Freeway in East Los Angeles reopened Thursday morning after an hourlong closure while sheriff's deputies searched for an armed man loose on foot.

Aerial news video showed the suspect being taken into custody a little after 9:30 a.m.

The man, who was initially suspected of vandalism, was found hiding in a trash bin in a construction zone on the side of the freeway. Deputies threw a flash grenade into the bin, and the man surrendered, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. John Sagardia.

The man, who was not identified, will be booked on vandalism and weapons charges, Sagardia said.

The incident started about 8:15 a.m. when a deputy on patrol saw a man vandalizing property and tried to approach him, Sagardia said. The man ran onto the Cesar Chavez Avenue onramp to the northbound 710 with a gun in his hand, the deputy reported.

The man ran back toward the street but vanished, Sagardia said. That area of the 710 Freeway is under construction and is partially shut down, with several large trash bins, bushes and other places to hide, Sagardia said.

The closure backed up traffic for miles while police canvassed the area with a K-9 unit and armored vehicle.

The freeway was closed at 8:40 a.m. and reopened around 9:40 a.m.
