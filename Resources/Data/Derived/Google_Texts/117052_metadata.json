The construction cost overrun for the Veterans Affairs hospital in Aurora, together with the VA waiting list scandal, should be viewed as a wake-up call and opportunity. Both events show that the current VA system is a relic and an anachronism in 2015. It no longer serves our veterans and the country well.\n\nIn my opinion, the current VA facilities should be auctioned off to existing medical systems, and its employees should be re-deployed to existing health care providers to serve our veterans. A new payment system, for veterans only, operated on a parallel basis with our existing Medicare system, with suitable veterans\u2019 benefits, could be substituted.\n\nThis change would not only be more efficient, it would also result in a more flexible system going forward and provide many veterans with services closer to their homes.\n\nJack Blumenthal, Denver\n\nThis letter was published in the April 20 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aurora VA hospital,health care,Veterans Affairs", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/04/19/a-new-system-for-veterans-health-care/37274/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "A new system for veterans' health care"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "A new system for veterans\u2019 health care", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/04/19/a-new-system-for-veterans-health-care/37274/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Recent controversies surrounding health care for veterans should be viewed as a wake-up call.
