Walker has said he'd expand Medicaid and stop the Alaska Stand Alone Pipeline, reversing Parnell policies in those areas. He has said as governor he would support SB 21, approved by voters Aug. 19, but closely watch it to make sure oil companies stabilize declining oil production over the long haul. Walker has also said he would complete the Alaska LNG project but said the state needs to more than double its proposed equity to 51 percent, a plan Parnell has said would kill the project.
