They discovered that 8.2 percent of the patients had visited an emergency department again, 32 percent of those at a different hospital and 29 percent resulting in an admission, within three days of the initial ED visit. And the numbers just got worse from there.\n\nWithin 30 days of the index visit, 19.9 percent of patients had revisited an ED, with 28 percent at a different hospital. The cost for those revisits in Florida, the only state with complete cost data, was 118 percent greater than the total index costs of initial ED visits. Skin infections caused most of the revisits (23.1%), Florida had the highest revisit rates (24.8%), and Nebraska had the lowest (10.6%). (Ann Intern Med 2015;162[11]:750.)\n\n\u201cPrevious literature had showed people coming back at a lower rate. What this shows is that people are coming back more frequently, and one-third are going to another emergency department. There is a story here,\u201d said Reena Duseja, MD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and the lead author of the study.\n\nThe study was not set up to determine why people come back, Dr. Duseja said. \u201cEither people are dissatisfied or are having trouble getting connected with the health care system, and are left going back to the emergency department for care.\u201d\n\nHigher than Expected\n\nRyan Radecki, MD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston who blogs at EM Literature of Note, said he was most surprised by the 8.2 percent three-day bouncebacks. \u201cThat's much higher than people expected to see,\u201d he said. He was less impressed by the cost estimates, however.\n\n\u201cUnless you are in a system providing a lot of structure, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in the health care system for saving money. A lot of time, we find that the failure is not the emergency department, but the failure [is] of the rest of the system. Patients come back to the emergency department because they don't have support or they have a medication problem. It's not the quality of the emergency department but a measure of the health system's overall quality. It would be interesting to see what other countries' bounceback rates are like. Or what the rates were a decade ago.\u201d\n\nMichael Weinstock, MD, a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at the Ohio State University College of Medicine who has written extensively about bouncebacks, pointed out that the problem is tricky. \u201cThe first step is to determine which patients you want to be worried about,\u201d he said. Seventy-one percent of patients who are sent home and die within a week have unexplained tachycardia, for example.\n\nOne of his colleagues, David Sklar, MD, recommended revisiting these patients in the exam room to determine if they have progressed and to obtain all information on the patient. He also advised EPs to record a progress note to confirm their thought processes. \u201cIf you cannot convince yourself the patient is going to be OK, you can't convince a family member,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Sklar, a distinguished professor of emergency medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, said recruiting family members to monitor the patient is a good idea. \u201cWe tell them to come back if things get worse or persist,\u201d he said. That may seem simple, but is not in the context of a busy emergency department.\n\nDr. Sklar also said Dr. Duseja's study importantly starts the process of finding out why patients bounceback and defines the extent of the issue. \u201cThey might not be bouncing back. They are just coming back. There is a way to address that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ED as a Symbol\n\nDr. Duseja has a federal five-year grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to study these issues. \u201cWe want to know what emergency departments with lower rates are doing differently from those that have higher rates. Qualitative interviews of patients and providers might provide such answers,\u201d she said.\n\nSome literature has also shown that social reasons drive patients to return to the emergency department, Dr. Duseja said. Sometimes patients may not have transportation or they may have mental illness or substance abuse that deters them from seeking appropriate care.\n\n\u201cWe need to develop interventions to stop this. The best care we can give to our patients does not mean coming back to a different provider every few days. The American College of Emergency Physicians studies show that people are using the emergency department more frequently, which drives up the rate of return visits,\u201d she said, adding that the Affordable Care Act has not affected bouncebacks.\n\nYet something needs to change, she said. \u201cEmergency departments are symbols of how well our health system is doing. If we are using it more, something is going wrong with outpatient systems.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County is starting a health exchange where patient records are available everywhere. \u201cIt's a step in the right direction. If a provider can see what happened across town, he or she will not repeat tests or procedures,\u201d Dr. Duseja said.\n\nShare this article on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAccess the links in EMN by reading this on our website or in our free iPad app, both available at www.EM-News.com.\n\nComments?
