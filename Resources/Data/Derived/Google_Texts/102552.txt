The department says abortion rates continue to decline in Iowa. There were 4,020 abortions in 2014 compared to 4,423 in 2013.

Between 2010 and 2013, the number of abortions decreased from nearly 5,400 to just over 4,420. That represents an 18.1 percent drop.

The reason for the decrease depends on who you ask.

Penny Dickey with Planned Parenthood says a big reason for the decline has to do with more use of long-acting contraceptives in recent years.

“That's when we really started to see that over time women are continuing to use these methods, and we have also seen the decline in abortion,” Dickey said.

Dickey also cited increased education to make good decisions, the Affordable Care Act and changes to insurance plans for the decline.

“It's been very encouraging to see that trend over the last couple of years,” she said.

Jenifer Bowen, with Right to Life, argues the decline has to do with an increase in pregnancy centers, often next to Planned Parenthoods, and an increase in baby pictures on social media.

She argues contraception is not a factor and cited a huge failure rate.

“I think that that is a claim that oftentimes the abortion side of the debate will point to,” Bowen said.

Both organizations say they will continue to work on education with the hope of helping women make smarter choices.
