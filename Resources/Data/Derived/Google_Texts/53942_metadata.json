DiNapoli.\n\nWall Street workers are doing well, too, as salaries have catapulted to record highs. The average salary, including bonus, jumped 14 percent in 2014 to $404,800, a new nominal record. Adjusted for inflation, those 2014 earnings were the third-highest ever. Wall Street bonuses reached an average of $172,900 \u2014 a level surpassed only by the two years prior to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRelated: Wall Street Should Pay for the Recessions They Cause\n\nThe average Wall Street salary was almost six times higher than the average across the rest of New York City\u2019s private sector, $72,300. As of 2013, nearly a quarter of Wall Street employees earned more than $250,000, while less than 3 percent of the rest of the city\u2019s workers made that much. At the other end of the income scale, 10 percent of securities industry employees earned less than $35,000, compared with 45 percent in the rest of the New York City workforce.\n\nAfter years of cutbacks and adjustment to new regulations, securities industry profitability has improved. It averaged $16.3 billion a year for 2013 and 2014, even as expensive legal settlements tied to the financial crisis ate into banks\u2019 bottom line. A drop in such legal expenses helped lift profits even higher in the first half of this year.\n\nAs the securities industry continues to recover and adapt, it added jobs last year for the first time since 2011, growing by 2,300 employees. It was on pace to add another 4,500 workers this year before stocks dipped into a correction. According to estimates from the Office of the Comptroller, each job that\u2019s added in the securities industry leads to two more jobs in other industries in New York City and one more job elsewhere in New York State.\n\nThe industry is still 9 percent smaller than before the recession, and DiNapoli warned that Wall Street\u2019s profits and hiring plans could be cut back by recent market turbulence and other factors.\n\nRelated: There\u2019s a Shortage of Cops on Wall Street \u2013 and New Trouble Brewing\n\n\u201cAfter a very strong first half of the year, the securities industry faces volatile financial markets and an unsteady global economy,\u201d DiNapoli said. \u201cAfter years of downsizing, the industry has been adding jobs in New York City, but it may curtail hiring to bolster profits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The stock market may not have gained much over the first six months of the year, but W", "title": "Wall Street and Its Workers Are Rolling in Dough Again", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Wall-Street-and-Its-Workers-Are-Rolling-Dough-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11062012_wallstreet_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Wall-Street-and-Its-Workers-Are-Rolling-Dough-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11062012_wallstreet_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The stock market may not have gained much over the first six months of the year, but W", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f74\"", "article_summary": "Wall Street workers are doing well, too, as salaries have catapulted to record highs.\nRelated: Wall Street Should Pay for the Recessions They CauseThe average Wall Street salary was almost six times higher than the average across the rest of New York City\u2019s private sector, $72,300.\nWall Street bonuses reached an average of $172,900 \u2014 a level surpassed only by the two years prior to the 2008 financial crisis.\nAs of 2013, nearly a quarter of Wall Street employees earned more than $250,000, while less than 3 percent of the rest of the city\u2019s workers made that much.\nRelated: There\u2019s a Shortage of Cops on Wall Street \u2013 and New Trouble Brewing\u201cAfter a very strong first half of the year, the securities industry faces volatile financial markets and an unsteady global economy,\u201d DiNapoli said."}
