Here\u2019s more information on what to do.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t filed your federal tax return yet:\n\nYou\u2019ll need to file a request for an extension with the IRS by April 15. The form, known as a form 4868, is available here. When you get your correct 1095-A form, you can file your return using the information it provides.\n\nIf you already filed your taxes and think your 1095-A was incorrect:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to file an amended tax return, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Even if you owe additional taxes, the IRS won\u2019t seek to collect them from you.\n\nHowever, if your 1095-A had incorrect information, you might benefit from filing an amended return \u2013 that is, you might end up owing less in taxes than you paid or qualifying for a larger refund. The treasury department suggests that people consider consulting with a tax preparer to determine if they would benefit from filing an amended return. The IRS has more information on that here.\n\nIf you did not receive a 1095-A form:\n\nYou should call Access Health at 866-230-8920.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/04/11/some-obamacare-customers-will-need-to-file-for-tax-extensions/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 1095-A, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/04/11/some-obamacare-customers-will-need-to-file-for-tax-extensions/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Some customers of Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange say problems with the exchange-generated forms they need to file their taxes have left them unable to file their taxes just days before the deadline.
