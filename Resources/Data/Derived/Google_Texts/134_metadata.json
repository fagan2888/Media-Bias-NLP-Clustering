Appearing at a campaign rally for gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown in Maryland on Sunday, President Obama sought to capture the magic that had electrified audiences in 2008 and, to some considerable degree, even in 2012. Obama isn\u2019t doing much stumping this year. He limits his campaigning mostly to fundraisers. This is the year, after all, when Democratic candidates are announcing how important it is in our system of government to have honest disagreements with the president. They\u2019re hastening to say that they would be tougher than he is on the Islamic State. They are declaring that a travel ban from West Africa is only common sense. It\u2019s the year when some have discovered a sacred Constitutional right to keep silent about whom they voted for in 2008 and 2012.\n\nMaryland is an exception. It\u2019s about as safe a Democratic state as you can find, and the president was welcomed. The audience at the rally was largely African-American. And yet, according to Reuters, \u201ca steady stream of people walked out of the auditorium while he spoke . . . and a heckler interrupted his remarks.\u201d\n\nCould it be that even loyal Democrats \u2014 even those who want to see Obama in the flesh \u2014 feel that they\u2019ve heard it all before? Their actions send a clear signal: We think you\u2019re a historical figure worth laying eyes on, but your words no longer interest us.\n\nIn 2012, reluctant to encourage a referendum on the first four years of his leadership, President Obama successfully turned attention away from his record and towards Mitt Romney and the Republicans. The race became (with the unwitting cooperation of several cloddish Republican candidates), not about the economy or jobs or debt or America\u2019s global retreat, but about saving American women from medieval inquisitors and shielding Hispanics from mass deportation.\n\nDemocratic candidates in 2014 are, if anything, even more eager to turn attention away from the president\u2019s performance in the past two years. The economy has not improved. Obamacare\u2019s debut was a debacle. Foreign policy is a shambles, government agencies from the IRS to the Secret Service are loose canons, and Ebola threatens.\n\nDemocrats are attempting to reprise some of the themes that worked in 2012, notably the \u201cwar on women.\u201d But not even that fright mask seems to be working anymore. Senator Mark Udall\u2019s campaign in Colorado was wall-to-wall gynecology \u2014 to the point where he was ridiculed as \u201cMark Uterus.\u201d The Denver Post was so disgusted that it endorsed his opponent, Representative Cory Gardner. Like other \u201cwar on women\u201d attacks, Udall\u2019s accusations were false. He asserted that Gardner had run an \u201ceight-year campaign to outlaw birth control.\u201d Gardner swatted the lie away with ads touting his support for selling contraceptive pills over the counter (a technique originated by Bobby Jindal).\n\nDemocrats are struggling not just because the economy is stagnant and the world is in chaos. They are paying the price for something else: President Obama has squandered the greatest asset he had \u2014 the perception among Americans that he cared about their problems.\n\nPresident Obama telegraphs indifference to Americans\u2019 well-being. When the Benghazi compound was overrun and our ambassador killed, he first dissembled (blaming a video) and then thundered about retribution and justice, but what happened? With the exception of one arrest, Benghazi has been dumped. No one has paid a price for that attack on the U.S.\n\nThe president permitted the Islamic State menace to metastasize and dismissed the terrorist army as \u201cjayvee,\u201d even as his national-security advisers were testifying before Congress that the group was a profound worry. When stories surfaced later that the president attended only 40 percent of his intelligence briefings in person, it fed the impression that President Obama doesn\u2019t take the time to evaluate threats to the country. He now blames the intelligence community, but a man who goes golfing after an American is beheaded is signaling a certain coldness.\n\nThe response to Ebola underlines all of these tendencies in thick, black ink. His instinct has been to tamp down fears rather than address threats with alacrity. He is willing to send U.S. troops to Africa to fight Ebola but not to Iraq to fight the Islamic State. The administration\u2019s resistance to a travel ban makes no sense if the top priority is the safety of Americans.\n\nIn 2012, most people still believed that Obama cared.
