A faculty member at Horry Georgetown Technical College was looking for a clever way to promote her medical technology program when she realized the easiest way to a kid’s heart is candy. Unfortunately, her method for delivering that candy left a lot to be desired. Officials from the South Carolina school issued an apology on Monday after a faculty member distributed prescription pill bottles filled with “happy pills,” which turned out to be M&Ms, to children at a campus event last weekend.

“We have heard from several concerned parents that a faculty member promoting her medical technology program at Horry Georgetown Technical College filled pharmaceutical bottles with M&M candy and distributed them to children at a public event over the weekend,” read a statement posted to the college’s Facebook page.

Standard issue prescription bottles were addressed to “A Great Kid” and directions on the bottles read: “Take 1 m & m every 2 to 4 hours… may refill 5 times by 2/13/2016.” The unidentified faculty member distributed the phony pill bottles at the college’s Family Fun Run on Friday, WMBF News reported.

“While we know this professor meant the candy to serve as a treat, the method of distribution may have confused pre-school children whose parents have taught them not to take pills from pharmaceutical bottles,” the statement read. “The college administration deeply apologizes for the distress and confusion this action may have caused and seeks your forgiveness for our thoughtlessness. We regret further that professors and administrators are human and, although eager to share information about growing careers, sometimes make mistakes. This particular mistake will not occur again.”
