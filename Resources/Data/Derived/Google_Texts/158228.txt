BALTIMORE — American Pharoah won the Preakness by seven lengths in driving rain Saturday, keeping alive his Triple Crown bid.

With victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, American Pharoah needs a win in the Belmont Stakes to become the sport’s first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.

“I don’t even want to think about that now,” trainer Bob Baffert said. “I want to enjoy this.”

American Pharoah will bring a six-race winning streak into Belmont on June 6 in New York.

American Pharoah was a heavy favorite in the Preakness despite starting from the unfavorable No. 1 post.

Breaking fast on a sloppy track as thunder roared in the background, American Pharoah took control early and won easily.

Tale of Verve finished second, a length ahead of Divining Rod. Dortmund was fourth, followed by Mr. Z, Danzig Moon, Firing Line and Bodhisattva.

The winner paid $3.80, $3.40 and $2.80. Tale of Verve returned $19 and $8.80, and Divining Rod paid $5.20.

Jockey Victor Espinoza rode American Pharoah. A year ago, Espinoza won the Derby and Preakness aboard California Chrome before losing in the Belmont.

“It went very well,” Espinoza said. “He bounced out of there. He broke a little tiny bit slow and I pushed him to the front.”
