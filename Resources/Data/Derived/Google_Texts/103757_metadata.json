KQED, along with our colleagues at KPCC in LA, and ClearHealthCosts.com, a health cost transparency start up in New York, are shining a light on health care costs by asking you \u2013members of our community \u2014 to share what you\u2019ve paid for various health care procedures.\n\nWe turned to crowdsourcing because health care prices are wildly variable and opaque. It sometimes stuns people to find out there is no central database of prices. Gag clauses in contracts between doctors and insurers forbid both parties to disclose prices.\n\nBut you can use our form to help bring prices into the open. Just get the explanation of benefits your insurance company sent for the colonoscopy, and enter price charged, price the insurance company paid and your co-pay (which should be zero for a screening colonoscopy \u2014 more on that below.)\n\nOur PriceCheck database already contains entries for colonoscopy prices \u2014 they range from $1,000-$5000 in the Bay Area. Surprised by that range? It\u2019s in line with the price variation reported both by policy experts and our community on PriceCheck for other procedures.\n\nAfter we get more shared prices (usually in a few weeks), we\u2019ll report them back to you on State of Health.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA), certain screening tests \u2013including the colonoscopy \u2014 are mandated to be covered at no cost to the patient. But we should all care about the wild variation in prices because as health care costs rise, health insurance premiums go up. If you have employer-sponsored health insurance, that can mean your own part of the premium will go up. Public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid get more expensive, too, and those are paid for through taxes.\n\nColonoscopy is \u201ca messy one\u201d for other reasons, too, says Maribeth Shannon with some irony. She specializes in market transparency and accountability at the California HealthCare Foundation.\n\nShe\u2019s not just referring to the procedure itself. Colonoscopy is messy because of the way it\u2019s billed. Here are some things to ask about before you go in for the procedure:\n\nScreening or diagnostic: In a screening colonoscopy, a doctor threads a flexible tube with an attached camera into the colon to look for abnormalities, like a polyp. If a polyp is found, it can be removed during the procedure. After the ACA first took effect, patients who had polyps removed discovered that this action changed the colonoscopy from a \u201cfree\u201d screening test to a diagnostic test, and they were on the hook for a big bill.\n\nFederal rules about the free screening colonoscopy have since been updated. \u201c(P)olyp removal is an integral part of a colonoscopy,\u201d says the federal government, and must be included at no cost to the patient. Still, Maribeth Shannon says that \u201cconsumers should check with their health plan and ask \u2018what happens if a polyp is found \u2014 you\u2019re going to treat that as preventive, right?'\u201d\n\nAnesthesia: You might think that anesthesia would be included with the price of a colonoscopy. After all, it\u2019s not surprising that many patients would want to be anesthetized when they are having a colonoscopy. But for quite awhile, patients were being billed for anesthesia, which by itself can run be $1,000 or more.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Gareth Tyrnauer of Sebastopol. He was delighted when his insurer sent him a letter that said a colonoscopy would be covered 100 percent. \u201cI\u2019d be a fool not to do this,\u201d he recalls thinking. But, after the procedure, he got a $1,200 bill \u2014 just for the anesthesia. He called his insurer\u2019s customer service to fight the bill, saying he told the representative, \u201cI\u2019ve got a piece of paper right here and it says \u2018it\u2019s 100 percent covered. What part of 100 percent don\u2019t I understand?'\u201d He ultimately won.\n\nEarlier this month, the federal government stepped in again and issued a clarification that insurers may not charge for anesthesia used in connection with a preventive colonoscopy.\n\nIn-network is key: Make sure you know in advance who is involved in the procedure, warns Dena Mendelsohn, a health policy analyst with Consumers Union in San Francisco. \u201cConsumers should be sure to confirm that the facility where they\u2019re going is in-network and the provider they will have is in-network.\u201d\n\nQuality: In health care, determining quality of a procedure can be as difficult as determining how much it might cost. A strong predictor of quality is volume of procedures. A doctor or facility that has high volume is likely to be doing a higher quality job. Mendelsohn says many health insurance plans have tools for their customers on their websites and sometimes that includes volume. How much is the right amount? Hard to know, she says, but consumers could compare \u201chundreds or thousands versus dozens.\u201d\n\nMendelsohn also recommends avoiding a large university medical center for a colonoscopy. \u201cLarge universities are tailored toward more complicated procedures,\u201d she says. \u201cSince a screening colonoscopy is more routine, it\u2019s not necessarily the case that going to a large university will get you a better colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nOther options: If you\u2019ve been dreading have a colonoscopy, you\u2019re not alone. But there are other non-invasive options for colon cancer screening, including the fecal-occult blood test. If you\u2019ve been avoiding a colonoscopy, you may want to learn more about this option.\n\nAn earlier version of this story misstated how screening and diagnostic colonoscopies were billed after some aspects of the Affordable Care Act went into effect.
