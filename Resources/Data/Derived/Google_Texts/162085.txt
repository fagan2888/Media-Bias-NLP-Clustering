The Shaw’s supermarket chain is re-examining its decision to stop donating perishable food to local food pantries and soup kitchens, according to U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree.

Shaw’s drew media attention after the company’s Brunswick store abruptly stopped its long-standing policy of donating perishable food to Mid Coast Hunger Prevention in Brunswick. Several days later, however, company officials said they would allow the resumption of donations to Mid Coast Hunger Prevention, a food pantry and soup kitchen that provided food to 1,200 families in eight midcoast towns and served more than 45,000 hot meals.

On Saturday, Pingree said that Shaw’s President Jim Rice told her the company would continue to allow donations from its Brunswick and Bangor stores and would revisit the policy elsewhere.

“I really appreciate the company taking another look at this policy,” Pingree, who represents the 1st District, said in a statement. “I know Shaw’s is committed to the communities they operate in and they already do help hunger organizations in a number other ways. But I hope they can also find a way to expand that commitment further by donating perishable food to soup kitchens and food pantries.”

Shaw’s had phased out the perishable food donation program, known as Fresh Rescue, although some individual stores had continued the donations.

A spokeswoman for Shaw’s could not be reached Saturday.
