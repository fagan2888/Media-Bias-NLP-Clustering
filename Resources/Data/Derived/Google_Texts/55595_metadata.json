However, it was the second fracture for Jones in less than three years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to bounce back from it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cFor me, speaking for myself, I was probably on bed rest with no weight-bearing for probably two months. That\u2019s before I was even able to go out and run or anything.\u201d\n\nBryant might be trying to show that his recovery will be fast. When the locker room was open to reporters this week, he showed up limping on the injured foot without a walking boot.\n\n___\n\nRINGS OF EXCELLENCE: Living Pro Football Hall of Fame members are getting 14-karat gold rings of excellence this year. By the end of the season, 93 Hall of Famers will have received them, and the remaining members will get theirs over the course of the next two seasons.\n\nMembers of the class of 2013 and 2014 already have their rings.\n\nEach ring is made by Kay Jewelers, is set in 14K gold and has a total diamond weight of 1 3/4 carats. The outer diamonds create a stadium effect surrounding the football-shaped diamond center. Individual details on each ring include a likeness of the enshrinee\u2019s bust, his position and years in the league on one side. His name, the Pro Football Hall of Fame logo and his enshrinement class are on the other.\n\nIt takes about eight weeks to create each ring, which was redesigned in 2013, when Kay Jewelers began its relation with the hall and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Canton, Ohio shrine.\n\nMick Tingelhoff will receive his ring Sunday in Minnesota. All living Packers Hall of Famers will get theirs Monday night at Lambeau Field, and 2015 inductee Jerome Bettis gets his on Thursday in Pittsburgh.\n\n___\n\nREPORTS AS ELIGIBLE: Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson is getting real creative. He\u2019s got Andy Dalton throwing to offensive linemen.\n\nThe Bengals have been using Jake Fisher as an extra blocker on some plays, putting him in the spot that would normally be filled by a tight end. During a 24-19 win over the Chargers last Sunday, he became a receiver for the first time. Fisher threw a block and then slipped out of the backfield uncovered for a 31-yard gain.\n\nHe was so wide open that he had lots of time to contemplate dropping the ball.\n\n\u201cJust thinking: Catch the ball,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThat\u2019s about it. It set me up for more opportunities in the future. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals practiced the play in the week leading up to the game. When it worked well against the Cincinnati defense, Jackson decided to try it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how you want it to look,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we even got that good of a (result) in practice.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSULLIVAN SITTING OUT: Vikings center John Sullivan\u2019s back started bothering him the second week of training camp. The discomfort worsened. The team\u2019s medical staff tried a variety of treatments. After a few setbacks, some of the symptoms were intensifying.\n\nSo surgery to repair a herniated disc was ordered.\n\nSullivan, who was placed on injured reserve with a designation to return at midseason, said he immediately felt better after the procedure two weeks ago. But those three weeks before the operation were miserable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a measure of guilt,\u201d the eighth-year veteran Sullivan said, referring to the feeling of letting the team down by his absence.\n\nThen there was the home front, where Sullivan and his wife were trying to care for their son born just a few weeks earlier.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s been awesome. Really picked up the slack,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt was tough on her, basically taking care of two babies. I was pretty useless there for a while.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNO MORE MUSTACHE: Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan is clean-shaven once again, the handlebar mustache he used to twirl while talking to reporters only a memory.\n\nLewan made the decision to shave it off after center Brian Schwenke alerted him to a Twitter account named for the left tackle\u2019s mustache.\n\n\u201cThe thing just went too far,\u201d Lewan said. \u201cTo have the identity of a mustache is too much, and we lost a game. It was irritating me a little bit anyway, and I consider myself a much more handsome man without a mustache, as much as it pains me to say. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a mustache sometime in the future.\u201d\n\nThe second-year offensive tackle isn\u2019t completely bereft of such hair - sort of. He has a handlebar mustache tattooed on the inside of his right index finger.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Teresa M.
