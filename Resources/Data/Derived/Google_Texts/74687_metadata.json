Randy Weber fanned partisan flames with an inflammatory tweet Tuesday night during the State of the Union, calling President Barack Obama the \u201cKommandant-In-Chef\u201d (presumably he meant \u201cchief\u201d) and a \u201cSocialistic dictator.\u201d\n\nOn floor of house waitin on \u201cKommandant-In-Chef\u201d\u2026 the Socialistic dictator who\u2019s been feeding US a line or is it \u201cA-Lying?\u201d \u2014 Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) January 29, 2014\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop there, calling out Obama for failing to protect the U.S. ambassador in Libya, and for blaming former President George W. Bush for his failures. His tweet about Libya was the only one time stamped after the president began speaking.\n\nSOTU: I never said if you like your country you can keep it. He can\u2019t blame Bush anymore. Will it be his phone and pen next time he blames? \u2014 Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) January 29, 2014\n\nSOTU = Sorry Our Time\u2019s Up. POTUS = Poor Obama Trashed U.S. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He promised to \u201cfundamentally change US\u201d Boy is he?! \u2014 Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) January 29, 2014\n\nObama believes that fewer give to their country than the diplomats. That\u2019s why he protected Chris Stevens in Benghazi\u2026 \u2014 Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) January 29, 2014\n\nHis tweets drew significant media attention from news outlets across the country, and polarized responses on Twitter. Most chided Weber for misspelling \u201cchief\u201d or attacked his aggressive tone. But the publicity gave Weber more than 400 new followers as of 2:00 p.m., almost 20 percent of his new total.\n\nIt also invited vandalism on Weber\u2019s Wikipedia page. There\u2019s name-calling. And the section describing the air-conditioning company he founded was changed to read that the company \u201cfocused on producing hot air for the state of Texas. He has carried this tradition forward with him to the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe freshman congressman served four years in the Legislature before winning the U.S. House seat vacated by former presidential hopeful Ron Paul, no stranger to controversial statements himself. In past interviews, Weber said that he sees himself as a lawmaker with a strong commitment to conservative values.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so Republican, my first name starts with \u2018R,\u2019 \u201d Weber told National Journal in July. \u201cI\u2019m so right-wing\u2014well, Randy Weber. You do the math.\u201d\n\nUntil Tuesday night\u2019s string of strongly-worded tweets, Weber had only mentioned the president three times on Twitter since November. His most inflammatory charge had been that Obama was \u201ccircumventing Congress\u201d with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t be reached Wednesday to discuss his tweets. His office said he was attending a 3-day GOP retreat. In an interview with Beaumont\u2019s KJAC-TV before the speech, he predicted that Obama would go \u201caround the Constitution\u201d to enforce laws that \u201cCongress hasn\u2019t passed.\u201d\n\nDuring the State of the Union, the president announced an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and promised that he was not afraid to \u201ctake steps without legislation\u201d in other matters.\n\nThat led to mixed reviews in the Texas delegation, with Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Midland, calling Obama \u201cthe imperial president.\u201d But Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, said that the president was well within his rights and should take action to fight gridlock in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMS9yZXAtcmFuZHktd2ViZXItY2F0Y2hlcy1mbGFrLWZvci1jYWxsaW5nLW9iYW1hLWEtc29jaWFsaXN0aWMtZGljdGF0b3IuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Friendswood Republican Rep.
