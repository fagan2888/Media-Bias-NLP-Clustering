As it turns out, the news was even better than that.\n\nThe new report from Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the U.S. economy added 257,000 jobs in January. The overall unemployment rate inched higher, from 5.6% to 5.7%, but this was an encouraging increase \u2013 more Americans are entering the market again.\n\nOnce a year, the BLS publishes benchmark revisions, going back and recalculating monthly job totals for all of the previous year, and that report was released today. And on this front, the news was even better \u2013 November\u2019s totals were revised up from 353,000 to 423,000, while December\u2019s figures were revised up, from 252,000 to 329,000. Combined, that\u2019s an additional 147,000 jobs.\n\nAll told, January\u2019s totals may not be quite as stunning as the figures from November and December, but this is still a strong jobs report. Indeed, wage increases last month were the best Americans have seen in six years.\n\nJust as important, we now know 2014 was an even more impressive year than we\u2019d realized, the U.S. economy added over 3.1 million jobs overall and 2.86 million in the private sector. What\u2019s more, January was the 52md consecutive month of positive job growth \u2013 the best stretch since 1939 \u2013 and the 58th consecutive month in which we\u2019ve seen private-sector job growth, which is the longest on record.\n\nLast year was easily the best year for U.S. job creation since 1999, which Republicans may struggle to explain in light of the Affordable Care Act, higher taxes, and federal regulations.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The latest job numbers were expected to be good.
