Or HIV drug users.\n\nAnd while that still accounts for about half of all people infected, those who are being diagnosed with this serious sexually transmitted disease don\u2019t fall into simple categories. They\u2019re young and old, straight, gay and transgender, of every race.\n\nA total of 5,377 Floridians were diagnosed with HIV in 2013, according to the Florida Department of Health. That number is higher than anywhere else in the nation.\n\nHere\u2019s some perspective. When it comes to the presence of HIV in Florida, the state\u2019s six largest metropolitan areas could be states unto themselves.\n\nIf Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach were a state, it would rank sixth nationally in the number of new cases. The Tampa Bay and Central Florida metro regions each saw more new cases than two dozen other states.\n\nThe number of HIV infections is significant because Florida is the third most populated state. But it also can provide clues as to who most of these newly diagnosed residents are. Health News Florida over the coming week will be sharing the stories of these people and their communities who include:\n\n\u00b7 Older Floridians accounted for 23 percent of the new infections in 2013. Of all cases of HIV in the state, 44 percent are 50 years of age or older.\n\n\u00b7 Young people, ages 13 to 24. Men this age who have sex with other men account for more than two-thirds of all new reports of HIV infection, the Department of Health reports. Doctors who work with this population also say that 60 percent of infected teens and young adults have no idea they are HIV-positive.\n\n\u00b7 Transgender women. There\u2019s little data identifying those in the transgender community living with HIV, but the risks are significant, from homelessness to sex work.\n\n\u00b7 African Americans. While this group accounts for 15 percent of the state\u2019s population, it disproportionately represents Floridians living with HIV, at 48 percent of cases. Stigma and prejudices linger around the disease within the black community, making testing and treatment difficult.\n\n\u00b7 Men who have sex with men. The gay community has been living with the realities of HIV infection since the disease emerged in the 1980s. And while it\u2019s at the forefront of many prevention efforts, infections persist.\n\nAcross Florida and the nation, public health educators continue to preach the importance of HIV treatment and prevention. That includes National HIV Testing Day, which is being recognized across Florida next week with free testing opportunities.\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, if HIV is identified early, there are medications that can transform the illness into a chronic disease. Treatments also can help keep HIV infection at bay for the sexual partners of people who are infected.\n\nBut that can\u2019t happen unless someone is tested and diagnosed, said Dr. Diane Straub, chief of adolescent medicine at the University of South Florida and medical director at the Ybor Youth Clinic, which specializes in treating LGBT Youth.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people that don\u2019t know they are infected\u2026The onset is usually about a decade before you start getting sick from it,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of opportunity for unprotected sex, and placing other sexual partners at risk, she said.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s years of exposing your partners to potentially acquiring HIV when you didn\u2019t know you were infected.\u201d\n\nHealth News Florida intern Megan Milanese contributed to this report.
