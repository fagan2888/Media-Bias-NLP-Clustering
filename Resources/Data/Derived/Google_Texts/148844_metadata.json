We knew it was a tough battle in that appellate court down in Washington, DC, but we\u2019re way ahead of the judge in south Texas, when all those governors joined, and I guess the judge put that on hold. So, we\u2019re already in the appellate court, and now going to Supreme Court on this very important issue.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think the Supreme Court may hear it, because you have different opinions from different district courts. Makes it ripe for the Supreme Court to look at it.\u201d\n\nArpaio also stated, \u201cwe have 5,000 people in jail on state charges that are here illegally, we turn them over to ICE, now last month, 40% keep coming back to the jails.\u201d And \u201cI think they\u2019re letting these people out the back door, because if they\u2019re not, we sure have a bad border down there. I think we agree with that. But, when they\u2019ve keep coming back 20, 25 times, in my jail, there\u2019s something wrong somewhere. So, something has to be done about it very, very\u2013.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio reacted to the dismissal of his lawsuit against Obama's executive amnesty by vowing \"we're going to the Supreme Court\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio reacted to the dismissal of his lawsuit against Obama's executive amnesty by vowing \"we're going to the Supreme Court\"", "title": "Sheriff Joe: 'We're Going to the Supreme Court' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Arpaio-814-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/14/sheriff-joe-were-going-to-the-supreme-court/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio reacted to the dismissal of his lawsuit against Obama's executive amnesty by vowing \"we're going to the Supreme Court\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Arpaio-814-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Sheriff Joe: 'We're Going to the Supreme Court' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "executive amnesty, Joe Arpaio, Sheriff Joe Arpaio,Border, Breitbart TV, Immigration,Sheriff Joe", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Border", "tag": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "published_time": "2015-08-14T16:02:02-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Immigration,Border"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "So, we\u2019re already in the appellate court, and now going to Supreme Court on this very important issue.\u201dHe added, \u201cI think the Supreme Court may hear it, because you have different opinions from different district courts.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERArpaio said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to Supreme Court.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMaricopa County, AZ Sheriff Joe Arpaio reacted to a federal appeals court throwing out his lawsuit against President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration by vowing \u201cwe\u2019re going to the Supreme Court\u201d on Friday\u2019s \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nWe knew it was a tough battle in that appellate court down in Washington, DC, but we\u2019re way ahead of the judge in south Texas, when all those governors joined, and I guess the judge put that on hold.\nBut, when they\u2019ve keep coming back 20, 25 times, in my jail, there\u2019s something wrong somewhere."}
