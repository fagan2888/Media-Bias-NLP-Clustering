He\u2019s a member of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nRead the hard facts of life, from Judge Andrew Napolitano, in \u201cIt Is Dangerous To Be Right When the Government is Wrong.\u201d\n\nNoted legal commentator Eugene Volokh, who once worked as a clerk for Kozinski, described him as \u201ca libertarianish conservative\u201d and said his old boss says \u201csome pretty harsh things about our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nProsecutors\n\nKozinski reserves his strongest blasts for prosecutors, who \u201chave unparalleled access to the evidence,\u201d and \u201cinfluence over witnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy direct experience is largely with federal prosecutors and, with a few exceptions, I have found them to be fair-minded, forthright and highly conscientious. But there are disturbing indications that a non-trivial number of prosecutors \u2013 and sometimes entire prosecutorial offices \u2013 engage in misconduct that seriously undermines the fairness of criminal trials,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThose actions range from misleading the jury to \u201coutright lying,\u201d he said.\n\nThat could be corrected by removing the absolute immunity they have from charges for misbehavior.\n\nKozinski cited the federal prosecution of then Sen. Ted Stevens. He was charged a week before he stood for re-election and was defeated, \u201cchanging the balance of power in the Senate\u201d to Democrats, at the time.\n\nHe was the longest serving Republican senator in history, and was charged with corruption for accepting the services of a building contractor and paying him far below market price \u2013 essentially a bribe.\n\nThe government\u2019s case hinged on the testimony of the contractor, but the government failed to disclose that the contractor was under investigation for unrelated crimes and thus had \u201cgood reason to curry favor\u2026\u201d Kozinski wrote.\n\nIn fact, the contractor at one point had put on the record that he thought he was overpaid for the work.\n\nKozinski explained \u201cthe government\u2019s perfidy came to light when a brave FBI agent by the name of Chad Joy blew the whistle on the government\u2019s knowing concealment of exculpatory evidence.\u201d\n\nBut prosecutors, when caught, argued even then the conviction should stand.\n\n\u201cInstead of contrition, what we have seen is Justice Department officials of the highest rank suffering torn glenoid labrums from furiously patting themselves on the back for having \u2018done the right thing,'\u201d Kozinski wrote.\n\n\u201cWe can only speculate how many others are wasting their lives behind bars because they lacked the right lawyer or the right judge or the luck needed to uncover prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe solution is to have aggressive enforcement of ethical behavior.\n\n\u201cNo Justice Department lawyer has yet been sanctioned for the Stevens prosecution despite the clear evidence of willful misconduct. Prosecutors need to know that someone is watching over their shoulders \u2013 someone who doesn\u2019t share their values and eat lunch in the same cafeteria.\u201d\n\nHe wrote, \u201cNaming names and taking prosecutors to task for misbehavior can have magical qualities in assuring compliance with constitutional right. Judges who see bad behavior \u2026 especially prosecutors who wield great power and have greater ethical responsibilities, must hold such misconduct up to the light of public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nSuch actions could even been the subject of a civil rights investigation, he said.\n\nUnder current precedent, he noted, prosecutors are immune from damages for misconduct \u201cno matter how badly they misbehave,\u201d for actions including \u201cintroducing fabricated evidence, knowingly presenting perjured testimony and bringing charges for which there is no credible evidence.\u201d\n\nThat, he said, \u201cis absurd,\u201d and if the Supreme Court won\u2019t change it, Congress should.\n\n\u201cWhen a prosecutorial office uses known liars as jailhouse snitches, or presents evidence from cops they know are prone to fabricate evidence or conduct suggestive lineups or eyewitness identifications, they are committing civil rights violations with dire consequences for their victims.\u201d\n\nVolokh republished the top issues that Kozinski raises as potential failing points in the system, of which corrupted prosecutors played only one part.\n\nEyewitnesses reliable?\n\nKozinski notes that there is an assumption that eyewitnesses are reliable, when \u201cresearch shows that eyewitness identifications are highly unreliable.\u201d And he notes people presume fingerprint evidence is foolproof.\n\n\u201cNo so,\u201d writes the veteran judge. \u201cWhen tested by rigorous scientific methods, fingerprint examiners turn out to have a significant error rate,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe even cites other \u201cforensic evidence,\u201d like bloodstain pattern identification, foot and tire prints, ballistics and the like, which have high error rates.\n\n\u201cSome fields of forensic expertise are built on nothing but guesswork and false common sense,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany defendants have been convicted and spent countless years in prison based on evidence by arson experts who were later shown to be little better than witch doctors. \u201d\n\nNot even DNA evidenced is infallible, he warned, being only as good \u201cas the weakest link in the chain.\u201d\n\nMemories cannot be counted on, he said, and it is not true that \u201cconfessions are infallible because innocent people never confess.\u201d\n\n\u201cInnocent people do confess with surprising regularity. Harsh interrogation tactics, a variant of Stockholm syndrome, the desire to end the ordeal, emotional and financial exhaustion, family considerations and the youth or feeble-mindedness of the suspect can result in remarkably detailed confessions that are later shown to be utterly false,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther, no one really knows whether juries follow instructions, and, \u201cThere is reason to doubt that prosecutors comply with these obligations\u201d to play fair\u2026\u201d\n\nNor can it be presumed, he wrote, that police are objective.\n\nPolice have \u2018vast discretion\u2019\n\n\u201cPolice investigators have vast discretion about what leads to pursue, which witnesses to interview, what forensic tests to conduct and countless other aspects of the investigation. Police also have a unique opportunity to manufacture or destroy evidence, influence witnesses, extract confessions and otherwise direct the investigation so as to stack the deck against people they believe should be convicted.\u201d\n\nHe cited the case of Debra Milke, who spent 23 years on Arizona\u2019s death row after a detective who was known to be a liar told the court she had confessed, a statement she contradicted.\n\nThe judiciary operates, Kozinski said, on the \u201cfaith that our system works very well and the errors, when they are revealed, are rare exceptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch hinges on retaining this belief: our self image as Americas; the pride of countless judges and lawyers; the idea that we live in a just society; confidence in the power of reason and logic; the certainty that none of us or our loved ones will face the unimaginable nightmare of unjust imprisonment or execution; belief in the incomparable integrity and accuracy of our system of justice; faith that we have transcended medieval methods of conviction and punishment so that only those who are guilty are punished, and their punishment is humane and proportionate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut he said, \u201cWhat do we really know?\u201d\n\nFurther, \u201cLawyers and judges are inculcated with the notion that the system works well and there is nothing to worry about,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe tell ourselves that the system works, and we really believe it, but this is largely based on faith. When all is said and done, we have only a guess.\u201d\n\nAdditional changes that might help include installing cameras in jury rooms.\n\n\u201cSeeing what juries do in actual cases can also ameliorate or eliminate the endless speculation about which trail errors are harmless and which are prejudicial,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy shoot in the dark when a man\u2019s liberty or life is at stake?\u201d\n\nHe also suggests giving jurors a written copy of jury instructions, letting them take notes and have access to a transcript, letting jurors discuss the case during the trial, letting them ask questions, and telling them up front what\u2019s at stake.\n\nAlso, ask their advice in sentencing, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "There have been a number of high-profile cases at the highest level of the federal court system in recent years that have left reasonably intelligent Americans wondering how the heck that conclusion was reached.
