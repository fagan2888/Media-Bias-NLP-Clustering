The tires.\n\nBig, puffy tires that look like something NASA developed in case someone ever wanted to ride on the moon.\n\nYes, they look a little strange, but these fat-tire bikes have a smooth ride, even over the toughest terrain, and are an awful lot of fun to ride.\n\n\u201cYou look at them and go, they\u2019re kind of goofy, but once you ride one, it\u2019s kind of hard to go back to a traditional mountain bike because of the additional stability and grip that you get,\u201d said Greg Smith, an enthusiast who started the website Fat- Bike.com.\n\nFat-tire bikes have been around for decades; photos from a 1982 Iditasport race in Alaska show a bike with two wheels welded together for an easier ride over the snow.\n\nThe bikes started to become popular in the early 2000s in places where riders wanted to combat the snow, like Alaska and the Midwest, particularly Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. Riders also took up fat-tire riding in sandy areas of New Mexico, Texas and Colorado.\n\nThe trend has spread across the country, spurred by major manufacturers jumping into fat-bikes around 2010.\n\nNow the puffy-tired rides are the fastest- growing segment of the bicycle industry and can be found from the deserts of Arizona to the beaches of Florida.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate adventure bike,\u201d said Billy Koitzsch of Arctic Cycles in Anchorage, Alaska. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of a fun being able to go over more obstacles. Your height and width profile are going to be able to get you over rocks with more ease.\u201d\n\nStability is the key component.\n\nRegular mountain bikes have tires 2 1-2 inches or less in diameter, which works well on trails or dirt paths.\n\nBut those tires also tend to slide out from under riders on corners when there\u2019s anything loose on the trail like gravel or sand. They also get bogged down when the terrain gets softer, as with snow or heavy sand.\n\nFat-bike tires are 4 to 5 inches in diameter, looking like someone put dirt-bike tires on a mountain bike.\n\nThe wider base puts more rubber on the ground, providing extra stability and traction. Fat-bike riders also use lower pressures in the tires, which adds balance and grip.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mountain bike on steroids,\u201d said Smith, who lives in Milwaukee. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put these tires on a traditional mountain bike because there isn\u2019t enough clearance, but the basic mechanics are the same, just enlarged to take that bigger tire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt brings people back to cycling: \u2018Oh, I used to do that, that was fun,\u2019 \u201d said Koitzsch, who has been offering guided fat-bike rides since 1996.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/04/bikes-0011.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a79\"", "article_summary": "Regular mountain bikes have tires 2 1-2 inches or less in diameter, which works well on trails or dirt paths.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mountain bike on steroids,\u201d said Smith, who lives in Milwaukee.\nFat-bike tires are 4 to 5 inches in diameter, looking like someone put dirt-bike tires on a mountain bike.\nBig, puffy tires that look like something NASA developed in case someone ever wanted to ride on the moon.\nYes, they look a little strange, but these fat-tire bikes have a smooth ride, even over the toughest terrain, and are an awful lot of fun to ride."}
