Jeremy Hill gets benched for fumbling twice, and his backup runs for 123 yards.\n\nIn their first two games, the Bengals have been a handful to stop.\n\nDalton added to his impressive season start with another high-percentage showing, and Cincinnati quickly ended Philip Rivers\u2019 streak of perfect passing while pulling away for a 24-19 victory over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday.\n\nWith their receiving group back to full strength this season, the Bengals (2-0) have been tough to hold down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our offense,\u201d said Dalton, who has yet to throw an interception or get sacked. \u201cThere\u2019s different things we can do. We have a good mix of everything.\u201d\n\nDalton\u2019s 9-yard throw to Tyler Eifert put the Bengals in control of a mistake-filled game midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nSan Diego (1-1) set up the first touchdown with a fumble and never led.\n\nGiovani Bernard took over at running back after Jeremy Hill lost two fumbles. Bernard finished with 123 yards, including a 26-yard run on the drive that ended with Eifert\u2019s touchdown.\n\n\u201cHe ran past guys,\u201d said Hill, who had 39 yards on 10 carries. \u201cHe ran through guys. He had a strong game.\u201d\n\nRivers brought a streak of 20 straight completions into the game, four shy of Donovan McNabb\u2019s NFL record. He completed his first two throws, and then was high with a third-down pass to Stevie Johnson.\n\nRivers\u2019 streak set a Chargers record and tied for third-longest in NFL history.\n\nHe threw a 10-yard touchdown pass early in the second half, the 255th of his career that moved him ahead of Dan Fouts for the club record. Fouts was at Paul Brown Stadium as a television analyst.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling to think about,\u201d said Rivers, who was 21 of 27 for 241 yards. \u201cIt\u2019s not as sweet right now because we lost the game. Once I\u2019ve had a chance to take a deep breath and look back, I\u2019ll be thankful.\u201d\n\nRivers added a 40-yard touchdown to Malcom Floyd with 4:20 left, cutting it to 24-19. His final throw was intercepted by Vinny Rey at midfield with 53 seconds left to clinch it.\n\nSan Diego returned to the site of its only playoff victory of the past six years \u2014 a first-round win during the 2013 season. Bernard had a fumble in that one, and Dalton had three second-half turnovers.\n\nThe tandem made the big plays this time.\n\nDalton finished 16 of 26 for 214 yards. In wins over the Raiders and Chargers, he\u2019s gone 41 of 60 for 483 yards with five touchdowns, no interceptions and no sacks.\n\nBoth teams missed a field goal and fumbled twice.\n\nKeenan Allen fumbled a punt on the Bengals\u2019 opening series. Two plays later, Dalton threw 16 yards to A.J. Green for a touchdown. Dalton also had a 45-yard TD to Marvin Jones.\n\nNotes: Peyton Manning completed 23 straight passes for the NFL\u2019s second-longest streak. Joe Montana, Mark Brunell, David Carr and Matt Ryan had also streaks of 22 completions along with Rivers. \u2026 Rivers\u2019 2 TD passes moved him ahead of Sonny Jurgensen into 14th on the all-time list with 256. \u2026 The Bengals benefited from a review late in the first half. Dalton was hit by Manti Te\u2019o as his arm started forward, resulting in a fumble that Jerry Attaochu returned for a touchdown. After a review, it was ruled an incompletion, and the Bengals took a 14-6 lead into halftime.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andy Dalton throws for 3 TDs, Bengals beat Chargers 24-19", "title": "Andy Dalton throws for 3 TDs, Bengals beat Chargers 24-19", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/20/andy-dalton-throws-for-3-tds-bengals-beat-chargers-24-19/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920_050318_philip-rivers.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920_050318_philip-rivers.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T14:28:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:09:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb98e\"", "article_summary": "CINCINNATI \u2014 Andy Dalton throws three touchdown passes, each to a different receiver.\nWith their receiving group back to full strength this season, the Bengals (2-0) have been tough to hold down.\nRivers\u2019 streak set a Chargers record and tied for third-longest in NFL history.\nDalton added to his impressive season start with another high-percentage showing, and Cincinnati quickly ended Philip Rivers\u2019 streak of perfect passing while pulling away for a 24-19 victory over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our offense,\u201d said Dalton, who has yet to throw an interception or get sacked."}
