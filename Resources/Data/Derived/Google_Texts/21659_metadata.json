Smith announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a class (the \u201cClass\u201d) comprising all purchasers of the securities of Tesla Motors, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ:TSLA) between May 10, 2013 and November 6, 2013, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d).\n\nTesla designs, develops, manufactures and sells electric vehicles and electric vehicle powertrain components.\n\nTesla Motors\u2019 goal is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to electric mobility with a full range of increasingly affordable electric cars. California-based Tesla designs and manufactures EVs, as well as EV powertrain components for industry partners. Tesla has delivered over 15,000 electric vehicles to customers in 31 countries.\n\nClass Action Law Suit\n\nThe Complaint alleges that during the Class Period the defendants misrepresented or failed to disclose that:\n\nStatements about the Model S\u2019s highest safety rating and lack of prior fire incidents were materially misleading, due to undisclosed puncture and fire risks in its undercarriage and lithium ion battery pack.\n\nThe Model S suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to erupt in flames under certain driving conditions.\n\nTesla\u2019s future sales, next generation Model X introduction, and stock price were vulnerable to the inherent risk posed by the Model S\u2019s design flaws.\n\nThe Company was unable to maintain sufficient automobile deliveries to satisfy analyst concerns and compensate for other declining revenue streams.\n\nIf you are a member of the Class described above, you may move the Court no later than January 7, 2014, to serve as lead plaintiff. To be a member of the Class, you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the Class.

The KBA is the German authority in charge of motor vehicle regulation. They have the power to initiate and perform investigations, and compel recalls. In response, Tesla provided the KBA with data and additional information regarding each of these incidents.\n\nNo manufacturer defects\n\nIn investigating these incidents, the KBA reviewed Tesla\u2019s responses to their inquiries, as well as other information. They subsequently issued the following statement:\n\nAccording to the documents, no manufacturer-related defects [herstellerseitiger Mangel] could be found. Therefore, no further measures under the German Product Safety Act [Produktsicherheitsgesetz (ProdSG)] are deemed necessary.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NetNewsLedger - Thunder Bay News", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.netnewsledger.com/2013/12/15/tesla-motors-faces-california-class-action-suit/", "article_author_name": "James Murray", "image": "http://www.netnewsledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/telsa-electric-roadster.jpg", "site_id": "9ea0cfc0695b71a1466e8dc4857c1f15", "article_published_time": "2013-12-15T18:45:00+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-24T12:47:16+00:00", "keywords": "electric cars, germany, green economy, tesla motors, featured, legal, technology, top stories", "wp_version": "7.6.1.4"}, "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dmumv1gbmkk4smoy1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "NetNewsLedger - Thunder Bay News", "description": "California Class Action Hits Tesla Electric Car Maker Law Offices of Howard G.
