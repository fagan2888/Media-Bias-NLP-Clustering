They can defend the Fox News host no matter what, while lashing out his \u201cfar-left\u201d critics for daring to fact-check the host. Or, conservative media outlets can let him fend for himself. (The third, obvious option of openly criticizing O\u2019Reilly for his duplicitous ways doesn\u2019t seem to be on the table.)\n\nIncredibly, as the controversy marches on and neither O\u2019Reilly nor Fox are able to provide simple answers to the questions about his truth-telling as a reporter, some conservative media allies continue to rally by his side.\n\nOn Sunday, Howard Kurtz\u2019s MediaBuzz program on Fox came to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s aid by doing everything it could to whitewash the allegations against the host.\n\nOver the weekend at Newsbusters\u2013a far-right clearinghouse for endless, and often empty, attacks on the media\u2013Jeffrey Lord denounced the O\u2019Reilly fact-checking campaign as \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d And Fox News contributor Allen West actually told the Washington Post that all the allegations against O\u2019Reilly had been \u201cdebunked.\u201d (Lots of attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week shared West\u2019s contention.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the peril for blindly protecting O\u2019Reilly this way? Simple: It completely undercuts the conservative cottage industry of media criticism. Because why would anyone care about media critiques leveled by conservatives who are currently tying to explain away O\u2019Reilly\u2019s obvious laundry list of lies.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Reilly\u2019s story, intended to portray him as an enterprising journalist unfazed by potential danger, is a fiction,\u201dnoted Gawker. \u201cIt is precisely the sort of claim that would otherwise earn Fox\u2019s condemnation, and draw sophisticated counter-attacks to undermine the accusers\u2019 reputation.\u201d\n\nAnd how do we know that to be true? Because the entire conservative media apparatus spent last monthunleashing sophisticated counter-attacks to undermine NBC News anchor Brian Williams after doubts were raised about his wartime reporting. Today, the same conservative media are either playing dumb about Bill O\u2019Reilly, or actually defending him.\n\nObviously, you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t demand Brian Williams be fired and that Bill O\u2019Reilly be left alone. Not if you want anyone to pause for more than three seconds when considering your press critiques.\n\nGiven its current defense of O\u2019Reilly, look at how comically hollow previous conservative condemnations of Williams now sound:\n\nHubris. So many celebrities \u2014 be they politicians, journalists, artists \u2014 refuse to accept that the cover-up and obfuscation is always worse than the crime. Time and again, when honesty and humility beckon, they are nowhere to be found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly's claims are demonstrably false.
