Although the researchers acknowledge that it\u2019s difficult to isolate the specific effect of Medicaid expansion on state budgets, they conclude that \u201cearly evidence from interviews with budget officials in these case study states shows state savings and revenue gains with limited costs resulting from expansion.\u201d\n\nThe three states examined in the Kaiser study are also saving money in programs outside of Medicaid itself, particularly when it comes to their behavioral health programs. With additional federal funding to finance Medicaid, states are able to shift money around to allocate more resources to mental health services, which have suffered big cuts in state budgets over the last several years.\n\nPrevious studies projected big savings for Medicaid expansion states \u2014 but, now that the policy has been in effect for a full year in many states, researchers are able to start confirming that positive benefit more explicitly. Other states, like New Jersey, have also started factoring the savings stemming from Medicaid expansion into their budgets.\n\nThere\u2019s been some other recent evidence that Medicaid expansion can also help spur job growth. According to a recent report from the market research group FitchRatings, the states that expanded their public health programs are creating jobs in the health care field at a more rapid rate, suggesting that \u201cACA expansion is generally positive for that sector\u2019s employment profile.\u201d\n\nHealth experts agree that Medicaid expansion has been one of the most successful provisions of the health reform law. States that expanded their programs saw much bigger drops in their uninsurance rates as they extended coverage to low-income people who were previously locked out of affordable insurance. If the entire country had accepted the expansion, the national uninsurance rate would be two percentage points lower, according to an analysis from the New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "There are big financial benefits in store for state lawmakers who implement this particular Obamacare provision.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "There are big financial benefits in store for state lawmakers who implement this particular Obamacare provision.", "title": "New Study Confirms That Obamacare Is Saving States Money", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/20/3636704/medicaid-expansion-savings-states/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP469774429824.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are big financial benefits in store for state lawmakers who implement this particular Obamacare provision.", "title": "New Study Confirms That Obamacare Is Saving States Money", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP469774429824-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP469774429824.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP469774429824.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-20T09:04:51+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0120\"", "article_summary": "The first study, from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, examined Kentucky and Arkansas \u2014 two states with previously high uninsurance rates that have benefited significantly from Medicaid expansion.\nOther states, like New Jersey, have also started factoring the savings stemming from Medicaid expansion into their budgets.\nThere\u2019s been some other recent evidence that Medicaid expansion can also help spur job growth.\nPrevious studies projected big savings for Medicaid expansion states \u2014 but, now that the policy has been in effect for a full year in many states, researchers are able to start confirming that positive benefit more explicitly.\nThe second study, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, reported similar findings for Connecticut, New Mexico, and Washington State."}
