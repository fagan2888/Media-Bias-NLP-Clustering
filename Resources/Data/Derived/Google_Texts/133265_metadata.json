Idle time and the fact he\u2019s playing on an NFL team based so close to his Jersey City connections haven\u2019t been a good mix for the second-year safety.\n\nFootball keeps him busy and away from his old neighborhood, where his past constantly tugs at him. The resulting stress and a case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have resulted in him self-medicating with marijuana, which helps calm him.\n\nAt the start of the season, Hill paid the price for his marijuana use, serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s drug use policy.\n\nAs a result, Hill knows he can\u2019t afford another misstep and he needs to get away from the negative influences threatening to derail his career. So that\u2019s exactly what he intends to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking my kids out to California and go to Disney World,\u201d he said with a huge grin. \u201cJust kind of relax.\u201d\n\nHill can use the down time. Since returning from his suspension, he has worked non-stop and energized the Giants secondary with his speed, aggressiveness and ball-hawking ability. He earned his first career start and had his first career interception in the team\u2019s 15-7 victory over the Eagles last Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a strong contribution,\u201d coach Tom Coughlin said. \u201cHe\u2019s worked hard and he has tried to go about his business the right way. In other words, to prove the quality of person that he is, rather than talk about it. He\u2019s not one to volunteer a lot of verbal, but he loves football and he\u2019s a very good football player.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone about his business and we\u2019ll stand by him and we encourage him. I think he feels a great deal of responsibility to his teammates now and hopefully that\u2019ll just continue to grow.\u201d\n\nWith two strikes, Hill, a former St. Peter\u2019s Prep star, knows this is his final chance with the Giants. He was suspended four games during his rookie season for using a performance-enhancing drug, which he said was the attention deficit drug Adderall.\n\n\u201cI want to repay the Giants for everything they\u2019ve done for me,\u201d said Hill, who also had off-the-field issues in college at Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to be able to play and help the team. I want to keep up the progress that I\u2019ve made. I want to be consistent and show the Giants I\u2019m ready to be the player they think I can be.\u201d\n\nTalent has never been the problem with Hill. At 6-1, 207 pounds, he\u2019s rangy, fast, aggressive, instinctive and has man-to-man coverage skills despite playing safety. In fact, he played some nickel as a rookie, covering speedy slot receivers.\n\nIn four games, Hill has 25 tackles, including a career-high 11 in his first game back against the Eagles on Oct. 6th, and the interception in the second Eagles game. His versatility gives the Giants options in the secondary such as playing three safeties or moving safety Antrel Rolle to nickel. Hill replaced starter Ryan Mundy in the second Eagles game, and played all 61 defensive snaps.\n\n\u201cI like to hit people,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe quicker you get to the ball, the quicker you can unload.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "sports", "title": "Giants safety Will Hill will skip town during bye week for some R&R", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Giants safety Will Hill will skip town during bye week for some R&R\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/11/giants_safety_will_hill_will_s.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/13696821-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11558352\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-02T07:03:37Z\", \"author\": \"Dave Hutchinson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"sports\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/13696821-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Will Hill quietly made his way out of the Giants locker room on Monday afternoon and walked into the uncertainty of the team's bye-week.
