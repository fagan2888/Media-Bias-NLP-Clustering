Robotics Competition.\n\nB.E.S.T. stands for Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology. The organization has been in existence for 20 years. Locally, Larry Frutiger has been helping run the Wichita competition for 16 years. \"An interest in science and technology, that is what we are trying to do, get kids interested in science,\" Frutiger said, \"and that is the whole purpose of the program.\"\n\nTwenty four schools from across Kansas and one school from Arkansas were at Hartman Arena.\n\nThe students have just a few weeks to put together their robots. For student Sam Chesick of Augusta High School, this was an opportunity to see science in action. \"We have enjoyed this program very much, we have learned a ton,\" Chesick said.\n\nSix of the highest rated teams will go onto regional competition at Fort Smith, Arkansas.\n\nThe event was in part ran by Wichita State Universities School of Engineering, and most all of the cost of Saturdays event was taken care of by local aviation companies.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Hartman Arena saw around 500 people, all of them watching robots designed by high school students compete in challenges.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Hartman Arena saw around 500 people, all of them watching robots designed by high school students compete in challenges.", "title": "Robots take over Hartman Arena", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Robots-take-over-Hartman-Arena-280433092.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F81/C60/F81C60EA71F74299B940096D1ABBE770", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/38B/502/38B50299595A4442B31DA338F570C1E3.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Hartman Arena saw around 500 people, all of them watching robots designed by high school students compete in challenges.", "title": "Robots take over Hartman Arena", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Robots-take-over-Hartman-Arena-280433092.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/robot43.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Robots take over Hartman Arena", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Robots take over Hartman Arena"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2816\"", "article_summary": "Twenty four schools from across Kansas and one school from Arkansas were at Hartman Arena.\nstands for Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology.\nLocally, Larry Frutiger has been helping run the Wichita competition for 16 years.\n\"An interest in science and technology, that is what we are trying to do, get kids interested in science,\" Frutiger said, \"and that is the whole purpose of the program.\"\nThe students have just a few weeks to put together their robots."}
