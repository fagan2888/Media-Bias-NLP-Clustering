Maureen Mooney, a former New Hampshire State Representative, is one of three co-chairs. She argues Brown is listening to his constituents, and will be an independent voice in Washington.\n\n\u201cNow on the other hand, our current senator, Shaheen, how can she possibly win? She voted for Obamacare,\u201d says Mooney.\n\nFollowing that same line of attack, Brown criticizes incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s vote for the health law and its effect on his mother.\n\n\u201cThree-quarters of a trillion dollars were taken from her Medicare to basically help fund a program that is broken, and is disastrous,\u201d says Brown.\n\nIf he gets through the GOP primary, Brown will be on the ballot against a female candidate for the third consecutive time. In 2010, he beat Martha Coakley for the Senate seat left vacant following the death of Ted Kennedy.\n\nHe lost his re-election bid to Elizabeth Warren in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "At his latest campaign stop, U.S. Senate hopeful Scott Brown aimed to win over female voters.
