It is gratifying that others \u2014 albeit belatedly \u2014 are waking up.\n\nThere are two separate issues: Is Obama trying to bring America down, and is his presidency falling apart (and what does that mean)?\n\nAs for the first, many get hung up on the semantics of whether Obama is trying to destroy America. Few are willing to believe anything so sinister of a twice-elected president. It\u2019s an easier sell to say that he doesn\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism or decries the very idea of nationalism and prefers to consider us all citizens of the world. He believes that capitalism yields unfair results, which leads him to desire a redistribution of our resources within the United States \u2014 and from the United States to the rest of the world. So he is pursuing an agenda that will bring America into line with the rest of the world, which is to say, he is making us weaker and less prosperous.\n\nI also happen to believe he has a grudge against America and wants to bring us down to size. But in his bizarro world, that\u2019s not destroying America; it\u2019s making it fairer and more just.\n\nConcerning the second issue \u2014 whether Obama\u2019s presidency is falling apart \u2014 it\u2019s important that we are clear on what we mean by this. Most seem to agree that Obama\u2019s honeymoon with the American people has degenerated into serious marital difficulties, as evidenced by his nose dive in approval polls. Some consider this data, along with his multitudinous scandals, and conclude, \u201cHis presidency is imploding.\u201d\n\nI believe that\u2019s correct only in the limited sense that he has lost the good will to accomplish much more of his agenda through proper constitutional channels. But I don\u2019t believe that it means he will be unable to accomplish anything for the remainder of this term. He has already proved that he is fully able and willing to act unilaterally on a wide range of issues, both domestic and foreign, with or without constitutional authority or congressional approval.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t just bluffing when he smugly declared, \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d He was expressing his frustration with his political opponents\u2019 sometimes refusal to roll over to his dictates and his resolve to circumvent them every time he gets a chance.\n\nThis was nothing new. He and his advisers had said many times that he intended to liberally use executive orders and other tricks to advance his agenda at every opportunity. He\u2019s also made clear his willingness to act lawlessly and encouraged his administrative agencies to do likewise. Nor will anything deter his enabling Democrats in Congress to assist and provide him cover every chance they get. Just watch the congressional hearings involving the Internal Revenue Service scandal if you want to understand how national Democrats invariably place their party\u2019s interests above those of the nation \u2014 and above the law.\n\nAs for his propensity for lawless unilateral action, remember when he admitted he didn\u2019t have the authority to pass the DREAM Act on his own and then two weeks later went ahead and issued an executive order implementing important provisions of it? Everyone has watched his whimsical, arbitrary and capricious granting of Obamacare exemptions. He intervened militarily in Libya without even consulting Congress, much less obtaining its approval. His Environmental Protection Agency, doing his bidding, has issued far-reaching emissions standards. The IRS was fulfilling his aims in criminally targeting conservative groups for punitive treatment under the tax code. His subordinates Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice were carrying out his direct orders in falsely blaming an Internet video for the attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Oh, yes, and he abused his recess appointment power to appoint a National Labor Relations Board president when the Senate wasn\u2019t in recess, for which the Supreme Court surprisingly slapped his hand. I could continue.\n\nSo if you choose to believe that Obama\u2019s presidency is imploding, I hope you understand that this doesn\u2019t mean he no longer represents a threat to America as founded or is impotent to do any further damage.\n\nIt\u2019s silly to write this all off with a wave of a hand, saying, \u201cThis is America. One man can\u2019t do that much damage.\u201d If you don\u2019t believe enormous damage has already been done in the past six years, we are on different planets. Look at the latest quarterly economic report, which shows a 2.9 percent shrinkage in the gross domestic product, with no end in sight. The number of people on food stamps and dependent on other government programs. The labor participation rate. The debt. The explosive costs and abominable failures of Obamacare. The state of the Middle East and the explosive rise in Islamic jihad.\n\nRegardless of whether Obama has the political clout to pass major legislation now or in the remaining 2 1/2 years, his executive powers alone \u2014 including those he has usurped \u2014 are enough to keep us on this downward spiral. Even without any further executive power usurpations, we are already on autopilot to spend ourselves into bankruptcy.\n\nWhatever you do, people, please don\u2019t get complacent.\n\nDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author and attorney.
