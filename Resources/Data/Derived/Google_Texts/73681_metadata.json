I quickly found out that if you pre-order the new Selena Gomez album, Revival, which is due October 9 on Interscope Records, you get a download of the single \u201cSame Old Love.\u201d Album options include a deluxe edition, Target deluxe version with 16 tracks, and a limited-edition deluxe version with an autographed journal, a forward by Gomez, color vinyl, and unreleased photos. Pre-orders also include advance ticket access for Gomez\u2019s upcoming U.S. tour.\n\nCheck out the video for \u201cSame Old Love\u201d below, courtesy of Apple Connect and Gomez\u2019s website, with embedding courtesy of me.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01.
