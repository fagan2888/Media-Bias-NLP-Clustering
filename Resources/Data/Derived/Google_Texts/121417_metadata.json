Murray, \u2018Bridge, bridge, bridge!\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s senior senator heard the message and came through with a $34 million \u201cTiger Grant\u201d from the U.S. Department of Transportation. King County Executive Dow Constantine put together the financing package with a few million here (from Tukwila) and there (Boeing).\n\nThe new bridge, unlike its predecessor, is earthquake resistant. A rain garden, made up of a two-foot-thick layer of specially mixed bio-retention soil, filters runoff from the bridge before it goes back in the Duwamish waterway. (The waterway has a new salmon project just upstream.)\n\nThe new bridge will carry 20,000 vehicles and nearly 3,000 heavy-duty trucks each day, transporting what King County estimates will be 10 million tons of freight each year.\n\n\u201cThis bridge is critical to several neighborhoods: It is critical to South Park, and to Georgetown, and to the industrial area of Seattle,\u201d said Dagmar Cronn, another South Park community leader who was raising hell \u2014 constructively \u2014 as the old bridge was raised for the last time.\n\n\u201cI have tended to be an optimist and a pessimist at the same time,\u201d Cronn joked. \u201cI was torn between hopes and dreams, and anxiety that this wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d She paid warm tribute to Constantine for stitching together the financing package.\n\nThe demise of the old South Park Bridge cut off Napoli\u2019s, a very popular (and very good) pizza parlor, from its lunchtime clientele of Boeing workers.\n\n\u201cThis is going to make a huge difference for us: Boeing is going to be able to get over here. People with a half-hour break won\u2019t debate whether they can make it around on the First Avenue South bridge,\u201d said Maria Porco as she took orders in a full house.\n\nAmong the political leaders on the dais, the new South Bark Bridge is both sweet and bittersweet. King County has a lot of bridges in need of repair. Yet, the Washington Legislature \u2014 specifically the Republican-run State Senate \u2014 has failed to act on a statewide transportation bill. (The House did pass a plan.)\n\n\u201cThis bridge is the last thing of this kind we will do for a while unless the Legislature gets off its butt,\u201d said Constantine as he walked to the bridge.\n\nSeattle Port Commissioner Bill Bryant, a Republican and likely candidate for statewide office, strongly appealed for a statewide transportation package when he spoke at the dedication.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., used the dedication to mock those in the \u201cother\u201d Washington who mock government.\n\n\u201cToday, a lot of people don\u2019t think the federal government has a role in anything,\u201d said McDermott. Gesturing to the handsome new drawbridge behind him, McDermott added: \u201cThis is what we call an \u2018earmark\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe new bridge can be opened for marine traffic. Just two 75-horsepower motors are needed to run it. It features four driving lanes, bike lanes and sidewalks.\n\nThe ceremony Sunday featured a Shaker prayer by Muckleshoot Indians, with a call for all who use it to travel peacefully and with good will.\n\nOn the dais together sat often-at-odds representatives from Aerospace Machinists Local 751 and the Boeing Company, which squeezed the union \u2014 hard \u2014 for contract concessions last winter.\n\n\u201cBoeing and the Machinists Union have had a partnership for many years,\u201d said Bill McSherry, Boeing\u2019s government affairs director.\n\nAfter the ceremony, and pre-July 4th fireworks, the bridge span was lowered and hundreds of neighborhood residents and bridge lovers streamed across, followed by a west-to-east parade of souped up 1950\u2019s automobiles.\n\nThe bridge will be opened to vehicle traffic at 6 a.m. on Monday.\n\nThe four year process that built it was a morale builder for all involved. Heads came together rather than butting into each other.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Debbie McNeil, \u201cwe came out of this pretty much liking each other.\u201d And Mayor Ed Murray was able to smile as he said: \u201cIt was the neighborhood that wanted this done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "The joyous Sunday dedication of Seattle\u2019s new $134 million South Park Bridge contrasted with a different form of dedication four years ago as the old 79-yearold bridge was being perman\u2026", "title": "A new South Park Bridge: The neighborhood made it happen", "url": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/06/29/a-new-south-park-bridge-the-neighborhood-made-it-happen/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/files/2014/06/20140626bridge_071.jpg", "height": 682}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-30T01:24:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-30T19:20:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/files/2014/06/20140626bridge_071.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c24\"", "article_summary": "The joyous Sunday dedication of Seattle\u2019s new $134 million South Park Bridge contrasted with a different form of dedication four years ago as the old 79-yearold bridge was being permanently closed to traffic.\n\u201cThis bridge is critical to several neighborhoods: It is critical to South Park, and to Georgetown, and to the industrial area of Seattle,\u201d said Dagmar Cronn, another South Park community leader who was raising hell \u2014 constructively \u2014 as the old bridge was raised for the last time.\nThe demise of the old South Park Bridge cut off Napoli\u2019s, a very popular (and very good) pizza parlor, from its lunchtime clientele of Boeing workers.\nAfter the ceremony, and pre-July 4th fireworks, the bridge span was lowered and hundreds of neighborhood residents and bridge lovers streamed across, followed by a west-to-east parade of souped up 1950\u2019s automobiles.\nPeople with a half-hour break won\u2019t debate whether they can make it around on the First Avenue South bridge,\u201d said Maria Porco as she took orders in a full house."}
