However, I think there is a bigger funding issue for Colorado schools that should be on the front page.\n\nEarlier this month, the Colorado legislature killed a bill that would fund all-day kindergarten statewide. As it is now, only half-day kindergarten is state-funded. So only families that can afford to pay tuition for their child are able to get a full day of kindergarten education in the public school system.\n\nThese are the pre-Common Core children whose curriculum was changed mid-education, without any additional funding provided by the state to purchase new textbooks and science supplies that are necessary to teach the altered curriculum. There is a lack of funding for teacher training in this critical time, when we have changed their teaching requirements. We need fully funded kindergarten, ongoing state-funded teacher training for core curriculum, and provision of supplies (including textbooks and science kits) before we will see educational success.\n\n\n\nJennifer Pula, Wheat Ridge\n\nThis letter was published in the Fab. 28 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "eLetters", "description": "So only families that can afford to pay tuition for their child are able to get a full day of kindergarten education in the public school system.", "title": "Funding is needed for all-day kindergarten across Colorado", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2016/02/27/funding-is-needed-for-all-day-kindergarten-across-colorado/41013/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2016/02/all-day-kindergarten-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "So only families that can afford to pay tuition for their child are able to get a full day of kindergarten education in the public school system.", "creator": "@denveropinion", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2016/02/27/funding-is-needed-for-all-day-kindergarten-across-colorado/41013/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2016/02/all-day-kindergarten-495x329.jpg", "title": "Funding is needed for all-day kindergarten across Colorado", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There is a lack of funding for teacher training in this critical time, when we have changed their teaching requirements.\nHowever, I think there is a bigger funding issue for Colorado schools that should be on the front page.\nEarlier this month, the Colorado legislature killed a bill that would fund all-day kindergarten statewide.\nWe need fully funded kindergarten, ongoing state-funded teacher training for core curriculum, and provision of supplies (including textbooks and science kits) before we will see educational success.\nRe: \u201cMany Colorado schools still failing after years, millions of dollars,\u201d Feb. 21 news story."}
