A 41-year-old man who was arrested Saturday for impersonating a police officer used the ruse in an attempt to engage in a sexual activity with a woman, according to an incident report.

Charleston police say Mark Christopher Dewitt approached a woman who was leaving the Silver Dollar on February 27 around 1 a.m. following an altercation, and identified himself as an undercover police officer.

An incident states the 20-year-old victim got into a fight at the bar, and Dewitt escorted her out claiming he saw the incident and would take her to a police station to file charges against her attacker.

The victim told police Dewitt took her to an Ann Street parking garage to get his vehicle, a white Range Rover, and then drove her towards Mt. Pleasant before returning to downtown Charleston.

While in the car, the report states Dewitt began to ask the victim if she was a "naughty girl," and asked if she liked to have fun. He then pulled out a stack of $100 bills and propositioned her for sex, the victim told police.

The report states the victim denied multiple propositions, and was then dropped off in the area of King and Spring Streets. The victim told police Dewitt did not touch during the incident.



According to a court affidavit, Dewitt was captured thanks to help from the Automated License Plate Reader system on the Ravenel Bridge. The victim was able to give a description of the car and a relative time they traveled over the Ravenel Bridge, and authorities were able to spot the vehicle and get its license plate number via video that was produced by the reader.



Officials say the Dewitt matched the physical description given by the witness, and he was later identified as part of a line-up.

Dewitt has been charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer.
