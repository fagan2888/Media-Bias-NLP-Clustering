And in the first four to five months he lost most of the weight he had gained.\n\nHe loves his job for much more than the exercise. Bob Dearing find the staff and patients\u2014 well, endearing.\n\n\u201cThey are some of the most wonderful people in the world. We're like a sounding board for the patients. Sometimes they just want someone to listen to what they are going through. And I'm not bashful about talking.\u201d\n\nNow 60, Bob was born in York, Neb., and raised in Nebraska City, but he moved with his family to Omaha.\n\nIn high school he worked 40 hours a week at a Food City store at 120th Street and West Center Road. In 1971, he graduated from Millard High (now Millard South) and joined the Air Force.\n\nHe spent 2\u00bd years in southeast Asia, training fliers in how to survive on the ground if they were shot down.\n\nHis own training included nine hours treading water in the ocean on the end of a 1,500-foot tether, repairing a life raft.\n\nHe taught airmen how to eject from their planes, hide their parachutes after landing and then use their survival vests. Each included a locator beacon, a sidearm, flares and a grease stick to camouflage their skin.\n\nA number of his trainees who survived and were rescued expressed their thanks by sending bottles of whiskey.\n\n\u201cI accumulated a nice collection of Jack Daniel's,\u201d Bob said.\n\nAfter leaving the Air Force, he traveled the country and then lived in northern California, where he learned glass blowing. He returned to Omaha in 1981.\n\nHe and his wife, Nancy, have three children, now ages 26, 20 and 13. Bob spent 21 years with FedEx Express, most of it loading and delivering packages.\n\n\u201cWe were constantly on the move,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery truck would make over 100 stops a day. It's a very physical job, which is how I was able to stay so skinny.\u201d\n\nOWH Columnists Columnists Michael Kelly, Erin Grace and Matthew Hansen write about people, places and events around Omaha. Read more of their work here.\n\nDelivering north of Audubon, Iowa, at dusk one winter, he got stuck in a snowbank on a road that hadn't been plowed. Given his background, he kept a survival kit in the military duffel bag he kept at the back of his truck. It contained candles, a flashlight, protein bars and extra socks and gloves.\n\nHe walked a long distance in the dark before seeing the light of a garage \u2014 and people who got him to warmth.\n\nBob retired with a pension, thankful for a job that \u201cpaid for my house and is putting my kids through college.\u201d\n\nBut a less-active lifestyle took a toll, and Bob, who is 5-foot-8, went from 159 pounds to 176.\n\nThen he heard about a job perfect for retirees and students: escorting patients around hospitals and to their vehicles when discharged.\n\nHis supervisor, Jan Killion, said the transportation team works from 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., 365 days a year, and has performed more than 400 escorts a day.\n\nHaving a separate staff to transport patients allows health professionals to concentrate on their own work, she said.\n\nBob works 32 hours a week and has three-day weekends. The work suits him just fine, he said, and he enjoys helping patients.\n\n\u201cNobody want to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's a wonderful place to get out of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "An Omaha hospital employee calls his job the best he's ever had \u2014 working for an escort service.", "title": "Kelly: Retiree says his new job, as hospital escort, is the best one he's ever had", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/kelly-retiree-says-his-new-job-as-hospital-escort-is/article_84edf4b4-1fc0-580a-bcf2-73cb9297494f.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/8d/28da693a-288b-5ef1-a581-20ce1b460406/5332eec99d14b.image.jpg?resize=760%2C492", "height": 492}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "An Omaha hospital employee calls his job the best he's ever had \u2014 working for an escort service.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d5a\"", "article_summary": "An Omaha hospital employee calls his job the best he's ever had \u2014 working for an escort service.\n\u201cI told my wife I needed to go back to work,\u201d Bob said with a smile.\nThen he heard about a job perfect for retirees and students: escorting patients around hospitals and to their vehicles when discharged.\n\u201dSo about 14 months ago, he joined the 32-person transportation staff at Methodist Hospital, 84th and Dodge Streets.\nHaving a separate staff to transport patients allows health professionals to concentrate on their own work, she said."}
