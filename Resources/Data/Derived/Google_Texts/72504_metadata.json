Competence: The administration has shown little talent for or focused interest in running the federal government well, and has managed the executive agencies very poorly. Coherence: The administration has been unable to explain persuasively the reasoning behind its current priorities (global warming? really?) or its decisions in areas from foreign policy to Ebola in a way that has allowed the public to follow their thinking. Credibility: If you want your doctor you can keep your doctor, red lines, it\u2019s highly unlikely Ebola will come here, there\u2019s not a smidgen of corruption in the IRS, etc. It\u2019s a terrible thing when a president loses his credibility.\n\nAbsolute failure in any one of the 3 C\u2019s will bring trouble, and when you fail in all three you get very big, even historic trouble.\n\nAll this explains nostalgia for a certain former president. You can get quite a conversation going in any room in Manhattan now by comparing Barack Obama to Jimmy Carter, with everyone defending Carter.\n\nIt will mean a great deal how the president handles all this.\n\nTwo weeks ago we lauded Bill Clinton\u2019s handling of his 1994 midterm drubbing. In a news conference the next day he accepted responsibility and suggested the political meaning of the election was that the public was more conservative than he was. That took some guts and humility. Cleverness, too. By convincing those on his left that they had to face reality, he opened the door for his historic compromises with the Contract Congress. This in turn gave Clinton room to breathe and gather his forces.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to quote a lot of George W. Bush\u2019s press conference the evening after the second term midterm thumpin\u2019 in which his party lost 30 House seats, six Senate seats, and control of both chambers.\n\nBut in his news conference you hear the sound of an old graciousness that has eluded President Obama, who has long said there\u2019s little he can do with obstructionists in Congress who are stuck on hating him.\n\nFor those who think Mr. Obama has faced unusual levels of rhetoric, consider this question from a reporter to Mr. Bush:\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. President. With all due respect, Nancy Pelosi has called you incompetent, a liar, the emperor with no clothes and, as recently as yesterday, dangerous. How will you work with someone who has such little respect for your leadership and who is third in line to the presidency?\u201d\n\nThis is how Mr. Bush replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been around politics a long time. I understand when campaigns end and I know when governing begins. And I\u2019m going to work with people of both parties. You know, look, people say unfortunate things at times. But if you hold grudges in this line of work, you\u2019re never going to get anything done. And my intention is to get some things done, and soon\u2014we\u2019re start visiting with her Friday with the idea of coming together.\u201d\n\nThat is the sound of political graciousness. It would be nice to hear it from Mr. Obama on Wednesday.\n\nAs for the Republicans, if they have as good a Tuesday night as they increasingly expect, it would be nice if they were gracious and big-minded, and a real relief if they didn\u2019t look smug and get that curled smile that says \u201cWe got it back, baby, and Harry Reid will soon be out of that pretty office.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if they were happy but modest, and made it clear they\u2019re aware of the fix we\u2019re in? \u201cIt is not about me and it\u2019s not, my hardworking friends, about you. It\u2019s about this thing we were given called America. It needs our help. So we are happy tonight, but it\u2019s work in the morning, and the kind of work that is the most important, saving our country.\u201d\n\nOr, more pointedly: \u201cI know what this is. It\u2019s the base giving the party one last chance. They are telling us we better do something. That\u2019s the meaning I take. and I mean to come through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Advice for the president and the candidates.", "title": "How to Lose, and Win, Graciously", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2014/11/03/how-to-lose-and-win-graciously/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Opinion", "article.headline": "How to Lose, and Win, Graciously", "description": "Advice for the president and the candidates.", "article_section": "Opinion", "author": "pnoonan2", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Peggy Noonan's Blog Blog", "page.subsection": "Peggy Noonan's Blog", "article.summary": "Advice for the president and the candidates.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-11-04T03:31:36-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2014/11/03/how-to-lose-and-win-graciously/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-233B-193", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Opinion", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Advice for the president and the candidates.", "title": "How to Lose, and Win, Graciously", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2014/11/03/how-to-lose-and-win-graciously/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Peggy Noonan's Blog", "article.id": "BL-233B-193", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-04T03:31:36-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf289\"", "article_summary": "For those who think Mr. Obama has faced unusual levels of rhetoric, consider this question from a reporter to Mr. Bush:\u201cThank you, Mr. President.\nIt would be nice to hear it from Mr. Obama on Wednesday.\nor its decisions in areas from foreign policy to Ebola in a way that has allowed the public to follow their thinking.\nBut if you hold grudges in this line of work, you\u2019re never going to get anything done.\nYou can get quite a conversation going in any room in Manhattan now by comparing Barack Obama to Jimmy Carter, with everyone defending Carter."}
