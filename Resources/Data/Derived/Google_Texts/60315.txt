LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Finally, a trip to the Kentucky Derby winner’s circle for Ahmed Zayat.

After three disappointing runner-up finishes, the owner won his first Derby when favorite American Pharoah took the Run for the Roses on Saturday before at record crowd of 170,513 at Churchill Downs.

The owner from Egypt who lives in New Jersey celebrated with his trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Victor Espinoza, both of whom are well acquainted with winning the Derby. Baffert won his fourth, Espinoza his third.

“I’m just happy for the Zayat family,” said Baffert.

Zayat was all smiles.

“I’m speechless and very emotional. We’ve been very close,” he said. “This is one special horse.”

Asked if it’s on the Preakness in two weeks, Zayat laughed and said “we’ll see.”

Zayat finished second with Bodemeister in 2012, Nehro in 2011 and Pioneerof the Nile in 2009. Baffert trained Bodemeister and Pioneerof the Nile.

With all those close calls, it’s no wonder Zayat spoke cautiously about his Derby chances — even though American Pharoah was the favorite in a deep 18-horse field. The owner also had Mr. Z, who finished 13th, and El Kabeir, scratched on Friday with a foot issue.

Though American Pharoah’s one-length victory over Firing Line was the closest of a six-race career in which he had been rarely tested, he proved he could answer a challenge.
