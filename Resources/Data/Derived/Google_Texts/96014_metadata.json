He co-founded Liberty Iowa in the wake of the Paul campaign, and organized the Free DC Project during the government shutdown of 2013. Joel is also a contributing writer to SteveDeace.com, LibertyConservatives.com, and other online publications, and maintains an independent blog covering a wide range of sociopolitical topics.\n\nBorn at the end of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term and raised in the relative wealth and convenience of the technology age, I am a member of the millennial generation: The most libertarian generation, the most connected generation, and, as of the last few weeks, the most confused.\n\nOurs was to be a generation of dreamers, unfettered by the silly traditions of our parents and grandparents. We were told that all we had to do was believe, without knowing what to believe in. We were told that faith would get us through, without any inkling that the value of faith is contingent upon its object. We were told to be nice for the sake of being nice, by a previous generation that still held vestiges of morality, while ceding the intellectual foundation that such morality requires.\n\nThe problem with throwing away truth, is that truth is a boomerang: It\u2019s going to come back fast. Share:\n\nThen we were soaked in Disney movies and pop songs advising us to listen to our hearts, follow our dreams, and be true to ourselves \u2013 consequences be damned. It all seemed quite innocent, even inspirational, at the time.\n\nI mean who doesn\u2019t want to follow their heart? Who is not inclined to be true to themselves? Even as a kid raised in a Christian home, I still cheered for Aladdin, Ariel, and Mulan defying authority to do their own thing. They always came out on top, things worked out, and in the end, following their heart was always the right thing to do. Nearly every Hollywood hero of my lifetime was a longshot dreamer who always won big and lived happily ever after. Had we grown up with some older cartoons, we might have at least been treated to the tempered warning in \u201cPinocchio\u201d \u2013 that following your heart without following your conscience lands you in a world of senseless jackasses.\n\nWhich is the world we\u2019ve landed in today.\n\nIt seems that my generation has finally taken Disney\u2019s advice to its obviously illogical conclusion.\n\nOur desire to flaunt common sense, defy definitions, and bend the rules has gotten us lost in a fog of baseless and conflicting wants. We no longer have to worry about following our friends off a cliff per our parents\u2019 proverb, we now seem willing to follow our own hearts off of it.\n\nWhen we want something we follow it unquestioningly, fighting everyone and everything that gets in our way. I would say that we tend to disregard the question of right and wrong, but really it\u2019s not so much that we disregard it, as we don\u2019t even comprehend the terms anymore.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia encapsulated the problem brilliantly in his dissent to Thursday\u2019s ludicrous Obamacare ruling when he said that \u201cwords no longer have meaning.\u201d Within the context of the last couple weeks, what other conclusion could anyone draw from our headlines?\n\nThe question just begs to be asked:\n\nIf Bruce Jenner is a woman, and Rachel Dolezal is black, then why can\u2019t state exchanges be federal, and marriage include two men or two women?\n\nThe answer, according to the Follow-Your-Heart Generation, appears to be \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nThe celebration that exploded across social media in the wake of both rulings seems to have no grounding in fact or logic; and that\u2019s okay with the left, because such things are rendered unnecessary by pictures of smiling couples and feely hashtags like #LoveWins.\n\nTrying to have sensible discussions with folks on these two decisions was like arguing with my 13-year-old self, back when there was some degree of novelty to defending the ridiculous just because it made me feel smart. Supporters of both decisions had been behind the majority since before either was made, and long before they knew what rationale would be used to justify it. The court could have cited the \u201cThree Stooges\u201d in the Obamacare case and concluded their marriage decision with \u201cbecause, potato\u201d and hordes of leftists would have rushed to the comments section of The Huffington Post to express their teary-eyed pride at the compassionate brilliance of the court that had just secured happiness and equality for everyone.\n\nI wish I could say that such inane gushing was limited to the realm of the status update, but it actually managed to find its way into a pair of majority opinions from the highest court in the land \u2013 both citing a lot of feelings and intentions, but employing about as much Constitutional and legal reasoning as an episode of \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure the court \u2013 or any of their new fans on the left \u2013 have stood back to examine the damage these decisions have inflicted, not just on morality, marriage, and health care, but on basic reason and rationality. Among the millions of jubilants parading their new win across the twitterverse, has anyone stepped back to consider the consequences of living in a nation where man might actually mean woman, black could really mean white, the text of a law is subject to what the court thinks Congress might have meant, and where someone\u2019s sexual preference is paramount to decisions of national law?\n\nIf anyone has, it is likely that they shrugged it off with relative ease. After all, this feels right! It feels good! Look at all the happiness! How could this be bad?\n\nNevermind that the Supreme Court has just legitimized the discrimination claims of polygamists, pedophiles, and those in incestuous relationships. Nevermind that the definition of \u201cstate\u201d must now be suspected of actually meaning \u201cnot state, but federal\u201d in pretty much every future law passed by Congress, ever. Nevermind that the Oberfell ruling places Christians and other faith groups squarely in the legal crosshairs of a newly-declared civil minority that has already shown itself utterly hostile to people of faith. Nevermind that the anchors of our very vocabulary have now been hoisted up to allow us to flow freely along with our confused and conflicted feelings.\n\nIt\u2019s all good, because, hey, #LoveWins.\n\nWe have earned this insanity. It is the birthright of my generation. We are convinced that we have the power to speak things into being. If we call marriage the union of two men, it must be. If we declare that state means federal so that people can keep bumming their coverage off of taxpayers, then that\u2019s what it means. If we call conservatives terrorists and Islam peaceful, reality steps aside for our proclamation.\n\nBut the problem with throwing away truth, is that truth is a boomerang: It\u2019s going to come back fast, and if you\u2019re not looking for it, it will probably hit you. We can rewrite the definitions all we want, but as the father of our language put it, \u201cA rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d\n\nA rude awakening is coming to millennials, and it\u2019s right around the corner. Reality is about to pop the bubble of self-righteous tolerance that has settled over Washington. D.C., and it has already begun.\n\nAmericans are finding out that no matter how many times we tell Islamic State that they belong to a peaceful religion, they just keep beheading people. My generation is discovering that we \u2013 and our parents \u2013 have followed our hearts into $18 trillion of debt, and that all the \u201cfree\u201d things that we were promised from government weren\u2019t free at all. We\u2019re finding that no matter how many times we declare ourselves righteous for our indignant crusades against racism, sexism, and intolerance, our country is still sinking in undeniable immorality, soaked in the tears of broken families and bathed in the blood of 58 million aborted babies.\n\nAs Ayn Rand famously said, \u201cWe can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality.\u201d\n\nWe have followed our hearts to the only place our hearts could have led us \u2013 to conflict and confusion. This might explain why we are now also the most cynical generation. With endless information and expert opinions instantly available to substantiate both sides of every conceivable issue, we see no reason to trust anyone.\n\nIs there a way back from this? Can a culture survive the loss of its own definitions and identity? Can we reclaim our laws, our institutions, our liberty, and reason?\n\nI guess that depends on how you define \u201cdefinitions,\u201d \u201cidentity,\u201d \u201claws,\u201d \u201cinstitutions,\u201d \u201cliberty,\u201d and \u201creason.\u201d\n\nAfter all, if definitions are up for negotiation, \u201cthen war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.\u201d\n\nFeature Image: Shutterstock\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
