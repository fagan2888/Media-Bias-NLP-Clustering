After congratulating each other on finding the funds for a possible aerial fire fighting fleet, the Senate passed this year\u2019s budget by a vote of 26-8.\n\nThe eight no votes came from Republican Senators Vicki Marble, Fort Collins, Scott Refroe, Eaton, Ted Harvey, Highlands Ranch, Owen Hill, Colorado Springs, Greg Brophy, Wray, David Balmer, Centennial, Kevin Grantham, Canon City, and Kevin Lundberg, Berthoud.\n\nBrophy explained his no vote by saying he was concerned that healthcare funding, which he attributed to the Affordable Care Act, has gone up by 87 percent in the last four years while education funding has only gone up 4 percent.\n\nRenfroe, who is term limited, noted that, when he took office in 2007, annual state funding for higher education was $750 million. He said he didn\u2019t feel right voting for a bill that only allocates $659 million to the state\u2019s colleges and universities.\n\nSeveral Democrats took issue with these complaints. Sen. Irene Aguilar of Denver noted that the large increase in the General Assembly\u2019s health funding has not, in fact, been a result of the Affordable Care Act but rather a piece of legislation she sponsored in 2009 to help provide more access to healthcare for the uninsured.\n\nMajority Leader Rollie Heath of Boulder, who has spent the bulk of his legislative career trying to raise more funds for education was, in a word, incensed by Republican accusations that not enough was being done to fund K-12.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing up here literally shaking. I\u2019m the oldest man in this room and the only reason I\u2019m here is education, and I think everyone knows that,\u201d said Heath. He proceeded to rail against the Republican side of the aisle for failing to support his 2011 Proposition 103 to raise taxes for education as well as a more recent initiative, Amendment 66, that would have added $1 billion annually to K-12 funding. This lack of support came despite studies from both the University of Denver and Colorado State University demonstrating that if the legislature doesn\u2019t find a way to raise revenue, they soon won\u2019t have enough money to fund anything but K-12 education, corrections and medicaid.\n\n\u201cTo stand up here and say we do not have a commitment to education burns me up. I resent that, we should all resent that. This state needs to recommit to education at all levels. We are not doing right by our kids and we can not do right by our kids within this budget,\u201d Heath concluded.\n\nLundberg disagreed, saying that if Democrats would consider a tax credit for families wishing to homeschool or enroll their children in private institutions, the education picture might improve without raising taxes.\n\nIn spite of the sparks around education funding, most of the Senate came together to say they were proud to have compromised so well.\n\nMinority Leader Bill Cadman of Colorado Springs encouraged his caucus to vote yes because he budget reflected the infrastructural, educational and rainy-day investments his party had said they wanted from the beginning.\n\n\u201cI just ask for a vote so we can go home and take a nap,\u201d concluded Colorado Springs Sen. Kent Lambert, a member of the budget committee, to some applause.\n\nThe proposal now heads to conference committee where representatives from both chambers will hash out a compromise between the Senate and House versions of the budget next week.\n\nWhich lawmakers will try out that minimum wage lifestyle?\n\nWith the balanced budget still firmly on the Senate\u2019s mind, Sen. Jessie Ulibarri of Westminster challenged his colleagues to join him in pledging to live on a minimum wage household\u2019s budget next week. That\u2019s $49 a week for food and $52 a week for transit and everything else, he said.\n\n\u201cWe just passed a budget to support working families in Colorado and I think it\u2019s important we understand the real lived implications of what it\u2019s like to live on minimum wage,\u201d said Ulibarri, noting that legislators make more than twice the salary of someone working full-time on minimum wage. He added that the average minimum wage worker is 35 years old and that 90 percent of all minimum wage workers are adults, not teenagers.\n\nHouse finds sweet relief from strain of toilet debate\n\nAfter just a little bit more debate and just a few more puns, the House passed SB 103 by a vote of 35-28 today. The bill prohibits the sale of water-inefficient plumbing fixtures after September of 2016.\n\nRep. Polly Lawrence of Littleton said she opposed the bill because the subsidies that currently exist for high-efficiency plumbing are working and she didn\u2019t feel a mandate was necessary or appropriate.\n\nRep. Cheri Gerou of Evergreen suggested that the bill was more or less a play by Denver Water to get everyone else in the state to shoulder the city\u2019s endless thirst.\n\nUltimately a majority of the House agreed with the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Randy Fischer of Fort Collins, that the fixtures are cost competitive and that it\u2019s worth making Coloradans buy them if it can save the state an estimated 13 billion gallons of water each year.\n\nThe measure now heads to the Governor\u2019s desk.\n\nHouse gets down to business to defeat appropriations backup\n\nThe House convened a little late today while they waited for the Appropriations Committee, which meets in the early morning, to churn through the more than 30 bills that had begun to pile up there. The House then held the floor until past noon deciding whether to give initial approval to the bills that made it out of that committee. Here is a sampling for your Friday afternoon reading pleasure:\n\nHB 1013, Pay advanced industry interns: Rep. Pete Lee of Colorado Springs and Rep. Mike Foote of Lafayette proposed spending half a million dollars each year to help fund student internships in advanced industry companies throughout Colorado.\n\nFoote argued that the bill touched on two of the most important things the legislature works on: education and jobs.\n\nSome conservatives opposed the measure saying it made no sense to pay companies, potentially fortune 500 companies at that, to pay their interns. Foote countered that not everyone can afford to take an unfunded career development position and that the grant evened the playing field by making the necessary opportunities to get a high paying job available to all Colorado\u2019s students.\n\nThe bill got initial approval on a voice vote.\n\nHB 1061, Get rid of debtors\u2019 prisons: Woops! Even though it\u2019s unconstitutional some of Colorado\u2019s municipalities are still routinely jailing folks for being unable to pay fines for infractions as minor as stealing a can of fish.\n\nThorton Rep. Joe Salazar\u2019s bill reiterates in statute that such a practice is illegal and also gives local courts some guidelines about how to make sure someone really can\u2019t pay and how to work with them on alternative or scheduled restitution.\n\nThe bill got initial approval without a single audible no.\n\nHB 1072, Child care tax credits for Colorado\u2019s poorest working families: Due to a loophole in how Colorado calculates its state child care tax credit, the state\u2019s poorest working families \u2014 those making less than $25,000 a year \u2014 aren\u2019t qualifying for the assistance that wealthier families receive because they aren\u2019t making enough to pay federal taxes, which is how the state calculates its own assistance.\n\nLakewood Rep. Brittany Pettersen and Rep. Tony Exum of Colorado Springs brought this measure to make sure those families are eligible for tax credit assistance of an annual maximum of $500 dollars per child, up to two children. They also amended the measure to make sure the legislature checks back in on the policy\u2019s efficacy and affordability in three years.\n\nPettersen noted that 62 percent of those who would qualify for this new tax credit are single mothers. Exum added that the bill also helps support Colorado\u2019s child care industry which provides 15,o00 jobs in the state.\n\nThe bill got hearty initial approval.\n\nHB 1009, even more better reasons to do wildfire mitigation: Carried by Rep. Tony Exum of Colorado Springs, a city hit particularly hard in the last few years by wildfires, this bill ramps-up the incentive for folks living along undeveloped forests to invest in wildfire mitigation on their property.\n\nCurrently the state offers a tax deduction for the costs homeowners incur while doing fire mitigation. Exum\u2019s bill changes that to a tax credit, which means the state will mach homeowners dollar for dollar on 25 percent of their mitigation costs up to $2,500.\n\nThe measure got initial approval today, so get chopping folks!\n\nHB 1316, Report on diversity in state contracting: This bill, sponsored by Reps. Angela Williams of Denver and Joe Salazar of Thornton, asks for $1.2 million dollars to conduct a report on what kind of business owners and contractors are winning state contracts.\n\nSalazar noted that Denver recently did a local version of this study and found that, yes, the vast majority of contracts went to businesses owned by white men. That said, both sponsors emphasized that the report would not be not a series of guidelines, goals or mandates about who should be allowed to contract with the state.\n\nEven with that caveat in place, they got a lot of push-back on the bill. Chief among that opposition were concerns that the study was too expensive, that it might violate a contractor\u2019s privacy and that it may not, in fact, be needed.\n\nRep. Libby Szabo of Arvada proposed an amendment to have the Department of Labor do their own, cheaper, internal survey first in order to see if the larger study was really needed.\n\nSalazar called Szabo\u2019s amendment a study of a study, which he felt was silly and distracted from the point of the bill \u2014 to make sure that Colorado\u2019s diverse businesses are arriving at an even playing field when it comes to government contracts.\n\nAfter several rounds of failed amendments, the measure got initial approval.\n\n\n\nSB 114, CSU Global open for that four-year degree granting business: Rating among the top 20 nationally for online degree programs, Colorado State University\u2019s Global program got the go-ahead to offer full four-year degrees from the House today.\n\n\u201cThis is truly the future of education,\u201d said the bill\u2019s co-sponsor Rep. Chris Holbert of Parker, adding that the program was particularly good for active military students and those looking for an affordable way to get a four-year degree.\n\nCo-sponsored by the chair of the House Education Committee, Rep. Millie Hamner of Dillon, the bill got initial approval today.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Notes from the 87th day of the 2014 legislative session.", "title": "Senate passes budget; House unloads bill backlog", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/146863/senate-passes-budget-house-unloads-bill-backlog", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/cap-note.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/cap-note.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-04T22:43:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T22:43:50+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/tessa-cheek"}}, "article_summary": "Senate passes budget; House unloads bill backlogSenate passes state budget with strong bipartisan supportCompared to the House, where only one Republican voted for this year\u2019s state budget, all was weary sunshine and rainbows in the Senate.\nCo-sponsored by the chair of the House Education Committee, Rep.
