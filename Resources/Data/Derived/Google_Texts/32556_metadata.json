Heart disease, the leading cause of death in the county, kills 281 blacks compared to 223 whites. Similarly, cancer kills 249 blacks compared to 178 whites.\n\nIn Ohio, STD rates among blacks are vastly higher than whites. In 2014, nearly 1,300 blacks were affected by chlamydia compared to about 200 whites. Gonorrhea rates for blacks are also higher \u2014 approximately 500 blacks compared to about 50 whites.\n\nAt Thursday morning\u2019s Let\u2019s Talk event, the four-person panel discussed why minorities seem to have more health problems and what can be done to address this problem.\n\nThough many more African Americans have acquired health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Lima Memorial Infection Control Chairman Dr. Wilfred Ellis said many health care providers will not accept this type of insurance.\n\n\u201cA lot of providers won\u2019t take Obamacare because they\u2019re not getting reimbursed appropriately,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cHow we\u2019re going to fix the problem remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lima Fire Inspector Chris Jackson, many African Americans do not seek treatment because they don\u2019t trust white doctors to provide them with proper care.\n\n\u201cThese people are deathly ill by the time they call us because they didn\u2019t trust the hospital or didn\u2019t have enough money in their insurance to seek treatment,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOur challenge as a community is we have to find a way to get these people the treatment they need.\u201d\n\nThe panel of professionals said increasing the amount of people who come in for health screens will help curb this problem. Screenings can determine a variety of health issues, including substance abuse and depression.\n\nAnother factor contributing to minority health problems is food deserts, a term used to describe areas where healthy food options do not exist, coupled with residents who lack transportation. According to Cheri Mitchell, project director at Activate Allen County, there are several food deserts within Allen County.\n\nAs a result, Mitchell said many families shop at gas stations and corner stores, many of which do not sell fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to create opportunities for access to affordable produce options for people in these areas so that they have the opportunity to bring them home,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cSome kids have never even seen real food that\u2019s grown.\u201d\n\nShe also recommended community gardens where people can grow their own food, which can save money and improve health.\n\nEven if accessibility to fresh produce was increased in these areas, many parents don\u2019t know how to cook them in a healthy way. Mitchell suggested offering free cooking classes for parents and children to teach them how to make healthy meals.\n\nTo address STD rates among African Americans, one community member suggested going to popular gathering spaces such as barber shops, beauty parlors and nail salons, and handing out condoms and pamphlets with safe sex and STD information.\n\nRewa Banks, registered nurse at Health Partners of Western Ohio, said talking to children about STDs and unintended pregnancy, and ultimately doing something about it, can go a long way.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take the airbags out of my son\u2019s car and say, \u2018don\u2019t you dare get in an accident,\u2019\u201d Banks said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t put a child on birth control because we don\u2019t want to give them permission to have sex. Permission and prevention are two different things.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the panel agreed improving health among minorities needs to be a cultural shift. Like most cultural changes, it starts at home.\n\n\u201cIf your mom and pop always went to the see the doctor and had wellness checks, or if they go to the YMCA to work out and bring you with them, you\u2019re going to have a culture where these things are normalized,\u201d Banks said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have to start as a community.\u201d\n\nHealth Partners of Western Ohio Registered Nurse Rewa Banks, left, leads a panel discussion on minority health issues with Lima Fire Inspector Chris Jackson, Lima Memorial Infection Control Chairman Dr. Wilfred Ellis and Activate Allen County Project Director Cheri Mitchell. http://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/web1_minority-health-panel-discussion.jpg Health Partners of Western Ohio Registered Nurse Rewa Banks, left, leads a panel discussion on minority health issues with Lima Fire Inspector Chris Jackson, Lima Memorial Infection Control Chairman Dr. Wilfred Ellis and Activate Allen County Project Director Cheri Mitchell.
