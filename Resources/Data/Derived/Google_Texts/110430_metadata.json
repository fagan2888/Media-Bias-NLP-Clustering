In fact, the hyperpartisan polarization that has ground Congress to a legislative halt is filtering down to the states, creating two nations, hardly parallel, that are increasingly adopting policies advocated by national partisan groups and decreasingly pursuing bipartisan legislation that was once the hallmark of state capitals.\n\nBy any measure, the partisan divide in state legislatures is as stark as ever. Only six states \u2014 Iowa, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New York, Washington and Virginia \u2014 have legislatures in which each party controls a chamber. Of the remaining 44 \u2014 in which one party controls both chambers \u2014 36 have governors of the same party. Nebraska effectively makes 37, a state with a nominally nonpartisan state legislature that is nonetheless dominated by conservatives working with a Republican governor.\n\nThese legislatures are pursuing dramatically different policies. On issues ranging from same-sex marriage and abortion policy to the minimum wage and the social safety net, Democratic-led states and Republican-led states are passing diametrically opposed legislation.\n\nAfter a wave of new legislative measures and voter-approved legislation, only one state run entirely by Democrats does not allow same-sex couples to be married. And in that state, Oregon, voters are likely to face a pro-marriage initiative on this year\u2019s ballot.\n\nOf the 25 states that maintain a constitutional ban on gay marriage, Republicans control both legislative chambers in all but two \u2014 Virginia and Kentucky. And in both of those states, Republican control of one chamber virtually guarantees no marriage bill will advance. The one state where a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is likely to make the ballot, either in 2014 or 2016, is Indiana, firmly under GOP control.\n\nLegal status of same-sex marriage\n\nIn the last several years, since Republicans regained control of legislative chambers in dozens of states in 2010, the patchwork of abortion restrictions have come to resemble a map showing presidential election results.\n\nBy the end of last year, 27 states had between four and 10 major restrictions on abortion rights, according to a study by the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute. Republicans controlled all but four of the 53 legislative chambers in those 27 states (again, counting Nebraska\u2019s unicameral Senate as under Republican control).\n\nStates with four or more major restrictions on abortion\n\n(Source: Guttmacher Institute)\n\nDemocrats own control of all but nine legislative chambers in the 23 states with fewer than four major restrictions on abortion rights (Republicans control both chambers in Wyoming, Montana and Alaska, and one chamber each in New Hampshire, New York and Washington).\n\nIn 2013, three Republican-controlled states, Arkansas, North Dakota and Texas, instituted bans on nearly all abortions performed after 20 weeks (Arkansas\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature overrode Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe\u2019s veto). North Carolina, Michigan, Georgia, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma and Missouri \u2014 all controlled by Republicans \u2014 passed new laws restricting abortions in some way last year.\n\nThe lowest-paid workers are making much different amounts in red states than those in blue states. Legislatures and voters in nine traditionally blue states raised the minimum wage, ranging from $9.32 an hour in Washington State to $8 an hour in New York. Though Gov. Chris Christie (R) opposed raising the minimum wage, New Jersey voters passed an increase, to $8.25 an hour, by wide margins in 2013.\n\nThe minimum wage rose, thanks to inflation adjustments, in five states controlled by Republicans: Arizona, Montana, Ohio, Missouri and Florida. The highest minimum wage among those states, in Ohio, is set at $7.95 per hour.\n\n\n\n(Source: USA Today)\n\nStates run by Democrats have had big increases in education spending over the last several decades. Of the 10 states that spend the most money per pupil, six have Democratic-controlled legislatures. Three \u2014 Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Alaska \u2014 are run by Republicans.\n\nAnd in the wake of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Republican- and Democratic-led states continued to diverge on gun-control issues. In 2013, 28 new measures loosening restrictions on gun permits were signed into law; only four came in states where Democrats have any foothold in the legislature. The only bill tightening restrictions on gun permits came from Colorado, a state Democrats control.\n\nOf the 70 bills loosening restrictions on guns, 49 passed in states with Republican legislatures and Republican governors. And 25 of the 39 new laws tightening gun restrictions came out of Democratic states last year. Seemingly the only area of bipartisan agreement came over guns in schools \u2014 seven states run by Republicans passed measures, most of which strengthen prohibitions on gun ownership by those with mental illness.\n\nPerhaps no single issue divides red America and blue America more than the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy initiative. Only three states with Republican governors \u2014 Idaho, Nevada and New Mexico \u2014 created their own state-based insurance exchanges; 11 states under Democratic control created their own exchanges.\n\n\n\n(Source: Kaiser Family Foundation)\n\nDemocratic states also moved quickly to expand Medicaid under a provision of the Affordable Care Act that provides billions in funding for additional Medicaid costs. Just six Republican-controlled states \u2014 Arizona, North Dakota, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan and Arkansas \u2014 expanded Medicaid roles.\n\n\n\nSource: Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nOn other issues \u2014 ranging from voting rights to unemployment benefits, immigration and college loans \u2013Democratic- and Republican-controlled states are moving in far different directions. When Obama makes his claim Tuesday evening, it will be a feel-good moment. Members on both sides of the aisle will leap to their feet at the suggestion that the state of the union is strong.\n\nBut while partisans will debate the health of the country itself, the union of the states is more divided than ever.
