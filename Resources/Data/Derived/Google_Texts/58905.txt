Lenticular, or lee wave, clouds form downwind from an obstacle in the path of a strong air current. The Front Range provides such an obstacle. Lenticular clouds can often be seen along the lee side of the range. ( Photo by Carlye Calvin )

Dear Readers: Because gift sets of Johnnie St. Vrain columns are not yet sold in stores, he's providing readers some of his greatest hits from yesteryear, right here. Enjoy this column originally published in November 2009.

Dear Readers: The Times-Call newsroom recently received the following question from A.R., which, while not addressed to Johnnie, is one that I believe I should answer.

"Tuesday at 5:32 p.m., I noticed the oddest and scariest cloud that I have seen in Colorado. It looked like a gigantic, fat tornado-to-be. It was dipping down like a funnel, but it was fluffy and fat and took up most of the sky. It was in the northwest area of the sky. What was that thing? Does it have a name? Was it a tornado hatchling?"

Dear A.R.: I went straight to our local weather expert, Dave Larison, with this question.

He had not seen the cloud, but he had a good idea what it wasn't and what it was.

"It certainly wasn't tornado-related," he wrote. "I would guess it was some kind of wave or 'lenticular' cloud, produced by moderate to strong atmospheric wind flow over the mountains. These clouds sometimes appear in odd shapes."

I went to a number of meteorological websites that provide images of cloud types. Lenticular clouds are fascinating. "Lenticular," according to Webster, is "having the shape of a double convex lens."
