But part-time workers, including those who work at the 30-hour cutoff set by the health law, receive more limited benefits. Instead of rolling back these workers\u2019 hours to avoid expanding their health coverage, Disney is choosing to promote them to full-time status.\n\n\u201cDisney wants to be proactive,\u201d said Ed Chambers, president of the Service Trades Council union that represents tens of thousands of Orlando Disney employees, in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cDisney is way out in front on this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a striking departure from some retail and service sector firms that have used Obamacare\u2019s employee coverage requirement as an excuse to cut hours and benefits. While the vast majority of firms are not engaging in such tactics, high-profile stories about companies that do adopt that approach tend to dominate media coverage.\n\nIn fact, Disney\u2019s decision tracks with a recent survey of chief financial officers at large American firms finding that American companies actually intend to increase their number of full-time employees by almost 2 percent over the next year, despite repeated claims by Obamacare critics that the reform law will create a part-time economy, discourage hiring, or encourage employers to roll back workers\u2019 hours to avoid Obamacare.\n\nThose claims have not borne out in reality. According to an analysis by Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) in July, just 0.6 percent of the American labor force worked between 26 and 29 hours per week in 2013 \u2014 the level of work that employers would be expected to roll back their workers\u2019 hours to if they were trying to bypass Obamacare.\n\nFurthermore, less than a third of workers say they are working less than 30 hours because of an employers\u2019 decision, with most choosing to work a limited number of hours out of personal preference. That led CEPR researchers to conclude that the employment trend \u201cis in the wrong direction for the ACA as job-killer story.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The happiest place on earth just got a little happier, now that Disney is making sure that 30-hour-a-week workers have better health benefits than they did before.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The happiest place on earth just got a little happier, now that Disney is making sure that 30-hour-a-week workers have better health benefits than they did before.", "title": "Under Obamacare, Disney World Will Promote Its Part-Time Workers To Full-Time Status", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/02/2716951/disney-world-obamacare-promote-full-time/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_disney-world-e1380724227967.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The happiest place on earth just got a little happier, now that Disney is making sure that 30-hour-a-week workers have better health benefits than they did before.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_disney-world-e1380724201734-321x214.jpg", "title": "Under Obamacare, Disney World Will Promote Its Part-Time Workers To Full-Time Status", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_disney-world-e1380724227967.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_disney-world-e1380724227967.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-02T11:26:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5cd\"", "article_summary": "Health Under Obamacare, Disney World Will Promote Its Part-Time Workers To Full-Time Status CREDIT: ShutterstockThe happiest place on earth just got a little happier.\nInstead of rolling back these workers\u2019 hours to avoid expanding their health coverage, Disney is choosing to promote them to full-time status.\nDisney already offers a level of health coverage that is acceptable under Obamacare to its full-time employees.\nBut part-time workers, including those who work at the 30-hour cutoff set by the health law, receive more limited benefits.\n\u201cDisney wants to be proactive,\u201d said Ed Chambers, president of the Service Trades Council union that represents tens of thousands of Orlando Disney employees, in an interview with Bloomberg News."}
