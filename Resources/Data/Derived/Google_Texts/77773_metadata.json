William Peter Blatty had used the word \u201cdemonic,\u201d and now there atop Drudge was a photo of of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nIt had been another week of the Obama administration\u2019s having to answer for and trying to explain away the political house of horrors that its signature law, the misnamed Affordable Care Act has becomesignat.\n\nBlatty never called Sebelius demonic. But he did reflect on the American soul in ways deeper than most political analysts tend to, deeper than many public prayers about politics.\n\nSebelius\u2019s name came up during the interview as Blatty talked with the reporter about his decades-long concern for the integrity of his alma mater, Georgetown University, as a Catholic institution. In the spring of 2012, he recalled, as religious leaders, and Catholic bishops in an unmistakable way, were protesting the White House\u2019s insistence that an HHS-mandated assault on conscience stand as a new health-care regulation, Georgetown hosted Sebelius as its commencement speaker.\n\nBut this runs deeper than a cabinet secretary, a political debacle, or even one influential school. Anyone who clicked on the Drudge link was issued an invitation into a contemplative life.\n\nThe Ear of the Heart, the memoir of Mother Dolores Hart, known as \u201cthe nun who kissed Elvis,\u201d the former actress who went on to the cloistered religious life writes: \u201cTo enter the contemplative life truly, you have to go though a narrow, lonely place in your being, where you face all your fears and selfish patterns, even when you don\u2019t know what these are. I thought I was very grown up, very mature. You don\u2019t realize what a child you are until God tests your heart and you go through that deep place all of us have to go through.\u201d\n\nOutside of a cloister, Blatty has seen that. Blatty has lived that.\n\nThe Post piece notes that Blatty wears \u201ca silver medal etched with the three crosses of Calvary, where Jesus was crucified in the Gospels. The medal,\u201d the reporter writes, \u201cbelonged to his son Peter, who died seven years ago. One reason The Exorcist has endured, Blatty thinks, is because it shows that the grave does not mean oblivion. That there is something after death.\u201d As Blatty talked about the death of his son, he also talked about and demonstrated hope.\n\nBut what is even more interesting than what was printed in the Post\u2019s article, occasioned by the 40th anniversary of The Exorcist, is what it did not say.\n\nThe reporter tells us about Blatty\u2019s choice of sweetener for his coffee at their lunch at the Georgetown-area Tombs restaurant, along with his mashing his meatballs, carving his polenta, and swirling \u201cthem together with blood-red sauce.\u201d And yet there is a ceiling on details in the piece. \u201cHe describes, his voice trembling, a particular abortion procedure in graphic detail,\u201d the reporter writes. End of details.\n\nBlatty tells me that what he described was a \u201clate term abortion procedure plus the saline injection.\u201d\n\n\u201cI described late-term abortion procedure in which the abortionist plunges a surgical scissors into the infant\u2019s skull,\u201d he says. He talked about the brutality of the procedure, one that Leroy Carhart, a late-term-abortion provider with a clinic in Maryland, has described in almost sacramental terms: \u201cI think out of respect and love and honor for this baby that you\u2019ve lost, you will find yourself being a better person,\u201d Carhart recently told an undercover investigator from Live Action.\n\nIn 1977, Melissa Ohden survived a saline-infusion abortion. Her teen mom was six months pregnant, and Melissa was delivered alive and cared for as the newborn she was by the doctors and nurses present. Today she speaks about late-term abortion in the most personal of terms. She started a group, the Abortion Survivors Network, for other women who have survived abortion and who started life as babies who were supposed to have been delivered dead.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see no evil here. Even when there may be the best of intentions.\n\n\u201cMost women who come in for abortions, if they knew this, would never go through with it,\u201d Blatty believes. It\u2019s \u201cdemonic\u201d to look away, to not confront it and insist on better, was his point. For women, for children, for our country and our day.\n\nIn talking with the Washington Post\u2019s reporter, Blatty described his writing of The Exorcist as \u201capostolic.\u201d\n\nPicking up my yellowed copy of the 1971 classic, I am reminded of the quotes with which Blatty chose to open the book. First there was Luke. Jesus approaches a man possessed \u201cby a devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times it had laid hold of him, and he was bound with chains . . . but he would break the bonds asunder.\n\n\u201cJesus asked him, saying, \u2018What is thy name?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Legion.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nBlatty then moves close to home, with a graphic portion of a transcript of an FBI wiretap describing a murder: \u201c[William] Jackson was hung up on that meathook. . . . He was on that thing three days before he croaked.\u201d\n\nBlatty does not shy away from blunt descriptions of the evil men do. Dachau, Auschwitz, Buchenwald all get mentions before his novel begins.\n\nBeyond ghoulish fascination, there is good and there is evil. And for all our popular talk of \u201cspiritual journeys,\u201d and of millennials\u2019 being \u201cspiritual but not religious,\u201d we\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think there is redemption in denial.\n\n\u201cThere is no greater gift, I believe, that a woman can give, than life to a child,\u201d Melissa Ohden has said. Melissa\u2019s mother was pressured into that abortion that should have killed Melissa before she saw the light of day. \u201cI soaked in that toxic salt solution,\u201d Ohden described the latter days of her fetal life to a rally earlier this year protesting the push to expand the availability of abortion that New York governor Andrew Cuomo considers a priority of his administration.\n\nThis is a window into hell. Want out? Acknowledge our radical abortion politics as being about a right to dead babies, and we might just break the chains of a grave ideology, as we work together for something better.\n\n\u2014 Kathryn Jean Lopez is editor-at-large of National Review Online and a director of Catholic Voices USA.
