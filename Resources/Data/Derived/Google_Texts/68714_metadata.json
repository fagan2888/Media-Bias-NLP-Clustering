Meanwhile the proportion of EU students increased from 16 per cent (2,013) to 21 per cent (2,199).\n\nThe number of Scottish and EU students both increased at St Andrews University. The Scottish Government said more \u201cfunded\u201d places for Scottish and EU students have been provided this year.\n\nGlasgow University said the number of places it can offer Scottish and EU students is capped and it is forbidden from discriminating between them.\n\nEdinburgh and Dundee universities said they welcomed talented students from around the world, \u201cregardless of where they are from\u201d, while Aberdeen said its proportion of Scottish students had remained at 59 per cent for the last three years.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "DCSext.articleId": 11428014, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03162/edinburgh_universi_3162156k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@simon_telegraph"}, "keywords": "free tuition, tuition fee, SNP, Edinburgh university, Glasgow university, Aberdeen university, Dundee university, St Andrews, University education,Education", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Politics;Scotland;UK_News;University_education;Education;Simon_Johnson;SNP;Scottish_Politics", "DCSext.Channel": "education", "DCSext.MLC": "/education/universityeducation", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "free tuition, tuition fee, SNP, Edinburgh university, Glasgow university, Aberdeen university, Dundee university, St Andrews", "WT.cg_n": "education", "title": "Scots 'losing out on university places to EU students'", "section-id": 3985, "GSACategory": "universityeducation", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "education-universityeducation", "GSAMLC": "education/universityeducation", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "WT.cg_s": "universityeducation", "description": "Official figures suggest that the SNP's free tuition policy is backfiring on \n  Scottish youngsters competing for a place at some of the most prestigious \n  universities by attracting more students from the Continent.", "tmgads.channel": "education", "article-id": 11428014, "DCSext.Category": "universityeducation", "DCSext.Level": 3, "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-22", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "education-university_education", "last-modified": "2015-02-22", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "Education", "wordcount": 632, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Simon Johnson", "tag": "Scottish Politics", "subsection": "University education", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 6, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "tmgads.articleid": 11428014, "tmgads.level": 3, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Scots \\u0027losing out on university places to EU students\\u0027 \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11428014/Scots-losing-out-on-university-places-to-EU-students.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03162/edinburgh_universi_3162156k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11428014\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-22T15:58:34Z\",\"section\": \"Education\",\"authors\": [\"Simon Johnson\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"Politics\",\"Scotland\",\"UK News\",\"University education\",\"Education\",\"Simon Johnson\",\"SNP\",\"Scottish Politics\"]}", "GSAChannel": "education", "GSAChannelName": "Education", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Official figures suggest that the SNP's free tuition policy is backfiring on   Scottish youngsters competing for a place at some of the most prestigious   universities by attracting more students from the Continent.", "title": "Scots 'losing out on university places to EU students'", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11428014/Scots-losing-out-on-university-places-to-EU-students.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03162/edinburgh_universi_3162156k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.cf": 0, "DCSext.cd": 0, "tmgads.zone": "education.universityeducation", "DCSext.cn": 0, "DCSext.author": "Simon Johnson", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2015-02-22 15:58"}, "article_summary": "Glasgow University said the number of places it can offer Scottish and EU students is capped and it is forbidden from discriminating between them.\nThe Scottish Government said more \u201cfunded\u201d places for Scottish and EU students have been provided this year.\nThe number of Scottish and EU students both increased at St Andrews University.\nMeanwhile the proportion of EU students increased from 16 per cent (2,013) to 21 per cent (2,199).\nOver the same period the proportion of EU students increased by three percentage points to 14.4 per cent, from 1,805 to 2,437."}
