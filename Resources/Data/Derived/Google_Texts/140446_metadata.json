You are playing against a team with nothing to lose and a lot of young guys that are trying to prove something and it can go either way.\u201d\n\nTomas Fleischmann and Teuvo Teravainen also scored to help the Blackhawks improve to 44-25-7. Trevor van Riemsdyk had two assists for the defending champs.\n\nChicago earned consecutive wins for the first time since March 2.\n\nScott Darling made 26 saves in his ninth victory of the season. Regular starter Corey Crawford is not on the road trip due to an upper-body injury.\n\n\u201cI thought he had a couple of key saves,\u201d Quenneville said about Darling. \u201cI thought he was big, strong, quick and that he anticipated really well.\u201d\n\nAlex Burrows and Sven Baertschi scored for the Canucks, who have managed only seven goals during their eight-game losing streak. Emerson Etem had two assists, and Ryan Miller finished with 29 saves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cYou never want to lose that many games in a row. Right now it\u2019s frustrating because we know we\u2019re not going to get in. It\u2019s going to be a really long summer of working out and a lot of time in the gym. We have to use these next few weeks for the young guys to show what they got.\u201d\n\nBaertschi tied the score 2-all with just more than 5 minutes left in the third when he converted a feed from Etem.\n\nTeravainen put Chicago ahead early in the period when he slammed home a quick one-timer at the back door following a nifty passing play between Patrick Kane and van Riemsdyk.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looking to repeat as Stanley Cup champions and win their fourth title in seven years, the Chicago Blackhawks took a crucial step Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Looking to repeat as Stanley Cup champions and win their fourth title in seven years, the Chicago Blackhawks took a crucial step Sunday.", "title": "Blackhawks beat skidding Canucks 3-2 to clinch playoff spot", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/blackhawks-beat-skidding-canucks-3-2-to-clinch-pla/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/blackhawks_canucks_hockey.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/blackhawks_canucks_hockey.jpeg", "description": "Looking to repeat as Stanley Cup champions and win their fourth title in seven years, the Chicago Blackhawks took a crucial step Sunday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Blackhawks beat skidding Canucks 3-2 to clinch playoff spot"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI love the way he played the last couple of games,\u201d Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said.\nAndrew Ladd scored the go-ahead goal with 2:27 left in the third period and Chicago clinched its eighth straight postseason berth with a 3-2 victory over the skidding Vancouver Canucks.\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - Looking to repeat as Stanley Cup champions and win their fourth title in seven years, the Chicago Blackhawks took a crucial step Sunday.\nIt\u2019s going to be a really long summer of working out and a lot of time in the gym.\n\u201cWe wanted to build on last night\u2019s win and just keep getting points,\u201d Ladd said."}
