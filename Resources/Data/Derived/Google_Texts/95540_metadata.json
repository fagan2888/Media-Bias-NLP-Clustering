The \u201cpantsing\u201d is not what is disgusting.\n\nWhat\u2019s disgusting is that three of our kids would be kicked out of school over horseplay. What\u2019s disgusting are stats that show Escambia County is a place where this sort of unjust, excessive discipline is too often doled out onto our children. What\u2019s disgusting is the fact that the kids who are bearing the brunt of that excessive discipline are by and large, black.\n\nState statistics show that during the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for only 34 percent of the student population in Escambia County, yet they made up 63 percent of the students disciplined. Of the entire population of black students, 33.8 percent were disciplined, while only 10.8 percent of all white students were disciplined. And of all students who received either in- or out-of-school suspension, 4,676 were black while 2,151 were white. That\u2019s not just a perception problem. That\u2019s cruelty in numbers.\n\nIt is unacceptable that Superintendent Malcolm Thomas has chosen to stay silent in this case. Instead of being a vocal public leader in the face of public outcry, Thomas hid behind bureaucratic process by citing district policy. \"We do not comment about any discipline incident that involves specific students,\" he said. \"If a student commits a serious conduct breach, they're entitled to due process and have an opportunity to a hearing before a committee.\"\n\nA \u201cserious conduct breach?\u201d A serious conduct breach is violence or threats thereof. We\u2019re talking about pantsing, here. Please.\n\nTaxpayers deserve more from Thomas. Recently, the superintendent was more than outspoken when he sat down with the PNJ to offer criticism of Florida\u2019s broken system of student testing. He was right and we praised him for his vocal leadership against a flawed system that harms students and schools. But he ought to be equally outspoken in the face of a disciplinary system right here at home that is crushing our own kids.\n\nIndeed, this sort of irrationally harsh juvenile discipline is a hallmark of Escambia County. It\u2019s not unrelated to the sad, sick fact that Florida sends more children, especially minorities, to adult court than any other state. Tonia Galloni, managing attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Miami, recently told the PNJ that prosecutors in Escambia County are especially inclined to try juveniles as adults.\n\n\u201cIn 2013-14, Escambia County prosecutors transferred 70 children to adult court,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the same number of children that were \u2018direct filed\u2019 in Orange County, with a youth population almost five times the size.\u201d While the statewide trend to do so is declining, the opposite is happening in Escambia, she pointed out. What\u2019s worse is how often this harsh punishment is meted out for non-violent offenses and how these kids are almost always black.\n\nHow can this be? Are black kids in Escambia County somehow worse than black kids in inner-city Orlando? It\u2019s absurd. This is an unacceptable status quo and it\u2019s symptomatic of some larger cultural sickness in our community. These are our children that we\u2019re destroying.\n\nFamilies of two of the boys from WFHS, both 15 years old, are fighting it. One of the boys has no disciplinary history at all, yet he\u2019s being expelled over the incident.\n\nIt should not be like this. After all, let\u2019s remember that this is about a prank, a pantsing. Teenage boys act like teenage boys and we ban them from a place of education? Is that the best answer we\u2019ve got? How about running the bleachers or wind sprints until they collapse? How about scrubbing the cafeteria floors? How about cleaning the campus or mandatory weekend landscaping duties? How about something productive?\n\nWe send our kids to school because, as a society, we believe it will make them productive citizens. What does it accomplish to scrap that in the face of mischief?\n\nTaxpayers and parents need to demand a full, public justification from Superintendent Malcolm Thomas and the Escambia County School District \u2014 not only about the pantsing case, but about the awful numbers of an unjust disciplinary system that crushes black kids more often than others. Black parents should speak out. White parents should speak out. Especially white parents. Because injustice for any of us is injustice for all of us.\n\nWe are a community and these are all our kids. But stories like this show that the disciplinary systems that we\u2019ve created for them \u2014 that we force upon them \u2014 are too often excessive, unjust and immoral. And that\u2019s simply disgusting.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1RNDHau", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We are a community and these are all our kids.
