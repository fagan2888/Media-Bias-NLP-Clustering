In fact, the debate on poverty (like the poor themselves) will be with us all year. But it\u2019s important to remember that LBJ\u2019s war coincided with other social upheavals, such as the end of the marriage culture, the start of the \u201cminority rights\u201d revolution, and a huge surge in immigration, mostly from Latin America.\n\nThese immigrants, who were soon agglomerated under the label \u201cHispanics\u201d by the bureaucracy (a term made in America and only used by others in a different context), became one of the main casualties of the war.\n\nMuch attention is paid these days to the subject of illegal immigration. Considerably less is paid to how we integrate the millions of immigrants who\u2019ve come in legally in the past 50 years, or to children who have been born to them, into the pursuit of the American Dream. Little or no consideration is given to the fact that the America they came into \u2014 and in many ways the only America they\u2019ve known \u2014 was one shaken to the core by the perfect storm that more or less began when President Johnson launched the War on Poverty on January 8, 1964.\n\nThe War on Poverty itself has produced today over 80 federal welfare programs that cost about $1 trillion a year (the national GDP average of countries in the OECD, known as the rich man\u2019s club, is $1.4 trillion). The cost would matter less if the programs succeeded in easing Americans out of poverty and helping them become upwardly mobile. The problem, however, is that many of the poor become entangled in the safety net that was supposed to help them.\n\nThis happens because of effects that are built into the welfare programs, which can produce vicious cycles that increase the conditions that produce more poverty. Single moms who find a job or a man they want to marry, for example, can stand to lose 80 percent or 100 percent of their benefits. Social scientists talk of \u201cmarriage penalties\u201d and \u201ccliff effects.\u201d Marriage and a job are, however, the best ways out of the cycle of poverty.\n\nImmigrants don\u2019t come to this country seeking assistance from the government. Many who say that either do not understand the human condition or fear immigration for other reasons. Instead, immigrants come here searching for freedom and the American dream, at the very heart of which lies the promise of upward mobility.\n\nGovernment however foists welfare on immigrants and sees Hispanics as a prime target, and the Obama administration has been second to none in this area, going out of its way to tear down the inner pride and resolve to make it on their own that the vast majority of immigrants come with.\n\nOne of the worst examples of this \u2014 that we know of \u2014 was when the Obama administration was caught trying to entice Hispanics to go on food stamps by placing messages in Spanish-language radio advertisements that were made to sound like radio soap operas, or telenovelas.\n\nIn one of the USDA-produced soap operas, one of the protagonists said to a friend insisting that she sign up for food stamps, \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help. My husband earns enough to take care of us.\u201d Her friend mocks her, saying, \u201cWhen are you going to learn?\u201d Eventually the woman gives in and enrolls her family in food stamps.\n\nAnd who can forget Obamacare Girl, the poor woman whose face adorned the snake-bitten website of the Affordable Care Act until it was mercifully taken down? If she looked vaguely Hispanic to many of us it is because she was a model from Colombia who immigrated to this country legally. She teared up recounting her experience on ABC News.\n\nBut we know why the Obama administration chose a Hispanic face for the program. At last count, Hispanics were not signing up for Obamacare in great numbers, but the administration won\u2019t give up. Up on the HHS website one can find this:\n\nFor Latinos, like other racial and ethnic minorities, the law will address inequities and increase access to quality, affordable health coverage, invest in prevention and wellness, and give individuals and families more control over their care.\n\nThese are the messages that Hispanics who started coming into this country in great numbers after Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act and ended the Bracero guest-worker program received every day. Schools stopped teaching otherwise. As for the culture, all that those of us trying to decode this country got was TV shows like All in the Family or Maude, which presented a dark side of America.\n\nWe are enjoined (by the Bible and most major religions) to assume good intentions until we know otherwise, and thus we must resist the temptation to think of the past 50 years of the War on Poverty as an attempt to create liberals and Democratic voters. Rather, many liberals are outraged by injustice and believe the best way to close the gap between rich and poor is through government assistance.\n\nBut good thinking liberals must consider what has been the result of all these efforts. The illegitimacy rate of Hispanics is today a stratospheric 53 percent, and it rises every year. This is worrying because there\u2019s a near consensus that high out-of-wedlock rates are closely linked to all sorts of dysfunctions such as high truancy and drop-out rates, unemployment and incarceration.
