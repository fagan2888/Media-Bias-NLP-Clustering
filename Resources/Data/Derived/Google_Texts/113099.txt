While families across the Midwest were reeling from tornadoes and storm damage, President Obama spent four hours playing golf Sunday (his 151round of golf as president) and then took in a college basketball game at the University of Maryland. The Maryland Terrapins were taking on the Oregon State Beavers, coached by Michelle's older brother Craig Robinson. What a great day for the president! His two favorite sports in one day. What, me worry?

Even with all the golf and courtside seats ( and Air Force One for jaunts to the Costa del Sol and other upscale resorts), it's going to be a lot less fun being Obama than it used to be for the next three years. It is reported that President George W. Bush was counting the days until he could get out of the White House and return to Texas, following Hurricane Katrina. If Obama becomes more and more unpopular as Obamacare harms more and more people, Obama may find the truth behind the old saying, "Be careful what you wish for."

But the picture above would seem to indicate the President was hearing more boos than applause. Look at the expression on his face, especially the eyes.

The Obamas were greeted by applause and some boos as they took their seats near courtside at the Comcast Center
