Dannel P. Malloy\u2019s tax hikes and other budget proposals are approved by the legislature it\u2019s only a matter of time before community hospitals, like the one in Bristol, closes its doors.\n\nKurt Barwis, president and chief executive officer of Bristol Hospital, said he\u2019s losing about $200,000 per month despite all the efforts to make his hospital more efficient.\n\n\u201cI will literally default on my bonds within 12 months,\u201d Barwis said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. If all the cuts and taxes continue he estimated his hospital would close within three to five years.\n\nStephen Frayne, senior vice president of health policy for the Connecticut Hospital Association, said Malloy\u2019s two-year budget proposal increased the hospital tax from $235 million to $270 million a year. Hospitals want the legislature to go back to the \u201coriginal promise\u201d where the tax would be collected and all of it, not just some of it, would be redistributed to the hospitals.\n\nBut the tax isn\u2019t the only financial burden hospitals are dealing with. Hospital executives said they are also dealing with an increase in the Medicaid population at the same time as reimbursements haven\u2019t kept pace with the cost of care. Collectively, the changes included in Malloy\u2019s budget will cut funding to hospitals by $753 million, according to the Connecticut Hospital Association.\n\nMarna Borgstrom, president and chief executive officer of Yale New Haven Health System, said Malloy\u2019s budget is a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s concerned about the \u201cmassive cuts of Medicaid\u201d because the Yale New Haven Health System provided care last year to 30,000 Medicaid patients. She said there\u2019s this myth that once the state established the exchanges more patients would have private insurance. She said 80 percent of the people who receive insurance through the exchange were previously insured.\n\nShe said the charity care her organization has given away has grown from $32 million in 2010 to $92 million last year and that is during the period of implementation of the Affordable Care Act. She said during that same period bad debts have doubled from $22 million to $44 million.\n\n\u201cThe hospitals are not looking for subsidies or handouts,\u201d Borgstrom said. \u201cWe\u2019re simply looking to be paid fairly for the services we provide.\u201d\n\nBut no matter what hospital executives say Ben Barnes, Malloy\u2019s budget director, doesn\u2019t believe it.\n\nBarnes said it looks like most of the state\u2019s 28 hospitals are \u201cpretty successful financially.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a revenue report, which shows the only hospitals losing money in 2014 were Windham, New Milford, Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center, Milford, and John Dempsey. Some of the other hospitals have returns that would be the \u201cenvy of the for-profit world,\u201d according to Barnes. Based on the most recent information from the Office of Health Care Access the hospital industry made $663 million through Sept. 2014.\n\n\u201cThese guys are claiming poverty?\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThe profitability of hospitals has almost doubled and it\u2019s because of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBut hospitals executives disagree. They said Medicaid demand far exceeded the funding available to pay for that care.\n\nHospital executives said the Malloy administration in general has turned a deaf ear to their concerns.\n\nWhen he testified in front of the Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee about the governor\u2019s budget, Barnes was asked about why the administration would tax such a \u201cvirtuous\u201d business like the hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like why do you rob banks?\u201d Barnes said. \u201cIt\u2019s where the money is.\u201d\n\nPeter Karl, president and CEO of Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which operates Manchester Memorial and Rockville Hospital, called the comments \u201cinsulting and uncalled for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s just out there feeling as though he can throw stones at anyone he wants, but he\u2019s created a very adversarial relationship,\u201d Karl said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in him. I\u2019m disappointed in the governor whose turned a deaf ear to us.\u201d\n\nKarl said as a result layoffs have occurred and will continue to occur.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the shared sacrifice came in,\u201d Karl said. \u201cThere must be a plan somewhere in state government to close hospitals because there\u2019s no way these hospitals can survive going forward.\u201d\n\nHospitals are the largest employer in many of the towns and take care of the sickest people and \u201cif the governor and his staff doesn\u2019t care about that then hopefully he doesn\u2019t get sick in a town that\u2019s going to lose a hospital.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/hospital_executives_lobby_lawmakers_against_tax_hike_cuts/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "Executives from Connecticut\u2019s hospitals are asking lawmakers to \u201cpause\u201d and rethink the hospital tax and the promises that were made when it was first implemented.", "title": "Hospital Executives Lobby Lawmakers Against Tax Hike, Cuts | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re simply looking to be paid fairly for the services we provide.\u201dBut no matter what hospital executives say Ben Barnes, Malloy\u2019s budget director, doesn\u2019t believe it.\nStephen Frayne, senior vice president of health policy for the Connecticut Hospital Association, said Malloy\u2019s two-year budget proposal increased the hospital tax from $235 million to $270 million a year.\nCollectively, the changes included in Malloy\u2019s budget will cut funding to hospitals by $753 million, according to the Connecticut Hospital Association.\nBased on the most recent information from the Office of Health Care Access the hospital industry made $663 million through Sept. 2014.\nIf all the cuts and taxes continue he estimated his hospital would close within three to five years."}
