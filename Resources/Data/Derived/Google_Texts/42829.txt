CMS recently added another 68,000 payment records — totaling more than $200 million — to its Open Payments data set, bringing the total payment information from device and drug makers to physicians to $3.7 billion.

That includes payments to around 546,000 physicians and up to 1,360 teaching hospitals, according to CMS, which launched Open Secrets recently as part of an effort to provide more transparency for consumers in the healthcare market place.

The recently released data was “inadvertently excluded” from the release of payment data earlier this year, CMS said. Another 9,000 payment records were disputed by providers and weren’t included in the original data set, either.

With the recent data refresh, though, those records are now part of the Open Payments dataset, according to CMS. The effort is part of the Affordable Care Act’s Sunshine Provision, written by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
