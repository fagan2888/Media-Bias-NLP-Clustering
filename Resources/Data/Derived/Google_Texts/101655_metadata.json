The second and final run will begin at 12:45 p.m.\n\n\u201cThat was a pretty mediocre run for sure,\u201d said Ligety, who has been nearly unbeatable here in GS. \u201cI need to be skiing a lot cleaner the whole way down. Hopefully I can clean it up next run.\u201d\n\nAlexis Pinturault of France is in second place, 0.01 of a second behind Raich, and Marcel Hirscher of Austria is third, 0.01 of a second ahead of Ligety.\n\nLigety has won the last three World Cup GS races here and four of the last five.
