I was never waiting for marriage or \u201cthe right one.\u201d Mine is a case of bad luck. Wrong women, wrong times.\n\nMy story doesn\u2019t fit the profile you\u2019d expect. I\u2019m a comic in New York City, and I\u2019ve worked in and around this scene since I was 22. I\u2019m a good comic. Some nights, I\u2019m even great. You know what comedians do after shows? Drink, smoke or fuck. They do that because all three are easy to find after-hours, when our shifts end. I\u2019ve gone out with female audience members on occasion, but those nights somehow fall apart, and I end up at home playing \u201cSonic the Hedgehog.\u201d A comic once said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for even a mediocre comedian to not get laid doing this. And you\u2019re good and you\u2019ve never gotten laid. I don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d Nice to know: In one area of comedy, at least, I\u2019m a groundbreaker.\n\nSo why am I writing about all this? Because I know there are more guys out there like me. I was reminded of that last weekend, when 22-year-old Elliot Rodger went on a murderous rampage, saying that part of his rage was because he was still a virgin. He describes his existence as \u201ctorturous.\u201d I can relate to that feeling. Not only have I never had sex, but I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend. In my entire life. But I wish I could\u2019ve told that guy life without sex is only as torturous as you want it to be.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy. Every girl I\u2019ve ever cared for has rejected me. The last big rejection was April 29, 1999. I was in high school, and I was fairly certain this girl was interested in me, too. But her ex told her I was going around school saying she was already my girlfriend. The next day she told me to fuck off and never talk to her again in front of the entire school. OK, not the entire school. Just the drama club. And the kids in detention (chanting \u201cECW!\u201d because extreme wrestling was big up here and \u201cJerry! Jerry!\u201d because ahhh, the \u201990s). And the dance company. And the cheerleaders. So, you know, most of the school. When I got upset, as one does when his heart is broken in front of the senior class, a teacher grabbed the girl. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what happened last week in Columbine?\u201d Gee, thanks.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough for this girl. She also framed me for a bomb scare at my school. She also called my mom to let her know she only hung out with me because she felt bad for me. As the days turned to weeks and the months turned to years, I realized that perhaps I was wrong. She never did care about me. And in fact no one has.\n\nThis is the part that stings. It hurts like a motherfucker that no one has ever seen me as a boyfriend. But of course, the part people want to talk about is the sex. When you\u2019re a virgin this late in the game, it bothers people. They ask questions. They judge you. There is ridicule. As I got older, it presented a huge handicap with women. They saw me differently, I suppose, or didn\u2019t want the burden that came with being my first. There was just so much at stake. But the virgin part doesn\u2019t really bother me anymore. If I really wanted to just lose it, there are ways. I made a choice 10 years ago that if I had already waited this long, then I wanted my first time to be with someone who cares for me. A woman who does it because she wants to \u2014 not because she was paid to do it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I'm proof that normal guys manage without sex.
