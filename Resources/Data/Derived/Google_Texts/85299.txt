C. difficile infections are on the increase in Oregon, and are now the most common microbial infection contracted by hospital patients.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

A new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that almost a half million Americans suffered from C. difficile infections last year. 29,000 died.

The bacteria blooms in a person’s gut after they’ve taken a course of antibiotics that kills off all their beneficial bacteria. Doctor Michael Bell, with the National Center for Emerging Diseases, said the bacteria produces a toxin that causes inflammation and diarrhea.

“Once you have C. difficile it usually means your normal bacteria in your bowels are so damaged that returning to normal can be very difficult,” said Dr. Bell.

The Affordable Care Act requires hospitals to report healthcare-associated infections like C. difficile. Over two years, the rate of the infection in Oregon increased by eight percent.
