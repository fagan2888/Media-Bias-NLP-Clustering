The next step is a formal imposition of the sentence. Then, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons will decide where he\u2019ll be housed.\n\n___\n\nSENTENCING HEARING\n\nJudge George O\u2019Toole Jr. will schedule a sentencing hearing to formally impose the sentence. Survivors of the bombing will be given a chance to give victim impact statements. Tsarnaev also will be allowed to speak if he chooses. It\u2019s unclear how many victims the judge will allow to make statements.\n\n___\n\nPRISON ASSIGNMENT\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons could send Tsarnaev to the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which has a special unit for death row inmates and is where Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was executed. If he had been sentenced to life, he would likely have been sent to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. The Supermax prison is the highest-security prison in the country and houses some of the country\u2019s most notorious criminals, including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph and 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Death Sentence, What\u2019s Next for Boston Marathon bomber", "title": "After Death Sentence, What\u2019s Next for Boston Marathon bomber", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After Death Sentence, What\u2019s Next for Boston Marathon bomber", "title": "After Death Sentence, What\u2019s Next for Boston Marathon bomber", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/after_death_sentence_whats_next_for_boston_marathon_bomber/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/boston-marathon-bombing-photo-gallery.jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After Death Sentence, What\u2019s Next for Boston Marathon bomber", "title": "After Death Sentence, What\u2019s Next for Boston Marathon bomber", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/boston-marathon-bombing-photo-gallery.jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Denise Lavoie", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf578\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death by lethal injection, but he won\u2019t be executed for years \u2014 maybe decades \u2014 as the appeals process runs its course.\n___SENTENCING HEARINGJudge George O\u2019Toole Jr. will schedule a sentencing hearing to formally impose the sentence.\nThen, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons will decide where he\u2019ll be housed.\nThe next step is a formal imposition of the sentence.\n___PRISON ASSIGNMENTThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons could send Tsarnaev to the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which has a special unit for death row inmates and is where Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was executed."}
