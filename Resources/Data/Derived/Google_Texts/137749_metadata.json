What troubles me is that all this drama has a tendency to cause people\u2019s emotions to cloud their rational thought on good public policy formation.\n\n\n\nMany of us are sick and tired of politicians playing with our emotions to avoid the intelligent discussions needed to arrive at common sense solutions. At the very least, limit the drama and get to work for the common good of everyone.\n\n\n\nIs this a sign of a lack of competence or the actions of megalomaniacs? In either case, we are in danger of losing any semblance of true American democracy and our way of life.\n\nRobin Sanders\n\nAnn Arbor, Jan. 5, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Fox News Fan Club\n\nDear Editor:\n\n\n\nThe Metro Times used to be a decent rag, but has long since jumped the shark. It\u2019s now nothing more than a far-left propaganda mag filled with half-truths, outright lies and Hack Lessonbarely\u2019s weekly anti-GOP rants.\n\n\n\nWhy not do a story on the president\u2019s 50-plus scandals or the misery Obamacare is inflicting nationwide? Oh, yeah, because any truth that would put progressives in a less-than-perfect light will never see light as long as Lessonbarely has a say.\n\n\n\nCan you point out anything positive your rag has said about the GOP in the last year? Dan \u201cLet\u2019s kill all the Republicans\u201d Savage is the icing on the cake. In closing, go fuck yourselves you liberal idiots.\n\nPeter Weise\n\nBerkley, Jan. 3, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nForgotten Havens\n\nDear Editor:\n\nre: \u201cSaying Goodbye\u201d; [Cover Story; Jan. 1-7, 2014]\n\n\n\nI was astonished to find that you did not include the passing of Richie Havens in your list of notables who died in 2013. Havens was a fighter for justice and equality. He was a folksinger who started out performing in Detroit on a regular basis. He was well known for his marathon performance at Woodstock.\n\n\n\nHe sang songs about social injustice & covered many songs by Bob Dylan and other \u201cprotest\u201d singers. He will be remembered as one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time. He also covered the song \u201cBrother Brother\u201d by Marvin Gaye.\n\n\n\nPlease join me in remembering his legacy. May He Rest in Peace.\n\nPaula Stone\n\nFarmington Hills, Jan. 1, 2014\n\n\n\nThe Next Ebert?\n\nDear Editor:\n\nre: \u201cA Folked-Up World\u201d; [Film Review: Inside Llewyn Davis; Jan. 1-7, 2013]\n\n\n\nThis was one of the best film reviews I\u2019ve read in ages! Corey Hall really captured the intent of the film and illuminated it for me.\n\nElizabeth Zerwekh\n\nHuntington Woods, Jan. 4, 2014\n\n\n\nOh, Oh Domino\n\nDear Editor:\n\nre: \u201cThe Domino Effect\u201d; [Higher Ground; Jan. 1-7, 2014]\n\n\n\nHow many countries in Central or South America will decriminalize possession of marijuana this year? I read your excellent piece about, among many things, the decriminalization in Uruguay and I wonder will any other countries follow? I do not mean countries who already have decriminalized, in different ways, but who are going to do it, nationwide, during this time.\n\nJenny Maria Nilsson\n\nStockholm, Sweden, Jan. 4, 2014", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "Oh, the Drama Dear Editor: &nbsp; One only has to observe the psychological manipulation of mudslinging, race-baiting, inciting class warfare and the liberal vs. conservative...", "title": "Letters About 'Liberal Idiots,' Richie Havens And More | Feedback | Detroit Metro Times", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit Metro Times", "description": "Oh, the Drama Dear Editor: &nbsp; One only has to observe the psychological manipulation of mudslinging, race-baiting, inciting class warfare and the liberal vs. conservative...", "title": "Letters About 'Liberal Idiots,' Richie Havens And More", "url": "http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/letters-about-liberal-idiots-richie-havens-and-more/Content?oid=2143707", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/letters-about-liberal-idiots-richie-hav/u/slideshow/2166348/1613406.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/letters-about-liberal-idiots-richie-hav/u/slideshow/2166348/1613406.jpg"}, "description": "Oh, the Drama Dear Editor: &nbsp; One only has to observe the psychological manipulation of mudslinging, race-baiting, inciting class warfare and the liberal vs. conservative...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Letters About 'Liberal Idiots,' Richie Havens And More"}, "oid": 2143707, "fb": {"app_id": 310950202407744}, "keywords": "News, Blog, Culture, Dining, Events", "google-site-verification": "06A5Yh5mu5xlqSkqBOzGlxA6P_yfmltTp1l0ssgpOBk", "thumbnail": "http://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/letters-about-liberal-idiots-richie-hav/u/slideshow/2166348/1613406.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "news, blog, culture, dining, events"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6005\"", "article_summary": "Peter WeiseBerkley, Jan. 3, 2014Forgotten HavensDear Editor:re: \u201cSaying Goodbye\u201d; [Cover Story; Jan. 1-7, 2014]I was astonished to find that you did not include the passing of Richie Havens in your list of notables who died in 2013.\nDear Editor:re: \u201cA Folked-Up World\u201d; [Film Review: Inside Llewyn Davis; Jan. 1-7, 2013]This was one of the best film reviews I\u2019ve read in ages!\nI read your excellent piece about, among many things, the decriminalization in Uruguay and I wonder will any other countries follow?\nIt\u2019s now nothing more than a far-left propaganda mag filled with half-truths, outright lies and Hack Lessonbarely\u2019s weekly anti-GOP rants.\nIn either case, we are in danger of losing any semblance of true American democracy and our way of life."}
