On Thursday, President Barack Obama appeared at a college in Orlando, Fla., to pressure Congress into passing legislation aimed at easing the burden on women in the workforce. Flanked by a female audience members, the president said that women deserve paid sick days and equal pay with men. “If men were having babies, we’d have different policies,” he observed.

“Women are still earning just 77 cents on every dollar that a man does,” Obama said. “Women with college degrees may earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career than a man at the same educational level, and that’s wrong.”

“This isn’t 1958,” he added. “It’s 2014.” He said that he was pressuring Republicans to support The Paycheck Fairness Act, which he said they continue to block. “We’ve got to get them to change their minds and join us in this century because a woman deserves equal pay for equal work,” Obama said to applause.

“A woman deserves to take a day off to care for a sick child or a parent without running into hardship,” the president continued. “A woman deserves work place policies that protect her right to have a baby without losing her job.”

“It’s pretty clear that, you know, if men were having babies, we’d have different policies,” Obama said. “Right?”
