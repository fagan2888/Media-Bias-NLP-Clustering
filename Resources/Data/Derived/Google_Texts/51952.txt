Fox News host Sean Hannity had U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., on his show to discuss the recent grand jury decisions regarding Michael Brown and Eric Garner and the appearance quickly turned into a shout-fest.

Norton readily acknowledged that she has not reviewed the transcripts of the grand jury testimony and other evidence, prompting Hannity to ask why she is pushing “a narrative that has been proven false.”

“The truth isn’t your concern?” he asked.

“I haven’t read the transcript because my interest is not in what happened, my interest is in what should happen!” Norton incredulously fired back, adding that she is looking to move forward.

@EleanorNorton @seanhannity @FoxNews Lady, way to show your ass. Evidence does not matter while your “teaching law enforcement a lesson”? — H.G. Pennypacker (@HG_Pennypacker) December 5, 2014
