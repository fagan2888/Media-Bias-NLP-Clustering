Written by center-right talk radio host John Batchelor, the critique reads as one Republican\u2019s strong rebuke of Emanuel, whose take-no-prisoners approach to politics had won him few friends on the other side of the aisle.\n\nBut behind Batchelor\u2019s work at the Beast was someone who did have an axe to grind with Rahmbo. For Sid \u2018Vicious\u2019 Blumenthal edited Batchelor\u2019s work in 2009 and 2010, the radio talker confirmed to The Daily Caller.\n\nThe Daily Beast was one of Blumenthal\u2019s many side projects during Clinton\u2019s State Department tenure. Buzzfeed reported last June that Blumenthal served as a recruiter in the early days of the website, which was founded by Tina Brown, his former boss at The New Yorker. And though Blumenthal worked under-the-radar \u2014 his name never appeared on the Daily Beast\u2019s masthead \u2014 he also helped shape political content for the site, editing and commissioning articles.\n\nMany of the articles Blumenthal commissioned happened to serve his own political and personal purposes. As Buzzfeed reported, Blumenthal edited two articles written by Harry Siegel, now a columnist at The New York Daily News, that were critical of Caroline Kennedy, who in late 2008 was being considered to replace Clinton as Senator from New York. Siegel referred to Kennedy as a \u201cpuppet\u201d and called her potential run for the U.S. Senate an \u201cinsult.\u201d\n\nBatchelor, too, wrote a piece slamming Kennedy. In \u201cIs Caroline Entitled To The Senate?\u201d Batchelor argued that Kennedy\u2019s \u201ccelebrity and history are not entitlements to high office.\u201d The hit pieces were favorable to Clinton \u2014 and Blumenthal, by extension \u2014 because, the thinking went, another Senator Kennedy would pose a long-term threat to Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes.\n\nHad Blumenthal\u2019s byline graced the attacks, they would have been much easier to dismiss as pure partisan hackery. But if penned by someone with no direct connection to Clinton, they carried the appearance of disinterested, objective political analysis.\n\nAt the same time he was directing favorable Clinton coverage, Blumenthal, who served as an aide in the Bill Clinton White House, also worked for the Clinton Foundation, where he was paid a reported $10,000 salary each month. He earned a similar amount advising American Bridge and Media Matters, two groups operated by Clinton ally David Brock.\n\nThe mysterious Blumenthal also frequently sent political gossip, memos, and intelligence reports to Hillary Clinton on her personal email account. Much of the information \u2014 including that which he passed along about Libya \u2014 was gleaned from Blumenthal\u2019s vast network of sources in the intelligence community.\n\nThe Libya work was another Blumenthal side gig. He and former CIA operative Tyler Drumheller advised Osprey Global Solutions, a private defense contractor that sought business in post-Gaddafi Libya.\n\nA State Department post would have also graced Blumenthal\u2019s resume were it not for Emanuel, who currently serves as mayor of Chicago. Clinton had hoped to bring her friend and former presidential campaign operative to the State Department as an adviser. But as The Times reported in its 2009 article, Emanuel vetoed the idea because of Blumenthal\u2019s underhanded anti-Obama campaign tactics during the 2008 Democratic primaries.\n\nThe article described Blumenthal \u2014 who circulated false rumors about Obama to his journalism friends \u2014 as a polarizing figure who threatened to sow \u201cdissension and drama in the ranks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel bad for Sid,\u201d is how Clinton responded to her chief of staff Cheryl Mills after reading The Times piece.\n\nA week after the article was published, The Daily Beast published an item by Batchelor entitled \u201cHow Rahm Is Reviving The GOP.\u201d In it, Batchelor, whose eponymous radio show airs seven nights a week across the U.S., criticized Emanuel\u2019s \u201ctalents for bullying, whimsical favoritism, cheerful power-grabbing, and self-congratulatory earthiness.\u201d\n\nThe next month, \u201cRahm\u2019s Historic Stupidity\u201d appeared with Batchelor\u2019s name printed at the top. That article took Emanuel to task for being ignorant to the nature of Republican opposition to President Obama.\n\nSo were the anti-Rahm articles planted by a vengeful Sid Vicious? Batchelor says he doesn\u2019t remember.\n\n\u201cAncient history,\u201d he told TheDC. \u201cI have no memory of what or how, other than the Beast record in print.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Blumenthal] is a gentlemen and scholar and friend,\u201d the radio host added.\n\nBut one of Batchelor\u2019s articles contains a seemingly random digression that also took a stab at one of Blumenthal\u2019s numerous mortal enemies.\n\n\u201cRahm\u2019s Historic Stupidity\u201d launched into an attack on Richard Mellon Scaife, the now-dead heir to the Mellon family banking fortune who commissioned numerous articles at The American Spectator in the 1990s investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s shady dealings.\n\nBatchelor described Scaife \u2014 who became personal friends with Bill Clinton after he left office \u2014 as a \u201csilver-spoon-born playboy\u201d who was \u201ctossed out of Yale for drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no record of Scaife having stable partisan beliefs other [sic] his funding of a hatchery of Clinton-bashers that produced the vile theory that Bill and Hillary Clinton were responsible for suicide Vincent Foster\u2019s death,\u201d Batchelor wrote.\n\nTheDC learned of the Blumenthal-Batchelor connection from a Sept. 3, 2010 email contained in the State Department\u2019s most recent release of Clinton emails. That memo shows Blumenthal referring Clinton to a Batchelor article entitled \u201cThe GOP\u2019s Oompa-Loompa.\u201d\n\nThe piece poked fun at John Boehner, who was set to take over as Speaker of the House, for his orange-colored skin. Batchelor also suggested that Boehner was an \u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201chack on the make.\u201d Blumenthal told Clinton in the email that Batchelor wrote the article based \u201con a subject I suggested to him.\u201d It is one of many articles Blumenthal cited in his emails with Clinton as having planted or commissioned.\n\nBatchelor confirmed to TheDC on Twitter that Blumenthal had suggested the article. He went further by stating that Blumenthal had been his editor at the Daily Beast in 2009 and 2010. In a follow-up email he said that he could not recall the exact dates that he worked under Blumenthal.\n\nThough Batchelor is unable to say what other items Blumenthal may have pitched him, the radio host\u2019s body of work carries a strong anti-Emanuel, anti-Republican, and pro-Clinton tone.\n\n\u201cThe GOP Self-Destructs,\u201d \u201cGOP Still Has No Chance,\u201d and \u201cThe Tea Party\u2019s Whiny Takeover\u201d are as critical of conservatives as their titles suggest.\n\nIs Sidney Blumenthal A Major Liability For Hillary Clinton?
