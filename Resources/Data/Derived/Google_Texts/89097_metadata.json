For her, it\u2019s everything from how food trucks and doughnuts market themselves to efforts made by healthcare companies to help potential customers navigate the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople are rethinking, on a range of scales of businesses, how to connect\u201d with customers, she said.\n\nOne design process that is seeping into popular consciousness is prototyping, and particularly rapid prototyping. \u201cA prototype should be a rough draft, ugly mockup,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cIt does not have to be perfect and gilded in gold. Pop-up shops are a great way to prototype services and experiences.\u201d\n\nAs Google X cofounder Tom Chi put it during Fosterly\u2019s Collaborate conference earlier this year, \u201cDoing is the best type of thinking. \u2026 Thinking is the worst way to think.\u201d That\u2019s why he\u2019s encouraging companies to spend less time planning and more time fiddling with a prototype \u2014 a lesson he learned from his experience with the Google Glass.\n\nBut rapid prototyping can be extended to more or less any aspect of life.\n\nHear Dale try it out: \u201c[Some coffee shops] have those signs on the table like, no laptop use between 1:17 and 4:19 p.m.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this tension between coffee shop owners who want to sell coffee and people who go to them who want to go work out in public.\u201d\n\nHis solution: \u201cIf they just adjusted their way of thinking about their product,\u201d Dale said. \u201cThere\u2019s a way that this can be solved where everyone doesn\u2019t feel weird anymore.\u201d\n\nListen below, download the episode or subscribe to the Technical.ly Podcast on iTunes or Stitcher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n-30-", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Technical.ly DC", "description": "In this month's Technical.ly Podcast, we discuss design thinking and the growing phenomenon of rapid prototyping.", "title": "Where rapid prototyping might take you [Technical.ly Podcast] - Technical.ly DC", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://technical.ly/dc/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/03/proto-e1426001136875.jpg", "height": 803}, "url": "http://technical.ly/dc/2015/03/10/rapid-prototyping-design-thinking-technical-ly-podcast/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Creative", "tag": "Technical.ly Podcast", "published_time": "2015-03-10T11:26:05-04:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 1515786778663856, "app_id": 1011285523}, "twitter": {"domain": "Technical.ly DC", "description": "In this month's Technical.ly Podcast, we discuss design thinking and the growing phenomenon of rapid prototyping.", "title": "Where rapid prototyping might take you [Technical.ly Podcast]", "url": "http://technical.ly/dc/2015/03/10/rapid-prototyping-design-thinking-technical-ly-podcast/", "image": "http://technical.ly/dc/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/03/proto-400x268.jpg", "creator": "@lalitaclozel", "site": "@technicallydc", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=0.96,width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9df9\"", "article_summary": "This month\u2019s Technical.ly Podcast on design thinking escalated fast; we got our lead reporter in Brooklyn, Brady Dale, to perform some rapid prototyping on the mic.\nOne design process that is seeping into popular consciousness is prototyping, and particularly rapid prototyping.\nBut rapid prototyping can be extended to more or less any aspect of life.\nFirst, we heard from Natalie Nixon, who runs an MBA program at Philadelphia University focused on design thinking.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way that this can be solved where everyone doesn\u2019t feel weird anymore.\u201dListen below, download the episode or subscribe to the Technical.ly Podcast on iTunes or Stitcher."}
