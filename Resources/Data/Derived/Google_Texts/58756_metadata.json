According to Freeland, Drunktown is foremost a human story that transcends race and nationality. It just happens to be set in a Native town.\n\n\u201cYou have this film that you create, and you kind of set it loose in the world. And, you have no idea how people are going to react; whether they accept it or reject it. It's been an amazing ride because people have responded well,\u201d says Freeland.\n\nThough the film has been on a world tour, Freeland admits she still feels closest to the responses on her home turf in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest of all these film screenings was in Gallup, in my hometown, in front of a sold-out crowd. The Mayor attended and the fact that people laughed, cried and enjoyed the film\u2026 That means the world to me. That's why you do this, to make something that people can relate to.\"\n\nFreeland has long acknowledged the criticism of the film's title, Drunktown.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Gallup, which was notorious for its high rate of alcoholism. When ABC\u2019s 20/20 came to my hometown they did a segment called Drunktown, U.S.A. That experience always stuck with me.\n\n\u201cYou take screen-writing in college and they teach you to write what you know. I started re-visiting all this stuff from growing up and I thought, 'What if we could show another side of Drunktown? What if we were able to show how diverse this place is, and how dynamic all these people are?'\n\n\"One of the things that were very important for me was to try to tell the best possible story. That meant being as honest and true to the characters as I could be while portraying things that could be seen in a negative light. It lets you appreciate the positive when it does come around. Any character, in any story, has to go through some kind of change. They have to have an arc. If the character is the same at the beginning of the story as they are at the end of the story\u2026 What's the point?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main point overall,\u201d says Freeland, \u201cis that every film has to have a conflict. Any story needs to have conflict in order to have resolution at the end. That said, I didn't want a film that had a tragic ending. That would have been too easy. I also, however, didn\u2019t want to have an ending where everyone lives happily ever after. That would have not been honest to the circumstances. It was really about finding a balance between the two, and leaving the audience with a sense of hope.\"\n\nThough her film has been well-received all over the world, Freeland keeps her success in perspective. \"We're fortunate to have screened a lot of festivals and we were fortunate enough to be selected for the Sundance Film Festival, but we're still trying to get distribution.\u201d\n\nFreeland has just finished directing a web series called Her Story (http://herstoryshow.com/) that \u2018looks inside the dating lives of trans & queer women as they navigate the intersections of desire & identity\u2019 and is slated to direct another feature in 2016 entitled, Deidra and Laney Rob a Train.\n\nFuture screenings and updates on Drunktown\u2019s Finest can be found at: www.drunktownsfinest.com and on their Facebook page at: www.facebook.com/drunktown.movie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Native Film - Drunktown's Finest, Hailed In Europe!
