In Sonic Youth, Gordon was aloof, distant, beautiful and strange. Her vocals combined a guttural and ethereal quality that both anchored the band and shot them off into some kind of experimental-amateur netherland that either grated or sent chills down the spine.\n\nNow that Gordon and Thurston Moore \u2014 the bohemian rock world\u2019s it couple for decades \u2014 have broken up and the sadly familiar story of their demise has come out, Gordon has written \u201cGirl in a Band.\u201d There are cameos by Danny Elfman, Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain, Lydia Lunch and some less famous figures worth discovering, but it\u2019s all filtered through Gordon\u2019s slightly removed, analytical take on things. She writes as she sings, in a down-to-earth yet removed way, as if she\u2019s experiencing it all by satellite transmission.\n\nIt\u2019s a memoir that moves from L.A.\u2019s dreamy, rangy canyon-rock scene to the New York\u2019s darker, Lower East Side art world. In it, she offers slivers of memories about her life in pre-punk Los Angeles and hitting New York\u2019s art/music scene as a young person (hard to say \u201cing\u00e9nue\u201d in the case of this artist \u2014 it seems she never fit that role). She also talks about the strangeness of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll fame for a woman who doesn\u2019t even consider herself a musician.\n\nGordon spoke to us from L.A.\u2019s Silver Lake neighborhood, about family, art and self-exposure.\n\nI know that you\u2019ve been through a really tough time; a lot of people would retreat into a more solitary life but you decided to write a memoir that\u2019s extremely personal and you\u2019re exposing a lot. Why did it seem like the right time?\n\nWell, people were starting to ask, for one thing. I think because the Patti Smith book did so well, people started looking for what could be next. I think that was a surprising book for a lot of people. I don\u2019t know. It just seemed like I was kind of in a thinking mode. Looking back over my life to see how I got where I was. It\u2019s just useful for me to actually write to figure out how I\u2019m feeling or thinking about anything.\n\nDid you hesitate at all about putting it out there, though? Was there ever a concern for you?\n\nI hesitated about doing such a conventional book. At first, I thought I would just make one copy to sell for a lot of money and some art context, but it was just kind of a way to begin again. Little bits of it were coming out in different ways so the editor said, Well, this is an opportunity to get in front of that. It\u2019s just a part of the story. It\u2019s not the whole story. It just got me thinking about my whole life, really.\n\nDid you find that it was helpful to you? When it was done, did you feel like you\u2019d been on a journey? Did you feel like you understood yourself more and what you\u2019d been through?\n\nYeah, I guess so. Instead of just half-knowing things about yourself and just facing the different phases of your life and making peace with them in a certain way.\n\nI\u2019m wondering about your decision to begin with the end. That\u2019s a really dramatic way to begin and it\u2019s really painful to read. I wonder why you wanted to start there?\n\nI think so I could kind of get on with the rest of the story. It seems like that\u2019s what people wanted to hear and I wanted to sort of get it over with and then satisfy that part of them. It\u2019s just a way to kind of be able to move past it. It just seemed like a dramatically good thing to do.\n\nIt\u2019s a really dramatic way to begin but it seems like it was a really incredibly painful time, too. You talk at the beginning about how people reacted to the breakup. People took it really personally. I think a lot of people felt like they had grown up with you guys as almost like this model of what could be done even in a bohemian relationship with this great band that seemed to just keep putting out great records for decades. How did that impact you when people responded that way? Did it in some way help you to grieve with these people or did it make it worse?\n\nNo. It was surprising how many people cared about the band or us, for one thing. We have a niche audience. It wasn\u2019t like we really felt like we were that famous or that much in the public. That\u2019s how I was used to thinking of us, so that was surprising. It kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t say that it was comforting. It made me incredibly self-conscious. I\u2019m the kind of person that when someone gives me sympathy, it makes me cry more. But I can appreciate it. I can appreciate it more now. I also just feel like when I went out and starting playing music again, people were pretty supportive. They weren\u2019t like yelling for Sonic Youth songs and things like that.\n\nI want to talk about music a little bit. There\u2019s one part in the book at the beginning and I think you reiterate it later one, that you don\u2019t consider yourself a musician, which really surprised me that you said that and that you consider yourself kind of a rock star in small letters?\n\nLowercase rock star.\n\nFor a lot of people, you\u2019re the center of the one of the best bands to come out of the \u201980s. I wonder how you can say that \u2014 that you don\u2019t think of yourself as a musician. What do you think of yourself as being?\n\nReally a visual artist. That\u2019s what I grew up thinking I would be my whole life. With my training. The music thing I just sort of fell into. I think that for a lot of people who were more \u2013. Even though Sonic Youth is a post-punk band, punk rock kind of created the situation, almost like an intervention or an opening in the culture like there hadn\u2019t really been since the \u201960s. It was kind of rebelling against the status quo, so a lot of people I think who got involved with music weren\u2019t necessarily musicians, you know what I mean? It wasn\u2019t about playing an instrument. That\u2019s basically why I don\u2019t think of myself as a musician. It wasn\u2019t about learning how to play your instrument well. I have so much respect for musicians who are like that, who really actually know how to play, but I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t relate to that. I have a technique of not playing \u2014 never learning how to play too well. It\u2019s a technique unto itself.\n\nYou talked about authenticity when you were talking about your voice \u2014 that it\u2019s more about authenticity and then I think there was a jazz reference? You talked about moving into the negative spaces\u2026\n\nYeah, something like that. Appreciating space as much as \u2014 yeah.\n\nI want to talk about all your influences. You brushed up against Los Angeles in the 1960s, your father\u2019s jazz collection was important to you, the East Village art world, the experimental music world. Can you talk about some artists outside of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll who had a strong impact on you as somebody in a band?\n\nWhat do you mean? Other people outside rock \u2018n\u2019 roll?\n\nSomebody who is outside rock \u2018n\u2019 roll who had an impact on the work that you did in the band.\n\nThe artist Dan Graham influenced me in different ways. He turned me onto Greil Marcus\u2019 \u201cMystery Train.\u201d That book was really influential and I think I was inspired to write some lyrics like \u201cBrother James\u201d from that. Reading about Jim Morrison and Robert Johnson. I started playing music as an art because Dan Graham had this performance piece called \u201cMirror Audience Performance\u201d [\u201cPerformer/Audience/Mirror\u201d] where he would stand in front of this huge mirror that reflected the audience and he would describe the audience looking at him. Then he would turn around and describe himself very self-consciously in the mirror with the audience looking at him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sonic Youth star corrects the record: Why she doesn't see herself as a musician, a rock star or a New Yorker", "author": "Sara Scribner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sonic Youth star corrects the record: Why she doesn't see herself as a musician, a rock star or a New Yorker", "title": "Kim Gordon on life after Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore: \u201cIt was surprising how many people cared about the band or us\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/kim_gordon_on_life_after_sonic_youth_thurston_moore_it_was_surprising_how_many_people_cared_about_the_band_or_us/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/kim_gordon2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sonic Youth star corrects the record: Why she doesn't see herself as a musician, a rock star or a New Yorker", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/kim_gordon2.jpg", "title": "Kim Gordon on life after Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore: \u201cIt was surprising how many people cared about the band or us\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Kim Gordon on life after Sonic Youth, Thurston Moore: \u201cIt was surprising how many people cared about the band or us\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Courtney Love, Editor's Picks, Fleetwood Mac, Greil Marcus, Jim Morrison, kim gordon, Kurt Cobain, nirvana, sonic youth, thurston moore", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8fe\"", "article_summary": "It just got me thinking about my whole life, really.\nI wonder how you can say that \u2014 that you don\u2019t think of yourself as a musician.\nEven though Sonic Youth is a post-punk band, punk rock kind of created the situation, almost like an intervention or an opening in the culture like there hadn\u2019t really been since the \u201960s.\nThat\u2019s basically why I don\u2019t think of myself as a musician.\nIt\u2019s a really dramatic way to begin but it seems like it was a really incredibly painful time, too."}
