There has been a \u201cDo Not Eat\u201d fish advisory via the Washington and Oregon state health departments since the summer of 2013 for the area around the Bradford Island Cleanup site. The advisory followed years of failed cleanup efforts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which used the island as a dumping ground for four decades.\n\nBradford Island and its surrounding area is part of the Yakama Nation\u2019s usual and accustomed area. It\u2019s a historic fishing site for Yakama tribal members. And notably, the Yakama Nation\u2019s largest archeological collection comes from the island area. Even so, the court action alleges, the Corps excluded the tribe from cleanup efforts.\n\nThe site qualifies as a Superfund site, \u201cbut USACE has used authorities under an Executive Order to conduct the cleanup,\u201d Rose Longoria, Superfund Coordinator with the Yakama Nation Fisheries told Indian Country Today Media Network.\n\nThe Corps removed electrical debris and some contaminated sediment from the river in 2002, and removed 0.83 acre of highly contaminated sediments from the same area in October 2007. The Corps has several options to continue cleaning up the island. A feasibility study is expected to be completed in 2015.\n\nThe island and surrounding area is contaminated with toxic waste materials from the operation of the dam. The Corps disposed of hazardous waste on the island and directly into the river from 1942 to 1982.\n\nThe waste released hazardous substances \u201clike petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides,\u201d Longoria said, resulting in \u201chighly toxic, unhealthy fish\u201d that carry the highest PCB concentrations in the region.\n\n\u201cWorking together to clean up the Columbia River is key to a clean and productive river that sustains the cultural practices of Yakama members,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cIt is disappointing that we are going to court to compel the United States to partner with the tribe.\u201d\n\nA Corps spokesperson said they had not seen the lawsuit, and had no comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Yakama Nation is suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for allegedly excluding the tribe from cleanup input at the Bradford Island Superfund site on the Columbia River.Yakama Nation sues U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for allegedly excluding it from cleanup plans at Branford Island Superfund site in WA.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/22/yakama-nation-sues-army-corps-engineers-columbia-river-superfund-site-cleanup-158412", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bradford_island-or_dept_of_environmental_quality.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Yakama Nation Sues Army Corps of Engineers in Columbia River Superfund Site Cleanup"}, "abstract": "Yakama Nation sues U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for allegedly excluding it from cleanup plans at Branford Island Superfund site in WA.", "dc": {"title": "Yakama Nation Sues Army Corps of Engineers in Columbia River Superfund Site Cleanup"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/22/yakama-nation-sues-army-corps-engineers-columbia-river-superfund-site-cleanup-158412", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Yakama Nation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Superfund, Superfund Sites, Columbia River,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-12-22T15:30-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Yakama Nation Sues Army Corps of Engineers in Columbia River Superfund Site Cleanup"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6268\"", "article_summary": "The Yakama Nation is suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for allegedly excluding the tribe from cleanup input at the Bradford Island Superfund site on the Columbia River.\n\u201cThe Yakama Nation has a key role in cleanup and had numerous meetings with the Corps, but they still fail to meaningfully include the Yakama Nation in Bradford Island cleanup efforts,\u201d Gerald Lewis, Yakama Nation Tribal Councilman said in a statement about the action filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon on December 10.\nIt\u2019s a historic fishing site for Yakama tribal members.\nThe site qualifies as a Superfund site, \u201cbut USACE has used authorities under an Executive Order to conduct the cleanup,\u201d Rose Longoria, Superfund Coordinator with the Yakama Nation Fisheries told Indian Country Today Media Network.\nThere has been a \u201cDo Not Eat\u201d fish advisory via the Washington and Oregon state health departments since the summer of 2013 for the area around the Bradford Island Cleanup site."}
