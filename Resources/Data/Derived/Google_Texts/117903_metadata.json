People like Wilberforce who persisted for years because of his faith and because of his love for people. So no liberal is going to win a debate that big government freed the slaves.\u201d\n\nDeMint continued, \u201cIn fact, it was Abraham Lincoln, the very first Republican, who took this on as a cause and a lot of it was based on a love in his heart that comes from God.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation head also denounced the presentation of Obamacare as something written to help uninsured or lower-income Americans.\n\n\u201cObamacare was not written to help the uninsured, it was written by the big insurance companies and big hospitals to force people into the health insurance market who didn\u2019t want to be; to enrich \u2018the bigs.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said that many Americans have simply been force-fed falsehoods about the benefits of liberal ideologies, saying that some in left-wing circles believe that \u201cthe only way to help people is to control them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ideas as conservatives unite the country, but they have not been presented in a positive way.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare is not going to help the little guy. They wrote this thing to force a lot of young, healthy people to buy insurance so it would be less expensive for older, more infirmed people. You cannot have one central government determining the healthcare needs of over 300 million Americans,\u201d said DeMint.\n\nHe said that many young Americans will eventually realize that large student loans and increased costs of health care are a by-product of excessive government intervention into Americans\u2019 lives. He noted that big government was \u201cenriching the banks\u201d who are holding up massive student loan debts against young Americans.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., and their stated mission is to \u201cformulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The head of the Heritage Foundation, Jim DeMint, ridiculed big government policies in the U.S. and reiterated that \u201cthe little guy\u201d representing the American people should take the power back from \u201cthe bigs\u201d controlling the country\u2019s...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/04/10/demint-big-government-did-not-free-the-slaves/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/151981816.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/151981816.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1039}, "type": "article", "description": "The head of the Heritage Foundation, Jim DeMint, ridiculed big government policies in the U.S. and reiterated that \u201cthe little guy\u201d representing the American people should take the power back from \u201cthe bigs\u201d controlling the country\u2019s government, health care and corporations.", "title": "DeMint: Big Government Did Not Free The Slaves"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/151981816.jpg?w=1500", "description": "The head of the Heritage Foundation, Jim DeMint, ridiculed big government policies in the U.S. and reiterated that \u201cthe little guy\u201d representing the American people should take the power back from \u201cthe bigs\u201d controlling the country\u2019s government, health care and corporations.", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "DeMint: Big Government Did Not Free The Slaves"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "cbs washington, politics, big government, conservative, falling in love with america again, former south carolina senator, heritage foundation president jim demint, misconceptions, slavery, the little guy, the slaves, the white house", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "big government, conservative, falling in love with america again, former south carolina senator, heritage foundation president jim demint, misconceptions, slavery, the little guy, the slaves, the white house"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc85\"", "article_summary": "He noted that big government was \u201cenriching the banks\u201d who are holding up massive student loan debts against young Americans.\n\u201cThere is this misconception that big government is going to help the little guy,\u201d said DeMint.\n\u201cBut a lot of the move to free the slaves came from the people, it did not come from the federal government.\nHe said that many young Americans will eventually realize that large student loans and increased costs of health care are a by-product of excessive government intervention into Americans\u2019 lives.\n\u201cWell the reason that the slaves were eventually freed was the Constitution, it was like the conscience of the American people,\u201d said DeMint."}
