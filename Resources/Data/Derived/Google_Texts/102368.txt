UPDATE: Juwan Thompson will not be available to play Sunday. Jeremy Stewart will be the third running back for the Broncos.

For the first time since C.J. Anderson’s breakout performance in Game 9 at Oakland, the Broncos will have their full complement of running backs for their divisional playoff Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts.

Anderson, Ronnie Hillman and Juwan Thompson will all dress to give the Broncos a one-two-three running punch against the Colts. Expect the No. 1 back, Anderson, to get the bulk of the carries.

Hillman suffered a Lisfranc foot sprain during that Nov. 9 game against Oakland and didn’t return until the season finale against the Raiders, on Dec. 28 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Thompson played every game this season until the final against the Raiders, when he rested his sore hip and knee.

All three are ready for the game against the Colts.
