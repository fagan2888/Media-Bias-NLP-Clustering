They would like to see the quality measures changed this year.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\"The program is well intentioned; they were picking measures that seemed right, on the surface. They should be willing to fix it,\" he said.\n\nCMS instituted the HAC Reduction Program in fiscal year 2015, to reduce payments to the lowest-performing hospitals.\n\nOf the 3,284 hospitals participating in the HAC program, 721, or 22 percent, were penalized, according to JAMA.\n\nThe JAMA authors created an eight-point hospital quality summary score using hospital characteristics related to volume, accreditations, and offering of advanced care services.\n\nHospitals with higher hospital quality summary scores had significantly better performance on nine of 10 publicly reported measures compared with hospitals that had lower quality scores, according to the study.\n\nHowever, hospitals with the highest quality score were penalized more more often than hospitals with the lowest quality score, JAMA stated.\n\nThe study's data was obtained from CMS' Hospital Compare, the 2014 American Hospital Association Annual Survey and FY2015 Medicare Impact File.\n\nThe findings suggest CMS should reconsider how it assesses hospital penalties to ensure it is achieving the intended goal, the study's authors stated. They questioned whether the program accurately measures quality and fairly penalizes hospitals.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospital-acquired-infection-measures-flawed-study-authors-say-top-tier-hospitals-see-most-fines", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/surgical-supplies-feature_4.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Accredited hospitals that offer advanced services, are major teaching institutions and have better performance and outcome measures are penalized more frequently than other providers for hospital-acquired conditions, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association that cl", "title": "Hospital-acquired infection measures flawed, study authors say, as top-tier hospitals see most fines"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/surgical-supplies-feature_4.gif"}, "description": "Accredited hospitals that offer advanced services, are major teaching institutions and have better performance and outcome measures are penalized more frequently than other providers for hospital-acquired conditions, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association that cl", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hospital-acquired infection measures flawed, study authors say, as top-tier hospitals see most fines"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Accredited hospitals that offer advanced services, are major teaching institutions and have better performance and outcome measures are penalized more frequently than other providers for hospital-acquired conditions, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association that claims to have exposed a major flaw with program.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The JAMA authors created an eight-point hospital quality summary score using hospital characteristics related to volume, accreditations, and offering of advanced care services.\nThey questioned whether the program accurately measures quality and fairly penalizes hospitals.\nThey would like to see the quality measures changed this year.\nOf the 3,284 hospitals participating in the HAC program, 721, or 22 percent, were penalized, according to JAMA.\nHospitals with higher hospital quality summary scores had significantly better performance on nine of 10 publicly reported measures compared with hospitals that had lower quality scores, according to the study."}
