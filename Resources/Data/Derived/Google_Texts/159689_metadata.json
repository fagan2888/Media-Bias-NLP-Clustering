As Aneesh Chopra, the White House\u2019s former chief technology officer, put it in a guest post for VentureBeat, \u201cThe real story, likely to play out over the coming months, will be its rise as a new platform for innovation \u2013 one that will lead to the creation of new private sector services to improve our nation\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nNearly six months after Healthcare.gov\u2019s disastrous launch, the new commercial exchanges are just beginning to emerge. GetInsured, a startup that has been around since 2005, claims to have developed the first real online alternative to Healthcare.gov.\n\nGetInsured\u2019s new site lets consumers shop for insurance before being redirected to Healthcare.gov to check their eligibility for a subsidy. Consumers are then directed back to GetInsured to purchase a plan.\n\nMORE: We\u2019re now entering the post-HealthCare.gov phase of Obamacare\n\nThe site integrates with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) and currently serves patients in 36 states.\n\nKrzysztof Kujawa, GetInsured\u2019s vice president of product management, expects some of the state-run exchanges to open up their API to commercial players in the coming months. GetInsured plans to integrate with these exchanges to reach people in states that don\u2019t rely on Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cWe see this as a first step in a much longer relationship where commercial players can interact with the government-run health exchanges,\u201d said Kujawa in an interview.\n\nSimilarly to the government alternatives, for people who don\u2019t have access to the Internet, GetInsured can complete the enrollment process by phone.\n\nWhat are the advantages for patients over the government exchanges?\n\nGetInsured claims that it can enroll patients in about 10 minutes, which is a darn sight faster than the federal and some of the state-run alternatives. In addition, the company has developed tools that make it easier for people to select the optimal plan. GetInsured offers a tax credit estimator to estimate eligibility for government assistance in purchasing insurance coverage. The GetInsured Plan Score (GPS) helps customers easily compare health plans based on what\u2019s important to them, such as monthly premium amount and estimated out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nHowever, Kujawa admits that the site needs plenty of design work, as the team is primarily focused right now on making the experience much simpler.\n\n\u201cThere are people who get stuck and need to pick up the phone,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the beginning, and it will get better in the next six to nine months.\u201d\n\nGetInsured wouldn\u2019t disclose its revenues, but the company has significantly benefited from the Affordable Care Act. Kujawa said the company has grown \u201ctwo or three times\u201d in the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe company developed software for California\u2019s state exchange, as well as for New Mexico\u2019s and more recently Idaho\u2019s. Earlier this month, Your Health Idaho announced it would work with Accenture and GetInsured to create the technology site, day-to-day project management, and risk mitigation services.\n\nDespite the earlier hiccups, Kujawa is confident that the government is steadily improving its technology infrastructure. Kujawa said the team is working closely with CMS and the White House\u2019s technology team.\n\n\u201cThey are beginning to be more realistic about what they can accomplish, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned their lesson.\u201d\n\nFacebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-02-26T16:30:16+00:00", "author": "christina-farr", "modDate": "2014-02-26T16:30:16+00:00", "keywords": "company-530e0e9bf08f0c0553026eef,health-2,insurance-providers,krzysztof-kujawa,online-exchange,state-run-exchange,top-stories", "type": "news", "id": 994880}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Nearly six months after Healthcare.gov's disastrous launch, the new commercial exchanges are just beginning to emerge.", "title": "GetInsured launches its Healthcare.gov\u00a0alternative", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/26/getinsured-launches-its-healthcare-gov-alternative/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-26-at-3-39-46-pm-780x295.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Nearly six months after Healthcare.gov\u2019s disastrous launch, the new commercial exchanges are just beginning to\u00a0emerge.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "GetInsured, a startup that has been around since 2005, claims to have developed the first real online alternative to Healthcare.gov.\nThe company developed software for California\u2019s state exchange, as well as for New Mexico\u2019s and more recently Idaho\u2019s.\nGetInsured plans to integrate with these exchanges to reach people in states that don\u2019t rely on Healthcare.gov.\nGetInsured\u2019s new site lets consumers shop for insurance before being redirected to Healthcare.gov to check their eligibility for a subsidy.\nEarlier this month, Your Health Idaho announced it would work with Accenture and GetInsured to create the technology site, day-to-day project management, and risk mitigation services."}
