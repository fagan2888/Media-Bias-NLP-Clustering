I believe the answer ties into campaign finance reform,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the email, which went out this week. \u201cThe truth is, the insurance companies and the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.\u201d\n\nHe said that he wants to make \u201chealth care a right for every American,\u201d and that the health care industry is \u201cflooding my opponents with cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t go around asking millionaires and billionaires for money. You know that,\u201d Mr. Sanders wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get a whole lot of contributions from the health care and pharmaceutical industries. I don\u2019t like to kick a man when he is down, but when some bad actors have tried to contribute to our campaign, like the pharmaceutical C.E.O. Martin Shkreli who jacked up the price of a lifesaving drug for AIDS patients, I donated his contribution to an AIDS clinic in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Party\u2019s front-runner for president in most polls, has received \u201cmillions of dollars from the health care and pharmaceutical industries\u201d and more this campaign cycle those sectors than did the top three Republican presidential candidates combined.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not be na\u00efve about this, maybe they are dumb and don\u2019t know what they are going to get?\u201d Mr. Sanders added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, and I don\u2019t believe you do, either.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders has pledged not to run negative ads, but has struggled at times to maintain an issues-based approach. His aides recently took down a digital ad that described Mrs. Clinton as being captive of big banks after reporters noticed it.\n\nMrs. Clinton has received many hundreds of thousands of more dollars from the health care industry than Mr. Sanders has, according to breakdowns from the Center for Responsive Politics. She was also deeply critical of Mr. Shkreli over the increased cost of a vital AIDS drug when the issue first surfaced in the news media.\n\nIn a statement, Christina Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said her candidate \u201ctakes a back seat to no one when it comes to fighting to expand quality, affordable health care coverage for all Americans. She has spent her entire career standing up to the insurance industry and drug companies \u2014 and she has the scars to prove it.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s effort on a universal health care initiative in 1993 when her husband Bill Clinton was president, and noted the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program grew out of that. She also said Mrs. Clinton wants to improve on the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nAsked about the tone of the fund-raising email, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, Michael Briggs, noted he had criticized her on the debate stage, and replied: \u201cTaking factual note of the huge role the health care industry is playing in Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign is consistent with the senator\u2019s honest and straightforward critique of her Wall Street donors. These are matter-of-fact contrasts between the kind of contributions that are going to the two candidates. Voters have every right to consider how a candidate\u2019s donations would affect policies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151224141308, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Sanders, Bernard;Shkreli, Martin (1983- )", "org": "Democratic Party", "keywords": "Clinton Hillary Rodham,Sanders Bernard,Shkreli Martin (1983- ),Campaign Finance,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2016,Democratic Party,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Maggie Haberman", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Maggie Haberman", "byl": "Maggie Haberman", "twitter": {"description": "\u201cWhat is stopping us from guaranteeing free, quality health care as a basic fundamental right for all Americans?
