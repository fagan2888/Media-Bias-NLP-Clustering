(Photo: AP) Story Highlights The Supreme Court rulings this week caught the attention of Fox Cities residents.\n\nOne day after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s momentous ruling on marriage equality and two days after its ruling on the Affordable Care Act, one thing is certain \u2014 this was one historic week.\n\nThe nation\u2019s high court ruled Friday that same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, striking down same-sex marriage bans that were still in place in 14 states.\n\nThe action is one of two landmark decisions the Supreme Court handed down on hotly debated issues. On Thursday, the justices ruled the Affordable Care Act allows the federal government to provide tax subsidies for health insurance, a major blow to those looking to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s health care plan.\n\nIt was a monumental week, one that will surely affect the tenor of the national conversation as the nation dives into another presidential campaign.\n\nBut how did the Supreme Court\u2019s back-to-back rulings play on Main Street, or in this case, College Avenue? We caught up with people as they strolled along College Avenue in downtown Appleton at the Saturday morning farmers market.\n\nMost said they paid particular attention to Friday\u2019s marriage equality ruling. If you were connected to social media, you had little choice, they said.\n\nLori Glassco of Little Chute said she first heard about the decision on Facebook and wanted to learn more. She visited the Supreme Court\u2019s website to view the ruling and the judges\u2019 decision.\n\n\u201cBecause it was such a close vote (5-4), I just wanted to see how the justices voted and their reasoning,\u201d she said.\n\nTom Vanderleest of Little Chute followed both rulings closely and said the decisions make sense to him. He said he doesn\u2019t think it would be fair for the federal government to provide people with health insurance only to have the Supreme Court \u201cpull the rug out from under them.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s 6-3 ruling was the judges\u2019 second on the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. Across the nation, 10.2 million people have signed up for health insurance under the law. Of those, 8.7 million receive an average subsidy of $272 per month toward their insurance premiums.\n\nOn the same-sex marriage ruling that came down a day later, Vanderleest said he watched closely but wasn\u2019t surprised by the outcome. He said he expected every state to eventually legalize same-sex marriage, so Friday\u2019s ruling merely sped up the process.\n\n\u201cTwo people, no matter who they are, are not hurting anyone else,\u201d Vanderleest said.\n\nVanderleest is far from alone. Polls show a seismic shift in attitude toward same-sex marriage over the past decade.\n\nPolls show Americans are now more likely than not to support same-sex marriage, with some surveys showing as many as 6 in 10 in favor. Polling by the Pew Research Center found support for same-sex marriage growing from 36 percent in 2005 to 57 percent in a poll conducted in May.\n\nThe conversations over the two rulings continue to reverberate in political circles. Both rulings struck at the heart of the Republican Party platform.\n\nBut the response to Friday\u2019s ruling to give same-sex couples the right to marry was mild in comparison with the outrage that followed the high court\u2019s decision Thursday to uphold Obama\u2019s health care law. Friday\u2019s ruling drew tepid responses from several Republicans who, in many cases, would like that issue to fade away.\n\nThe sharp contrast highlights the political challenges for the Republican Party.\n\nThe Republican presidential class is ready to bet big their opposition to Obama\u2019s health care law will resonate with voters. But facing a big shift in public opinion on gay marriage, several of the party\u2019s most ambitious appear ready to turn the page on a social issue Republicans used for a generation to motivate its most passionate voters to turn out at the polls.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the debate is going away, Supreme Court ruling or not.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t settle anything,\u201d National Organization for Marriage president Brian Brown told the Associated Press before the ruling, comparing the gay marriage decision to the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade. \u201cIt\u2019s just like Roe. Do you think Roe settled the abortion debate?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a historic week, one that will certainly shift the conversation \u2014 or fuel it \u2014 whether it\u2019s happening on campaign trails, in government halls or on Main Street.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting this law for six years, and we\u2019re going to make sure it stays right on the front burner,\u201d Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in the wake of the Affordable Care Act ruling.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1NnLR6E", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Affordable Care Act, same-sex marriage rulings ignite plenty of conversation in our area.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Affordable Care Act, same-sex marriage rulings ignite plenty of conversation in our area.", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s landmark rulings mark a historic week", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/2015/06/27/supreme-courts-landmark-rulings-mark-historic-week/29396983/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Affordable Care Act, same-sex marriage rulings ignite plenty of conversation in our area.", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s landmark rulings mark a historic week", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d9ad11f0645a671bc0e8f129e74c0787955f763a/c=713-0-3989-3276&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/27/Appleton/B9317886250Z.1_20150627155617_000_GF5B6R8M5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/jen.zettel"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: AP) Story Highlights The Supreme Court rulings this week caught the attention of Fox Cities residents.\nBut how did the Supreme Court\u2019s back-to-back rulings play on Main Street, or in this case, College Avenue?\nThe action is one of two landmark decisions the Supreme Court handed down on hotly debated issues.\nThe nation\u2019s high court ruled Friday that same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, striking down same-sex marriage bans that were still in place in 14 states.\nThe Republican presidential class is ready to bet big their opposition to Obama\u2019s health care law will resonate with voters."}
