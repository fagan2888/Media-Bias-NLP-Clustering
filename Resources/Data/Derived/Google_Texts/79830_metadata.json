Worldwide, patients young and old are one diagnosis away from financial ruin.\"\n\nHealthy Travel Media, publishers of Patients Beyond Borders: Everybody\u2019s Guide to Affordable, World-Class Medical Travel, today announced publication of the updated and expanded Third Edition of the world\u2019s best-selling consumer guide to medical tourism and international health travel.\n\nThis impartial, easy-to-navigate print and eBook reference gives health travelers the road map required to make safe, cost-effective decisions about traveling abroad for healthcare.\n\nDriven by rising costs of elective treatments and increasing wait times for specialty procedures, more than a million US patients will cross borders for medical care this year, nearly double the number only three years ago. \u201cWith or without Obamacare, some 86 million Americans remain woefully un- or under-insured for common treatments related to dentistry, vision, hearing, weight loss, fertility and more,\u201d says Patients Beyond Borders author Josef Woodman. \u201cWorldwide, millions of patients young and old are without access to quality, affordable medical care, often one diagnosis away from financial ruin.\u201d\n\nPatients Beyond Borders features hundreds of newly-accredited international hospitals and clinics, providing healthcare consumers a wide range of affordable medical tourism options for quality care that did not exist just ten years ago. As costs for medical procedures continue to plague employers and healthcare consumers alike, savings of 40-85% compared to US medical costs are still common in more than 20 leading medical destinations around the world.\n\nPatients Beyond Borders will be available in print and fully searchable eBook format. A \u201cQuick-Read\u201d edition will provide readers with medical travel essentials, along with selected links to the official Patients Beyond Borders website. The book\u2019s foreword, penned by Jeremy Abbate, publishing director of Scientific American Worldview, provides perspective on medical tourism as a vital component in the globalization of healthcare and medical innovation.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJosef Woodman is an outspoken advocate of affordable, high-quality medical and preventive care for healthcare consumers worldwide.

In this sense, the seeking of health solutions beyond one\u2019s own national boundaries can be seen as part of the broader patient empowerment movement, in which the locus of control begins to shift from provider to health seeker. For those seeking medical and health solutions now, or those wanting to discover options within the larger, international arena in the not too distant future, there is no better source of sound data and information than Patients Beyond Borders.\u201d - from the foreword to Patients Beyond Borders Third Edition by Jeremy Abbate, Publishing Director, Scientific American Worldview.\n\nPaperback, 320 pages\n\nISBN-13: 978-0990315407\n\nNonfiction: Health/Travel\n\nPrice: $24.95 US", "article_metadata": {"description": "Book Offers New Choices for Patients as US Healthcare Crisis Deepens", "Generator": "PRWeb html v1", "og": {"site_name": "PRWeb", "description": "Chapel Hill, NC (PRWEB) June 19, 2014 -- Book Offers New Choices for Patients as US Healthcare Crisis Deepens", "title": "Healthy Travel Media Launches Third Edition of Patients Beyond Borders", "url": "http://www.prweb.com/releases/patientsbeyondborders/medicaltourism/prweb11948166.htm", "image": "http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2014/06/18/11948166/gI_88876_pbb3e%20front%20cover%20low%20res.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chapel Hill, NC (PRWEB) June 19, 2014 \n\n Healthy Travel Media, publishers of Patients Beyond Borders: Everybody\u2019s Guide to Affordable, World-Class Medical Travel, today announced publication of the", "creator": {"identifier": "@PatientsBeyond", "id": 33512543}, "url": "http://www.prweb.com/releases/patientsbeyondborders/medicaltourism/prweb11948166.htm", "image": "http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2014/06/18/11948166/gI_88876_pbb3e%20front%20cover%20low%20res.png", "title": "Healthy Travel Media Launches Third Edition of Patients Beyond Borders", "site": {"identifier": "@PRWeb", "id": 14124541}, "card": "Summary"}, "keywords": "PRESS RELEASE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health  Fitness,Alternative Medicine,Dental,General,Hospitals,Surgery,Senior Citizens,Diet  Weight Loss,Plastic Surgery,Sports Medicine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbe6\"", "article_summary": "Healthy Travel Media, publishers of Patients Beyond Borders: Everybody\u2019s Guide to Affordable, World-Class Medical Travel, today announced publication of the updated and expanded Third Edition of the world\u2019s best-selling consumer guide to medical tourism and international health travel.\nA \u201cQuick-Read\u201d edition will provide readers with medical travel essentials, along with selected links to the official Patients Beyond Borders website.\nIts flagship international title, Patients Beyond Borders, now in its Third Edition, is the world's leading consumer reference guide for medical tourism.\nPatients Beyond Borders Third Edition: Everybody's Guide to Affordable, World-Class Medical Travel With or without Obamacare, some 86 million Americans will remain woefully un- or under-insured for common but expensive treatments.\nAbout Patients Beyond BordersBased in Chapel Hill, NC, Patients Beyond Borders publishes books, eBooks, video, online, mobile, and other resources for healthcare consumers seeking high-quality, affordable options in medical care."}
