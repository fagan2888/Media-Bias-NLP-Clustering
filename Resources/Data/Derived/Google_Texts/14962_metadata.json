Mike Huckabee.\n\nCondemnation of the Supreme Court from Republicans and conservatives burst like a dam following a decision effectively upholding Obamacare.\n\nIn a 6-to-3 ruling in King v. Burwell, both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with the left wing of the court to confirm the legality of the nationwide tax subsidies in Obamacare. If the court had ruled otherwise, it would have meant six-to-eight million people would have lost their subsidies, effectively overturning the law.\n\nA dumbfounded Judge Andrew Napolitano said the chief justice employed \u201cbizarre and odd contortions\u201d to save the statute twice.\n\nRep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the Supreme Court ruled \u201cthe law doesn\u2019t mean what it says,\u201d and worried it will soon rule on same-sex marriage that \u201cthe Constitution doesn\u2019t mean what it says.\u201d\n\nSen Ted Cruz, R-Texas, blistered the bench, charging, \u201cFor nakedly political reasons, the Supreme Court willfully ignored the words that Congress wrote, and instead read into the law their preferred policy outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnelected judges have once again become legislators, and bad ones at that. They are lawless, and they hide their prevarication in legalese. Our government was designed to be one of laws, not of men, and this transparent distortion is disgraceful,\u201d added the presidential candidate.\n\nLater, during a speech on the Senate floor, Cruz referred to \u201crogue justices\u201d who \u201care not behaving as umpires calling balls and strikes. They have joined a team, and it is a team that is hurting Americans across this country.\u201d\n\nHe added, if the \u201cjustices want to become legislators, I invite them to resign and run for office.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the strongest condemnation of the ruling came from the court, itself.\n\nIn his dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, \u201cWe should start calling this law SCOTUScare,\u201d using the acronym for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n\u201cWords no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \u2018established by the State,'\u201d he added. \u201cIt is hard to come up with a clearer way to limit tax credits to state Exchanges than to use the words \u2018established by the State.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am stunned that the Supreme Court expanded the power of the executive branch to rewrite law it doesn\u2019t like. Not only does this decision prop up a failed policy, it enshrines the principle that the president can trump Congress,\u201d observed Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s Obamacare acrobatics should dispel for good the comforting illusion that we can rely on judges to save us,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions. R-Ala. \u201cWhether on socialized medicine, executive amnesty, or any other action which erodes our Constitution and the powers of Congress, conservatives will have to rally the everyday voting citizen.\u201d\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, observed, \u201cIn recent years, the U.S. Constitution has taken a severe beating at the hands of this president\u2019s administration. The United States Supreme Court has now added to the constitutional malfeasance by decreeing from on high that what the Affordable Care Act itself said is not legal is legal.\u201d\n\nJim Jordan, R-Ohio, said the decision \u201cdoes not change the basic truth: Obamacare is a bad law, sold deceptively, and it is fundamentally broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout this court case, I think we\u2019ve lost the leverage to actually have the president negotiate with us,\u201d said presidential candidate Sen Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nCruz even blasted many who were blasting the decision:\n\n\u201cAt the same time, crocodile tears are flooding our nation\u2019s capital today over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to illegally rewrite Obamacare, which has been a disaster since its inception. But one day of faux outrage from the Washington Cartel won\u2019t fool the millions of courageous conservatives across our country.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey know the Republican leadership in Washington is quietly celebrating the Court\u2019s decision. If they believe this issue is now settled so they don\u2019t have to address it, they are sorely mistaken.\u201d\n\nThe Texan also warned his fellow presidential contenders, \u201cEvery GOP candidate for the Republican nomination should know that this decision makes the 2016 election a referendum on the full repeal of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWhat do YOU think? Should the progressive wing of Supreme Court be impeached? Sound off in today\u2019s WND poll\n\nGOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush tweeted, \u201cI am disappointed in the Burwell decision, but this is not the end of the fight against ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean Obamacare is fixed, and never will be unless a Republican is elected president in 2016,\u201d and that the election now will be America\u2019s last chance to stop Obamacare.\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted, \u201cI disagree with the Court\u2019s ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama and Congress in forcing ObamaCare on the American people.\u201d\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a win for the Democrats and Obama, it\u2019s a big win for the majority of Republicans \u2013 who value the perks of office and an easy job more than they care about the Constitution.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said the ruling \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the fact\u201d that \u201cObamacare is fundamentally broken, increasing health care costs for millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nIt will not stop the \u201crolling disaster\u201d that is Obamacare, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nPresidential candidate Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., tweeted, \u201cToday\u2019s #SCOTUScare ruling means Republicans must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive & costly law.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate Carly Fiorina tweeted, \u201cIt is outrageous that the Supreme Court once again rewrote Obamacare to save this deeply flawed law,\u201d and, \u201cRepeal Obamacare and let the free market \u2013 not more crony capitalism \u2013 improve access and care for all Americans.\u201d\n\nGOP Presidential candidate and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry tweeted, \u201cAmericans deserve better than what we\u2019re getting with Obamacare. It\u2019s time we repealed and replaced it!\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling makes it clear that if we want to fix our broken health care system, then we will need to elect a Republican president with proven ideas and real solutions that will help American families,\u201d said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.\n\nTalk-show host Tammy Bruce warned, \u201cThis is not going to be good (for Democrats) when it comes to the reaction of the American people come 2016. It makes things clear \u2026 the Democrats own this \u2026 (voters) realize something dramatic is going to have to happen in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo amount of rhetoric, no amount of smugness, is going to change (the fact Obamacare is bad for America).\n\n\u201cThis decision is disappointing and troubling,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, or ACLJ, which filed an amicus brief challenging Obamacare.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the majority of the Court failed to apply the law as written. The Court instead rewrote the law, something it did not have the constitutional power to do. It is troubling that the high court backed the Obama Administration\u2019s overreach in its ongoing effort to rewrite or suspend portions of the ACA (Affordable Care Act), in violation of the separation of powers. The Court clearly over stepped its authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to protect its own reputation the Supreme Court handed down another absurd Obamacare ruling,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, CEO and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots.\n\n\u201cWhile Americans suffer under the law and the federal government issues subsidies contrary to what the law says, the Supreme Court seems intent on actively changing the text to uphold the law. We are living in interesting times when both the Executive and now the Judicial Branch seem to have an utter disregard for what is written into law.\u201d\n\nDemocrats sought to portray the ruling as an end to the national debate over Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama declared from a podium in the White House Rose Garden, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is here to stay.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton tweeted,\u201dYes! SCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts & under the law: Health insurance should be affordable & available to all.\u201d\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla, chair of the Democratic National Committee, crowed, \u201cAfter two Supreme Court victories, we can confidently declare that the Affordable Care Act is no longer just a law to be debated \u2013 it is woven into the fabric of our society and how we care for each other.\u201d\n\nBut she also warned leftists, \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that our Republican opposition just doesn\u2019t understand that this debate is over \u2013 they\u2019re going to keep fighting to undo the progress we\u2019ve made. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s full statement:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision in King v. Burwell is judicial activism, plain and simple. For the second time in just a few years, a handful of unelected judges has rewritten the text of Obamacare in order to impose this failed law on millions of Americans. The first time, the Court ignored federal law and magically transformed a statutory \u2018penalty\u2019 into a \u2018tax.\u2019 Today, these robed Houdinis transmogrified a \u2018federal exchange\u2019 into an exchange \u2018established by the State.\u2019 \u201cAs Justice Scalia rightfully put it, \u2018Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \u2018established by the State.\u201d He also said, \u2018We should start calling this law SCOTUSCare\u2019 \u2013 I agree. \u201cIf this were a bankruptcy case, or any other case of ordinary statutory interpretation, the result would have been 9-0, with the Court unanimously reversing the Obama administration\u2019s illegal actions. But instead, politics intervened. \u201cFor nakedly political reasons, the Supreme Court willfully ignored the words that Congress wrote, and instead read into the law their preferred policy outcome. These judges have joined with President Obama in harming millions of Americans. Unelected judges have once again become legislators, and bad ones at that. They are lawless, and they hide their prevarication in legalese. Our government was designed to be one of laws, not of men, and this transparent distortion is disgraceful. \u201cAt the same time, crocodile tears are flooding our nation\u2019s capital today over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to illegally rewrite Obamacare, which has been a disaster since its inception. But one day of faux outrage from the Washington Cartel won\u2019t fool the millions of courageous conservatives across our country. They know the Republican leadership in Washington is quietly celebrating the Court\u2019s decision. If they believe this issue is now settled so they don\u2019t have to address it, they are sorely mistaken. \u201cEvery GOP candidate for the Republican nomination should know that this decision makes the 2016 election a referendum on the full repeal of Obamacare. \u201cI have made repeal of this disastrous law a top priority since the first day I arrived in the Senate and have made its repeal central to my campaign. Any candidate not willing to do the same \u2013 and campaign on it every day \u2013 should step aside. \u201cThe Court adopted the IRS\u2019s blatantly unlawful reading of the statute to make subsidies available to individuals on federal exchanges, when Congress expressly provided the opposite. \u201cAfter today\u2019s ruling, Obamacare will now be responsible for imposing illegal taxes on more than 11 million individuals and for burdening hundreds of thousands of businesses with illegal penalties on their workers, killing jobs, and further slowing economic growth. President Obama\u2019s health care law remains deeply unpopular and is harming countless Americans by increasing costs and worsening the quality of care. \u201cI remain fully committed to the repeal of Obamacare \u2013 every single word of it. And, in 2017, we will do exactly that.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s full statement:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s King v. Burwell decision, which protects and expands ObamaCare, is an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny. Our Founding Fathers didn\u2019t create a \u2018do-over\u2019 provision in our Constitution that allows unelected, Supreme Court justices the power to circumvent Congress and rewrite bad laws. The Supreme Court cannot legislate from the bench, ignore the Constitution, and pass a multi-trillion dollar \u2018fix\u2019 to ObamaCare simply because Congress misread what the states would actually do. The architects and authors of ObamaCare were intentional in the way they wrote the law. The courts have no constitutional authority to rescue Congress from creating bad law. The solution is for Congress to admit they screwed up, repeal the \u2018nightmare of Obamacare\u2019, and let states road-test real health care reforms. \u201cEverywhere I go, I talk to American families who keep getting punched in the gut with outrageous insurance premiums and infuriating hospital bills. ObamaCare was railroaded through Congress to \u2018solve\u2019 our healthcare problems, but five years later, American families are getting railroaded by runaway mandates, big government bureaucracy, and out-of-control healthcare costs. ObamaCare is a $2.2 trillion Washington disaster that raided billions from Medicare and did nothing to fix our broken system of \u2018sick care,\u2019 which rewards irresponsibility and penalizes commonsense. As President, I will protect Medicare, repeal ObamaCare, and pass real reform that will actually lower costs, while focusing on cures and prevention rather than intervention. The status quo is unfair, unaffordable, unsustainable, and completely un-American.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s full statement:\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision today does not change the basic truth: Obamacare is a bad law, sold deceptively, and it is fundamentally broken. Americans deserve health care policy that makes it easier for companies to provide insurance and for individuals to buy it themselves, not harder. I hear stories all the time about how Obamacare is hurting people in Ohio. In the Fourth District, Dan, a business owner, runs a company that employs about 70 people. Because of Obamacare, his company\u2019s health costs went up, and they had to switch plans from one they liked, to one that forces some of his employees to pay out of pocket $500 each month for asthma inhalers. This is wrong. Healthcare policy should be about empowering and helping people, not government. Obamacare is raising the cost of healthcare for Americans everywhere. It\u2019s time to repeal this bad law. Congress must get rid of this law once and for all, and replace it with patient-centered fixes that promote personal freedom and spur job creation, instead of stifling both.\u201d\n\nRelated stories:\n\nWatchdog lawyer says six supremes must be impeached\n\nScalia slams \u2018jiggery-pokery\u2019 used to save Obamacare\n\n\u2018Out-of-control act of judicial tyranny\u2019\n\nFormer chief of surgeons group calls Obamacare \u2018fascism\u2019\n\nObamacare subsidies upheld by Supreme Court\n\nObama: \u2018Health care is not a privilege but a right\u2019", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 \u201cAn out-of-control act of judicial tyranny,\u201d said presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov.
