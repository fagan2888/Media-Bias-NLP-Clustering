Pope Benedict XVI's successor is being chosen by the College of Cardinals in Conclave in the Sistine Chapel. The 115 cardinal-electors, meeting in strict secrecy, will need to reach a two-thirds-plus-one vote majority to elect the 266th Pontiff.

He said the Obama administration doesn\u2019t take religious concerns about the contraception mandate seriously and has gone after how people practice their faith in their daily lives.\n\n\u201cThis administration has been more aggressive with it than any we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Wilson told TheDCNF. \u201cIn the case of the HHS mandate, one just has to conclude that the administration doesn\u2019t take those concerns seriously at all. We shouldn\u2019t accept being marginalized.\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby won a landmark supreme court case last year that allowed the company to get a religious exemption to the Obamacare mandate that they provide insurance covering contraceptives, including those that can destroy embryos.\n\n\u201cCMF CURO is an important part of this transformation insofar as it seeks to transform the healthcare culture from one which is bureaucratic, coercive, and secular, to one which is rooted in solidarity, the primacy of the family, individual responsibility, and in the person of Jesus Christ,\u201d Burke wrote.\n\nThe religious right has been taking hits recently as they fight a losing battle over wedding vendors, cake, pizza and gay weddings. Recent religious freedom laws in Indiana and Arkansas that would have not likely been controversial a decade ago sparked a firestorm that led the states\u2019 leaders to back down.\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
