Some are confused about health insurance in general.\n\nSome University of Florida students aren\u2019t informed about their current health insurance. UF student Sarah Beauchamp said she can\u2019t explain what kind of insurance she has, while UF student Marylander Menard said she was unaware of the fine if she fails to get health insurance by the January 1 deadline.\n\nThe Florida Public Interest Research Group launched a campaign to educate young adults on the Affordable Care Act. Students gathered holding signs, offering tips with information that many people are unaware of, including the fact that insurance companies can\u2019t turn someone away for pre-existing conditions.\n\nFlorida Public Interest Research Group representatives stressed the importance of being informed regardless of how healthy a person is. Dalyn Houser, a program associate from the research group, said it\u2019s important for young people to realize they are not invincible. Anything can happen at any time.\n\nLast year, 15 percent of Americans did not have health insurance, and this year, 20 percent of UF students are uninsured.\n\nUF senior Jose Cardona said he fractured his leg in 2012 while playing basketball at the gym. Cardona had no way of paying his hospital bills, he said.\n\nPeople can research health insurance plans online at HealthCare.gov. Some, including students, may qualify for financial assistance, but the average monthly cost for coverage under the act will be $328. People under the age of 26 can choose to be added to or remain on their parents\u2019 insurance plan.\n\nThose who choose to remain uninsured will face a fine. In 2014, that fine will either be $95 or 1 percent of a person\u2019s income, depending on which is higher. In 2016, that fine will go up to 2.5 percent or $625 per adult.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WUFT News", "description": "The Florida Public Interest Research Group has launched a campaign to educate young adults about the upcoming health care legislation.
