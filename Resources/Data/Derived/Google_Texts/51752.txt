LexisNexus Risk Solutions has acquired Ennclairy and EDIWatch int he past few years. Lexis Nexus Group has picked up Sheshunoff and A.S. Pratt from the Thomson Media Group in May 2013, and in 2012 bought the parent company of Law360. The company is owned by Reed Elseveir Group plc, a provider of professional information services.

Companies have been stocking up on health care services as demands on providers increase with more patients moving into the system because of the Affordable Care Act. For more, see 5 Technologies Drive Health Care M&A.
