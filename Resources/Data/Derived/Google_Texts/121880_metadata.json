In the fight against obesity, sugary drinks have been seen as public enemy No. 1, fueling chronic diseases related to diet. In a recent ad, Coca-Cola tried to compose a \u201cnew fun way to pay for Coke,\u201d which has inadvertently turned into a public health warning about the effects of soda on the body.\n\n\u201cA Coke used to cost 5 cents,\u201d read the ad on YouTube. \u201cBut what if a 12-oz. Coke cost 140 calories?\u201d The ad blatantly acknowledges the average time to burn 140 calories while biking is 23 minutes if you\u2019re 140 lbs., followed by stating, \u201cBut hey, everyone\u2019s different.\u201d Although the beverage company has cleverly displayed a \u201cfun\u201d scenario to burn off the calories of a 12-oz. Coke, consumers may not be into spending 23 minutes of cycling to eliminate a can of sugar.\n\n\"It's so clever on so many levels, but it's twisted too,\" said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and author of Appetite for Profit: How the Food Industry Undermines Our Health and How to Fight Back, to the Associated Press. Simon believes the Coca-Cola ad is a response to the recently released Fed Up movie. The film, for instance, shows a child would have to bike for an hour and 15 minutes to burn off the calories in a 20-oz. Coke.\n\nAlthough the ad tends to address the theme of energy balance in a lighthearted way, it falls short of persuasion and can actually backfire since people may be turned off by the idea of bike riding for 23 minutes to burn off the soda. The amount of time required is a lot of time for those who are busy or lazy. \"They're showing exactly why you wouldn't want to drink a Coke. Twenty-three minutes on a bike is not fun for most people,\" Laura Ries, president of the brand consulting firm Ries & Ries told the AP.\n\nTrade your soft drink for some flavored water by just adding slices of your favorite fruits and veggies, no 23-minute bike ride necessary.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "coca-cola, soft drink, beverage, soda can, bike ride, cycling, energy balance, diet, obesity, chronic diseases, calories", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Coca-Cola Company, the world\u2019s largest beverage company, inadvertently shows the health effects of soda on the body in an ad.", "title": "Coca-Cola Ad Inadvertently Shows The Effect Of Soda On Body [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unusual-coca-cola-ad-shows-health-effects-soda-23-minute-bike-ride-287350", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/coca-cola-can-sand.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Coca-Cola Company, the world\u2019s largest beverage company, inadvertently shows the health effects of soda on the body in an ad.", "title": "Coca-Cola Ad Inadvertently Shows The Effect Of Soda On Body [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unusual-coca-cola-ad-shows-health-effects-soda-23-minute-bike-ride-287350", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/coca-cola-can-sand.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/coca-cola-can-sand.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-09T17:27:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T17:27:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Coca-Cola Company, the world\u2019s largest beverage company, inadvertently shows the health effects of soda on the body in an ad."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cfa\"", "article_summary": "Twenty-three minutes on a bike is not fun for most people,\" Laura Ries, president of the brand consulting firm Ries & Ries told the AP.\nIn a recent ad, Coca-Cola tried to compose a \u201cnew fun way to pay for Coke,\u201d which has inadvertently turned into a public health warning about the effects of soda on the body.\nTrade your soft drink for some flavored water by just adding slices of your favorite fruits and veggies, no 23-minute bike ride necessary.\nThe film, for instance, shows a child would have to bike for an hour and 15 minutes to burn off the calories in a 20-oz.\n\"It's so clever on so many levels, but it's twisted too,\" said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and author of Appetite for Profit: How the Food Industry Undermines Our Health and How to Fight Back, to the Associated Press."}
