Pickett would ride alongside a steer, jump on its shoulders and bring the animal down by digging in his heels.\n\n\u201cPeople knew the name, Will Rogers, but who they hadn\u2019t heard of was Bill Pickett, and if they had, they didn\u2019t know he was black,\u201d Vason said, according to the website.\n\nThe first Bill Pickett Invitational was held in 1984 in Denver.\n\n\u201cLu leaves an indelible mark on Denver\u2019s cultural scene and Western heritage that will never be forgotten,\u201d Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said in a statement.\n\nBefore Vason got into show business, he was a beautician and barber, Franklin said.\n\nWhen he began a career as a promoter and producer, the legendary rock music promoter Barry Fey became his mentor, Franklin said.\n\nHe promoted performances by stars like Prince and Stevie Wonder.\n\nEventually, he realized that the music industry \u201cwas being taken over by bigger corporations with deeper pockets and he couldn\u2019t compete with that,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nHe continued to promote smaller concerts, and was working until shortly before he died. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t have any quit in him,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nHe was committed to the black community, especially to helping black youngsters, Franklin said. \u201cI have never seen anyone so caring and concerned. I used to tease him, I said you are committed to people and some of these folks don\u2019t care about you. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019 He was always around youth and children.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Vason\u2019s Facebook page was filled with condolences and tributes from friends.\n\n\u201cRIP Lu Vason. The man who was responsible for my reign as Miss Black Colorado and made it a huge success,\u201d wrote Phyllice Johnson Masby, Miss Black Colorado USA of 1995. \u201cYou will be missed!!\u201d\n\nA funeral service is set for Friday at Shorter Community AME Church in Denver at 11:30 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lu Vason, creator of all-black Bill Pickett Rodeo, dies at 76", "title": "Lu Vason, creator of all-black Bill Pickett Rodeo, dies at 76", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/17/lu-vason-creator-of-all-black-bill-pickett-rodeo-dies-at-76/", "image": {"width": 467, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517__vasonp1.jpg", "height": 653}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517__vasonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-17T17:08:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T06:15:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb11e\"", "article_summary": "Lu Vason, who promoted musical artists, including the Pointer Sisters, produced concerts and created the all-black Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, has died.\nAt the Black American West Museum, in Denver, Vason learned of Bill Pickett, a black cowboy who created \u201cbulldogging,\u201d now called steer wrestling, according to the rodeo website.\nThe first Bill Pickett Invitational was held in 1984 in Denver.\n\u201cPeople knew the name, Will Rogers, but who they hadn\u2019t heard of was Bill Pickett, and if they had, they didn\u2019t know he was black,\u201d Vason said, according to the website.\nVason became interested in rodeo in 1977, during Wyoming\u2019s Cheyenne Frontier Days, when he noticed there were no black cowboys competing, according to information on the Bill Pickett rodeo\u2019s website."}
