Lindsey Graham didn\u2019t pull any punches when talking about Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in a frank radio interview on Tuesday. Graham, who last week endorsed Jeb Bush\u2019s candidacy for the Republican nomination for president, called Trump \u201cbeyond crazy\u201d and said Cruz\u2019s tactics in the Senate hurt the Republican Party.\n\nGraham\u2019s sharpest indictment of both candidates: Hillary Clinton would beat them handily.\n\nAsked on Kilmeade and Friends about the possibility of a Trump nomination, Graham said, \u201cI can just tell you this: That means Hillary Clinton is president.\u201d He added that a Trump\u2013Clinton race would not even be close, and called Trump \u201cbeyond crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsane \u2014 on foreign policy, he has no idea what he is talking about. His domestic agenda is a bunch of gibberish,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe is saying things that have no chance of becoming reality. He has an 81% disapproval rating with Hispanics.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if you want to make Hillary Clinton president, elect Donald Trump,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHis numbers with young women are terrible; he has through the roof negatives with Hispanics. We\u2019ll get creamed, in my view.\u201d\n\nAsked for his take on the feud between Trump and Cruz that has been brewing in recent weeks, Graham called it a distraction. He then unloaded on the Texas senator, saying Cruz wasn\u2019t mature enough to be president and labeling him the \u201cleast respected\u201d person in the Senate.\n\n\u201cNumber one, Ted Cruz was born in Canada. I have no doubt he is eligible to run for president of the United States. I have no doubt that he would be an ideologue in the eyes of most Americans. He has been a senator, he has been the most disruptive influence in the Senate, he hasn\u2019t passed anything meaningful. His idea to shut down the entire government to get Barack Obama to repeal Obamacare made no sense to me. It hurt the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nPressed by host Brian Kilmeade if Cruz was just standing on principle on Obamacare, Graham shot back, \u201cNo, I think what he did he stood up for Ted and threw the Republican Party under the bus.\u201d\n\nGraham went further, calling his plan to shutdown the government \u201cstupid\u201d and solely for fundraising.\n\n\u201cTed\u2019s idea of shutting the government down to get Barack Obama to sign a bill that would repeal his signature issue was stupid. He used it to raise money; it hurt the Republican Party \u2014 and here is what I hate most about what he did \u2014 he accused me and others who disagreed with the tactic of being for Obamacare. \u201d\n\n\u201cRemember the Sandy Hook shooting when those kids were killed? He was going to filibuster a debate on gun control,\u201d continued Graham. \u201cWe won every vote on the floor. The worst thing the Republican Party could have done is to say after Sandy Hook we don\u2019t want a debate. No, I don\u2019t think he is ready to be president. I don\u2019t think he is mature enough. I think he is all over the board on foreign policy. He is more of a Libertarian than he is a Ronald Reagan conservative. He changes with the wind. I don\u2019t dislike Ted as a person but they will cream him \u2014 almost anybody else could win.\u201d\n\nGraham said Cruz tries to get ahead at the expense of others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dislike him; I think he is the least respected,\u201d said Graham. \u201cI think what he does is get ahead at other people\u2019s expense. When he accused me of being for Obamacare because I did not agree with his tactics of repealing Obamacare, that was very offensive. I have never been for Obamacare, but I had people in South Carolina saying, \u2018Why are you voting for Obamacare?\u2019 I said, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018Well, you weren\u2019t with Cruz.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know it really pissed me off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to disagree on tactics, but to accuse your colleague of being for Obamacare, when you know they are not, because they don\u2019t agree with your tactics, is a bridge too far for me. He does not have the ability to pull this country together. When you talk about problem solver, you can\u2019t mention Ted Cruz.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4128823, "userid": 227410}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Tell us how you really feel...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
