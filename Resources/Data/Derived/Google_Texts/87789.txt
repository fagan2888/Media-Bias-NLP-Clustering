ORONO, Maine (AP) - University of Maine researchers are working on a two-year project to increase the state’s crop of locally grown plums.

The university says the project is designed to identify plum varieties that are suitable for Maine’s climate and would help diversity the state’s apple farms. Plums are being evaluated for crop yields, fruit quality, production costs and “consumer acceptance.”

The school says UMaine phytochemist Angela Myracle and UMaine Cooperative Extension tree fruit specialist Renae Moran are collaborating on the project. Moran says Maine farmers are showing interest in growing another fruit crop in addition to apples, a fall staple in the state. Myracle says plums could potentially be sold during the peak tourist season in Maine.
