Jeff Sessions continued to warn Wednesday against giving President Barack Obama fast track authority, especially for a potential deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nIn an interview with radio host Mark Levin Wednesday night, Sessions said a potential TPP deal would cause \u201ca diminishment of the individual citizens\u2019 power\u201d as the U.S. president\u2019s vote for a deal would be on par with that of the sultan of Brunei.\n\nMARK LEVIN: I\u2019m a little confused, Sen. Sessions. We\u2019re supposed to be a republic. We\u2019re supposed to have the consent of the governed. That doesn\u2019t mean majoritarianism or pluralism, but it at least means these damn big bills, whether they\u2019re budget bills or Obamacare or fast track, what\u2019s the problem? Can\u2019t we the people who have to live under these schemes at least have a look at them? SEN. JEFF SESSIONS: Absolutely, we must insist on that. Particularly when you\u2019re dealing with not just a trade agreement, which TPP is supposed to be, but it has the creation of international commissions. It has all the earmarks of how the European Union got started. And it transfers American sovereignty, the sultan of Brunei gets the same vote as the President of the United States, and they can pass all kinds of things that could bind Americans in a lot of different ways. And as you know fundamentally, we don\u2019t have any control over them. We can\u2019t vote out the sultan of Brunei. This is a diminishment of the individual citizens\u2019 power. It is a transfer to this President, and to an international organization that we have no reason to believe will serve our interests.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "Jeff Sessions continued to warn Wednesday against giving President Barack Obama fast track authority, especially for a potential deal on the TPP", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Sen.
