Amy Poehler, Pharrell Williams, Kate Bosworth, Michael Cera, and Rosario Dawson were among the many who took to social media to promote the hashtag #GetCovered.\n\nBut now the White House has directly produced its own endorsement ad, and its spokesman is Basketball Hall of Fame member and HIV survivor Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. It is promoting the video on the WhiteHouse.gov homepage and its YouTube page.\n\nIn the ad, Johnson specifically addresses young people and athletes, and tells them to \"Make sure you get Obamacare.\"\n\nHe proclaims that early detection of diseases can save lives, which is what gave him the chance to live a healthy life being HIV-positive for the past 22 years (though, of course, Johnson's wealth grants him access to the most advanced and expensive health care).\n\nHere's the video, which premiered on Wednesday:\n\nJohnson has been a health advocate for awhile now.\n\nHe founded his non-profit, the Magic Johnson Foundation, in 1991, the same year he announced he was HIV-positive. It is dedicated to educating poor urban communities on HIV/AIDS prevention, and has established scholarship programs and community centers around the country.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Richard Feloni", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Celebrities have been unofficially endorsing Obamacare since it launched, but the White House has premiered its own ad, and its stars the basketball legend.", "creator": "RichFeloni", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/magic-johnson-endorses-obamacare-2014-1", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52d7094f69bedd3c089c1526-506-253/magic-johnson-is-now-an-official-spokesman-for-obamacare.jpg", "title": "Magic Johnson Is Now An Official Spokesman For Obamacare", "site": "BI_Advertising", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "advertising,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Obamacare, Advertising, Endorsements, Magic Johnson, Richard Feloni", "description": "Celebrities have been unofficially endorsing Obamacare since it launched, but the White House has premiered its own ad, and its stars the basketball legend.", "author": "Richard Feloni", "sailthru.date": "2014-01-15", "sailthru.title": "Magic Johnson Is Now An Official Spokesman For Obamacare", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/52d709466da811e95499f741-50-50/magic-johnson-is-now-an-official-spokesman-for-obamacare.jpg", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Advertising, Endorsements, Magic Johnson, Richard Feloni", "tbi-image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52d709466da811e95499f741/magic-johnson-is-now-an-official-spokesman-for-obamacare.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-01-15", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/richard-feloni"}, "sailthru.description": "Celebrities have been unofficially endorsing Obamacare since it launched, but the White House has premiered its own ad, and its stars the basketball legend.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Celebrities have been unofficially endorsing Obamacare since it launched, but the White House has premiered its own ad, and its stars the basketball legend.", "title": "Magic Johnson Is Now An Official Spokesman For Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/magic-johnson-endorses-obamacare-2014-1", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52d7094f69bedd3c089c1526-1190-625/magic-johnson-is-now-an-official-spokesman-for-obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Magic Johnson Is Now An Official Spokesman For Obamacare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52d709466da811e95499f741/magic-johnson-is-now-an-official-spokesman-for-obamacare.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "advertising"}, "article_summary": "In the ad, Johnson specifically addresses young people and athletes, and tells them to \"Make sure you get Obamacare.\"\nHe founded his non-profit, the Magic Johnson Foundation, in 1991, the same year he announced he was HIV-positive.\nBut now the White House has directly produced its own endorsement ad, and its spokesman is Basketball Hall of Fame member and HIV survivor Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson.\nIt is dedicated to educating poor urban communities on HIV/AIDS prevention, and has established scholarship programs and community centers around the country.\nIt is promoting the video on the WhiteHouse.gov homepage and its YouTube page."}
