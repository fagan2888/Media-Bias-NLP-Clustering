But roughly one in 10 Minnesotans now is getting health insurance through MNsure.\n\n\u201cThere is still work to do, the cost of care is rising, so we need to figure out how to manage premium growth and cost of care,\u201d said Stefan Gildemeister, the Minnesota health economist.\n\nAvidor is finally getting the checkups and procedures he\u2019s been putting off for the past decade, making him and his wife part of the picture of a healthier state.\n\n\u201cMNsure and the Affordable Care Act allowed us to get back into the system,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of people in Minnesota without health insurance is at an all-time low, according to a report from the Minnesota Health Department and University of Minnesota.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/02/29/mdh-u-of-m-report-uninsured-minnesotans-low-rate/", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/mn-uninsured-rate-at-historic-low-feb-29-2016.jpg?w=1280", "identifier": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/mn-uninsured-rate-at-historic-low-feb-29-2016.jpg?w=1280", "height": 720}, "type": "article", "description": "The number of people in Minnesota without health insurance is at an all-time low, according to a report from the Minnesota Health Department and University of Minnesota.", "title": "MDH: Minnesota's Uninsured Rate At Historic Low"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsminnesota.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/mn-uninsured-rate-at-historic-low-feb-29-2016.jpg?w=1280", "description": "The number of people in Minnesota without health insurance is at an all-time low, according to a report from the Minnesota Health Department and University of Minnesota.", "site": "/wcco", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MDH: Minnesota's Uninsured Rate At Historic Low"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Minnesota, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "WCCO | CBS Minnesota", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota", "author": "http://facebook.com/CBSMinnesota"}, "keywords": "university of minnesota, u of m, the u, minnesota department of health, mdh, uninsured, minnesotans uninsured, rate of uninsured minnesotans, gov. mark dayton, health insurance, minnesota health insurance", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/306ed083e68aa1a8027608b8156838d2?s=16", "news_keywords": "university of minnesota, u of m, the u, minnesota department of health, mdh, uninsured, minnesotans uninsured, rate of uninsured minnesotans, gov. mark dayton, health insurance, minnesota health insurance"}, "article_summary": "MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) \u2013 For 10 years, self-employed artists Ken Avidor and his wife lived the gamble without health insurance.\n\u201cAll groups of Minnesotans, regardless of income, race or ethnic group or age, reported improvements in health insurance coverage,\u201d Ehlinger said.\nA recent University of Minnesota survey of 11,000 households found that the number of uninsured in the state is at an all-time low.\nFrom a high of 9 percent without coverage in 2011, Minnesota\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen to 4.3 percent of the population, or about 234,000 residents.\nBy enrolling in the state\u2019s MNsure health insurance exchange, they became covered and helped push down the number of Minnesotans living on the edge."}
