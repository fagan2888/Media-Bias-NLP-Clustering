The company said revenues are expected to reach $143 billion this year, and specifically credited \u201cmore effective and more modern approaches\u201d for the windfall.\n\nWhat are UnitedHealth\u2019s \u201cmore effective and more modern approaches\u201d? Stripped of the self-congratulatory press releases, this dividend translates into something more worrisome for the tens of thousands of cancer patients dealing with rising copays, restricted coverage and all too often, access denied completely.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat\u2019s why cancer advocacy organizations are taking action, pressing Congress and state legislatures to cap co-pays on specialty medicines and ensure equality of access and insurance coverage for all anticancer regimens. To date, 39 states have enacted oral chemotherapy access laws, while 15 states and the District of Columbia have either introduced or passed bills to limit what patients pay for specialty medicines.\n\nAsk patients where these actions are necessary and you\u2019re likely to hear about the detested practice of health plans requiring patients to use medication after medication until their insurance company agrees to pay for the drug actually prescribed by their doctor. Insurers have a benign term for this: \u201cstep therapy.\u201d But cancer advocacy organizations call it something else: \u201cfail first.\u201d\n\nNot only is this practice unjust, multiple studies show it increases costs to the health care system \u2013 particularly for hospital and emergency-room care \u2014 while compromising patient treatment.\n\nAnother onerous strategy is placing newer medicines (especially biologics) into \u201cspecialty tiers\u201d \u2013 another dressed-up code word for patients having to pay up to 50 percent of the total cost of these therapies. This can cause patients to spend thousands of dollars for a single drug that is medically necessary, opt for less effective drugs or choose not to fill their prescriptions at all.\n\nThen, there is the ritual of insurers covering the costs of intravenous or injectable chemotherapy drugs when patients are treated in a physician\u2019s office or hospital, but not a major portion of the costs when patients take oral cancer drugs at home. The insurance preference for invasive infusions and harsher side effects is simply unfathomable to many patients.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates, as much as 25 percent of oral anticancer medicine costs is shifted to patients in higher co-pays \u2013 as much as hundreds or thousands of dollars per month. As a result, almost 10 percent of insured patients don\u2019t fill their initial prescriptions for these medications. They want to \u2013 they just can\u2019t afford to.\n\nTen percent of cancer patients denied access to treatments their doctors prescribe and they need is no rounding error \u2013 it\u2019s a national crisis.\n\nDespite these facts, UnitedHealth and other insurers are blocking patients\u2019 path to novel therapies because they say the price of new, targeted medicines is \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d This may make short-term sense for the bottom line and the stock price, but it is hurting patients and damaging the broader economy.\n\nBut there is a simple solution for UnitedHealth and other health plans to solve this crisis. According to an analysis released last month by the Millman financial consulting firm, capping copays for many plans would increase premiums by less than 0.5 percent. For other plans, there are market-based ways to offset costs by increasing the copays for doctor visits by just $5.\n\nThese solutions also pay back: According to one analysis, innovative treatments and breakthrough cancer medicines are associated with 50 million life years saved over the last 15 years. The improved outcomes and increased survivability have reduced spending on hospital and physician care, amount to an economic gain of $1.2 million per person, and countless additional tax payments as employees live and work longer.\n\nRight now a patient revolution is going on in this country, but it need not be at war with the insurance industry. By all means, let UnitedHealth grow its business and expand its bottom line. We don\u2019t want to take away the insurance industry\u2019s profits \u2013 all we ask is that while doing very well from patient premiums, insurers do some good for patient access, too.\n\nWilcox is the Public Policy director of Vital Options International, a national non-profit organization focusing on improving the lives of all Americans living with cancer.
