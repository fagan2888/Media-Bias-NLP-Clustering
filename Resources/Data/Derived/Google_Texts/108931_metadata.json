The RNC blared, \u201cHILLARY CLINTON DISPARAGED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BEFORE SHE ADOPTED IT IN 2008 AND IN OBAMACARE.\u201d Politico headlined, \u201cHillary Clinton dissed individual mandate, docs show.\u201d \u201cClinton criticized individual mandate,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\nBut that\u2019s just not true \u2014 not by a long shot. The administration\u2019s 1993 health care proposal, Health Security Act, relied heavily on an employer mandate, but it also included an individual responsibility component. \u201cIn accordance with this Act, each eligible individual (other than a Medicare-eligible individual) must enroll in an applicable health plan for the individual, and must pay any premium required, consistent with this Act, with respect to such enrollment,\u201d section 1002 (a) states. Individuals who did not enroll in a plan would have been auto-enrolled in insurance once they sought health care services and paid twice the back premium in penalty.\n\n\u201c[T]he individual will be responsible for making a contribution, but the employer will also be supporting that contribution,\u201d Clinton explained during testimony before the Senate Finance Committee in 1993. \u201cEvery individual will have to take responsibility and pay something, and that is where two-thirds of the financing for premiums will come from.\u201d In a back-and-forth with former Sen. John Chafee (R-RI) \u2014 the architect of the Republican alternative \u2014 Clinton conceded that the administration\u2019s proposal includes the individual requirement:\n\nSEN. JOHN H. CHAFEE (R-RI): Your plan does have an individual mandate to the extent of the 20 percent. MRS. CLINTON: Yes, sir. SEN. CHAFEE: In other words, the individual is responsible for paying a portion of his or her \u2014 the employee \u2014 insurance. Whereas ours makes the individual 100 percent, yours makes him 20 percent. So it\u2019s a difference of degree more than the total difference. MRS. CLINTON: That\u2019s right.\n\nWatch it:\n\n)\n\nFormer Clinton administration officials who worked closely with administration in drafting the proposal explained that the Clintons strongly disagreed with the GOP\u2019 push to require individuals to pay for all of their health care costs and sought to build on the existing health care system and bolster the role of the employer in providing coverage. As Hillary Clinton explained before the Committee, the administration feared that without a companion employer requirement, \u201cthe numbers of people who currently are insured through their employment will decrease, because there will no longer be any reason for many employers who have struggled to ensure their workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople remember the employer mandate in the Clinton plan, but it had both,\u201d Judy Feder, a Georgetown professor who helped craft the Clinton plan, told ThinkProgress. \u201cHillary Clinton has been on this for years.\u201d\n\nThe former first lady was also prescient about the politics of the individual requirement. Public opinion polls from the time showed that most Americans believed that employers should contribute to their employees\u2019 health care coverage, leading Republican leadership to quickly sour on their own alternative. As Sen. Bob Dole admitted on Meet The Press, the \u201cindividual mandates aren\u2019t going to pass.\u201d \u201cI see about three votes for individual mandates on the Finance Committee.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "No, Hillary Clinton did not oppose the individual mandate in 1993.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "No, Hillary Clinton did not oppose the individual mandate in 1993.", "title": "The Campaign Begins: Media Seizes On Hillary\u2019s Health Care Statements From Two Decades Ago", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/11/3386751/hillary-individual-mandate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Hillary-Clinton-1993.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No, Hillary Clinton did not oppose the individual mandate in 1993.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Hillary-Clinton-1993-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Campaign Begins: Media Seizes On Hillary\u2019s Health Care Statements From Two Decades Ago", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Hillary-Clinton-1993.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Hillary-Clinton-1993.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-11T09:47:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2675\"", "article_summary": "Health The Campaign Begins: Media Seizes On Hillary\u2019s Health Care Statements From Two Decades Ago CREDIT:The recent release of Clinton administration papers by the Clinton Presidential Library has raised speculation that then-First Lady Hillary Clinton opposed a central tenet of the Affordable Care Act while trying to sell Bill Clinton\u2019s health care reform bill.\nThe RNC blared, \u201cHILLARY CLINTON DISPARAGED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BEFORE SHE ADOPTED IT IN 2008 AND IN OBAMACARE.\u201d Politico headlined, \u201cHillary Clinton dissed individual mandate, docs show.\u201d \u201cClinton criticized individual mandate,\u201d The Hill reported.\nThe administration\u2019s 1993 health care proposal, Health Security Act, relied heavily on an employer mandate, but it also included an individual responsibility component.\n\u201cHillary Clinton has been on this for years.\u201dThe former first lady was also prescient about the politics of the individual requirement.\nPublic opinion polls from the time showed that most Americans believed that employers should contribute to their employees\u2019 health care coverage, leading Republican leadership to quickly sour on their own alternative."}
