The federal support for fiscal year 2014, which doesn\u2019t go to the ALS Association but funds ALS research, is $40 million, down from $47 million in fiscal year 2010.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 9 Most Amazing ALS Ice Bucket Challenges\n\nThe funding cuts were caused by the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nLast year, the ALS Association raised a comparatively paltry $2.6 million between July 29 and August 26. Donations have skyrocketed in the past week to an average of $9 million a day.\n\n\u201cThe ALS Association looks forward to funding its present mission priorities of research, care services and public policy while also considering new projects to move the needle on finding treatments and a cure for the disease,\u201d an ALS Association\u2019s spokesperson told The Fiscal Times in an email. \u201cWhen people look back in 10 and 20 years, the Ice Bucket Challenge will be seen as a real game-changer for this cause.\u201d\n\nNot only is the ice bucket challenge taking in huge amounts of money, but it\u2019s being embraced by a wide array of people, including politicians and celebrities.\n\nRelated: How ALS Hijacked the Ice Bucket Challenge and Raised Millions\n\nLast week, President George W. Bush took the ice bucket challenge. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan poured a bucket of ice on Andrea Mitchell, his wife, last week. And former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney took the ice bucket challenge this weekend, helped along by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), his former running mate.\n\nEven Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, took the challenge, surrounded by her family.\n\nThe challenge is also gaining popularity beyond our borders. In Canada, more than $6 million has been raised, and in Europe, French singer Johnny Hallyday took the challenge last week.\n\nIn the challenge, people call on friends and family to dump a bucket of ice water on their heads and/or make a donation to the ALS Association to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease. Those taking the challenge post videos online and call on even more people to continue the chain.\n\nRelated: Pot and Ice Buckets Are New Business School Props\n\nALS is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, eventually leading to a loss of muscle control. Death often occurs within two to five years of diagnosis, as there\u2019s no cure currently available. Only one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration modestly extends survival.\n\nCurrently about 30,000 Americans have ALS and an average of 15 people are newly diagnosed every day. ALS is responsible for two deaths per 100,000 people. The ALS Association uses donations to provide care services to assist people with ALS and their families and to fund research across the world.\n\nClick Here to see The 9 Most Amazing ALS Ice Bucket Challenges.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The ALS Association is raising so much money from the ice bucket challenge that it is more than filling the gap left by federal budget cuts that affected ALS research funding in 2011.", "title": "Ice Bucket Challenge Pulls In Over $88M to ALS Cause", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/26/Ice-Bucket-Challenge-Pulls-Over-88M-ALS-Cause", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Bill-Gates_ice_bucket.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/26/Ice-Bucket-Challenge-Pulls-Over-88M-ALS-Cause", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Bill-Gates_ice_bucket.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The ALS Association is raising so much money from the ice bucket challenge that it is more than filling the gap left by federal budget cuts that affected ALS research funding in 2011.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb4a\"", "article_summary": "Related: How ALS Hijacked the Ice Bucket Challenge and Raised MillionsLast week, President George W.
