Summers withdrew Sunday from consideration as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nMr. Summers, a key architect of the Obama administration\u2019s economic stimulus plan in 2009, informed President Obama of his decision in a phone call Sunday morning. Mr. Obama said in a statement that he accepted the decision.\n\nMr. Obama said said he \u201cwill always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Fed likely to slow bond buys despite tepid economy\n\n\u201cLarry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom, and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe move leaves Janet Yellen, vice chairwoman of the Fed, as the obvious front-runner to replace Chairman Ben S. Bernanke when his term expires in January. Mr. Summers was said to have been Mr. Obama\u2019s leading candidate.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t give a reason for Mr. Summers\u2018 withdrawal, but the prospects for his nomination dimmed last week when a top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, announced that he wouldn\u2019t support Mr. Summers. A spokeswoman for Mr. Tester said that the senator \u201cbelieves we need a consensus-builder to lead the Federal Reserve\u201d and that he was \u201cconcerned about Mr. Summers\u2018 history of helping to deregulate financial markets.\u201d\n\nMr. Summers, a former White House economic adviser, recently reached out to another key Democrat on the committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachussetts, as the debate intensified over his potential nomination.\n\nOpposition from women\u2019s groups also was damaging Mr. Summers\u2018 candidacy. He came under fire for a controversy in 2005, while he was president of Harvard University, by suggesting that women were not as capable as men in math and science.\n\nWomen\u2019s groups have raised concerns over the lack of women in top posts in the administration. If chosen, Ms. Yellen would be the first woman to lead the Fed.\n\nAs Mr. Tester suggested, Mr. Summers also sparked opposition over his support while secretary of the treasury under President Clinton for removing barriers that prevented financial institutions from consolidating their banking and investment subsidiaries.\n\nSenators of both parties were opposed to his nomination, and many lawmakers wrote Mr. Obama a letter this summer urging him to appoint Ms. Yellen.\n\nOther Democrats who were expected to join Mr. Tester in opposing Mr. Summers\u2018 nomination were Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Ms. Warren.\n\nTheir opposition could have left Mr. Obama in the position of needing Republican support just to get Mr. Summers\u2018 nomination out of the banking committee. Democrats hold 12 of 22 seats on the committee.\n\nMs. Yellen\u2019s service in government includes a stint on Mr. Clinton\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers in the late 1990s. From 2004 to 2011 she was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She has served as Fed vice chair since 2010.\n\nAnother possible candidate for the job is Donald Kohn, who is retired from the Fed board.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facing opposition from women's groups and key Democratic senators, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.
