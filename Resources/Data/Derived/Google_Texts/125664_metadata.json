Hawley, the author of the brief, argues that the case is about not contraception, but \u201cthe principles of liberty that animate our Constitution.\u201d\n\nCiting \u201cthis court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby,\u201d Hawley, a former clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts, argues that \u201cbusinesswomen\u2014whether they operate for-profit or non-profit ventures\u2014do not check their religious liberty rights at the office door.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, the deeply personal choices about when life begins and whether or not to use birth control are decisions for women and their families, not the government. IWF therefore urges this court to grant this petition and to decide whether the HHS \u2018accommodation\u2019 discriminates among religious organizations in violation of the First Amendment,\u201d Hawley wrote.\n\nShe also claims that the Department of Health and Human Services discriminates against some religious employers because it makes exemptions to the contraceptive mandate for some and not others.\n\nHadley Heath Manning, the director of health policy for the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, said in a statement that \u201c[a]s with the Hobby Lobby case, this case is about more than contraception.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is about the principles of liberty that animate our Constitution. It is about empowering women to choose the health care and salary options that best fit their needs. And it is about empowering charitable employers, many lead by women, to follow their deeply held religious convictions\u2014regardless of the form of their charitable entity,\u201d Manning said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This case is about more than contraception.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"This case is about more than contraception.\u201d", "title": "Women's Group Files Brief in Support of Little Sisters of the Poor", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150826_IWF_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-02T23:34:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Kqopay"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"This case is about more than contraception.\u201d", "title": "Women's Group Files Brief in Support of Little Sisters of the Poor", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150826_IWF_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-09-02T11:05:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T23:34:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Independent Women\u2019s Forum, IWF, Supreme Court, SCOTUS, Little Sisters of the Poor, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, contraception mandate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c4a\"", "article_summary": "The Independent Women\u2019s Forum has filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court in support of the Little Sisters of the Poor.\nIt is about empowering women to choose the health care and salary options that best fit their needs.\nAnd it is about empowering charitable employers, many lead by women, to follow their deeply held religious convictions\u2014regardless of the form of their charitable entity,\u201d Manning said.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns who care for the elderly poor, have petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that they must comply with the Obamacare contraception mandate by authorizing a third party to provide contraception and abortifacient drugs to their employees.\nIWF therefore urges this court to grant this petition and to decide whether the HHS \u2018accommodation\u2019 discriminates among religious organizations in violation of the First Amendment,\u201d Hawley wrote."}
