The leadership\u2019s 2017 budget plan is stalled. And legislation to overhaul the Federal Aviation Administration hasn\u2019t left the runway.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith all the attention showered on Ryan\u2019s non-interest in running for president, it\u2019s easy to overlook the new speaker\u2019s troubles running the House these days.\n\nAlmost six months into the job, Ryan and his top lieutenants face questions about whether the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s tenure atop the House is any more effective than that of his predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Ryan has flattered the House Freedom Caucus and pursued promises to empower rank-and-file Republicans with reforms to how the House operates \u2014 yet it\u2019s yielded little in the way of actual results.\n\nDemocrats are openly mocking their GOP counterparts, and Republicans grumble \u2014 in private so far \u2014 that nothing is getting done under Ryan. Like Boehner, Ryan is finding out that becoming speaker is easier than being speaker, at least in the still badly divided House GOP Conference.\n\nThe rise of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump \u2014 which has shocked GOP leaders on Capitol Hill as much as it has Republican heavyweights nationwide \u2014 has also injected more uncertainty into the legislative process. With the party base so unsettled, rank-and-file GOP members don\u2019t want to do anything that could alienate pro-Trump voters back home. \u201cDon\u2019t piss anyone off\u201d has become the unofficial mantra for Republicans, which has led to paralysis.\n\nNo House Republican wants to openly criticize Ryan. And there\u2019s no question he is more popular than Boehner was at the end of his five-year run leading the House.\n\nBut there are complaints that Ryan has worked so hard to accommodate disaffected conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and elsewhere \u2014 the same crew that took out Boehner and blocked Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from moving up to speaker \u2014 that he risks coming up empty-handed. With the House majority in jeopardy this year, as Ryan has admitted in his own fundraising appeals, some Republicans want a stronger hand atop the chamber.\n\nTo them, the time for conciliation is over.\n\n\u201cI think Boehner would have listened to it for a little bit, given everybody a chance to chew on it and swallow it and spit it out, and then he would have just taken it to the damn floor,\u201d said one Republican on condition of anonymity, contrasting Ryan\u2019s style with Boehner\u2019s. \u201cI think [Ryan] has underestimated the opposition to getting anything done.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican said the GOP Conference \u201cis unwhippable and unleadable. Ryan is as talented as you can be: There\u2019s nobody better. But even he can\u2019t do anything. Who could?\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s difficulties have come into sharp relief this week. With federal taxes due Monday, he and House Republicans dubbed it \u201cIRS Week.\u201d GOP leaders set up a series of votes to bash the troubled tax agency, including a bill to prevent the IRS from hiring new employees until it could certify no one working there owed back taxes.\n\nBut it\u2019s all been overshadowed by the failure to make headway on the GOP\u2019s larger agenda.\n\nA House bill to address the Puerto Rico crisis is bogged down in committee after some Republicans cried \u201cbailout,\u201d despite Ryan\u2019s insistence the measure is no such thing. The GOP-drafted budget has been stalled for weeks because of objections from conservatives still upset over last year\u2019s spending deal with President Barack Obama and Democrats. That\u2019s led to a delay taking up the dozen annual appropriations bills until mid-May.\n\nA continuing resolution to keep the federal government open past Sept. 30 was likely in any case. But the holdup on spending bills \u2014 and a seven-week recess the House is set to take in July and August \u2014 means a continuing resolution to fund agencies is all but certain at this point. The only question is whether there will be a broader spending deal after Election Day, and what an agreement would look like.\n\nIndeed, 2016, which always figured to be light on legislative accomplishments, is proving to be a virtual wasteland on the House side.\n\nOnly 40 legislative days remain before the House adjourns for the national conventions, and nothing substantive is expected to happen until a projected lame-duck session in November. House Republicans won\u2019t shut down the government in September, but they\u2019re not going to do much else.\n\n\u201cEven under a different speaker, the deep divisions among House Republicans continue to prevent them from getting their work done,\u201d House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said. \u201cThey have failed to pass a budget, the House has yet to take up legislation to address the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, and their plan to begin considering appropriations bills in April will not happen. From the government shutdown to taking our nation to the brink of default, House Republicans have shown again and again that they are incapable of governing \u2014 and it\u2019s no different under a new speaker.\u201d\n\nAides to Ryan say everyone always knew the legislative deck would be stacked against House Republicans this year, with the battle for the White House in full swing and Senate Republicans in jeopardy of losing their short-lived majority.\n\n\u201cSince Speaker Ryan took the gavel six months ago, the House of Representatives has been very productive and members are excited to roll out our \u2018confident America\u2019 policy agenda for 2017,\u201d AshLee Strong, Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n\nWhile Ryan received well-deserved credit for clinching December\u2019s $1.1 trillion tax and spending deal, much of the framework for that agreement had been put in place by Boehner when he struck a deal with Obama before resigning as speaker at the end of October.\n\nRyan has scored some wins this year. Republicans finally put a bill calling for Obamacare\u2019s repeal on the president\u2019s desk, though it was, of course, vetoed. New sanctions on North Korea have been approved, as has a permanent ban on taxing Internet access. Other highlights include a bill to broaden public information on sex offenders; reforms for Zika vaccines; and a measure to pressure the Obama administration to declare that the Islamic State is involved in genocide.\n\nAdditionally, Ryan has gone to great lengths to dial back tensions with the Freedom Caucus and other hard-line conservatives. Going beyond standard GOP Conference meetings, he\u2019s instituted weekly meetings with broad-based groups of rank-and-file lawmakers to make them feel more involved and listened to. The speaker has thrown himself into fundraising, raking in more than $17 million in the first three months of this year, a staggering haul.\n\nRepublicans also pin blame for their problems on Obama, even when the president has no direct role in provoking squabbles among congressional Republicans.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, you have a disaster of a president who is not willing to compromise in any way, shape or form, and who is going to issue new regulations every day he can,\u201d said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chief deputy majority whip. \u201cSo the difficulty of legislating in this environment is extraordinarily high.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan is doing exactly what we asked him to do,\u201d added Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). \u201cThat\u2019s to communicate broadly to the public why we think a conservative vision for the country is attractive. He\u2019s doing a good job of that. He\u2019s working substantively through the committees of the House and trying to bring back regular order.\u201d\n\nRyan does hope to move on some key issues in coming weeks. A House version of legislation to address the nation\u2019s opiate crisis will likely hit the floor next month, though it will then have to be reconciled with a Senate version. A bipartisan bill to limit what emails Internet providers can turn over to government agencies is set to be taken up soon. And efforts to rein in new Obama administration regulations on brokers who handle retirement accounts, overtime pay and \u201cjoint employers\u201d will also see a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan-appointed task forces are slated to release proposals by late May or early June for replacing Obamacare and reforming the tax code. The plans will become the centerpiece of Ryan\u2019s vision for House Republicans, though none are expected to be voted on this year, and they have no chance of being enacted if they do.\n\n\u201cPaul is trying to define what the Republican Party is for the public out there, but sort of reassure us up here,\u201d said Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.). \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a good Republican, yet you just don\u2019t know anymore. If you read your Facebook page, you get called all these names and stuff like that. \u2026 I feel like I\u2019m a good Republican; at least I haven\u2019t gone back on what I ran on. But I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Almost six months into the job, the new speaker is struggling to advance an agenda.", "title": "Paul Ryan's House of woes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/paul-ryan-house-speaker-republicans-222098", "image": "http://static.politico.com/75/c1/4a41ba2e415e810a2ff5fae2e8b3/160418-paul-ryan-1-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Almost six months into the job, the new speaker is struggling to advance an agenda.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "House Republicans won\u2019t shut down the government in September, but they\u2019re not going to do much else.\n\u201cEven under a different speaker, the deep divisions among House Republicans continue to prevent them from getting their work done,\u201d House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.)\nLike Boehner, Ryan is finding out that becoming speaker is easier than being speaker, at least in the still badly divided House GOP Conference.\nThe plans will become the centerpiece of Ryan\u2019s vision for House Republicans, though none are expected to be voted on this year, and they have no chance of being enacted if they do.\nA House bill to address the Puerto Rico crisis is bogged down in committee after some Republicans cried \u201cbailout,\u201d despite Ryan\u2019s insistence the measure is no such thing."}
