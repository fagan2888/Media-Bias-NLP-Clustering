Scott Brown (R-Mass.), on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, talking about health care policy\n\nAt one stop, he suggested repealing Obamacare but letting New Hampshire\u2019s beneficiaries be \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d so they don\u2019t lose coverage.\n\nFormer Sen. Scott Brown\u2019s (R-Mass.) spokesperson, also on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, almost immediately thereafter\n\nA spokeswoman walked that back in a subsequent conversation. \u201cYou can\u2019t grandfather people from something you\u2019re fully repealing,\u201d she said, emphasizing Brown\u2019s intent to wipe out Obamacare before entertaining a replacement.\n\nRemember, Scott Brown isn\u2019t a novice. He\u2019s a former U.S. senator. He\u2019s run for statewide office three times \u2013 in two states \u2013 over just four years, giving him plenty of time to hone his skills as a candidate and answer glaringly obvious questions. He\u2019s basing much of his campaign platform on health care policy, despite the fact that he doesn\u2019t actually have a health care policy of his own and doesn\u2019t seem to have the foggiest idea what he\u2019s talking about when addressing the health care policy he ostensibly opposes.\n\nIn this case, I\u2019m not altogether sure what he was even trying to say. Brown seems to realize there are many Americans who currently benefit from the Affordable Care Act, and he also seems to realize they\u2019d suffer if he successfully repeals the entirety of the law. So maybe they\u2019d be \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d? How would that work, exactly? According to his own aide, it wouldn\u2019t work at all, which is why we\u2019re apparently supposed to disregard what the candidate says about the candidate\u2019s policy positions.\n\nM eanwhile, Brown refuses to give an opinion on Medicaid expansion in his new, adopted home state of New Hampshire, which again, is an odd posture for a candidate basing his Senate campaign on health care policy.\n\nGreg Sargent called it \u201c epic buffoonery ,\u201d which seems more than fair under the circumstances.\n\nIn the meantime, Brown continues to face questions as to why he lobbied his former colleagues to kill an energy-efficiency bill sponsored by his rival, incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). Ryan Grim reported yesterday on Brown reaching out to the New Hampshire senator he\u2019d serve with if he\u2019s elected, who apparently didn\u2019t find him especially persuasive.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) explained Thursday why she voted to support legislation by her Democratic counterpart, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), despite a call from a fellow Republican who opposed the bill. \u201cI just did what I thought was best based on my state and voted the way I thought I should,\u201d Ayotte told The Huffington Post.\n\nThe headline on Grim\u2019s piece probably isn\u2019t the one Brown was hoping for: \u201cKelly Ayotte Says She Ignored Scott Brown\u2019s Wishes For The Good Of New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown was in Las Vegas last night, appearing \u201cbefore some of the wealthiest people on earth at the annual hedge fund confab at the Bellagio Hotel.\u201d The former senator was paid for his appearance, though his campaign refused to say how much.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Every time it seems Scott Brown couldn't possibly get any worse as a Senate candidate, he manages to kick things up a notch.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-brown-still-struggling-badly", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Every time it seems Scott Brown couldn't possibly get any worse as a Senate candidate, he manages to kick things up a notch.", "title": "Scott Brown still struggling badly with the basics", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-brown-still-struggling-badly", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/nh_senate_brown.jpeg-07236.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Scott Brown still struggling badly with the basics", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-brown-still-struggling-badly", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/nh_senate_brown.jpeg-07236.jpg?itok=sQhFqViP", "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Every time it seems Scott Brown couldn't possibly get any worse as a Senate candidate, he manages to kick things up a notch."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-05-16T11:33:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Every time it seems Scott Brown couldn't possibly get any worse as a Senate candidate, he manages to kick things up a notch.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Scott Brown still struggling badly with the basics", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-brown-still-struggling-badly", "published": 1, "date": "05/16/2014 11:33:00 EDT", "tags": "election-2014,elections,new-hampshire,scott-brown,rachel-maddow-show"}, "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2014, New Hampshire, Scott Brown"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf71\"", "article_summary": "Former Sen.
