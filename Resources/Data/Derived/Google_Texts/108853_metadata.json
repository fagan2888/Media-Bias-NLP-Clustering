PAYC is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 3. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.5%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\n\n\nFactors to Consider\n\n\n\nPaycom Software reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, with its top and bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favorable.\n\n\n\nRevenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.\n\n\n\nWe believe that higher traction of Paycom Software\u2019s Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company. Also, Paycom Software might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues,.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation PCTY, Intuit Inc. and Paychex, Inc. remains a headwind.\n\n\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\n\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paycom Software is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.\n\n\n\nZacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Paycom Software is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 20 cents per share.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank: Paycom Software has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company\u2019s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.\n\n\n\nWe caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.\n\n\n\nStocks to Consider\n\n\n\nHere are some other companies, which are worth considering as our model shows that they have the right combination of the two elements needed to post an earnings beat:\n\n\n\nSynopsys Inc. SNPS, with an Earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)\n\n\n\nFitbit Inc. FIT, with an Earnings ESP of +175.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
