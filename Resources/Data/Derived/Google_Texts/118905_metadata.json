NeuroLife reconnects the brain directly to muscles \u2014 allowing control of a paralyzed limb using thoughts.\n\nThe device is obviously complex, but it essentially interprets thoughts and brain signals using a direct connection to a sleeve that stimulates muscles controlling his arm and hand, according to Wexner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing for the first time that a quadriplegic patient is able to improve his level of motor function and hand movements,\u201d said Ali Rezai, M.D. and a co-author of the study, in the release.\n\nWearable Tattoo for A Better You\n\nIf you see someone walking around with what looks like a cushy white Band-Aid on, it might be monitoring their health rather than repairing a wound.\n\nBioStamp Research Connect, pictured right, developed by MC10 is a flexible wearable sensor that sticks to a person's body and can monitor electrical activity from skeletal muscles and produce a real-time ECG, according to an article in Tech Times. And the patch packs a big punch \u2014 it houses an accelerometer and gyroscope inside that is aimed toward researchers concerned with problems relating to motor skills, movement and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nA similar, consumer-focused patch \u2014 My UV Patch \u2014 tells users how long they\u2019ve been in the sun using dye that changes based on sun exposure and offers advice about tanning healthily, according to the same report.\n\nMaybe patches will be the new cool thing \u2014 if they can keep us healthy, why not?\n\nThe Future of Rx Bottles; End of Opioid Crisis?\n\nWhat if a patient could only access their pills during the time their doctor directed, and received only the exact dosage? The device, TAD, \u201ctake as directed\u201d is looking to put a tighter cap on prescription abuse.\n\nThe pill bottle of the future, developed by Intent Solutions, pictured left, houses a portable dispenser that contains a disposable vial attached to a pre-programmed reusable electronic device, according to a Palm Beach Post report.\n\nIt's programmed to the patient's prescribed regimen and biometric. TAD notifies the patient when to take the pill, scans their fingerprint, dispenses the pill and sends the data to an accompanying app and the company\u2019s cloud database for analysis.\n\nYou might ask, why not just break the device and grab the medication? TAD will report attempted access outside the programmed regimen and if the device is tampered with, according to the Post.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ve realized childproof caps aren\u2019t getting the job done anymore.\n\nDocs Track Patients With New App\n\nPatients in Vermont should know that big doctor may be watching them. Thanks to a federally backed pilot using the online app PatientPing, health care providers can know if a patient has entered an emergency room or if they\u2019ve been admitted to a hospital or nursing home, according to a News & Observer report.\n\nMost of the time docs find out about this sort of thing through phone calls or faxes, which may never reach the doctor directly, leaving discharged patients vulnerable to getting lost in the system.\n\nManager of the care coordination program for Community Health Accountable Care, Debra Gaylord says she can now get medical visit information in real-time and provide the proper support for discharged patients so they don\u2019t return to the hospital if it\u2019s not needed.\n\nThe app is part of a pilot program supported by a $45 million federal grant to the state. It is used in six states so far, but Vermont is the first to test it statewide, according to News & Observer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "years ago, 24-year old Ian Burkhart was paralyzed in a driving accident, but now a device called NeuroLife is helping him swipe a credit card and play guitar hero, according to a Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center release.
