AIR FORCE ACADEMY — The message was clear after the first race of the Class 5A boys state swimming and diving championships. The Boulder schools were not to be ignored.

The 200-yard medley relay started the festivities at the Natatorium on the Air Force Academy grounds, and it was Boulder High School that stood above all others in the event. Fairview refused to be left out and came away with a win of its own as the two schools both cracked the top five in the team race.

"Boulder High has finished in the top five only twice," Panthers swimmer Christian Feiler said. "We're really happy with the result, tying our best finish ever at state. So we can't be too bummed."

The initial race is what gave Boulder the surge of energy it needed to stay competitive in the meet. By the time Feiler hit the water, he had some ground to make up if he was going to come away with the win.

He was quick to point out that he wasn't just swimming for himself, but for three of his best friends in Chris Nicholson, Mick Bartholomew and P.J. Stapleton.

"I saw right when I dove in that I made up a little bit of ground," he said. "At the turn I saw I was even so I knew we could do it with the crowd behind us and the team there for us."

Feiler's day wasn't done after the relay. He went on to the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 20.67 seconds. Those two races were a huge factor in Boulder finishing with 177 points on the day for a fourth place finish.

Right over their shoulders was rival Fairview, which was hoping to at least match its third place finish from a year ago. The Knights were hoping to get a huge boost from Michael Zarian in the 200-yard individual medley and the 500-yard freestyle. Zarian had the fastest qualifying time of the individual medley group, coming at 1:52.19.

His finals time was over a quarter of a second faster, but he finished second to Pomona's Keefan Foulke who torpedoed through the field with a time of 1:50.13.

"Right before the race, I was really nervous. Maybe that threw me off," Zarian said. "Keegan did really well and I'm really proud of him."

Zarian was able to shake off the loss and get himself focused for the 500-yard freestyle, which was a major factor in keeping his team in the top five for overall points. The Knights finished with 149 points on the day.

"His love is the 500 freestyle," Knights coach Amy Webb said. "He was going for in the IM but winning the 500 was really really big for him."

Part of the reason for Fairview falling back two spots from where they were a year ago is the youth of the team.

The future looks good for the program with Zarian looking to back for his junior year and lead a team that now has experience in competing with the top teams at the state meet.

"I'm perfectly fine with (our finish)," fellow sophomore Justin Li said. "Everyone had amazing swims and I think we had great morale today."
