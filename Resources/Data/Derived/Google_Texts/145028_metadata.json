(AP) - A Montana man is charged with threatening to shoot a boy for sharing information about a subplot of the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie during an online conversation.\n\nArthur Charles Roy, of Helena, was charged with felony assault with a weapon Monday during an appearance in Lewis and Clark County Justice Court. He remains jailed with his bail set at $10,000.\n\nMr. Roy, 18, became angry Thursday when he learned details about \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d from a Facebook friend, prosecutors said.\n\nMr. Roy sent the friend a picture of himself with a gun and threatened to come to the victim\u2019s school to shoot him, court records said. Mr. Roy reportedly said the gun was a Colt 1911 with a \u201chair trigger.\u201d\n\nThe friend called a school resource officer Thursday afternoon to report the threat.\n\nHelena\u2019s alternative high school was locked down Friday morning after students said they were afraid Mr. Roy might follow through with his threat. Police arrested Mr. Roy on Friday afternoon. He declined to answer questions on the advice of his attorney, court records said.\n\nMr. Roy\u2019s mother asked why her son was being arrested since it was only a BB gun in the photo, charging documents said.\n\nChris Abbott, Mr. Roy\u2019s public defender in an ongoing separate case, wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment Tuesday. It\u2019s not clear if Mr. Abbott has been assigned to this case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Montana man is charged with threatening to shoot a boy for sharing information about a subplot of the new \"Star Wars\" movie during an online conversation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Montana man is charged with threatening to shoot a boy for sharing information about a subplot of the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie during an online conversation.", "title": "Arthur Charles Roy, Montana man, jailed after threatening boy over \u2018Star Wars\u2019 spoiler", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/22/helena-man-charged-with-threat-over-star-wars-spoi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/Star_Wars-Box_Office.JPEG-0b70a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/18/Star_Wars-Box_Office.JPEG-0b70a.jpg", "title": "Arthur Charles Roy, Montana man, jailed after threatening boy over", "description": "A Montana man is charged with threatening to shoot a boy for sharing information about a subplot of the new \"Star Wars\" movie during an online conversation.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Arthur Charles Roy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2777\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - A Montana man is charged with threatening to shoot a boy for sharing information about a subplot of the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie during an online conversation.\nMr. Roy, 18, became angry Thursday when he learned details about \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d from a Facebook friend, prosecutors said.\nPolice arrested Mr. Roy on Friday afternoon.\nHelena\u2019s alternative high school was locked down Friday morning after students said they were afraid Mr. Roy might follow through with his threat.\nArthur Charles Roy, of Helena, was charged with felony assault with a weapon Monday during an appearance in Lewis and Clark County Justice Court."}
