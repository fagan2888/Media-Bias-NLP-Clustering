The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing a review of its multimillion-dollar anti-tobacco campaign.

The $50M-a-year account is handled by a group led by Plowshare Group, including Havas, GolinHarris, Toluna USA, the American Legacy Foundation, Arnold Worldwide and Elevacion. It was last put out for review in 2012 and the resulting pact with options expires this year.

The account is funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund of the Affordable Care Act, which has about $110M earmarked for anti-tobacco efforts like a media campaign and quitting hotlines.

GH's digital and media relations focus is estimated to be worth about $900K per year as the bulk of the pact, $29M+, is slated for media buys through Havas. The American Legacy Foundation also works earned media and other promotions.

The CDC said an RFP is forthcoming and that any firm, regardless of size, will be able to submit a proposal.
