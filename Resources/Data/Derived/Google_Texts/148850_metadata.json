Patients, meanwhile, should stick to the facts of whatever is ailing them, giving their provider the data for diagnosis and treatment planning, without superfluous anecdotal detail.\n\nProfessional boundaries are certainly important. There is validity to the argument that doctors need to keep distance in order to make clear medical decisions, striving to minimize the biasing impact of emotion. And perhaps it is also true that patients benefit from some distance, in thinking of their doctor as an authority figure rather than a friend. But this obsession with boundaries has conspired with the pressures of efficiency and economy that constrain the health care system to remove some very personal (and important) elements of the patient-provider relationship.\n\nWe are far from the small town medicine of the past, when patients and doctors knew the details of each other\u2019s lives because their worlds intersected outside of the exam room.\n\nNowadays, in the 15-20 minute appointments that we are alloted, the patient-provider relationship can feel sterile and robotic. At its worst, it can feel antagonistic. Doctors are over-loaded and time constrained, with fear of litigation and the rules of HIPAA pressing in on them, and a payment model that rewards quantity over quality.\n\nPatients often feel hurried and neglected; overwhelmed by the task of presenting the frightening aspects of their health in the right way to get answers and treatment. Physician burnout is ubiquitous, as is patient dissatisfaction.\n\nIt is our belief that by highlighting the humanity of both individuals in the relationship, the patient-doctor bond can be strengthened, with increased satisfaction all around.\n\nTaking it one step further, we believe that reviving the humanity in this relationship will ultimately lead to better health outcomes.\n\nSo, here at Health Story Collaborative we\u2019ve designed a program in which a patient and a doctor come together to share and listen to one another\u2019s personal narratives. This new patient-provider model is a variation of our already existing Healing Story Sessions program. In short, our goal is to create a space where both patient and provider can be human.\n\nWe recently launched this project in collaboration with the Cambridge Health Alliance, with a grant from the Arnold P. Gold Foundation. We met on a Tuesday evening recently with Tracey Pratt, a woman with diabetes and her health care provider of many years, Dr. David Baron. As they shared their stories, an audience, including other diabetes patients, Dr. Baron\u2019s wife and other medical providers, listened on.\n\nWe worked with both speakers in advance to craft their narratives, encouraging personal refection as well as their thoughts about the their mutual relationship.\n\nTracey talked about her passion for teaching, her travel to the Great Wall of China, and about learning Merengue in Havana, Cuba. She also detailed some of the difficulties she had managing her diabetes.\n\nDavid told stories about growing up in rural Ohio, picking corn in the fields as a teenager, about his time in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, and his journey to becoming a doctor.\n\nHe also shared his wish to rescue people, something that being a doctor both satisfies and challenges.\n\nBoth discussed their experiences working together to manage Tracey\u2019s diabetes, and the inevitable challenges along the way.\n\nHearing these varied perspectives opened each participant up to the other\u2019s history, weaving their relationship into a broader pair of ongoing narratives. It also brought the other members of the group and the treatment team toward a better understanding of these two people who participate in their experience of struggling with diabetes.\n\nAs one patient in the audience put it, \u201chearing about my doctor\u2019s life and meeting his wife was a privilege.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about what listening to the stories taught them, audience member comments included \u201cEveryone is human. It is humbling\u201d and \u201cBoth the patient and the doctor have complex and real lives behind their official presentation.\u201d\n\nAs for Tracey and David, both found the experience to be quite meaningful and said that it will change their relationship in positive ways going forward.\n\nHow these changes continue to play out remains to be seen. But we feel this Patient-Provider Healing Story Session demonstrated the power of carving out space for a genuine, human connection between people struggling with illness and their doctors.\n\nOur hope is that running more sessions like this one will continue to impact the participants as well as introduce a different model of care in the broader health system.\n\nDr. Annie Brewster, M.D.is Founder and Executive Director of Health Story Collaborative.
