Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Ayad Akhtar, a Brookfield Central High School graduate, will join the Milwaukee Repertory Theater's associate artists roster.

The Rep will produce a play by Akhtar each of the next four seasons, including a commissioned world premiere, the Rep announced Saturday evening.

In 2013, Akhtar won the Pulitzer for drama for "Disgraced"; the Broadway production of "Disgraced" has been nominated for a Tony Award for best new play.

Akhtar is also a novelist, actor and screenwriter based in New York. "Themes of identity, assimilation and Muslim life in America run through all his works," Duane Dudek wrote in a 2012 profile of the playwright.

Akhtar's father, a cardiologist, and his mother, a retired radiologist, were born in Pakistan and moved to Wisconsin in the 1960s.

The Rep will begin its Akhtar cycle with a production of "The Invisible Hand" Feb. 24 through April 3, 2016.
