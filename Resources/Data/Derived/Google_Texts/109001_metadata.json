Michael Roberts of the Pleasant Grove police. The officers discovered the six other bodies.\n\nPhoto\n\nCaptain Roberts declined to comment on a motive or on what Ms. Huntsman said during an interview with investigators. He said that the estranged husband, whose name was not released, lived with Ms. Huntsman when the babies were born but was not considered a person of interest.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe he had any knowledge of the situation,\u201d Captain Roberts said. Asked how the husband could not have known about the bodies if he lived in the house, he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question. Amazing.\u201d\n\nThe bodies were sent to the Utah medical examiner\u2019s office for tests, including one to determine the cause of death. DNA samples taken from Ms. Huntsman and her husband were expected to determine whether the two were the parents, as investigators believe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe house, in a middle-class neighborhood, is owned by the husband\u2019s parents, and the man was cleaning out the garage when he made the discovery.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140413224419, "twitter": {"description": "A woman believed to be the mother was arrested on murder charges after the bodies were discovered in the garage of her former home.", "title": "Bodies of 7 Babies Found in Utah", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/us/bodies-of-7-babies-found-in-utah.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002823805"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/us/14Utah-2/14Utah-2-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/us/bodies-of-7-babies-found-in-utah.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002823805", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/us/bodies-of-7-babies-found-in-utah.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 13, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Murders and Attempted Murders,Utah,Huntsman  Megan,Child Abuse and Neglect,Pleasant Grove (Utah)", "description": "A woman believed to be the mother was arrested on murder charges after the bodies were discovered in the garage of her former home.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Associated Press", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/us/14Utah-2/14Utah-2-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Huntsman, Megan", "slug": "14utah", "byl": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A woman believed to be the mother was arrested on murder charges after the bodies were discovered in the garage of her former home.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/us/14Utah-2/14Utah-2-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Utah", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-05-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Pleasant Grove (Utah)", "published": "2014-04-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Pleasant Grove (Utah)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140510030005, "hdl_p": "Bodies of 7 Babies Found in Utah", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/us/bodies-of-7-babies-found-in-utah.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/us/14Utah-2/14Utah-2-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A woman believed to be the mother was arrested on murder charges after the bodies were discovered in the garage of her former home.", "title": "Bodies of 7 Babies Found in Utah"}, "pdate": 20140413, "des": "Child Abuse and Neglect", "articleid": 100000002823805, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Bodies of 7 Babies Found in Utah", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced37\"", "article_summary": "PhotoA Utah woman was arrested on murder charges on Sunday after the police discovered the bodies of seven babies stuffed in cardboard boxes in the garage of her former home.\nThe woman, Megan Huntsman, 39, who lived in the Utah home until three years ago, gave birth to the babies between 1996 and 2006, investigators believe.\nAmazing.\u201dThe bodies were sent to the Utah medical examiner\u2019s office for tests, including one to determine the cause of death.\nHe said that the estranged husband, whose name was not released, lived with Ms. Huntsman when the babies were born but was not considered a person of interest.\nDNA samples taken from Ms. Huntsman and her husband were expected to determine whether the two were the parents, as investigators believe."}
