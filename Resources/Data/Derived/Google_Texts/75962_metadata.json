The online repository of cat photos and \u201cWhich pop diva are you?\u201d polls came in dead last in the Pew Research Journalism Project\u2019s survey of how much trust Americans have in a variety of news outlets.\n\nThe survey, part of the Pew Research Center\u2019s ongoing examination of the partisan divide in the United States, had people rate themselves on a scale from \u201cconsistently conservative\u201d to \u201cconsistently liberal,\u201d and then asked them to assess the trustworthiness of three dozen different news outlets by placing each in one of three categories: \u201cmore trusted than distrusted,\u201d \u201cabout equally trusted as distrusted,\u201d and \u201cmore distrusted than trusted.\u201d\n\nRelated: Three Reasons Why a GOP \u2018Wave\u2019 Is Still Possible\n\nOne of the most striking findings is the vast gulf between the number of news sources generally trusted by liberals and those trusted by conservatives. People calling themselves consistently liberal said that they generally trusted 28 of the outlets in the survey. Consistent conservatives, on the other hand, trusted only 8.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was the only publication to win the trust of groups across the entire ideological spectrum. And, it is interesting to note that two of the most widely trusted news sources among Americans are actually British. The Economist magazine and the British Broadcasting Corporation both did well, failing only to earn the trust of consistent conservatives.\n\nRelated: Obama Gets Surprising Bump in Approval Despite Widespread Criticism\n\nAmong the major U.S. television networks, ABC came out the best, also trusted by all but the most conservative respondents. CBS, NBC, and CNN were trusted by liberals and those with \u201cmixed\u201d political views, but lost out among the mostly conservative and consistently conservative.\n\nTo circle back to Buzzfeed for a moment, in its defense, the site is more than cat GIFs and listicles. In the past year, the site has hired a stable of award-winning investigative reporters, and has begun producing serious journalism. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to spot between the Grumpy Cat pictures.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new Pew survey finds that liberals are far more open to trusting a variety of news sources than conservatives.
