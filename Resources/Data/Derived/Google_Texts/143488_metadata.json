Insurance companies are withdrawing in droves\n\nCommenting on the potential withdrawal from all Obamacare exchanges, UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said in an investor call Thursday morning \u201cWe cannot sustain these losses . . . We can\u2019t really subsidize a marketplace that doesn\u2019t appear at the moment to be sustaining itself.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, a critical element to Obamacare was the creation of co-ops in order to spur competition and create less expensive coverage for consumers. However, as Breitbart reported, with the recent closure of the Michigan Obamacare co-op, more \u201cthan half of the 23 original co-ops have now failed. Previous closures include the co-ops in Arizona, Utah, South Carolina, Colorado, Iowa/Nebraska, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Tennessee, Oregon, and Kentucky.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d was a brazen and cruel lie.\n\nObama repeatedly promised Americans \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d This may have been a catchy political phrase for approval of his senseless program but after millions of Americans had their plans cancelled Obama\u2019s infamous fabrication was named the 2013 PolitiFact Lie of the Year.\n\n3. Still waiting on that $2,500 in savings Obama promised you? You\u2019re not alone. Premiums are skyrocketing nationwide.\n\nAs a candidate in 2008, Obama boasted his healthcare plan would reduce the typical family\u2019s annual premiums by up to $2,500 per year. To the contrary, rates have skyrocketed. As Breitbart recently reported \u201cAcross the board, Obamacare premium prices are increasing 20.3 percent for 2016\u201d \u2013 this increase is on top of the more than 20 percent 2015 Obamacare hike.\n\n4. Obamacare customers say their plans are \u201cuseless\u201d due to soaring deductibles\n\nIn an effort to convince people to sign up for Obamacare, Obama officials have hyped low premiums available on the exchanges. Unfortunately, the sky-high deductibles are making these plan useless. The New York Times described a common experience of Obamacare consumers \u201cThe deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it impossible to actually go to the doctor,\u201d said David R. Reines, 60, of Jefferson Township, N.J., a former hardware salesman with chronic knee pain. \u201cWe have insurance, but can\u2019t afford to use it.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, as the New York Times article reported \u201cIn many states, more than half the plans offered for sale through HealthCare.gov, the federal online marketplace, have a deductible of $3,000 or more.\u201d\n\n5. The Obamacare \u201cdeath spiral\u201d conservatives warned about is real.\n\nAs Breitbart highlighted, \u201cObamacare appears to have entered an insurance industry \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nBasically, too many sick people are signing up, and too few healthy people are doing so. This causes prices to surge, and that causes fewer healthy people to sign up. The death spiral continues until the insurance program collapse completely. The 20.3 percent price increase for 2016 is probably the cause of the current round of the Obamacare death spiral.\n\nAs these facts make painfully clear, Obamacare is not the answer. What is needed is a product Americans want to buy, one based on common sense and easily understandable benefits and incentives. A program that forces people facing tough budget choices to purchase a product they don\u2019t want to buy through penalties is a train wreck in the making. The time has come for Oblimination \u2014 the full scale dismantling of Obamacare and replacing it with a system based on free market principles that actually work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation\u2019s largest health insurer is even considering pulling out of Obamacare altogether.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The nation\u2019s largest health insurer is even considering pulling out of Obamacare altogether.", "title": "5 Devastating Obamacare Facts Every American Should Know - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Obamacare_Protesters-Jason-Reed-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/23/5-devastating-obamacare-facts-every-american-should-know/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nation\u2019s largest health insurer is even considering pulling out of Obamacare altogether.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Obamacare_Protesters-Jason-Reed-Reuters.jpg", "title": "5 Devastating Obamacare Facts Every American Should Know - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Medicine, Obamacare,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-11-23T13:05:13-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBelow, then, are five devastating Obamacare facts every American should know about President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement:1.\nThe 20.3 percent price increase for 2016 is probably the cause of the current round of the Obamacare death spiral.\nThe Obamacare \u201cdeath spiral\u201d conservatives warned about is real.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLast week\u2019s devastating Obamacare announcement by United Healthcare \u2014 it expects to lose $600 million on Obamacare policies next year \u2014 further confirms what conservatives have known and said all along: Obamacare is a disaster.\nThe death spiral continues until the insurance program collapse completely."}
