As a state-approved Qualified Health Plan, Affinity has a vast network of nearly 26,000 healthcare providers and more than 85 of the leading hospitals in the New York metropolitan area \u2013 one of the largest provider networks on the Marketplace. Open enrollment begins November 15, 2014.\n\n\"As an independent, not-for-profit health plan with deep roots in the community, we see ourselves as champions of rich and rewarding lives \u2013 and access to high-quality healthcare coverage for every New Yorker is essential to that vision,\" said Glenn MacFarlane, Affinity Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. \"In the past year, more than 265,000 New Yorkers in our coverage area enrolled in a health insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 many for the first time in their lives \u2013 representing a tremendous leap forward in reducing barriers to critical health and medical care. Affinity is proud to offer, for the second year in a row, high-quality coverage options on the New York State of Health Marketplace \u2013 so that our families and communities can access the quality healthcare they need, when and how they need it, regardless of circumstance.\"\n\nOpen enrollment for health plan options on the New York State of Health Marketplace runs from November 15, 2014 to February 15, 2015 for coverage that starts as early as January 1, 2015. During this time, people who have not yet signed up for health insurance can enroll in an AffinityAccess Plan, and people who are not satisfied with their current plan now have the opportunity to change plans.\n\n\"While the majority of health insurance plans are raising premiums, Affinity is actually reducing rates for our offerings on the Health Plan Marketplace \u2013 without changing the largest network of healthcare providers and top hospitals in the Greater New York City area,\" added MacFarlane. \"We are a not-for-profit company, so our focus is on customers in our communities, and our measure of success will be in the number of lives impacted positively with access to care.\"\n\nAffinity will commemorate the first day of open enrollment on November 15 with a flagship celebration at 305 E. Fordham Road in the Bronx, as well as smaller celebrations at four other Affinity retail store locations in Brooklyn, Queens, Suffolk, and Westchester. All are welcome to join community leaders, New York residents and Affinity employees to enjoy music, food and entertainment, and benefit from free multilingual health insurance resources and counseling to better understand healthcare options in the Marketplace.\n\nLocations of Smaller Celebrations\n\nBrooklyn\n\n2228D Church Avenue\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11226\n\nQueens\n\n168-22 Jamaica Avenue\n\nJamaica, NY 11432\n\nSuffolk\n\n757B Suffolk Avenue\n\nBrentwood, NY 11717\n\nWestchester\n\n10 Palisades Avenue\n\nYonkers, NY 10701\n\nFor more information about the AffinityAccess plans, visit www.affinityplan.org/health_benefit_exchange/.\n\nFor information on New York State of Health: The Official Health Plan Marketplace, visit www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov.\n\nAbout Affinity Health Plan\n\nFounded in 1986, Affinity is an independent, not-for-profit organization driven by the mission to help its members, their families and their communities lead rich and rewarding lives.
