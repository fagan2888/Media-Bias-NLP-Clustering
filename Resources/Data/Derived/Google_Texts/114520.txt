Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had a backup plan of revenge in 2013, in case President Obama did move to replace her from her party position — and that was to paint him as “anti-woman” and “anti-Semitic,” various media outlets reported.

She even went so far as to line up supporters to sell the slam — that Obama’s potential firing of her from the chairman role was “both anti-woman and anti-Semitic” — to the public, Politico senate-bid-could-be-solution-for-wasserman-schultz-115373.html” target=”_blank”>reported.

Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Obama haven’t had warm relations in a while, Mediaite reported.

She hasn’t had discussions with the president or his staffers since 2011, when she first took over as head of the DNC, Politico said. Her current terms wraps in early 2017.

The report comes as the blunt-talking Florida lawmaker is said to be mulling a Senate run.

“It’s rare in Washington for President Obama and Senate Republicans to agree, but we are all in agreement that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a terrible DNC chair and would make an even worse Senate candidate,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee spokeswoman Andrea Bozek, Politico reported.
