In fact, a third of all spending on travel \u2013 to the tune of $145 billion \u2013 goes through online booking. But that convenience has masked a marketplace full of scams, rogue vendors, false advertising and consumer abuses.\n\nAnd it\u2019s time for Washington to take action.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis week a panel of hotel industry leaders will meet on Capitol Hill to discuss how Congress and the FTC can work to protect consumers from these deceptive practices, as well as policy issues surrounding e-commerce and travel in the hotel industry.\n\nAs the FTC has recognized in the past, deceptive advertising exposes consumers to significant harm through financial loss and other inconveniences. That\u2019s true in the online hotel marketplace too. The combination of unfair and misleading practices is significantly costing consumers nationwide: upwards of $228 million a year.\n\nHere\u2019s how: consumers are deceived into booking on third party websites that are purporting to be the hotels themselves. These third party sites often use the a hotel\u2019s name as part of the URL, a cunning and confusing tactic which leads consumers into thinking the site is owned and operated directly by a hotel. Usually these ads include a toll-free number and/or a \u2018call now\u2019 button, neither of which are affiliated with, or connected to, the brand or hotel. That means you may not be getting what you pay for, whether it\u2019s losing your loyalty points or not getting access to the room you requested, especially if you need an accessible room for the disabled.\n\nEnter mobile devices: for the 10 to 15 percent of e-commerce traffic that route through mobile devices, these dubious tactics are even easier to implement. Smaller screen sizes make it more difficult to recognize phony URL addresses and 1-800 numbers that look like the hotel\u2019s reservation desk\u2014not the third party.\n\nAdditionally, vendors will often use false strike-through pricing, misleading the consumer into believing they are charging the lowest available price, when it\u2019s actually more expensive than the price offered directly through the hotel. Consumers may also be charged a \u201cbooking fee,\u201d and are unable to cancel or change their reservation without being aware that this is the case until they need to make a change (not having the benefit of the hotel\u2019s customer service policies).\n\nAnother thing to consider when booking through a third party: where are consumers\u2019 credit card and personal information stored? Who is responsible for keeping this information secure?\n\nOne easy solution to keep consumers from getting tripped up is to book your travel directly with the hotel. It\u2019s easier than ever and you can have peace of mind that you\u2019ll get exactly what you paid for directly from the source.\n\nBut when it comes to the law, it\u2019s very clear; businesses should not be misleading consumers about who they are and what they are selling. This problem needs to be fixed. The FTC has the jurisdiction and the duty to investigate deceptive advertising that harms consumers.\n\nConsumers demand transparency from businesses and the assurance that their privacy is protected. The time for greater legislative oversight and awareness of this issue is now.\n\nLugar is president and chief executive officer of the American Hotel & Lodging Association.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Convenience has masked a marketplace full of scams, rogue vendors, false advertising and consumer abuses.", "description": "Convenience has masked a marketplace full of scams, rogue vendors, false advertising and consumer abuses.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Convenience has masked a marketplace full of scams, rogue vendors, false advertising and consumer abuses.", "title": "Protecting consumers from getting tripped up by hotel booking sites", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/234765-protecting-consumers-from-getting-tripped-up-by-hotel-booking", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/234765-protecting-consumers-from-getting-tripped-up-by-hotel-booking", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-11T08:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Katherine Lugar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T08:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/234765-protecting-consumers-from-getting-tripped-up-by-hotel-booking", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Convenience has masked a marketplace full of scams, rogue vendors, false advertising and consumer abuses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Protecting consumers from getting tripped up by hotel booking sites"}, "dcterms.title": "Protecting consumers from getting tripped up by hotel booking sites"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8926\"", "article_summary": "E-commerce and online hotel booking sites are now the norm for consumers looking to make their business and personal travel arrangements.\nOne easy solution to keep consumers from getting tripped up is to book your travel directly with the hotel.\nIn fact, a third of all spending on travel \u2013 to the tune of $145 billion \u2013 goes through online booking.\nBut when it comes to the law, it\u2019s very clear; businesses should not be misleading consumers about who they are and what they are selling.\nThat\u2019s true in the online hotel marketplace too."}
