Carson has never held public office.\n\nBobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, focused his time on his upbringing and what he calls a present-day assault on religious liberties.\n\nJeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said he was proud of his brother, former President George W Bush. Jeb Bush struggled during the week explaining his views on whether his brother's military invasion of Iraq was a mistake.\n\nRick Perry, former governor of Texas, drew some of the most frequent applause with his fiery speech and took credit of leading much of the country's economic gains, thanks to Texas' economy.\n\nRand Paul, declared candidate and U.S. Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky, welcomed the debate on whether the government should tap phones of American citizens in the interest of national security. Paul is not a fan of that.\n\nGeorge Pataki, former governor of New York, pitched reducing the federal workforce by 15 percent.\n\nLindsey Graham, U.S. Senator from South Carolina, drew by far the most laughs with numerous one-liners.\n\nCarly Fiorina, declared candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, won applause from criticizing Hillary Clinton numerous times. She also had the distinction of getting her microphone cut off after ten minutes (per pre-established rules of the event), since she hadn't finished her remarks. Many in the crowd stood and cheered as she walked off stage.\n\nDonald Trump, businessman and \"Celebrity Apprentice\" host, told the crowd he plans an announcement next month about his future and that it would surprise some people.\n\nScott Walker, governor of Wisconsin, was the only one to bring a visual aide. He showed a boyhood photo of himself in Iowa holding the state flag with his brother.\n\nClick here for more on the speeches from the Des Moines Register.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 1,300 Iowa activists had plenty from which to choose Saturday night and it had nothing to do with the menu at the Lincoln Dinner.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "0b712ce3c768feea09b44013120c6553"}, "og": {"site_name": "whotv.com", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 More than 1,300 Iowa activists had plenty from which to choose Saturday night and it had nothing to do with the menu at the Republican Party of Iowa\u2019s Lincoln Dinner.\u2026", "title": "Big Dinner Featured Many Choices for Iowa Activists", "url": "http://whotv.com/2015/05/16/big-dinner-featured-many-choices-for-iowa-activists/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/republican-party-e1339898277880.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/republican-party-e1339898277880.jpg?w=240", "site": "@whohd", "card": "summary", "creator": "@whohd"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324711668", "fb": {"pages": 383549560312}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whotv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f35371452b04df2deef561dcee55bb01?s=16", "application-name": "whotv.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD", "published_time": "2015-05-17T04:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-17T18:20:18+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD"}, "keywords": "iowa, politics, lincoln dinner, des moines", "google-site-verification": "rL7fNdHSnN2PyMcNFC2GBk_LusisYfoPth6XdX-yZ2Y", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Rand Paul, declared candidate and U.S.\nCarly Fiorina, declared candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, won applause from criticizing Hillary Clinton numerous times.\nBen Carson, declared candidate and former neurosurgeon, said iconic President Abraham Lincoln also had very little experience in public service before winning his election.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoDES MOINES, Iowa -- More than 1,300 Iowa activists had plenty from which to choose Saturday night and it had nothing to do with the menu at the Republican Party of Iowa's Lincoln Dinner.\nJeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said he was proud of his brother, former President George W Bush."}
