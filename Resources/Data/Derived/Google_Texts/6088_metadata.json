Virginia Staub spent the day surrounded by friends and family.\n\n\n\nThe room was filled with pictures from the past 100 years of her life. Staub joined the army in 1942 and served for three years. But now, her life is very different. She has settled down in Tucson for the past 10 years and is enjoying the sunshine.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago she said was forced to start walking with a cane, but although her mobility is limited, her mind is still sharp. Staub\u2019s son credited her longevity to having to walk everywhere, because Staub never got her driver\u2019s license, and her positive attitude.\n\n\n\nStaub said she was able to celebrate 100 years because of her diet.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs my son would say, \u2018I ate everything that came down the pipe,\u2019 and this is true. And I ate fried foods - I'm from Kentucky, you know - fried chicken. And I never drank a whole lot, but I drank when I wanted to. I don't recommend it for everyone, but it worked for me and I'm thankful,\u201d Staub said.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
