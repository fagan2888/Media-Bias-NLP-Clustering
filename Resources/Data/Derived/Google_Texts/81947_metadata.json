The commission that runs the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum approved the design Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015, that would feature the flag in a glass case surrounded by displays that scroll the names of the 22,000 South Carolinians killed in the Civil War. (Haley Sharpe Design via AP)\n\nThis is what\u2019s wrong with state government in one sentence:\n\nThe Legislature refuses to follow a state Supreme Court order to come up with a plan to fund education adequately in the next six months, but imposes a six-month deadline for plans to display a Confederate flag.\n\nAnd not even a real one.\n\nThat\u2019s it in a nutshell.\n\nFor 22 years, the state has let impoverished school districts fail. One lost court battle after another has shown that. Lawmakers know there is a problem and, admittedly, the fixes aren\u2019t easy. Still, the state won\u2019t even pretend it\u2019s trying to make the situation right when timely manners are measured in decades.\n\nBut for goodness sake, we have to get that authentic reproduction battle flag on display \u2014 pronto.\n\nThis is not a screed against the Confederacy. Our Civil War history is important to remember. It is instructive. And if the state wants to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars preserving that history, here\u2019s an idea:\n\nSend some of that security money to The Confederate Museum on the Market, where the Daughters of the Confederacy have the actual, original seven-star banner that flew over Fort Sumter during the first battle of the war.\n\nThat\u2019s a really important piece of history, and just one of several priceless artifacts in their impressive collection.\n\nThe flag that flew on Statehouse grounds, well, that was more of a political football.\n\nAnd football season is almost over.\n\nHo ho ho\n\nLast week, a back-bencher state lawmaker named Chris Corley sent out a Christmas card to Republican colleagues that mocked them for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Confederate flag.\n\n\u201cMay you have a blessed and happy Christmas, and may you take this joyous time as an opportunity to ask forgiveness of all your sins such as betrayal.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a joke, but it\u2019s really just whining.\n\nYou lost, the Confederacy lost, get over it.\n\nNow, this is not a knock on all those men who fought for the South \u2014 most of whom did not own other human beings, it should be pointed out \u2014 but since Rep. Corley wants to drag Christmas into this, perhaps he should ask himself how Jesus feels about the issue of slavery.\n\nBecause the Confederate government\u2019s chief purpose was to preserve an economy built on slave labor, even if they sold it to the men who actually fought as a battle to protect their homes.\n\nThere is a monument to the people who died in the Civil War on Statehouse grounds, and it is appropriate. The flag was always superfluous, seen by many as a thumb to the nose in response to civil rights. The Legislature took it down, finally, after a madman waving a similar flag killed nine people in a Charleston church.\n\nThat was not a surrender, as Corley says, but an uncharacteristically humane display of empathy and healing.\n\nBut now, beyond his stupid Christmas card, Corley wants a referendum about putting the flag back up.\n\nYeah, but it should have to pass with two-thirds of the vote, just like it took to take the flag down.\n\nPast or future?\n\nThe Confederate Relic Room is a fine museum, with a knowledgeable staff of historians that are well-qualified to explain our complicated history to folks.\n\nAnd if putting the flag from the Statehouse in the museum will attract attention to \u2014 and help preserve \u2014 some of the fine artifacts already there, then $5 million is a bargain.\n\nOf course, that price tag is more than a simple flag display. It\u2019s a makeover for the Relic Room. But the mandate was to do something special for that one flag.\n\nAnd choosing to showcase some 21st-century made banner instead of one of the multitudes of flags that men actually fought and died under is the worst kind of political pandering, and an insult to all those lost souls.\n\nAnd imposing a deadline, while ignoring more pressing ones, sends a message that our state is more interested in cloth than flesh and blood.\n\nIt\u2019s about priorities, folks. History is important. The future is more important.\n\nSo if you want to promote \u201cmorals, convictions and \u2026 what is right,\u201d Rep. Corley, how about doing some actual work to fix an education system that is still broken, particularly in your corner of the state, instead of harping on the reproduction banner of a lost cause.\n\nOr, you could just continue to act like a fool, which obviously is much easier.\n\nReach Brian Hicks at bhicks@postandcourier.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Misplaced priorities, misplaced outrage, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nBrian Hicks, \r\nBrian Hicks, Confederate flag,Legislature", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "This is what\u2019s wrong with state government in one sentence:", "title": "Misplaced priorities, misplaced outrage", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151206/151209723/misplaced-priorities-misplaced-outrage", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151206/PC16/151209723/AR/0/AR-151209723.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151206/PC16/151209723/AR/0/AR-151209723.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is what\u2019s wrong with state government in one sentence:", "title": "Misplaced priorities, misplaced outrage", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151206/PC16/151209723/AR/0/AR-151209723.jpg?201512060946", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151209723}}, "keywords": "Misplaced priorities, misplaced outrage , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nBrian Hicks, \r\nBrian Hicks, Confederate flag,Legislature", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T06:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T09:46:00Z", "author": "Brian Hicks"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "This is what\u2019s wrong with state government in one sentence:"}, "article_summary": "Of course, that price tag is more than a simple flag display.\nBut for goodness sake, we have to get that authentic reproduction battle flag on display \u2014 pronto.\nThis rendering made available by Haley Sharpe Design, shows the approved display design where the confederate flag that was removed from the South Carolina statehouse in the summer of 2015 will be shown.\nStill, the state won\u2019t even pretend it\u2019s trying to make the situation right when timely manners are measured in decades.\nHo ho hoLast week, a back-bencher state lawmaker named Chris Corley sent out a Christmas card to Republican colleagues that mocked them for their \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Confederate flag."}
