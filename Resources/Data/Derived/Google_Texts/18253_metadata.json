We did so in the shadow of proposed double-digit Obamacare premium increases in states across the country, everywhere from Tennessee to Oregon to New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cAmericans have gotten further bad news since, including Obamacare premium spikes that could reach as high as 83% in New Mexico. And each day seems to bring more and more troubling news, which could mean heartbreak for even more Americans.\n\n\u201cTake for instance some headlines from last night, \u2018Most Arkansas insurers propose double-digit hikes for 2017\u2019 and \u2018Some rates in Georgia insurance exchange could soar in 2017\u2019 \u2014 and by soar they\u2019re talking as high as 65%.\n\n\u201cAs one paper put it, there is \u2018no end in sight for higher Obamacare premiums.\u2019 These are not just abstract numbers. They can represent real pain for families already stretched to the limits under the Obama economy.\n\n\u201cA recent survey showed that health care costs are now the top financial concern facing American families, ahead of concerns about low wages and even job loss.\n\n\u201cAnd what does the Democrat response too often seem to boil down to? Get over it.\n\n\u201cJust the other day the Democratic Leader in the Senate said that Americans who, like us, disagree with the pain Obamacare is causing need to just \u2018get over it and accept the fact that Obamacare is here to stay.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly the only callous comment we\u2019ve heard from across the aisle on Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI ask Democratic colleagues to listen to the Americans who continue to share heartbreaking Obamacare stories with us, like these Kentuckians.\n\n\u201cShould the Elizabethtown man who says he can\u2019t afford to see a doctor under his Obamacare plan \u2013 despite the fact that he pays more for his premium than his house payment \u2014 just get over it?\n\n\u201cShould the dad from Owensboro who said he\u2019s seen his family\u2019s health costs increase by nearly 250% under Obamacare just get over it? \u2018What happened to being rewarded for working hard in America?\u2019 this Dad asked, \u2018What happened to the American dream?\u2019\n\n\u201cMany Americans are wondering the same thing. Obamacare continues to write a record of broken promises at the expense of the American people.\n\n\u201cInstead of lowering premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family as then-Senator Obama talked about on the campaign trail, Obamacare has raised many families\u2019 rates.\n\n\u201cInstead of making health care costs more affordable for all, Obamacare has led to unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for families across the country.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this. Obamacare is too often hurting those it promised to help. It\u2019s a direct attack on the middle class.\n\n\u201cThe Republican-led Senate sent a bill to President Obama\u2019s desk to repeal this partisan law so we can replace it with policies that actually put the American people first. Because let\u2019s remember, the American people do not need to get over Obamacare\u2019s failures \u2014 our Democratic colleagues need to finally join us in working to end them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BereaOnline", "description": "Obamacare: Bad News, Premiums Spike for Americans", "title": "Obamacare: Bad News, Premiums Spike for Americans", "url": "http://bereaonline.com/?p=51227", "image": "http://bereaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mitch-McConnell-150x150.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "r5ETplh3KYT2hAIb_e3TAB0Vlkh9CHo9j5rG2s6bsmM", "fb": {"app_id": 160191540696050}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAmericans have gotten further bad news since, including Obamacare premium spikes that could reach as high as 83% in New Mexico.\nWe did so in the shadow of proposed double-digit Obamacare premium increases in states across the country, everywhere from Tennessee to Oregon to New Hampshire.\n\u201cShould the dad from Owensboro who said he\u2019s seen his family\u2019s health costs increase by nearly 250% under Obamacare just get over it?\n\u201cI ask Democratic colleagues to listen to the Americans who continue to share heartbreaking Obamacare stories with us, like these Kentuckians.\n\u201cAs one paper put it, there is \u2018no end in sight for higher Obamacare premiums.\u2019 These are not just abstract numbers."}
