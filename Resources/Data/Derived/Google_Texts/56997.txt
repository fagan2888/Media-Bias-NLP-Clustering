It’s official: The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs will meet yet again the NBA Finals, a rematch four-time champion Tim Duncan has already vowed to win. This will be the fourth straight trip to the Finals for Miami, a feat only two other franchises have achieved (Boston and the Lakers), and it could land LeBron James his third straight championship. The King has already been dubbed “the Michael Jordan of our era” by Pacers coach Frank Vogel, and if he secures another championship trophy, it be hard for anyone to dispute that.

The Heat needed all seven games and a last-minute Ray Allen three to upend the Spurs in the 2013 Finals, and the Spurs have made it know that they’re out to avenge their devastating loss. But if anything is guaranteed in this series it’s that we’ll get one heck of a show from the league’s most consistent and star-studded teams.

The bad news in all this is we have to wait four more days (I know!) before it actually begins:

Game 1: Thursday, June 5 at 7 p.m. MDT, ABC

Game 2: Sunday, June 8 at 6 p.m., ABC

Game 3: Tuesday, June 10 at 7 p.m., ABC

Game 4: Thursday, June 12 at 7 p.m., ABC

Game 5: Sunday, June 15 at 6 p.m., ABC (if necessary)

Game 6: Tuesday, June 17 at 7 p.m., ABC (if necessary)

Game 7: Friday, June 20 at 7 p.m., ABC (if necessary)

In the meantime, check out some of the best plays (mostly dunks, because dunks are fun) from the earlier series, ranked in order of awesomeness. If I missed any, let me know and I’ll them in for your enjoyment.
