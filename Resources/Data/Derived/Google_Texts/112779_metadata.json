Because the government retained an ownership stake, many companies had senior Russian officials serving on their boards of directors until fairly recently. They were replaced with much more junior government figures in 2011, when then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev directed cabinet ministers and vice premiers to remove themselves from corporate boards as part of an effort to modernize the economy.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Woes Worsen as Russia-Backed Rebels Reportedly Kill Civilians\n\nNo longer.\n\n\u201cNow, we will apparently have to return them,\u201d Economic Development Minister Alexey Ulyukayev announced Wednesday, according to the state-owned media company ITAR-TASS.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has already been pressuring large Russian companies that do business overseas to support the country\u2019s failing currency by converting income earned in foreign currencies to rubles. Now, when the directors of major Russian companies consider their financial strategies, they will have members of Putin\u2019s inner political circle at the table with them.\n\nConsider Treasury Secretary Jack Lew serving on the board of JP Morgan Chase, or Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on the board of General Electric.\n\nRelated: Oil Drop Further Rocks Putin\u2019s Economy\n\nUlyukayev also said that Russians should expect that their sovereign debt offerings would be downgraded to \u201cjunk\u201d status by international ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s in coming days.\n\nThe new addition to corporate boards comes at the same time that Russian Finance minister Anton Siluanov warned that, with the country facing a loss of as much as $45 billion in revenue this year due to declining oil prices, the government is planning 10 percent across-the-board cuts in spending, targeting virtually everything except the military and some infrastructure projects.\n\nThat\u2019s a doubling of the cuts that Putin warned Russians, just last month, they should expect in the coming year.\n\nWorse still, from a fiscal perspective, the Kremlin apparently plans to start withdrawing money from its $88 billion sovereign wealth fund as part of its continued effort to prop up the ruble, which has lost nearly half its value against the U.S. dollar in the past year. Russia\u2019s central bank has spent a reported $76 billion in an ultimately failed attempt to support the ruble over the past year.\n\nRelated: Fallout from Obama\u2019s Russia Strategy Is Spreading Through Europe\n\nNone of this should suggest that Russia is in immediate danger of financial collapse. The country still has substantial foreign currency reserves, in the hundreds of billions of dollars, despite the fact that it has been spending them down as part of the effort to protect the ruble. However, Ulyukayev\u2019s recognition that international debt market are, for all intents and purposes, likely to be closed to the Russian government in the near future makes those reserves look a lot smaller.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On the same say that Russian officials said the government is facing across-the-board 10 percent spending cuts, the country\u2019s Minister for Economic Development said the boards of directors of Russia\u2019s biggest companies will need to find space at the table for senior government figures.", "title": "A Desperate Putin Makes a Private Sector Power Grab", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/15/Desperate-Putin-Makes-Private-Sector-Power-Grab", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-putin_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/15/Desperate-Putin-Makes-Private-Sector-Power-Grab", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-putin_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On the same say that Russian officials said the government is facing across-the-board 10 percent spending cuts, the country\u2019s Minister for Economic Development said the boards of directors of Russia\u2019s biggest companies will need to find space at the table for senior government figures.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16bb\"", "article_summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has already been pressuring large Russian companies that do business overseas to support the country\u2019s failing currency by converting income earned in foreign currencies to rubles.\nBecause the government retained an ownership stake, many companies had senior Russian officials serving on their boards of directors until fairly recently.\nNow, when the directors of major Russian companies consider their financial strategies, they will have members of Putin\u2019s inner political circle at the table with them.\nThat\u2019s a doubling of the cuts that Putin warned Russians, just last month, they should expect in the coming year.\n\u201cNow, we will apparently have to return them,\u201d Economic Development Minister Alexey Ulyukayev announced Wednesday, according to the state-owned media company ITAR-TASS."}
