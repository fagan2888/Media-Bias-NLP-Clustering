But, with revenge on their minds, Paul Stastny and his teammates on the United States hockey team are itching for a fight with our friendly neighbors to the north.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the true meaning of intense. You know the guys on Canada, but we don\u2019t like them. And they don\u2019t like us,\u201d Stastny told me Wednesday, after Team USA crushed the Czech Republic 5-2 in the quarterfinals of the Olympic tournament. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing for your country, there\u2019s always been a rivalry between the United States and Canada. You don\u2019t look at the names on the back of the uniform. You only look at the logo on the front.\u201d\n\nSo guess who\u2019s next up for the United States in the medal round of the tournament. An old foe in Canada, and there\u2019s an old score to settle. Four years ago, on Canadian ice, the U.S. men rallied late in the third period to force overtime, only to get beat on a flick of the wrist by Sidney Crosby.\n\nCanada advanced to a semifinal showdown scheduled Friday against the United States with an unimpressive 2-1 victory against Latvia, needing a goal by Shea Weber more than 13 minutes into the third period to survive the upset bid. In a short tournament, highly dependent on the right combination of no ego, instant chemistry and hot goaltending, the United States has clearly been the most impressive team.\n\n\u201cWhen you play on the big Olympic sheet, there\u2019s a tendency to try to play a really skilled game, but when we\u2019re at our best, I think we just try to keep puck possession in the offensive zone,\u201d Stastny said.\n\nWhile the star power of Canada is electric, the other three teams remaining in this tournament \u2014 Sweden, Finland and the USA \u2014 are playing very solid, similar systems based on defense first and suppression of any urge to get in a figure-skating contest with superstars such as Alex Ovechkin, whose Russian team was bounced by the Finns.\n\nWhile there seems to be serious ambivalence among NHL leadership about whether it\u2019s worth shutting down the season to let the league\u2019s stars play in the Winter Olympics, here\u2019s what commissioner Gary Bettman needs to understand: These Games really matter to the pros now.\n\nWay back in 1998, when the NHL shipped its highly paid athletes halfway around the world to Japan for the Olympics, the Europeans were genuinely pumped about playing for love of country, but at times it seemed the guys from the United States and Canada viewed the competition on ice as little more than an elaborate excuse to play cards between games.\n\n\u201cI think the guys on the European teams all grew up playing together since they were kids, so they\u2019ve got that gel and that natural spirit. I think the more success U.S. hockey has had through the years, the bigger bond it is for these guys on this team. The more history you have, the more of a bond you have as a team. We\u2019re going for something special, and you realize if we do succeed, we\u2019ll have something special to remember for the rest of our lives,\u201d said Stastny, the former University of Denver star and current Avalanche center whose pride in representing the red, white and blue has developed into something real and strong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s playing for the jersey. \u2026 You never know if this chance to win the gold is going happen again. You never know if you\u2019re going to be an Olympian again.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, the USA needed a miracle against the former Soviet Union to win a gold medal on U.S. soil.\n\nHere\u2019s what is cool: Stastny and his millionaire teammates want to win gold in Russia every bit as much as Mike Eruzione and his gritty U.S. band of crazy amateur dreamers did a generation ago.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Paul Stastny wants gold as much as 1980 \u201cMiracle\u201d dreamers did", "title": "Kiszla: Paul Stastny wants gold as much as 1980 \u201cMiracle\u201d dreamers did", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/19/kiszla-paul-stastny-wants-gold-as-much-as-1980-miracle-dreamers-did/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-19T20:24:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:31:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing for your country, there\u2019s always been a rivalry between the United States and Canada.\nBut, with revenge on their minds, Paul Stastny and his teammates on the United States hockey team are itching for a fight with our friendly neighbors to the north.\nYou only look at the logo on the front.\u201dSo guess who\u2019s next up for the United States in the medal round of the tournament.\nAnd they don\u2019t like us,\u201d Stastny told me Wednesday, after Team USA crushed the Czech Republic 5-2 in the quarterfinals of the Olympic tournament.\nYou know the guys on Canada, but we don\u2019t like them."}
