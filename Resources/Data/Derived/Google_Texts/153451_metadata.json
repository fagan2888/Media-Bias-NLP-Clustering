The truth is closer to the reverse.\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s hard to see how pharmaceuticals can be a major driver of costs when they\u2019re just over 11 percent of the total US health-care budget.\n\nBut more important is that even extremely pricey drugs still save money if used right.\n\nConsider Sovaldi, which has a 90 percent cure rate for Hepatitis C, a disease affecting over 3 million Americans. A three-month treatment cycle of the new drug costs upward of $84,000. On the market for just a few months, Sovaldi has already clocked in a record-shattering $2.3 billion in sales.\n\nSome are calling foul, accusing the drug\u2019s developer \u2014 Gilead Sciences Inc. \u2014 of exploitative pricing. \u201cThe company in this case is asking for a blank check,\u201d says Karen Ignagni, president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. \u201cIt will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s 100 percent wrong \u2014 the exact opposite of reality. New, better medications are actually the best and swiftest way for this country to cut down on our health-care expenses. By more effectively combating disease and improving patients\u2019 lives, drugs reduce long-term medical costs and bolster the overall economy.\n\nConsider one pre-Sovaldi \u201cbest practice\u201d treatment for Hepatitis C, the drug Pegasys. This requires one injection a week for 48 weeks \u2014 and very few patients see the treatment through to completion, so much of that treatment, both physician time and drug cost, is wasted. Nor is it that much cheaper: At about $7,000/month, the full course of treatment is over $70,000 \u2014 barely less than cost of the three months needed for Sovaldi to work a cure.\n\nAnd the price of not using Sovaldi is very high. One in three patients with the Hepatitis C virus eventually develops liver cirrhosis, and managing these patients is costly. A \u201croutine\u201d liver transplant (where the liver is from a cadaver) costs close to $300,000; a \u201cliving donor\u201d transplant is even more expensive.\n\nThanks to Sovaldi, a pill that cures the disease when taken once a day over 12 weeks will eradicate the need, the risks and the costs of liver transplantation. Such radical innovation deserves to be both lauded and rewarded.\n\nAnd Sovaldi\u2019s costs will come down. The initial price of such breakthrough medications reflects the huge R&D costs required to bring the drug to market, not avarice.\n\nAs Food and Drug Administration official Dr. Janet Woodcock noted of the Sovaldi controversy: \u201cWe may have to put a big down payment down now to get something really good.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable that some large insurers have the chutzpah to complain that curing 3 million Americans of hepatitis C will bankrupt health-care systems. Data recently published by the PwC Health Research Institute suggests the reverse. The study shows that the use of Sovaldi will actually drive down overall spending within a decade. According to the authors, \u201cThe challenge may lie in targeting the patient most in need of the more expensive course of therapy.\u201d\n\nIn short, drugs aren\u2019t the cause of rising health-care costs \u2014 they\u2019re the solution. Demonizing new treatments distracts from the real problem in the US biopharmaceutical industry: top-down cost-centric policies that focus on the near-term, short-changing long-term patient outcomes, and so endanger \u201csustainable innovation\u201d by denying fair reimbursement for high-risk investment in R&D. (Research and development costs big even if a drug never makes it to market \u2014 and most don\u2019t.)\n\nNew treatments are a bargain. Disease is always much more costly.\n\nUnfortunately, under ObamaCare health plans are sticking more people with a bigger share of drug costs \u2014 a strategy designed to discourage use by the people in greatest need and direct outrage away from insurers to drug companies.\n\nBreakthrough drugs could generate huge new savings in the US economy \u2014 but only if federal regulators don\u2019t smother them in the womb with expensive and unnecessary legal hurdles. Left unencumbered, domestic medical innovation will generate the new treatments to improve lives, stave off disease and cut down on long-term health-care costs.\n\nIf we don\u2019t reward risk-taking on behalf of human health, both will shrink.\n\nPeter J.
