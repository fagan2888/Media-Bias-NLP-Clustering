Whether they\u2019ve just had their first child and need a nanny or they\u2019re hiring someone to take care of an elderly or disabled loved one, the vast majority of Americans have a very limited understanding of their responsibilities as a household employer. If you\u2019re advising a client who\u2019s hiring a domestic worker in the coming months, here are a few of the latest topics in the industry you\u2019ll want to hit on.\n\nWorker Classification\n\nThe most common mistake families make when handling taxes for a household employee is treating the worker as an independent contractor. Although the IRS test to determine worker status is somewhat vague, your families should be aware that, in the vast majority of cases, they\u2019ve ruled that domestic workers should classify as employees, not independent contractors. There\u2019s always been risk associated with providing a Form 1099 (instead of a Form W-2), but more than ever this practice is being monitored. Nineteen states were awarded grants by the Department of Labor last year to increase enforcement efforts and the household employment industry has been cited as a prime target.\n\nMinimum Wage\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably seen in the news, there\u2019s a growing movement nationwide to increase minimum wage at the federal level. While this hasn\u2019t resulted in a change to the current $7.25 per hour rate, several states and municipalities have approved hourly rates higher than the federal mandate. In fact, nearly half the states in the country increased their minimum wage in 2015, so it\u2019s important for your clients to know the current rate in their area to keep from underpaying their employee.\n\nOvertime\n\nDomestic workers are considered \u201cnon-exempt\u201d and, therefore, are protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Additionally, a growing number of states have passed Domestic Worker Bill of Rights laws \u2013 heightening awareness among workers of their right to time-and-a-half for all hours over 40 in a 7-day work week. Some states also have special overtime provisions for live-in workers or more than 8 hours in a day.\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is still a hot topic in the tax community \u2013 even though most of the provisions have been with us for more than a year. Families often get confused because they know many businesses have to provide health insurance for their employees. However, household employers are exempt from this mandate because they are under the 50-employee threshold.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the employee can go without health insurance though. There\u2019s still an individual mandate in place, so the employee needs to make sure she\u2019s covered so she doesn\u2019t have to pay a fine. The health insurance Marketplace at www.healthcare.gov is a good place for workers to purchase a policy \u2013 plus they\u2019ll probably qualify for a federal subsidy to lower the cost of the premium. However, to take advantage of the subsidy, workers need to have documented wages, which means employers \u2013 your clients \u2013 will need to provide Form W-2. Recently, this has been a key driver of compliance in the household employment industry. Many families have found themselves scrambling to catch up on payroll in order to get their worker the paperwork necessary for the subsidy.\n\nMileage Reimbursement\n\nMost states don\u2019t require families to reimburse their household employee for miles driven while on the job. But it\u2019s a nice non-taxable benefit to provide if the employee has to run errands, take the kids on outings or shuttle grandma to doctor\u2019s appointments in her car. The IRS increased the mileage reimbursement rate to 57.5 cents per mile this year. It covers the cost of gas plus general wear and tear on the employee\u2019s vehicle. Remember, this reimbursement rate covers only miles driven while on the job; any payment for miles driven while commuting to and from the worksite would be considered taxable wages.\n\nIt may seem odd speaking to clients about tax-related matters during middle of the year, but household employment is a different animal compared to handling personal income taxes. It\u2019s very important to make sure the employee\u2019s payroll and your clients\u2019 expectations for federal and state employment taxes are established during the hiring process. Mistakes in this area of the tax code are not easily remedied in January \u2013 and cause significant headaches to fix for the family and for you.\n\nIf you find yourself looking for additional resources, there is a state-by-state breakdown of all household employment payroll and tax rules on our website.
