The original idea for a one-way loop was generated by a citizen committee 12 years ago, and in early public meetings, the plan drew general support.\n\nBut to hear critics, the loop is being \u201cforced down the community\u2019s throat\u201d and would lead to the \u201cdestruction of downtown Estes Park,\u201d even though the project would not require expanding existing roads or increase the leisurely tourist-trap speed limit.\n\nIn a flyer handed out to visitors, opponents of the project implore: \u201cIf you love the charm of Estes Park and don\u2019t want to see it mowed over by one-way streets and four-lane highways, please let our town know how you feel!\u201d\n\nIn the past, the town has tried employing crossing guards at the main intersection to smooth the flow of traffic and protect pedestrians. A minor bypass route was created for those wanting to head up U.S. 36, although another \u201csecret\u201d bypass for locals traveling west on U.S. 34 past the historic Stanley Hotel has always remained unpublicized at the demand of the merchants worried that visitors would avoid downtown altogether.\n\nSo at this point, the town is awaiting the results of a federal environmental analysis expected later this summer, but officials are wary enough of the vocal opponents that they are not absolutely committed to moving forward with the project.\n\nIt would mean rejecting the grant money.\n\nIt would require coming up with a new plan to rebuild three bridges that are inadequate to withstand floodwaters, which would have been included in the loop project.\n\nAnd it would leave Estes Park with its traffic problem at a time when visitation to the national park steadily climbs.\n\nTraffic snarls have plagued Estes Park practically since F.O. Stanley chugged his legendary steam-driven motor carriage up to the mountain valley at the turn of the 20th century, and congestion on the roads consistently is named in surveys as the town\u2019s most pressing problem.\n\nAfter all, no one wants to go on vacation and sit in traffic.\n\nUnless it\u2019s caused by elk.\n\nSteve Lipsher (slipsher@comcast.net) of Silverthorne writes a monthly column for The Denver Post.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lipsher: Estes Park tying itself in knots over traffic solution", "title": "Lipsher: Estes Park tying itself in knots over traffic solution", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/01/lipsher-estes-park-tying-itself-in-knots-over-traffic-solution/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-01T15:58:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T05:36:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda563\"", "article_summary": "The classic image of an \u201cEstes Park traffic jam\u201d shows a herd of elk crossing the road in front of a line of bemused drivers.\nAnd it would leave Estes Park with its traffic problem at a time when visitation to the national park steadily climbs.\nTraffic snarls have plagued Estes Park practically since F.O.\nThe original idea for a one-way loop was generated by a citizen committee 12 years ago, and in early public meetings, the plan drew general support.\nBut to hear critics, the loop is being \u201cforced down the community\u2019s throat\u201d and would lead to the \u201cdestruction of downtown Estes Park,\u201d even though the project would not require expanding existing roads or increase the leisurely tourist-trap speed limit."}
