Analysts pegged Obamacare, other entitlement programs, new federal spending and recent tax cuts as contributors to the nation\u2019s debt crisis.\n\n\u201cBeyond the 10-year period, if current laws remained in place, the pressures that had contributed to rising deficits during the baseline period would accelerate and push debt up even more sharply. Three decades from now, for instance, debt held by the public is projected to equal 155 percent of GDP, a higher percentage than any previously recorded in the United States,\u201d the analysts concluded, the Washington Times reported Tuesday.\n\n\n\nObama, who has seen the U.S. debt balloon more than $8 trillion during his tenure, was aided by lawmakers last year who passed a budget resolution to balance the debt by 2024 and then opted not to pursue entitlement reform. The CBO said Congress added $750 billion to the debt over the next 10 years while vowing to save $5.8 trillion.\n\nCNS News broke down federal spending under Obama on Tuesday and concluded it was equal to $70,612.91 in net federal borrowing for each of the 117,480,000 households the Census Bureau said were in the U.S. as of September 2015.\n\n\u201cIn the 15 years from the beginning of Bush\u2019s first term to the end of Obama\u2019s seventh year in office, the federal debt increased $13,213,630,160,947.51,\u201d the website reported.\n\n\u201cImpeachable Offenses\u201d presents an indictment of Barack Obama that goes well beyond today\u2019s headlines. Order it today at WND\u2019s Superstore.\n\nAnalysts at CBO added that rising interest rates over the next decade will be a financial back-breaker.\n\n\u201cBecause of rising interest rates and growing federal debt held by the public, the government\u2019s interest payments on that debt are projected to rise sharply over the next 10 years \u2013 more than tripling in nominal terms and more than doubling as a percentage of GDP, from 1.4 percent to 3.0 percent. \u2026 As interest rates rise, the government\u2019s cost of financing its debt will climb \u2013 especially if that debt continues to mount, as it does in CBO\u2019s projections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has always been the biggest problem with debt and deficits \u2013 not what\u2019s likely to happen this year or next, but the risks it holds further down the road,\u201d responded Reason magazine on Monday. \u201cWhile it\u2019s in some ways understandable that politicians have focused less attention on debt and deficits recently, it\u2019s also worrisome, for it shows how poor our political system is at managing predictable but long-term problems like this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A new report by the the Congressional Budget Office makes clear that President Obama will bear a large chunk of culpability when U.S. federal debt tops $30 trillion within the next decade.
