(Photo: Clarence Tabb Jr / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nA sense of timing is a wonderful thing, whether in politics or comedy. The timing of the pitch for a pay raise for Detroit\u2019s elected officials is almost funny for its obliviousness.\n\nThe lobbying by City Council President Brenda Jones and city clerk Janice Winfrey came on the same week that cuts to retiree pensions kicked in as part of the bankruptcy settlement. Roughly 12,000 city of Detroit retirees saw their monthly benefit checks cut by 4.5 percent.\n\nThese retirees also lost much of their health care benefits to the bankruptcy process.\n\nWhat Jones and Winfrey are saying is, \u201cLet them eat cake,\u201d setting themselves up as above the sacrifice required of others whose livelihoods come from the city\u2019s coffers.\n\nThe pair asked the Detroit Elected Officials Compensation Commission to recommend a pay raise, arguing they are worth more than the salaries they\u2019re receiving.\n\n\u201cMy days normally exceed 12 hours,\u201d Jones, who makes just shy of $80,000 a year, was quoted as saying. \u201cOur roles as council members, my role as council president, has changed tremendously\u201d because of the bankrutpcy.\n\nWinfrey chimed in that, \u201cI am severely underpaid\u201d at about $73,000 a year.\n\nWinfrey has lots of company in that sentiment among the ranks of city employees. Like the elected officials, rank and file city employees have agreed to pay cuts over the years. City Council saw its pay drop 10 percent in 2010 as part of a general payroll tightening aimed at averting the financial collapse.\n\nThe result of a decade or more of financial hardship is that the wages of most employees of the city have not kept pace with their peers. But most don\u2019t have the luxury of getting the cuts restored simply by petitioning a commission. They\u2019ll have to win them back at the bargaining table, when and if the city\u2019s finances allow.\n\nWinfrey, Jones and the other elected officials knew the pay levels for their offices when they sought them, and must have understood the inability of the city to do much about salaries.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan, in new labor contracts signed last fall, did restore some of the pay of police and firefighters, which had fallen to among the lowest paid in the region, despite the dangers and pressures of the job.\n\nThat should be the priority \u2014 providing fair compensation for workers in a competitive market.\n\nCouncil members and other elected officials don\u2019t fall into that category. When a seat on the council came open last fall, 135 people applied for the post, fully knowing what the job paid.\n\nThe compensation commission hasn\u2019t signaled what it intends to do with the pay request.\n\nBut it should keep in mind the message a pay hike for elected officials would send just three months after Detroit emerged from bankruptcy, and while pensioners are still adjusting to the pain of benefit cuts.\n\nDetroit\u2019s long-term financial stability remains uncertain. Bankruptcy has provided some budget breathing room for the next two years, but after that revenues are expected to tighten unless there is a surge in tax payments.\n\nThe commission should wait to measure the city\u2019s ability to pay for salary hikes before acting on the request from Jones and Winfrey.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1BUE51q", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A sense of timing is a wonderful thing, whether in politics or comedy or at Detroit City Hall", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "A sense of timing is a wonderful thing, whether in politics or comedy or at Detroit City Hall", "title": "In Detroit city government, let them eat cake", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/03/08/let-detroit-pols-eat-cake/24512143/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A sense of timing is a wonderful thing, whether in politics or comedy or at Detroit City Hall", "title": "Editorial: In Detroit city government, let them eat cake", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ddc2dfedd3c8eee4cad537ab2f96d20588df9ccc/c=602-0-3220-2618&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DetroitNews/2015/03/06/B99248974Z.1_20150306150745_000_G9SF5JOR.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Brenda Jones, Janice Winfrey, Detroit, Detroit City Council, city council, Detroit Elected Officials Compensation Commission, Mike Duggan, bankruptcy"}, "article_summary": "The pair asked the Detroit Elected Officials Compensation Commission to recommend a pay raise, arguing they are worth more than the salaries they\u2019re receiving.\nRoughly 12,000 city of Detroit retirees saw their monthly benefit checks cut by 4.5 percent.\nWhat Jones and Winfrey are saying is, \u201cLet them eat cake,\u201d setting themselves up as above the sacrifice required of others whose livelihoods come from the city\u2019s coffers.\nCity Council saw its pay drop 10 percent in 2010 as part of a general payroll tightening aimed at averting the financial collapse.\nThe timing of the pitch for a pay raise for Detroit\u2019s elected officials is almost funny for its obliviousness."}
