The government incorrectly pegged enrollment for Arizona’s health insurance co-op at 4 per cent of 2014 targets, unfairly placing it near the very bottom of states allowed those providers under Affordable Care.The actual results for Arizona’s nonprofit insurance company were much closer to 15 percent of 2014 targets, according to a review by The Associated Press. It revealed that the inspector general missed one of two annual reports filed by Arizona’s co-op, Meritus.The federal analysis, issued last month, erred in suggesting Arizona’s co-op had insured some 869 people by the end of its first year of operation. That painted only a third of the actual picture, missing an additional 2,662 people, according to filings to the inspector general.A spokeswoman for the agency appeared to downplay the oversight, suggesting the additional signups do little to change the inspector general’s conclusions or its recommendation.Of the 23 state co-ops – meant to compete with for-profit insurance companies under the Act – some 13 had lower than projected signups, according to the inspector general’s report.Still, Arizona’s co-op has seen its enrollment grow in 2015, the result of a stepped-up marketing campaign and a beefier website. Meritus market share is now effectively 28 percent, according to AP estimates.
