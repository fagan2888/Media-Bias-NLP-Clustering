It\u2019s always gratifying when an interview gets headlines. We cover the news, but it\u2019s also kind of fun to make news from time to time.\n\nSo I knew when I walked on stage to interview former President Bill Clinton at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation\u2019s annual fiscal summit this week that I would ask about the day\u2019s hot topic: Republican strategist Karl Rove\u2019s questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and age.\n\nAs retold in the pages of The New York Post, Mr. Rove had suggested that Mrs. Clinton suffered a \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d in a fall about 18 months ago that was far more serious than the Clintons disclosed.\n\nMr. Clinton was clearly prepared for my question about the Rove comments, and defended his wife while shrugging off the perceived accusation with a prepared joke. \u201cFirst they said she faked her concussion,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they say she\u2019s auditioning for a part on \u2018The Walking Dead.\u2019 I mean, you know, whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nAs the audience laughed, the former president glanced over to make sure I was smiling too.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. That was my final, and certainly least serious, question in a nearly hour-long conversation. If that\u2019s the only thing you heard about that interview, here are some of the other interesting things he had to say that you may have missed.\n\n102869 Bill responds to accusation that Hillary has brain damage Former President Bill Clinton discussed debt, deficit, economic growth and inequality Wednesday with Gwen Ifill, part of the 2014 Fiscal Summit sponsored by the Peterson Foundation in Washington, D.C. According to the New York Post, Republican strategist Karl Rove recently suggested that the former Secretary of State may have sustained brain damage after she suffered a fall in December 2012. disabled 2365246336 W6JsScdwa-8\n\nBill Clinton on his wife\u2019s health.\n\nInequality\n\nPresident Clinton is keenly aware of his economic record. The economy did spectacularly well during his years in office, but he has also been accused of setting the table for the 2008 financial collapse by loosening regulations on corporations and, in essence, feathering the nests of the \u201c1 percent.\u201d\n\nSo what about that?\n\nHis response: \u201cTo reduce inequality, you have to have tight labor markets and a changing job mix,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the reason that, in the eight years I served, that each quintile of the American economy increased in tandem more than at any time since the mid-\u201870s. And you can say, well, inequality has still increased, because the top 1 percent did better, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much you could do about that unless you want to start jailing people.\u201d\n\nCue awkward laughter in the room.\n\nHealth Care\n\nI covered the Clintons\u2019 joint effort to get comprehensive health care passed in 1993 for The New York Times, so I knew he was a booster of the Affordable Care Act that finally kicked into place two decades later. But Mr. Clinton knows as well as anyone that embracing the law \u2013- and President Obama himself \u2013- has proved difficult for many Democrats.\n\nHis advice: run toward, not away from, the issue.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re rocking along pretty good here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beginning. And I think that the people can handle the truth. Talk about what\u2019s good about it. Talk about the remaining problems. Commit to fix the problems. That\u2019s the best political position.\u201d\n\n102894 102867 102867 Clinton gives advice to Democrats facing criticism on ACA Former President Bill Clinton discussed debt, deficit, economic growth and inequality Wednesday with Gwen Ifill.

Look, here\u2019s the problem. Immigration reform has been -\u2013 the Republicans did a lot to build up their tea party base by being against illegal immigration and making it look like the barbarians were at the gate.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to adopt immigration reform,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd ironically, if the Republicans did it, it would put them in a position to get a higher percentage of Hispanic votes because, you know, their small business rhetoric, their family responsibility rhetoric, all the stuff that they care about would be quite appealing to a lot of hardworking Hispanic immigrants.\u201d\n\nRussia\n\nMr. Clinton -\u2013 one of a series of U.S. presidents who have found themselves stymied by Vladimir Putin, suggested we should worry less about the Russian president\u2019s territorial ambitions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cHe invaded Georgia, too, and took part of that. I don\u2019t agree with this, and I think we have to be firm against it, but it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d\n\nThe Catch 22 Second Term\n\nThere are only three men living who have served two full terms as president of the United States. I was curious what advice one of them would have for President Obama, who is on the way to joining that very exclusive club.\n\nWhat\u2019s a president to do who is facing economic struggles at home as well as questions about the forcefulness of his leadership abroad?\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just have a laundry list of problems in the world, and say there they are and we didn\u2019t make them go away in 48 hours, therefore we don\u2019t have a good foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cI think the president\u2026the debate was banging the daylights out of him for\u2026staying in Afghanistan too long, having too many drone attacks, doing too much on intelligence. So he\u2019s damned if he does and dammed if he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the world we\u2019re living in.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what you missed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s always gratifying when an interview gets headlines.
