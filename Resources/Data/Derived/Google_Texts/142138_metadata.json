If that happens, the South stands ready to save Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Democratic primary in South Carolina is Saturday, Feb. 27, and Clinton has a much more comfortable lead than in the first two early states. Then Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia all vote the following Tuesday, March 1.\n\nSeveral Republican secretaries of state in the region worked together to move up the contests so that the South would have more clout. While their primary focus in creating \u201cthe SEC Primary,\u201d named for the college football conference, was prodding the GOP to choose a more conservative nominee, the unintended result has been to give the Democratic frontrunner a firewall in case things kick off poorly.\n\n\u201cI believe Hillary is a lock to sweep the Deep South,\u201d said Richard Fording, the chair of the political science department at the University of Alabama.\n\nThis was a common sentiment I heard during nine days in the South over the holidays. It\u2019s backed up by what sparse polling there is and conversations with leading Democrats.\n\n\u2014 Dynamics can change quickly. Recall 2008, when the Clinton juggernaut turned out to be not so unstoppable, but here\u2019s the bottom line: So long as the former first lady of Arkansas maintains overwhelming support among African Americans, who make up the majority of the Democratic electorate in several of these states, her outlook in the region \u2013 and for the nomination \u2013 remains very rosy.\n\nJohn Lewis introduces Clinton at an \u201cAfrican Americans for Hillary\u201d rally at Clark Atlanta University on Oct. 30. (Reuters/Tami Chappell)\n\n\u2014 Clinton has a near monopoly on support from the Democratic establishment in the South. She has spent years improving relationships that were frayed during the brutal battle with Obama, when Bill Clinton bitterly called his candidacy a \u201cfairy tale\u201d and friends like John Lewis, the civil rights hero, defected.\n\n\u2014 Lewis says he\u2019s backing Clinton \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d this time. So are a bevy of other prominent African Americans from Georgia, including former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, Reps. Hank Johnson and David Scott, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and Stacey Abrams, the powerful minority leader of the state House. The campaign rolled out these endorsements in the fall, and the support has shown no signs of fraying.\n\n\u2014 Here in Alabama, where Democrats are more of a minority party, Clinton has the strong backing of the mayor of Birmingham and the only Democrat in the nine-member congressional delegation, Terri Sewell. The former Secretary of State spoke at the Alabama Democratic Conference convention in October and then came to Montgomery in December, to mark the anniversary of the bus boycott.\n\nClinton has weighed in vocally against the state\u2019s decision to shut down 31 driver\u2019s license offices, calling it \u201ca blast from the Jim Crow past.\u201d Among the 60 Alabamians on her \u201cleadership council\u201d is Fred Gray, the civil rights attorney who defended Rosa Parks after she refused to go to the back of the bus.\n\n\u2014 Many on these \u201cleadership teams,\u201d which have been rolled out for every key Super Tuesday state, are superdelegates. They automatically get a vote at the national convention in Philadelphia next summer because they hold elected office or a party leadership position, and they are not bound by how their state votes. Nationally, Sanders has secured the backing of 11 such superdelegates, including himself. Clinton has received public pledges of support from more than 350 of about 700 total.\n\n\u201cSince the first day of her campaign, Hillary Clinton has been working hard to earn the nomination \u2013 from the early caucuses and primaries, through Super Tuesday and beyond \u2013 and she\u2019s building a ground-up grassroots campaign to get the job done,\u201d says spokesman Jesse Ferguson.\n\nHost Larry Wilmore interviews Bernie Sanders on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d last night. (Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Comedy Central)\n\n\u2014 Sanders has tried with limited success to make inroads in the SEC primary states. The campaign said recently that it will open three field offices in Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s a real uphill battle here,\u201d Juanita Juarez, who had helped gather signatures to put Sanders on the ballot in Alabama, recently told my colleague David Weigel. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of name recognition to get past. People know Hillary; the first time I talk to people about Bernie is usually the first time they\u2019ve heard about him.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 broader challenge is that he\u2019s not peeling away enough African Americans from Clinton, despite regularly campaigning with Cornel West, embracing the Black Lives Matter movement and recently traveling to Chicago essentially to criticize embattled Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton ally.\n\nSanders is not Obama. Besides the obvious, the septuagenarian has represented a rural, almost entirely white state in Congress. He\u2019s not needed to build ties with communities of color over his decades in politics.\n\n\u2014 In the short-term, the Clinton campaign is primarily focused on winning decisively in Iowa and New Hampshire. She finished third in the 2008 caucuses and has a steady, but fragile, lead in the polls this year. \u201cI know that if I get off to a good start here in Iowa, we\u2019re halfway home,\u201d Clinton said in Davenport this week, making her 75th appearance in the state since announcing her candidacy last April. \u201cThe battle for Iowa is mostly a battle of expectations,\u201d Anne Gearan and John Wagner write in today\u2019s paper. \u201cExpectations are lower for Sanders, who at times sounds almost surprised by his success.\u201d If Sanders somehow wins the first two states, Clinton is surely in for a longer slog to the nomination than widely anticipated.\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s historically unusual for a candidate to prevail in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Sanders today seems much better positioned to win in New Hampshire, which borders his own states and where he\u2019s led in public polling. Just like the Granite State broke late for Clinton eight years ago after Obama\u2019s victory in the Hawkeye State, though, it\u2019s easy to imagine something similar happening again if Sanders managed to pull out a win in Iowa on Feb. 1. Independent voters who can choose which primary to cast a ballot in might suddenly be more interested in the Democratic contest, which has been relatively staid because of the drama in the GOP field.\n\n\u2014 More than just Southern states go on March 1. Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts \u2013 plus Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont \u2013 also vote that Tuesday. Clinton has campaigned in each of these places but Vermont.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nNorth Korean soldiers parade through Pyongyang.

If this test is confirmed, it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy. \u2026 We need new leadership that will stand up to people like Kim Jong-un\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2014 Two big fights escalated in the Republican race:\n\nDonald Trump gestures during a rally at Stevens High School in Claremont, N.H., last night.

You don\u2019t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head.\u201d In the interview, Trump insisted that he was merely providing a candid assessment of his leading opponent rather than initiating a personal attack and reviving the \u201cbirther\u201d debate that he once led against President Obama. He repeatedly said he is hearing chatter on the topic among voices on the right. \u201cPeople are bringing it up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to have to ask themselves the question: \u2018Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?\u2019 That\u2019d be a big problem,\u201d Trump told The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Philip Rucker during an interview in New Hampshire. \u201cIt\u2019d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he\u2019d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision.

A CNN/WMUR New Hampshire Primary Poll of likely primary voters last month found that 56% of Republicans were still trying to choose a candidate, while 44% of Democrats were ahead of the Feb. 9 primary. \u2026 State exit polls show that the number of voters who pick a presidential nominee in the final days of the campaign has grown. In 2012, 46% of GOP primary voters chose their candidate in the three days leading up to the election, up from 39% in 2008 and 26% in 2000, University of New Hampshire Survey Center data show. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t believe in polls in New Hampshire until the weekend before the election, and I\u2019ll tell you that as a pollster,\u2019 said Zachary S. Azem, a survey center researcher.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Slate, \u201cTrump\u2019s anti\u2013Bill Clinton strategy shows how much the GOP is counting on old voters,\u201d by Jamelle Boule: \u201cThis worry\u2014and Trump\u2019s obvious bet that he can harm Hillary using Bill\u2014might make sense if this were 2004 or even 2008. But in 2016, it\u2019s an odd\u2014even bad\u2014bet. Why? Because much of the American electorate is too young to care \u2026 This November, if projections hold true, 31 percent of all eligible voters\u201468 million people\u2014will be between 18 and 35 years old.

From The Hill: \u201cThe law mandates that employers provide health insurance for people working 30 hours or more per week. This had sparked reports that some employers would cut hours to avoid paying out insurance. However, the study, which looks at data from the Current Population Survey, does not find evidence to support suggestions the law would have such an effect.'\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly said every person who buys a gun should undergo a background check, a rare opinion he shares with President Obama.
