The Bulldogs slid to fourth.\n\nOregon was bumped down to second and Florida State is now third. The Seminoles are the only undefeated team left in a Big Five conference.\n\nFlorida State fans might not be happy about how their team is being treated, but the Seminoles appear to be safe if they can keep winning right through the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game. Same goes with Alabama in the Southeastern Conference and Oregon in the Pac-12.\n\nAfter that, things get complicated.\n\nMississippi State is followed by TCU, which slipped to No. 5 after a closer-than-expected win against Kansas on Saturday. Ohio State moved up two spots to No. 6, ahead of TCU\u2019s Big 12 rival Baylor.\n\nThe Bulldogs play Vanderbilt on Saturday but finish the regular season at Ole Miss, giving them a chance for another resume-boosting victory. They could use it because their best wins from early in the season (LSU, Texas A&M and Auburn) have been tarnished a bit lately.\n\nOhio State is in position to play in the Big Ten championship if it wins out.\n\nThe Big 12 has no conference championship game. TCU and Baylor would be co-champs if each finishes 11-1, but Baylor beat the Horned Frogs in Waco, Texas last month.\n\nThe selection protocol calls for the committee to use championships won as a tiebreaker if teams have similar resumes.\n\nSelection Committee chairman Jeff Long said \u201cthe differences between teams four through seven are narrow, very narrow.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s narrow enough to allow TCU, Ohio State or Baylor to jump past Mississippi State if one of those teams wins its conference and Mississippi State doesn\u2019t remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any way to project that,\u201d said Long, the athletic director at Arkansas. \u201cIt will certainly be weighed into the equation on Dec. 6 and 7.\u201d\n\nThe committee releases its final rankings on Dec. 7, the day after most of the conference championship games are played.\n\nLong said Alabama controlled the game in its 25-20 victory against Mississippi State enough to earn the big promotion this week. Alabama led by two scores in the fourth quarter and Mississippi State cut the lead to five with a touchdown with 15 seconds left.\n\nLong referred to game control a few times this week. It\u2019s not a metric used by the committee but a subjective discussion about how the game was played.\n\nTCU rallied for a 34-30 victory against Kansas, and Long noted how the Horned Frogs\u2019 inability to control the game against struggling team negatively affected their resume.\n\nLong also said a second straight road victory for Ohio State, this one against Minnesota after beating Michigan State the week before, helped the Buckeyes move up two spots. Still, an early season home loss to Virginia Tech is a mark against Ohio State.\n\n\u201cWhile they have certainly added to their resume and shown they are a better team, it doesn\u2019t erase that loss,\u201d Long said of the Buckeyes.\n\nThe committee still doesn\u2019t have a team from outside the Big Five conferences in its rankings but will have to pick the best of that group in the final rankings to fill a guaranteed spot in the New Year\u2019s bowls.\n\nLong said the committee discussed undefeated Marshall of Conference USA, Boise State and Colorado State of the Mountain West, Northern Illinois of the Mid-American Conference and Memphis from the American Athletic Conference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alabama jumped from fifth to first after handing previously undefeated and top-ranked Mississippi State its first loss on Saturday.
