United listed Ohio as a \u201cHigh Outbound\u201d state because more than 55 percent of the company\u2019s 7,641 Ohio moves were outbound.\n\nUnited reported 1,371 net outbound moves in Ohio during 2014. Of the 48 contiguous states, only New Jersey, Illinois and New York had a higher number of net outbound moves than Ohio.\n\n\u201cWith Ohio\u2019s middling job growth since 2011, it isn\u2019t a surprise that people are voting with their feet by moving to states where opportunities exist and the path to prosperity isn\u2019t so long,\u201d Matt Mayer, president of free market think tank Opportunity Ohio, told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\nOhio\u2019s economy has added fewer than 300,000 jobs since January 2011, although the state lost 455,000 jobs from March 2006 through February 2010. For the first three quarters of 2014, Ohio\u2019s job creation rate ranked 44th nationally.\n\nIn Opportunity Ohio\u2019s most recent monthly Ohio Jobs Recovery report, Mayer projected Ohio would not likely recover to peak March 2000 employment levels until late 2020.\n\n\u201cI hope Governor (John) Kasich and the General Assembly now move beyond the re-election rhetoric and realize Ohio remains mired in high government spending, slow job growth and pro-union policies,\u201d Mayer told Ohio Watchdog.\n\nHe added, \u201cI wish Governor Kasich would fight as hard on issues like right-to-work and less government spending as he does for expanding Medicaid and hiking the severance tax. Ohio\u2019s private sector employers and taxpayers sure could use his zeal where it really matters to them.\u201d\n\nRight-to-work laws protect the right of workers to choose whether to pay a union. Of the top 10 \u201cHigh Inbound\u201d states in United\u2019s 2014 National Movers Study, seven were right-to-work states. Of United\u2019s top 10 \u201cHigh Outbound\u201d states, only two were right-to-work states.\n\nIn the Atlas Van Lines 2014 Migration Patterns report, Ohio\u2019s ratio of inbound to outbound moves ranked 45th of the 50 states; Ohio\u2019s net migration ranked 48th of the 50 states.\n\nAtlas completed 1,934 moves into Ohio and 2,707 moves out of Ohio, for a net of 773 outbound moves. Only Illinois and New York had more net outbound moves than Ohio.\n\nBecause more than 55 percent of all Atlas shipments in Ohio were outbound, Ohio was listed as one of 14 \u201cOutbound\u201d states. Ohio has been listed as an Outbound state in each of the past 10 annual Migration Patterns releases, and, at 59 percent outbound moves, is tied with New York for the highest percentage of outbound moves over the decade.\n\nIn the Allied Van Lines 2014 Magnet States Report, Ohio\u2019s ratio of inbound to outbound moves ranked 37th of the contiguous states, D.C. and Alaska. With 344 net outbound moves, Ohio\u2019s net migration ranked 42nd \u2014 a drop of one position from the previous year.\n\nAllied moved 1,834 households into the state and 2,178 households out of the state last year.\n\nCensus Bureau findings later in the year consistent with the figures reported by United Van Lines, Atlas Van Lines and Allied Van Lines would represent the continuation of a negative trend, as Ohio has been losing population to other states for decades. Ohio has 16 seats in the U.S. House, compared to 24 seats in the 1960s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More families moved out of Ohio than moved into the state last year, according to reports from three of the nation's largest moving companies.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "More families moved out of Ohio than moved into the state last year, according to reports from three of the nation's largest moving companies.", "title": "Ohio lost interstate migration battle again in 2014", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/united-van-lines-2014-map-300px.gif", "updated_time": "2015-01-13T15:46:20+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/192463/ohio-migration-2014/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "More families moved out of Ohio than moved into the state last year, according to reports from three of the nation's largest moving companies.", "title": "Ohio lost interstate migration battle again in 2014", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/united-van-lines-2014-map-300px.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-01-14T04:00:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-13T15:46:20+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "migration, interstate migration, state-to-state migration, Matt Mayer, Opportunity Ohio, United Van Lines, Atlas Van Lines, Allied Van Lines, right-to-work"}, "article_summary": "Because more than 55 percent of all Atlas shipments in Ohio were outbound, Ohio was listed as one of 14 \u201cOutbound\u201d states.\nUnited listed Ohio as a \u201cHigh Outbound\u201d state because more than 55 percent of the company\u2019s 7,641 Ohio moves were outbound.\nWith 344 net outbound moves, Ohio\u2019s net migration ranked 42nd \u2014 a drop of one position from the previous year.\nAtlas completed 1,934 moves into Ohio and 2,707 moves out of Ohio, for a net of 773 outbound moves.\nUnited reported 1,371 net outbound moves in Ohio during 2014."}
