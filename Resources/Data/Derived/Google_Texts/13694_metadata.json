The Los Angeles Times reported former Newsweek media reporter Seth Mnookin was the first journalist to get upset:\n\nThe outcry began Tuesday with a blog post from science writer Seth Mnookin, who had spoken extensively with a \"Katie\" producer who assured him the segment would not be alarmist. Mnookin was therefore troubled by the sensationalistic teaser for the episode: \"The HPV vaccine is considered a life-saving cancer preventer \u2026 but is it a potentially deadly dose for girls?\"\n\nMichael Specter of The New Yorker, a former reporter for both The New York Times and The Washington Post, tweeted \u201cThe shameful @katiecouric HPV vaccine show was a model of dangerously misinformed reporting. Katie, your credibility is gone.\u201d Time magazine went for the jugular: \u201cIs Katie Couric the new Jenny McCarthy?\u201d McCarthy has argued autism is caused by vaccines.\n\nThe journalists were upset at the tilt and panic of the segment. Have you ever noticed these \"science\" defenders don't get upset when we're warned the planet is facing a \"deadly dose\" of human activity causing catastrophic global warming?\n\nCouric and her staff weren\u2019t apologizing in an update on the show\u2019s website:\n\nWhile many appreciated us raising the topic, others were critical of us for providing what they felt was a disproportionate amount of time to two families who faced the rare circumstances of seeing their children\u2019s health deteriorate after receiving Gardasil. The health problems may or may not be linked to the vaccine.\n\nFor those of you who watched the show, you know we presented the facts supporting the potential of the vaccine and that Katie\u2019s own daughters received the vaccine. This is an important personal decision to be made in consultation with your doctor and other family advisors...\n\n\n\nWe do not want to leave our viewers with an irrational fear of the vaccine and for that reason we\u2019re going to continue the conversation and invite a number of medical experts, journalists and scientists to weigh in here, on our site. We\u2019ll keep you posted!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Katie Couric put herself on the wrong side of liberals Wednesday with a show questioning the safety of the Gardasil vaccine to prevent the Human Papilloma Virus that causes cervical cancer.
