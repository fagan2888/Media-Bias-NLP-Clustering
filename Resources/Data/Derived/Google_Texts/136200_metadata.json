The new building will serve more than 1,000 children, which is double the capacity of the existing space.\n\nThe $4.3 million project is funded through startup grants and a capital match campaign by the city, which is 92 percent complete.\n\nFunding for the Boys & Girls Club was jumpstarted in 2011 by a $1 million grant from Suncor, a $250,000 capital commitment from Commerce City and a $166,000 U.S. Housing & Urban Development appropriation from Rep. Ed Perlmutter.\n\nThe city has also appropriated an annual operating budget of $80,000for regular maintenance and upkeep of the new club. The project is moving through zoning and permitting in the city quickly to meet the scheduled fall 2015 opening.\n\nThe remaining 8 percent of the city\u2019s fundraising goal still needs to be met. All donations will be matched on the dollar, thanks to private financiers, officials said.\n\nMegan Mitchell: 303-954-2650, or mmitchell@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former Greyhound Park in Commerce City getting Boys & Girls Club", "title": "Former Greyhound Park in Commerce City getting Boys & Girls Club", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/14/former-greyhound-park-in-commerce-city-getting-boys-girls-club/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T15:20:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:08:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2930\"", "article_summary": "\u201cInvesting in the Suncor Boys & Girls Club meets that objective, providing a return on investment for generations to come.\u201dThe new Suncor Boys & Girls Club will include a STEM lab, art room, learning center, teen center, commercial kitchen and full-sized gymnasium.\nA 20,000 square foot Boys & Girls Club will be the first new development on Commerce City\u2019s remediated, 65-acre Greyhound Park site in fall 2015.\nThe new Suncor Boys & Girls Club will move its operations two blocks from its current spot inside Kearney Middle School at 6160 Kearney St.\nCity officials said that since the original Boys & Girls Club opened at Kearney Middle School in 2007,enrollment has skyrocketed.\n\u201cOne way of achieving our vision of a \u2018Quality Community for a Lifetime\u2019 is measuring the opportunities available to our youth,\u201d Commerce City Mayor Sean Ford said in a statement."}
