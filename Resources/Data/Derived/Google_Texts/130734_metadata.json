(Photo: Anthony Kelly)\n\nYou knew this was coming.\n\nThe governor promised tax cuts so there were going to be some form of tax cuts, no matter what. Perhaps because somewhere down the line when he is running for something else he'll be able to say he cut taxes.\n\nAlthough, should the governor seek another office at some point he'd be wise to leave out the part about tapping into the state land trust fund (for 10 years) and leaving the financial ramifications of that to some future governor. And the part where poor kids got left out in the cold. Or the heat. Or wherever.\n\nApparently, the budget deal being cut behind closed doors at the Capitol doesn't yet reinstate the Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP, that has been held up by Senate President Andy Biggs, who opposes the program.\n\nI say \"yet\" because there's still hope.\n\nFor now, Arizona remains the only state that does not have such a program, which would provide health-care coverage to more than 30,000 kids who are ineligible now.\n\nWe're talking about children whose parents make too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to buy into Obamacare.\n\nThe fight to have the program isn't over. Ducey can push for it. He can demand it. As he did with those tax cuts.\n\nRepublican Rep. Justin Olson, House Appropriations chairman, told The Republic, \u201cThe governor campaigned on a promise to cut taxes every year that he\u2019s in office and expect that he wants to keep that promise to his constituents.\"\n\nOf course those cuts are of a more targeted variety. (Meaning, probably, businesses. Not you. Or me.)\n\nAnd then there's the ongoing fight over education funding. We'll be behind most other states no matter what happens with Proposition 123.\n\nIt's those pesky kids again, wondering if their government will do what it can to see that they are educated and healthy.\n\nOr, as they might put it in their generation's social media shorthand:\n\n#priorities?\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1SxmKQB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "EJ Montini: You knew this was coming.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "EJ Montini: You knew this was coming.", "title": "Montini: Tax cuts for business; no health care for poor kids - #priorities?", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2016/04/26/montini-gov-doug-ducey-kidscare-budget/83531440/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EJ Montini: You knew this was coming.", "title": "Montini: Tax cuts for business; no health care for poor kids - #priorities?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce84c33c33ddc74220b6ced1712db914c8da7cc9/c=449-0-2785-2336&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/ejmontini"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/KidsCare", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/KidsCare", "title": "Montini: Tax cuts for business; no health care for poor kids - #priorities?", "author": "EJ Montini", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed/ej-montini", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04376036197770bdfc1f851968d847a0a9d6dd66/c=876-0-2628-2336/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f12c4d63115e23c9125a3eb8976f9c42d5b32697/c=449-0-2785-2336/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3e37e4f88d6721e7979211fb52d625d09b96924/c=199-0-3306-2336/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01156a4c62938089786622cf005fb8870a907b76/c=0-0-3499-1977&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-26T07:01:23.717000-07:00", "shorthed": "Montini: Leaving kids out of the budget", "articleid": 83531440, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/77fe949cef05b1f66279a27672807cc7624fd9dd/c=0-0-3499-1977/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c27526881df191382f155f3111f6c8e962dfcebf/c=918-0-2226-2336/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635972283476301105-sadgirl.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "montini, gov. doug ducey, kidscare, budget"}, "article_summary": "The governor promised tax cuts so there were going to be some form of tax cuts, no matter what.\nAs he did with those tax cuts.\nPerhaps because somewhere down the line when he is running for something else he'll be able to say he cut taxes.\nIt's those pesky kids again, wondering if their government will do what it can to see that they are educated and healthy.\nAnd the part where poor kids got left out in the cold."}
