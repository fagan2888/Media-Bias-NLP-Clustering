The clinic, sponsored by the National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics (NAFC) in conjunction with the Kansas City CARE Clinic, highlights the continued need for increased access to medical care as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is implemented and as many states, including Missouri, continue to debate over Medicaid expansion.\n\n\n\n\"Even in the face of the ACA implementation, access to affordable health care is still a major issue for so many in this country,\" said Nicole Lamoureux, NAFC CEO. \"In fact, many are surprised to hear that even after full implementation of the ACA, according to the Congressional Budget Office, there may be as many as 29 million people who are still without access to health insurance. As our nation continues to debate the future of the ACA and health care in general, Free and Charitable Clinics remain an important part of the safety-net and continue to provide affordable care to those who need it most.\"\n\n\n\nThe details for the clinic are as follows:\n\n\n\nNAFC C.A.R.E Clinic\n\nSaturday, April 18, 2015 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nBartle Hall Kansas City Convention Center\n\nKansas City, Missouri\n\n\n\n\"Today, there are approximately 816,000 people who are uninsured in the state of Missouri and after full ACA implementation there will still be 539,000 uninsured Missourians as Medicaid was not expanded in our state,\" said Sheri Wood, CEO of the Kansas City CARE Clinic. \"As one of the National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics' largest clinic members, we are excited that the C.A.R.E. Clinic will be returning to our city. The Kansas City CARE Clinic is looking forward to collaborating with our community partners and volunteers to enable patients who attend the one-day clinic event to be connected to safety net clinics to establish a health home as well as other local resources for continued access to health care.\"\n\n\n\nThe NAFC recognizes that many people continue to have little to no access to affordable health care and need help now. This will be the 15th in a series of large C.A.R.E. (Communities Are Responding Everyday) Clinics held around the country to bring together physicians and other health care professionals, as well as non-medical volunteers, to serve the needs of thousands of people who might otherwise go without medical care. Since September 2009, more than 16,500 uninsured patients have received medical care at the NAFC's C.A.R.E. Clinics with the help of about 15,000 volunteers. In addition to the first Kansas City C.A.R.E. Clinic, which was held in December 2009, clinics have been held in: Houston; New Orleans; Little Rock; Kansas City; Hartford; Atlanta; Washington, D.C.; Charlotte; Tacoma; Dallas and Madison.\n\n\n\nBoth medical and non-medical volunteers are needed to participate in the free clinic event in Kansas City.
