Regardless of how anyone feels about this law, this year has been filled with fears about an unaffordable healthcare landscape.\n\nMillions of retirees like me, spent decades working for a single corporation at an agreed-to lower total salary in exchange for the commitment of lifetime health benefit and other protections from our former employers. We earned and paid for these benefits in our working years. I used this information in planning my retirement.\n\nDisregarding our sacrifice, a new generation of greedy CEOs, have been actively diminishing and cancelling retiree earned health benefits. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in what I am now paying for my health care insurance,\n\nEnough elected leaders in Washington, D.C. have yet to stand up and do something to protect and maintain the retiree benefits that we earned over decades-long careers. Programs such as Social Security and Medicare are critical but just not sufficient for all older Americans to survive on.\n\nI am part of a group ProtectSeniors.orgwhich is leading the charge to protect retiree benefits from being cancelled or diminished. I urge my fellow retirees to stand up and be heard before it is too late.\n\nMarvin Archabald\n\nCamillus", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Charley Hannagan, health insurance, Retirement, opinion", "title": "Senior citizens call on politicians to protect retiree health benefits (Your letters)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Senior citizens call on politicians to protect retiree health benefits (Your letters)\", \"link\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/03/seniors_call_on_politicians_to_protect_retiree_health_benefits_your_letters.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/17233153-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15439876\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-03-12T11:45:23Z\", \"author\": \"Your Letters\", \"tags\": [\"@topstory\",\"Charley Hannagan\",\"health insurance\",\"Retirement\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/17233153-standard.jpg", "description": "'We earned and paid for these benefits in our working years.
