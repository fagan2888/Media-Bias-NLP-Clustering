I try to do my best in the swim, then in my bike and then in the run.\"\n\nWhile Blanco was the overall champion, Boulder's Susan Brooker was the top female finisher.\n\nBlanco, who is from Buenos Aires, has been competing in triathlons since he was 14. Just two weeks ago, he arrived in Boulder, where he will train for the fourth summer in a row. He typically spends five to six months training here.\n\nIt wasn't until Friday that Blanco got his new bike. Then he heard about this event and on Saturday called race organizer Karen Charles to see if he could still get in. Not only was there room on the entry list; Charles also had a spot in her home for Blanco to crash on Saturday night. Riding his bike and a bus, he made the trip to Longmont on Saturday night.\n\nAfter picking up his award on Sunday, he planned to make the return bike/bus trip to Boulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the race itself, Blanco said it pushed him because he's not quite adjusted to the Colorado altitude.\n\n\"This race, I like,\" he said. \"The course is very nice. The bike and running are very hard. This is good training for me, because I work hard. I push my legs. Maybe the next day I have pain, but I can train more.\"\n\nBrooker, who turns 51 next month, couldn't believe she walked away a winner on Sunday. A distance runner for many years, Brooker is in her second season as a triathlete, and Sunday was just her fourth race.\n\n\"It's totally amazing,\" she said. \"I know it's a more low-key race, versus what you have in Boulder, but at my age to come out here and win this is pretty amazing. Hopefully it's inspirational to other people.\"\n\nA full-time mother of two kids, Brooker said she didn't have any goals of winning, or even any time goals going into the race.\n\n\"The bike has been my weak link, so I've been working on trying to get stronger on the bike,\" she said. \"To have a good bike split was probably my biggest goal for the race and it went pretty well.\"\n\nBrooker credited her success to Boulder Coaching, which has worked with her the past two years.\n\n\"They've been phenomenal in getting me in pretty good shape,\" she said.\n\nThe bulk of the work was done by Brooker, though, and she was thrilled with the result.\n\n\"I love the challenge and I love, especially as you get older, the cross training is really good to help prevent injury and stay strong,\" she said. \"I'm very motivated to train, because I know you put the work in and you can improve.\"\n\nIn the men's race, Boulder's Michael Foster was second, just 38 seconds behind Blanco. Frederick's Todd Robinson finished third, only nine seconds behind Foster.\n\nLongmont's Jennifer Findley was second in the women's race, finishing 1:37 after Brooker. Boulder's Katie Herrell was third.\n\nSeveral months after the event was nearly canceled, there were roughly 225 finishers - on par with the 2013 numbers.\n\nCharles, who has directed this race for years, was pleased to see the support as the 34th edition drew to a close. A large card was set up for people to sign for support, and several participants told Charles they planned to write to city council to thank them for keeping the event alive.\n\n\"I have a passion for the job and what I do,\" Charles said. \"This is just a little bit of what I do, but the passion is still there and as long as people want it, I'm glad we can give it to them.\"\n\nA year ago, Charles was sure she had seen the last Longmont Triathlon, but now said she believes it'll go on for years to come.\n\n34th Annual Longmont Triathlon\n\n(For complete results, visit myentryfee.com)\n\nMen's Top 20 finishers (Name, age, hometown, time) \u2014 1.
