Kansas is set to begin a drug testing program next year for some welfare recipients similar to a Missouri program that cost about $500,000 and turned up fewer than two dozen people who tested positive.

After eight months, and 636 drug test requests, Missouri's program this year cost nearly $500,000 and found 20 people who tested positive. About 200 others refused to comply.

The Kansas City Star reports that like Missouri, Kansas will test welfare recipients who are suspected of drug use, sometimes flagged by tests or a questionnaire.

Kansas Sen. Jeff King, who authored the state's testing plan, says some people will not apply for benefits if they think they will test positive. He says that should be considered in evaluating any drug testing plan.
