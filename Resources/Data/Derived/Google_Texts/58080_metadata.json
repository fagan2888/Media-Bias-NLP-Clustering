The car dealership is now the latest to take on and defeat the Obama administration in court.\n\nThe Obama administration agreed today to a federal court order in Randy Reed Automotive v. Sebelius that stops enforcement of the administration\u2019s abortion pill mandate against a Missouri family-run business:\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom Senior Legal Counsel Dale Schowengerdt told LifeNews: \u201cThe government has no business forcing citizens to choose between making a living and living free. Today\u2019s order means that this family will be free from that type of coercion while higher courts are considering the administration\u2019s mandate. If the government can force family business owners and job creators like this one to act contrary to their deepest convictions under the threat of fining them out of business, it is a danger to everybody.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court last week agreed to take a case from Christian-run business Hobby Lobby, which is suing the Obama administration over its mandate that it pay for birth control and abortion-causing drugs for its employees. But where do Americans stand on the issue of whether employers should be forced to comply with the mandate?\n\nA new Rasmussen Reports poll shows they apparently agree.\n\n\u201cHalf of voters now oppose a government requirement that employers provide health insurance with free contraceptives for their female employees,\u201d Rasmussen reports.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe poll found: \u201cThe latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 38% of Likely U.S. Voters still believe businesses should be required by law to provide health insurance that covers all government-approved contraceptives for women without co-payments or other charges to the patient.\n\nFifty-one percent (51%) disagree and say employers should not be required to provide health insurance with this type of coverage. Eleven percent (11%) are not sure.\u201d\n\nAnother poll last week found 59 percent of Americans disagree with the mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Court: Obama Admin Can't Make Family-Run Car Dealership Follow HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Randy Reed Automotive is a family-run automotive group in Missouri that doesn't want to comply with the Obamacare abortion mandate requiring it to pay for birth", "title": "Court: Obama Admin Can\u2019t Make Family-Run Car Dealership Follow HHS Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/12/03/court-obama-admin-cant-make-family-run-car-dealership-follow-hhs-mandate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pichealth43-e1338765492951.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "court,obama,hhs,mandate,pro-life,abortion", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce150\"", "article_summary": "Fifty-one percent (51%) disagree and say employers should not be required to provide health insurance with this type of coverage.\n\u201cHalf of voters now oppose a government requirement that employers provide health insurance with free contraceptives for their female employees,\u201d Rasmussen reports.\nVoters still believe businesses should be required by law to provide health insurance that covers all government-approved contraceptives for women without co-payments or other charges to the patient.\nThe car dealership is now the latest to take on and defeat the Obama administration in court.\nEleven percent (11%) are not sure.\u201dAnother poll last week found 59 percent of Americans disagree with the mandate."}
