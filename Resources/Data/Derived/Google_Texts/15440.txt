Gaze upon the new face of campus horror, if you dare.

Some readers will recognize the grim visage of David Horowitz to the right. Horowitz is the P.C.-hating activist whose personal odyssey from hardcore '60s radical lefty to Reagan-grokkin' conservative agitator has been documented endlessly in his own writings and those of countless other champions and critics.

Horowitz recently spoke to "an audience of about 100 people" at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a campus with about 30,000 students and 3,600 faculty. He was invited by the College Republicans.

According to student-newspaper accounts, Horowitz said "that student organizations like the Muslim Students’ Association and Students for Justice in Palestine are connected to terrorist organizations." Which is another way of saying he was mailing it in.

Yet his very presence provoked a campus hashtag campaign under the name #notsafeUNC. The student organizer explained:

“It came out of a desire to create a platform for students to be able to explain and share their own situations and experiences and incidents that have happened to them on campus that have made feel unsafe."

Because this is a contemporary college, there is the requisite quote from a student who holds some vague position of power ("senior advisor the student body president") about how college is no place for freedom of thought and speech:

[Andrew] Brennen said though he is a supporter of freedom of speech, Horowitz’s speech was unacceptable. “I love intellectual diversity, but I do not think that intellectual diversity should be used as a means to target students on campus.”

Whole thing here.
