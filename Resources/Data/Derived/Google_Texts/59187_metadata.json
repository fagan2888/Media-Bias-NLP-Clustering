He revealed his plans for reform on Wednesday in a video posted to Facebook.\n\nHe\u2019ll follow up the Thursday TV event with a pro-immigration rally in Las Vegas on Friday at Del Sol High School.\n\nObama had visited the same school, with a large population of non-English speaking students, in 2013 to unveil his blueprint for comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nObama will attend a pro-immigration rally at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas. He is seen at the school in January. (\u00a9 Jason Reed / Reuters/Reuters)\n\nNevada is the homestate of current Sen. Majority Leader (and soon to be Minority Leader) Harry Reid (D).\n\nReid had urged Obama early this week to go it alone and take executive action to reform the country\u2019s immigration system.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, the current Republican Minority Leader, is expected to take to the Senate floor on Thursday to slam Obama for bypassing Congress.\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "ABC, NBC, FOX and CBS will stick to their regularly scheduled programming instead of showing the President's plan for immigration reform.", "title": "Broadcast networks diss Obama, won't carry immigration talk", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/broadcast-networks-diss-obama-won-carry-immigration-talk-article-1.2017295", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2017294.1416491487!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/network21n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Leslie Larson", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-20T13:58:22", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/broadcast-networks-diss-obama-won-carry-immigration-talk-article-1.2017295", "parsely-title": "Broadcast networks diss Obama, won't carry immigration talk", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-20T08:58:22-0500", "sailthru.title": "Broadcast networks diss Obama, won't carry immigration talk", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2017294.1416491487!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/network21n-1-web.jpg", "description": "ABC, NBC, FOX and CBS will stick to their regularly scheduled programming instead of showing the President's plan for immigration reform.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "ABC, NBC, FOX and CBS will stick to their regularly scheduled programming instead of showing the President's plan for immigration reform.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "ABC, NBC, FOX and CBS will stick to their regularly scheduled programming instead of showing the President's plan for immigration reform.", "title": "Broadcast networks diss Obama, won't carry immigration talk", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/broadcast-networks-diss-obama-won-carry-immigration-talk-article-1.2017295", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2017294.1416491487!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/network21n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "LESLIE LARSON", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2017294.1416491487!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/network21n-1-web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2f5\"", "article_summary": "The four broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, FOX and CBS) won\u2019t show President Obama\u2019s immigration announcement Thursday at 8pm EST and will stick to their regularly scheduled programming.\nReid had urged Obama early this week to go it alone and take executive action to reform the country\u2019s immigration system.\nObama had visited the same school, with a large population of non-English speaking students, in 2013 to unveil his blueprint for comprehensive immigration legislation.\nObama will attend a pro-immigration rally at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas.\nHe\u2019ll follow up the Thursday TV event with a pro-immigration rally in Las Vegas on Friday at Del Sol High School."}
