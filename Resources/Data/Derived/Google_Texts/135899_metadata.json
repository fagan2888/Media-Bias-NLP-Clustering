John Kasich\u2019s presidential poll numbers may not be climbing much, but Ohio\u2019s Medicaid costs certainly have.\n\nThe state\u2019s annual Medicaid spending has increased by nearly $6 billion since Kasich took office. Based on \u201call funds\u201d figures from the Ohio Department of Medicaid, spending skyrocketed by 30 percent from 2011-15.\n\nCampaigning for the Republican presidential nomination as a budget-balancing welfare reformer, Kasich points to Ohio\u2019s Medicaid growth as proof he\u2019s kept spending in check.\n\n\u201cOur Medicaid program, by the way, is growing at less than 4 percent,\u201d Kasich told Sean Hannity during a July 21 Fox News interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like the best growth rate in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have taken Medicaid from a growth of 10 percent when I came in, in my second budget was at 2 percent without taking anybody off the rolls and without cutting any benefits,\u201d Kasich said during a Sept. 1 New Hampshire campaign stop.\n\nAveraged over Kasich\u2019s first two budgets, Ohio Medicaid spending increased by 7.4 percent per year \u2014 according to numbers from Kasich\u2019s own administration.\n\nKasich\u2019s first two budgets covered fiscal years 2012-13 and 2014-15. Ohio\u2019s Medicaid spending increased by 4.1 percent in fiscal year 2012, 2.5 percent in 2013, 10.6 percent in 2014 and 12.5 percent in 2015.\n\nWhat numbers is Kasich using when he says Ohio Medicaid spending \u201cis growing at less than 4 percent?\u201d Not the state\u2019s frequently-cited General Revenue Fund expenditures: GRF spending on Medicaid has increased by 34 percent under Kasich.\n\nKasich\u2019s campaign failed to respond to a request for explanation.\n\n\u201cI am sure the Governor is quoting average spending per Medicaid enrollee growth,\u201d State Rep. Jim Butler, a Republican from Oakwood, told Ohio Watchdog.\n\nBut while Kasich spins per-member cost growth as equivalent to overall Medicaid growth, his Obamacare expansion has swelled Ohio\u2019s Medicaid rolls by 620,000 members.\n\nBACKGROUND: Ohio\u2019s dependence on Medicaid is the worst in the Midwest\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion \u201chas likely masked the unsustainable increase in spending that is occurring with the Medicaid system,\u201d Butler said, because Obamacare expansion enrollees typically have lower health care costs than traditional Medicaid recipients.\n\nObamacare expansion covers working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities. Traditional Medicaid covers children, pregnant women, poor families, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nButler said Ohio\u2019s per-member Medicaid costs are still increasing at an alarming rate, considering how rapidly enrollment has climbed under Kasich.\n\nIn fiscal year 2011 \u2014 the final year of Democrat governor Ted Strickland\u2019s final budget \u2014 Ohio Medicaid spending totaled $17.7 billion. In fiscal year 2015, which ended in June, Ohio Medicaid spending totaled $23.5 billion.\n\nKasich\u2019s Department of Medicaid projected this winter that Ohio Medicaid spending would total $28.2 billion in 2017, a staggering 59 percent increase from when Kasich took office in 2011.\n\nBy contrast, Ohio\u2019s budgeted 2017 spending for the attorney general\u2019s office, Department of Public Safety and Department of Rehabilitation & Correction is just $2.2 billion combined.\n\nThe 2017 Ohio Department of Education budget is $11.1 billion, and the 2017 budget for the Ohio Department of Higher Education is $2.6 billion.\n\nInstead of investigating Ohio\u2019s skyrocketing Medicaid costs, newspapers across the state seem content to quote Ohio Department of Medicaid press releases. In July, ODM announced total 2015 Medicaid spending was $1.9 billion less than expected.\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s total Medicaid spending was nearly $2 billion below estimates for the fiscal year that ended in June, despite more newly eligible enrollees,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nThroughout the AP story, Ohio\u2019s smaller-than-expected Medicaid spending increase was described as a \u201csavings.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedicaid spending was nearly $2 billion below estimates,\u201d gloated the left-wing editors of the Toledo Blade in an editorial bashing \u201canti-government extremists\u201d opposed to Obamacare expansion.\n\nTraditional Medicaid enrollment was lower than expected in 2015, but Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost $1.5 billion more than projected in its first 18 months.\n\nButler told Ohio Watchdog the overall ODM figures aren\u2019t so sunny upon closer inspection.\n\nThe state didn\u2019t make an annual payment of nearly $600 million to hospitals in 2015, and there was overlap between spending budgeted by the General Assembly and spending budgeted for Obamacare expansion by the Ohio Controlling Board.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
