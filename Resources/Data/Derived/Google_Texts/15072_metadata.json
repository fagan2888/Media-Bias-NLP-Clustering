(AP) - The New York Giants opened their mandatory offseason minicamp without their best defensive player.\n\nDefensive end Jason Pierre-Paul is skipping the three-day minicamp after deciding not to sign the team\u2019s $14.8 million tender offer as its franchise player.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not a surprise, his absence on Tuesday is a setback for struggling unit that is trying to learn a new defense and rebound with Steve Spagnuolo back for a second stint as coordinator.\n\n\u201cAll I know is that he is not here,\u201d said coach Tom Coughlin, who has seen the Giants miss the playoffs the past three seasons.\n\n\u201cHe has been here for a couple of days and spent a couple of days in the classroom, and seemed to do well with the information given up that that point,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cBut since he has left, obviously he has received nothing.\u201d\n\nPierre-Paul is the Giants\u2019 playermaker. He led them with 12 1/2 sacks last season and was finished tied for third with 77 tackles.\n\n\u201cAnybody can put a highlight film together and make a play look great,\u201d Spagnuolo said of Pierre-Paul. \u201cIf you just watch tape with JPP out there, it is evident to me that he is an elite defensive end and fits a 4-3 system, which is exciting.\u201d\n\nSpagnuolo says Pierre-Paul is falling behind in the new system. However, he appreciated that the 2010 first-rounder met with line coach Robert Nunn and discussed some of the defensive changes when the offseason training program started on April 20.\n\n\u201cI thought that spoke volumes to who he is, what he\u2019s about and how important this is to him,\u201d Spagnuolo said.\n\nPierre-Paul met with Nunn six or seven times after the offseason program started nearly two months ago to go over the new defense.\n\n\u201cI thought he had a very good grasp of it when he left,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cWhen he gets here, that\u2019s where we will begin.\u201d\n\nThe Giants have until July 15 to either sign Pierre-Paul to a long-term deal or risk losing him to free agency after the season.\n\nThe 26-year-old Pierre-Paul is not under contract and can\u2019t be fined. Skipping the workouts also helps him to avoid an injury, which would put a long-term contract at risk.\n\nPierre-Paul has been working out in Florida with a personal trainer. He wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment Tuesday.\n\nLinebacker Jon Beason said that while it would have been nice to have Pierre-Paul at the workouts, the players understand he has to take care of business.\n\n\u201cHe is going to be a big part of our success this year,\u201d Beason said. \u201cHe has come in and taken the initiative to get some chalk board work done - I don\u2019t know if I am supposed to point that out, but that\u2019s being a big vet and means a lot him.\u2019\n\nEugene Parker, his agent, didn\u2019t return an email from The Associated Press seeking a comment on contract talks with the Giants.\n\nDefensive tackle Markus Kuhn said the linemen aren\u2019t worried about Pierre-Paul. They know he will be ready to go when he signs.\n\n\u201cWe know he is working and we know what he can do, so it\u2019s bringing us up to his standards more than the other way around,\u201d Kuhn said.\n\nNOTES: TE Larry Donnell hopes to get a boot off his left foot in two days. \u2026OT Will Beatty said that tearing a pectoral muscle last month while weightlifting was a fluke accident. He did was not at his maximum weight when the injury happened. The team said he will be sidelined for up to six months, but he hopes to return sooner. \u2026PK Josh Brown doesn\u2019t plan to change his approach to extra points with the league moving it back to the 15-yard line this season. It\u2019s just another kick, although from 33-yards now. \u201cCome fall it\u2019s going to be a bigger deal than people think, considering the situations, time in the game, circumstances of the season, and the playoffs. Every point is going to matter.\u201d \u2026 LB Unai\u2019 Unga, S Mykkele Thompson and CB Prince Amukamara had interceptions during the two-hour practice.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Giants opened their mandatory offseason minicamp without their best defensive player.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The New York Giants opened their mandatory offseason minicamp without their best defensive player.", "title": "Giants open mandatory minicamp without Jason Pierre-Paul", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/giants-open-mandatory-minicamp-without-jason-pierr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/16/508d3f9be4ce951a790f6a7067003afa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/16/508d3f9be4ce951a790f6a7067003afa.jpg", "description": "The New York Giants opened their mandatory offseason minicamp without their best defensive player.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Giants open mandatory minicamp without Jason Pierre-Paul"}, "Author": "TOM CANAVAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca172\"", "article_summary": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.
