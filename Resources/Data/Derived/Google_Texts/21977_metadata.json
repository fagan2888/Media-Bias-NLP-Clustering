Now I\u2019ve been reading that fish-oil pills don\u2019t actually live up to their promise of preventing heart disease. Can I skip them?\n\nA: The answer, as for many nutrition topics, has evolved as research has revealed fresh findings.\n\n\u201cNothing in nutrition is set in stone. We just don\u2019t yet know the details of everything various nutrients do, let alone exactly how much people need and how to account for individual differences,\u201d says Catherine Price, author of \u201cVitamania: Our Obsessive Quest for Nutritional Perfection.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that research in this area is aimed squarely at reducing cardiovascular disease, particularly heart disease and strokes.\n\nFish, red meat, peanut butter, avocados and other foods contain different types of fats, including saturated fat and the two main categories of unsaturated fats, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated. Even the highly esteemed olive oil contains a small amount of saturated fat.\n\nWe all need to eat some fat. Fats provide vitamins A, D, E, and K and, among other functions, help maintain healthy skin.\n\nBut the message to cut as many calories from fat as you can is from a bygone era. Today the focus is on quality.\n\nIn a nutshell, this translates to: Don\u2019t eat too few (less than 20 percent) or too many (no more than 35 percent) calories from fat, and make the fats you eat more healthful ones.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that preferentially replacing polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats provides the greatest impact on reducing cardiovascular disease,\u201d says Penny Kris-Etherton, Penn State University nutrition professor and spokeswoman for the American Heart Association. Monounsaturated fats come in second place and healthful sources of carbohydrates come in third.\n\nOmega-6 and omega-3 fats are the two main types of polyunsaturated fats. Liquid vegetable oils, such as corn, soybean and sunflower oils, contain mainly omega-6 fats. Omega-3 fats are found in plant-based foods such as canola and soybean oil, flax oil and seeds, and walnuts or walnut oil, and, as you know, fish.\n\nEarly studies showed remarkable benefits of fish-oil supplements in preventing repeat heart attacks and strokes and sudden death from heart disease. But more recent research has not duplicated these dramatic benefits, though it has shown some.\n\nConsuming sufficient amounts of omega- 3s from fatty fish remains an important goal for heart health, along with attention to eating more plant-based omega-3s.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t eat sufficient amounts of either,\u201d Kris-Etherton says.\n\nSuzanne Steinbaum, director of the Women and Heart Disease Center at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and co-founder of the Global Nutrition & Health Alliance, recommends fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines and tuna.\n\nWhy the focus on eating fish rather than swallowing fish-oil supplements?\n\n\u201cFish provides a good source of protein along with vitamin D, B vitamins, potassium and other nutrients,\u201d Kris-Etherton says.\n\nThe answer to your question about whether you can skip fish-oil supplements depends greatly on your willingness to eat a sufficient amount of fish each week \u2014 about eight ounces \u2014 along with your health status.\n\nKris-Etherton recommends one gram per day of a fish-oil supplement for healthy individuals who don\u2019t eat fatty fish. Steinbaum recommends one gram per day for people at risk of or with heart disease, and more for those with elevated triglyceride levels.\n\nAnd, as always, it\u2019s a good idea to discuss your individual health status and disease risks with your health-care provider before starting a supplement.\n\n\u2013 Hope Warshaw, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/sawaglasscarrie.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94ca\"", "article_summary": "Omega-3 fats are found in plant-based foods such as canola and soybean oil, flax oil and seeds, and walnuts or walnut oil, and, as you know, fish.\nEarly studies showed remarkable benefits of fish-oil supplements in preventing repeat heart attacks and strokes and sudden death from heart disease.\nSteinbaum recommends one gram per day for people at risk of or with heart disease, and more for those with elevated triglyceride levels.\nKris-Etherton recommends one gram per day of a fish-oil supplement for healthy individuals who don\u2019t eat fatty fish.\nConsuming sufficient amounts of omega- 3s from fatty fish remains an important goal for heart health, along with attention to eating more plant-based omega-3s."}
