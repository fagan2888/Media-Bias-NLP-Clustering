He explained the reason for his retirement, which is coming a little earlier than initially planned, involves the timing of a medical procedure and the birth of his fourth grandson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about our retirement, and spending time with the kids and doing some traveling,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m coming up on age 68, and I was planning on doing it this year anyway, then I had the procedure and it seemed better this way.\u201d\n\nAssistant Human Resources Director Jan Hansford, another longtime employee, will serve as interim HR director until a full-time department director is named.\n\nOwens said he\u2019s most proud of the county\u2019s implementation of an employee wellness program during his tenure, which involves both health benefits and a fitness aspect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep our health insurance premiums for employees at a reasonable rate when other organizations were going nuts with (the Affordable Care Act),\u201d he said. \u201cParticipation is up, which keeps the cost down. We\u2019re well positioned.\u201d\n\nOwens said he plans to continue teaching at the Carl Vinson Institute, which he\u2019s done for 24 years, but intends to scale back his independent human resources consulting work.\n\nHe\u2019ll work with the county through Aug. 22 to finish ongoing obligations, but he\u2019s already begun passing the torch to Hansford.\n\n\u201cWe have a very good, well-organized and functioning HR department thanks to him, and we\u2019ll be sorry to see him go,\u201d County Manager Alan Reddish said.\n\nContact government and enterprise reporter Kelsey Cochran: (706) 208-2233 or www.twitter.com/kelseyjcochran.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Kelsey Cochran", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2014-05-23/owens-retiring-athens-clarke-human-resources-director", "site_name": "Online Athens", "type": "article", "description": "If the idea of spending your retirement digging holes doesn't sound too enticing, just ask Harry Owens.", "title": "Owens retiring as Athens-Clarke human resources director"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91c2\"", "article_summary": "The long-time Athens-Clarke County Human Resources Director turned in his notice this month and he\u2019ll use accrued leave until his effective retirement date on Aug. 22.\nWe\u2019re well positioned.\u201dOwens said he plans to continue teaching at the Carl Vinson Institute, which he\u2019s done for 24 years, but intends to scale back his independent human resources consulting work.\nIf the idea of spending your retirement digging holes doesn\u2019t sound too enticing, just ask Harry Owens.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming up on age 68, and I was planning on doing it this year anyway, then I had the procedure and it seemed better this way.\u201dAssistant Human Resources Director Jan Hansford, another longtime employee, will serve as interim HR director until a full-time department director is named.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about our retirement, and spending time with the kids and doing some traveling,\u201d he said."}
