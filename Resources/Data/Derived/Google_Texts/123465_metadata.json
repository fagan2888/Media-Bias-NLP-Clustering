It would be strange not to ease if the BOJ were to cut its growth forecasts.\"\n\nThe BOJ is likely to offer a bleaker view on overseas economies and exports at next week's rate review, as China's slowdown hits Asian markets and demand for Japanese shipments.\n\nIt is also set to cut its long-term growth forecasts at the Oct. 30 meeting, though many central bankers are wary of deploying further stimulus.\n\nThey are concerned about diminishing policy tools and the rising costs of heavy money printing - such as drying up liquidity in the bond market.\n\nSome lawmakers have also complained that further monetary easing is unwelcome as it could further sap the yen and boost imported food prices, hitting households and small retailers.\n\nBut Yamamoto said such pain from a weak yen should not be an excuse to hold off on monetary easing. The government can ease the pain by offering fiscal spending of up to 5 trillion yen($41.47 billion) to help low-income households, he added.\n\nWith the dollar/yen still below levels hit before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, some more gains in the pair would still benefit Japan's economy, Yamamoto said.\n\n\"A bit more (appreciation) is okay because before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the dollar was around 124 to 125 yen,\" he said, when asked if further yen falls were beneficial for Japan's economy.\n\nThe dollar stood around 120.50 yen on Friday.\n\n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chris Gallagher and Clarence Fernandez)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen has \"a bit more\" room to fall before its costs outweigh the", "title": "'Abenomics' architect says yen falls still benefit Japan's economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/11/Abenomics-architect-says-yen-falls-still-benefit-Japans-economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-boj_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/11/Abenomics-architect-says-yen-falls-still-benefit-Japans-economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-boj_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen has \"a bit more\" room to fall before its costs outweigh the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05f6\"", "article_summary": "With the dollar/yen still below levels hit before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, some more gains in the pair would still benefit Japan's economy, Yamamoto said.\nBut Yamamoto said such pain from a weak yen should not be an excuse to hold off on monetary easing.\n\"A bit more (appreciation) is okay because before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the dollar was around 124 to 125 yen,\" he said, when asked if further yen falls were beneficial for Japan's economy.\nSome lawmakers have also complained that further monetary easing is unwelcome as it could further sap the yen and boost imported food prices, hitting households and small retailers.\n\"I can see how the BOJ would prefer to stand pat (next week) because there's not enough data to scrutinize,\" Yamamoto told Reuters on Friday."}
