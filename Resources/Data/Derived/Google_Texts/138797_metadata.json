In addition to the capital raised, the company welcomes chief medical officer of Oscar Health Insurance Aran Ron to its executive ranks. With cash in hand, Pager will be looking for expansion opportunities, both into new markets and through partnerships with healthcare organizations.\n\nPager was founded in 2014 by Uber\u2019s chief technology officer Oscar Salazar, Gaspard de Dreuzy, and Philip Eytan, to connect non-emergency patients with nurses and doctors who make house calls in the New York city area. Patients select one of three types of appointments: sickness or injury, a physical, or a health check, and Pager links them to one of its 40 doctors. On the whole, patients tend to use Pager for upper respiratory problems, like a persistent cough or Streptococcus (also known as strep-throat), common infections, and minor injuries.\n\nPager\u2019s healthcare professionals remotely evaluate patient requests to determine whether an ailment falls within the scope of what they\u2019re able to treat, before agreeing to an appointment. After each session, nurses and doctors follow up with patients in a phone call or text. Patients can continue communicating with doctors through the app.\n\nPager visits may also be covered by your health insurance \u2014 at least in part. A few months ago, the company transitioned from being entirely out-of-pocket for patients, to a network model. Pager now works with insurers so patients can be reimbursed for their visit.\n\nThe platform is designed so that doctors can share electronic health records within the network as well as outside of it. Pager is able to share a client\u2019s records with their primary physician, for example, as well as with a patient\u2019s other doctors.\n\nPartnerships with hospitals and medical networks are a big part of Pager\u2019s plans.Though it\u2019s not an electronic medical record company, Pager does hope to integrate more deeply with existing healthcare provider networks so that a patient\u2019s records are always up-to-date regardless of where a patient is being treated or by whom. This is tricky. There are myriad electronic health record providers, and electronic health care systems are notoriously difficult to integrate with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy. There\u2019s nothing about building a large business in digital health that\u2019s easy,\u201d says Mohamad Makhzoumi, general partner at New Enterprise Associates. He acknowledges that it will be difficult for Pager to hook into legacy healthcare networks, but says he\u2019s encouraged by the healthcare industry\u2019s willingness to work with startups like Pager. When the Affordable Care Act initially passed, many health care networks were actively opposed to innovation coming from outside the traditional healthcare framework, he says.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of another time when there has been more mind-share in large organizations in healthcare to partner, buy, and experiment with products like Pager,\u201d says Makhzoumi. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say it will spur immediate action,\u201d he adds quickly. Integration between health care technology platforms like Pager and traditional healthcare providers will be a slow-going process, but now that the industry is in a more cooperative mood there\u2019s more opportunity for Pager to gain traction.\n\nPager says it\u2019s hoping to expand to San Francisco next month. After that it will consider Los Angeles and Chicago, among other major cities, but don\u2019t expect to hear about new regional launch plans until 2016.\n\nUpdate: A previous version of this article stated that Aran Ron was a former chief medical officer of Oscar Health Insurance. Ron will continue serving at Oscar Health Insurance in addition to his new role at Pager.\n\nFacebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2015-07-14T05:00:26+00:00", "author": "ruth-reader", "modDate": "2015-07-14T15:41:49+00:00", "keywords": "health-2,oscar-salazar,pager,uber", "type": "news", "id": 1766819}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Pager has just raised\u00a0$14 million to bring its on-demand doctor service to\u00a0San Francisco and beyond.", "title": "Telemedicine startup Pager raises $14M, eyes San\u00a0Francisco", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/telemedicine-startup-pager-raises-14m-eyes-san-francisco/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doctor-chin-finger-poprotskiy-alexey-shutterstock-780x673.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Pager has just raised\u00a0$14 million to bring its on-demand doctor service to\u00a0San Francisco and beyond.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "There are myriad electronic health record providers, and electronic health care systems are notoriously difficult to integrate with.\nRon will continue serving at Oscar Health Insurance in addition to his new role at Pager.\nUpdate: A previous version of this article stated that Aran Ron was a former chief medical officer of Oscar Health Insurance.\nIn addition to the capital raised, the company welcomes chief medical officer of Oscar Health Insurance Aran Ron to its executive ranks.\nThe platform is designed so that doctors can share electronic health records within the network as well as outside of it."}
