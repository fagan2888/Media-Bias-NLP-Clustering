And Vermont got more money per capita to build and launch its health exchange than any other state.\n\nThis project is the most expensive and complicated information technology build out that the state has ever undertaken. Here\u2019s where the money came from, and how it was spent:\n\nIn the past two and a half years, Vermont has received roughly $172 million in four separate federal grants to design its own exchange, upgrade state computer systems, and launch a massive outreach campaign to educate Vermonters about how their insurance options would change in January of 2014.\n\nSights on single payer\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the grant documents that Vermont officials consider the new private insurance exchange to be a stepping stone to a publicly financed, single payer system. Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s goal is to implement this system in 2017.\n\nThe budget narrative for the first federal grant described the state\u2019s approach this way: \u201cThe State of Vermont aspires to create for its residents a health care system in which all residents receive coverage from a single source. Because of this ambitious undertaking, Vermont has come to see the role of a Health Benefits Exchange somewhat differently than do most states.\u201d\n\nThis project is the most expensive and complicated information technology build out that the state has ever undertaken.\n\nOf the 16 states that chose to set up their own exchange, Vermont is the only state in the country that decided to make participation mandatory for individuals and small businesses \u2013 employers with fewer than 50 employees. This means these groups have to go through the exchange if they want to have coverage after Jan. 1.\n\nShumlin has said the mandatory approach is a way to lead the way to single payer and also allow individuals to take full advantage of federal subsidies for coverage in 2014.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ll find other states will join Vermont going forward in having made that decision,\u201d he said last month. \u201cI recognized right from the beginning that one of the challenges seemed to me, to the Affordable Care Act, is to spend all this money and then not many people show up.\u201d\n\nLeveraging the grant dollars\n\nMark Larson, the commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, said it was very important to design an exchange that could also be used for a single payer system. But he said adding this dimension did not add any additional costs to the project.\n\n\u201cWe understand the important investment that we\u2019re making in our exchange and our IT projects and we need to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the use and reusability of that technology,\u201d he said.\n\nLarson said it would have been very difficult to implement all of the complex software programs needed for the exchange because the state had antiquated computer systems for its human services benefit programs. He said some elements of the system were more than 25 years old. So the state is using almost $50 million of the federal grant money to totally upgrade its computer systems:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely taken advantage of the federal funding for exchanges to help rebuild the technology that our Human Service Agency relies on that had to be replaced anyway,\u201d he said.\n\n\"We've definitely taken advantage of the federal funding for exchanges to help rebuild the technology that our Human Service Agency relies on that had to be replaced anyway.\" - Mark Larson\n\nThe contractors\n\nAlmost two thirds of the $172 million grant total is being paid to a group of private contractors and consulting firms.\n\nFor instance, Wakely Consulting of Boston has a contract for just over $6 million to \u201cassist with planning, designing, and developing of Vermont\u2019s exchange.\u201d\n\nThe Washington D.C. based public relations and political consulting firm GMMB got almost $3 million to design a public outreach and education plan. The contract also included a program to train hundreds of navigators throughout the state to help individuals and businesses better understand their insurance options.\n\nMaximus Inc., a technology firm based in Reston Virginia, has a $4.5 million contract to provide information technology consulting services to the state. HMC2 Advertising is overseeing a $2 million TV, radio and print campaign to promote the exchange.\n\nIn all of these cases, the final amount increased dramatically from the original contract through a series of amendments. For example, the Wakely contract expanded from $2 million to $6 million award. The original $400,000 Maximus contract grew to be a $4.5 million dollar deal.\n\nCommissioner Larson argues these amended contacts shouldn\u2019t be viewed as cost overruns.\n\n\u201cIn every case where there\u2019s been an increase in the cost of a contract that is because we have asked for more services or products from that vendor not that what we originally asked for in the contract got more expensive,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout $10 million in federal grant money is also being used to pay for the call center at Vermont Health Connect where more than 175 people are employed answering specific questions about coverage through the exchange.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the massive contract awarded to the Canadian IT firm, CGI Technologies and Solutions, to oversee the building of the exchange and to provide \u201csystems integration and technology infrastructure\u201d for the entire exchange.\n\nThe original CGI contract was for $42 million over a multi-year period. Through a series of amendments, this contract doubled to $84 million dollars.\n\nThe original CGI contract was for $42 million over a multi-year period. Through a series of amendments, this contract doubled to $84 million dollars.\n\nThroughout 2013, CGI missed a number of key deadlines for the operation of the exchange. Commissioner Larson said these problems were a big reason factor why the exchange wasn\u2019t fully functional by the target date of Oct 1:\n\n\u201cWe were working on a very, very tight schedule to complete a very complex project with the expectation in statute that it would be delivered on a date certain,\u201d he said.\n\nPenalties ahead?\n\nThe state estimates that CGI\u2019s missed deadlines have cost $26 million. But under the terms of its contract, CGI\u2019s potential monetary penalties are capped at $5 million. The governor said he intends to fight to get the maximum penalty.\n\n\u201cThis governor is miserable at the place where we are with this website and I\u2019m not being funny,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cThe folks that we\u2019re working with, the vendors that we\u2019ve engaged, have not delivered on the product that we were promised. That makes me miserable I\u2019m going to make sure it makes them miserable until we get it right.\u201d\n\n\"The folks that we're working with, the vendors that we've engaged, have not delivered on the product that we were promised. That makes me miserable I'm going to make sure it makes them miserable until we get it right.\u201d - Gov. Peter Shumlin\n\nBecause the online payment system didn\u2019t work, Shumlin offered small businesses several options. They could purchase their coverage directly from the insurance companies, Blue Cross and MVP, or they could extend their current coverage for the first three months of next year. The vast majority of small businesses have chosen the direct purchasing approach.\n\nThe Shumlin Administration is being criticized for its handling of the exchange from the political right and left.\n\nInternal reports obtained by VPR show the state was warned as early as last spring about missed deadlines, staffing shortages and other problems that threatened the Oct. 1 launch.\n\nBurlington Progressive Chris Pearson is concerned that the Administration wasn\u2019t forthright with key legislative committees about the issues developing with the exchange during the summer and early fall.\n\n\u201cSince it wasn\u2019t going to work on day one, and they had to know that ahead of time, I think they should have come clean and said \u2018we\u2019re going live, here are some of the challenges please bear with us,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day we need health care to be affordable and accessible to all Vermonters, and this is not going to satisfy that.\u201d\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov Phil Scott, who serves in Gov. Shumlin\u2019s cabinet, wants to delay the mandatory implementation of the exchange for a year because of the problems with the online payment system.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge endeavor. This is the biggest thing that we\u2019ve faced as a state from a technological stand point ever. So maybe we should have planned a little bit better,\u201d Scott said. \u201cMaybe we should have given it a little more time\u2026 whatever it takes to make sure we get this right and give comfort to Vermonters.\u201d\n\nShumlin has rejected this approach. He argues that delaying everything for a year causes more problems than it solves including the difficulty of determining new premium rates for the insurance companies.\n\n\"Maybe we should have planned a little bit better ... Maybe we should have given it a little more time.\" - Lt. Gov. Phil Scott\n\nThere is no timeframe for the online payment system to be operating but if it\u2019s not in place by Feb. 1, the governor might have to consider a new set of options for small businesses:\n\n\u201cAs you know I\u2019ve lost confidence in the contractors that promised to have a perfectly humming website on Oct. 1, so we think we can do it; we think we\u2019re going to do it, but I\u2019ve stopped being surprised,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that key legislative committees will want to conduct their own investigations into the problems that have plagued the state\u2019s health care exchange.\n\nAnd that oversight could evolve into a tough political issue for the administration if the online payment system isn\u2019t working in the next few months because many of the small businesses that have extended their coverage will question what their next option is going to be.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "An unprecedented amount of federal money has flowed into Vermont to design the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.
