RUCKMAN, Native Times Special Contributor Hits: 4903\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2013 Despite living in a state where Medicaid was not expanded, Oklahoma\u2019s 38 federally recognized tribes have found a way to state tribal liaison, Sally Carter - and she has found her way to them. In this newly created position, Carter is quick to tell you that she considers Oklahoma to have 39 tribes because even though the Euchee are not federally recognized, they are state recognized. Breathlessly, she says she is learning fast.\n\n\n\n\u201cI still count them,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nCarter carries Euchee concerns on health matters back to the state capital as part of a new stance where the health decision makers seek to repair a long and tenuous relationship between historical archetypes. When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010, a series of listening sessions between Oklahoma and the tribes occurred at six different tribal jurisdictions across the state to talk about the federal health overhaul. Replete with opening ceremonies and songs, the state was figuratively stretching its hand toward its Native inhabitants.\n\n\n\nFrom these beginnings, Carter takes the message back to the capital that the tribes want to be at the decision-making table with state leaders, including the newly re-elected Republican governor, Mary Fallin.\n\n\n\nCarter said the tribes don\u2019t just want to be told about important developments, they want to help shape the direction the state will take on things such as the implementation of the ACA and how to reduce health disparities like high smoking and diabetes rates in their nations.\n\n\n\nTo date, 1,638 American Indians in Oklahoma have enrolled for federal health insurance through ACA while 13,061 have enrolled nationally, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) report. When compared to the 9.1 million estimated Obamacare enrollees, American Indians number roughly 1 percent of all Americans who now have health insurance who had none before.\n\n\n\nBut that thing that makes Oklahoma\u2019s Indian Country so different\u2014that thing that separates it from other U.S. states with tribes \u2013 is that it has no official Indian reservations. A federal land allotment experiment from the 1900s crisscrossed the state\u2019s territory into a veritable smorgasbord of jurisdictions \u2013 federal, tribal, municipal, state.\n\n\n\nCarter is working on how to stimulate enrollment among Oklahoma tribes.\n\n\n\nIf the government wants to reach the American Indians here, it\u2019s best to go to each tribe, Carter said. That was a go-to move state health officials embraced as they discussed ACA with the tribes. The things Carter found surprised her although she is an Oklahoma resident and had lived near various tribal jurisdictions for years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are the only (minority) group that has to show their race,\u201d she said, her voice lilting. \u201cI mean, no other group has to do that. They have to prove it with an enrollment card of some kind.\u201d\n\n\n\nOfficial American Indian citizenship is important because the ACA has special provisions that allow Indians to \u201copt out\u201d of having to enroll in federal health insurance, if they choose. But Indians need to fill out form OMB No. 0938-1190 that officially removes them, officials said. Not doing so will mean an eventual penalty.\n\n\n\n\u201c(ACA) is very complex and not one of us would say that we know it all,\u201d Carter said. So the state took the best of what they knew after weeks of training on the health plan to several tribal jurisdictions. When all sides met, Carter said she was schooled. American Indians have strong opinions about the state/ federal government encroaching on their personal privacy and tribal sovereignty with this new federal health insurance.\n\n\n\nBecause Oklahoma chose not to expand Medicaid, enrolling American Indians in ACA takes a certain degree of cultural finesse and dogged persistence, Carter said. In other tribally populated states, like North Dakota, the move to expand Medicaid fills in where ACA may not be a strong priority, said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-ND. The emphasis is reducing uninsured numbers, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe State of North Dakota expanded Medicaid, which has helped uninsured, low-income individuals and families, including many Native Americans throughout the state, get access to affordable health care,\u201d Heitkamp said. \u201c Medicaid expansion is giving families opportunities they didn't have before to afford to see a doctor regularly and get access to needed medications, while reducing costs for everyone - those with health coverage and those without.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Oklahoma tribal liaison added that even while enrollment curiosity abounded, many did not qualify for ACA because they did not file income tax returns. American Indians can enroll in ACA at any time \u2013 not just during enrollment periods, but their tax filings allow them also to file the exemption \u2013 if they chose to forgo coverage.\n\n\n\nAmerican Indians have a higher unemployment rate than other groups--peaking in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population survey. Indian unemployment rates averaged 11.3 percent compared to 9.1 percent of the mainstream during that time. High unemployment rates among Indians tend to keep more Indians ineligible for ACA enrollment, Carter said.\n\n\n\nWhat has also dampened Oklahoma\u2019s outreach has been a distrustful relationship between the state and tribes\u2014this makes it harder for federal initiatives to come through the front door, said Terry Cline, Oklahoma\u2019s commissioner of health. He points to the good faith of the tribal/state meetings.\n\n\n\n\u201cI considered the listening sessions a good start,\u201d he said. An official summary on the sessions reported 193 attendees at the six sessions, several of which Cline attended.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe held those sessions to have open dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you hear from one tribe might be different from another tribe says.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs for ACA and tribes, a tribe\u2019s type of relationship with the federal government, either Self-Governance or direct service, dictated outreach approaches because that\u2019s how health dollars are administered by tribes in states, especially in Oklahoma, officials said.\n\n\n\nTribes that operate under provisions of the Indian Self Determination Act might outreach on ACA directly to members in their own tribally run health systems and tribes that are direct service entities may forgo outreach to their local Indian Health Service (IHS) service facility. In both regions, IHS and tribal facilities can accept ACA insurance from patients and lessen the amount of contract (out-of-IHS system) health dollars it spends, officials said.\n\n\n\n\u201cTribes have a lot of interest in ACA,\u201d Carter said. \u201cTribal leaders and the health department can inspire and direct tribal members to enroll.\u201d\n\n\n\nBoth of the tribal-to-federal relationships are considered when the state of Oklahoma contacts tribes, and the state tends to follow the federal approach, Carter said. Putting on different hats to deal with different tribes is prudent.\n\n\n\n\u201cTribes need to see people they know and that they can trust who know about American Indian provisions,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in face-to-face interactions. States usually contact them (tribes) with emails or letters, but a relationship needs to be worked on and allowed to develop.\u201d\n\n\n\nCline said no special state appropriations exist to outreach to tribes for ACA enrollment in Oklahoma but he\u2019s optimistic that other types of federal grants to reduce health disparities will help. The health commissioner said he knows Oklahoma has room for ACA Native growth through grants.\n\n\n\nThe HHS report points out that Oklahoma has the highest density of Indians among Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) states with 3.5 percent of the population followed by Wyoming, with 3.1 percent. Wyoming\u2019s total Native ACA enrollment stands at 309, the report shows.\n\n\n\nAt this point, Oklahoma seems to lead the state in the number of Natives it has enrolled, just exceeding figures for California. But as enrollment rolls on, officials expect more American Indians to register. Indian Country (the term used to characterize where a federal-tribal relationship exists) extends beyond Oklahoma.\n\n\n\nOther states with significant Native populations include Arizona, California, New Mexico, South Dakota and North Dakota. ACA data gathering for Native numbers is in its infancy, organizers said. They say the goal is to pool their information from various regions (via Indian advocacy agencies) to get a more precise picture of Native ACA enrollment. Due to their smaller population numbers, American Indian statistics are often overlooked, officials said.\n\n\n\nOther mainstream entities who track the progress are unclear about just how many have actually signed up for ACA. Michelle McEvoy, vice-president of survey, research and evaluation for the Commonwealth Fund, said that no Native specific information has been garnered by her group.\n\n\n\n\u201cLatinos currently represent about 17 percent of the U.S. population, so they have a greater probability of being sampled than American Indians who represent about 1.2 percent of the U.S. population,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the non-profit Enroll America, relies on Native ACA enrollment numbers from federal sources, wrote Jessica McCarron, deputy press secretary, by e-mail.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do work with partners at the local level to reach different communities, like Native American groups in certain parts of the country,\u201d McCarron stated. \u201cWe work with a few partners who have made outreach to tribal communities a high priority.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Carter is optimistic about ACA enrollment and reaching American Indians in Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n\u201c(ACA) is bigger than all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this alone; it only happens when the state extends its hands across the table and says we need to do this for all the people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2013 This story was funded by the University of Southern California\u2019s (USC) Annenberg School of Journalism as one project undertaken by the 2014 class of California Endowment Health Journalism Fellows. S.E. Ruckman is writing a three-part series on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in Indian country. In addition to mainstream viewpoints, American Indian health advocates and American Indian enrollees are visited to gauge the national health plan\u2019s implementation in Native populations.\n\n\n\nTo read more National Health Journalism Fellow stories, go to www.reportingonhealth.org\n\n\n\nNATIVE AMERICAN ACA ENROLLEES STATE ENROLLMENT TOTALS\n\n\n\n*Wyoming: 309\n\n\n\n*New Mexico: 566\n\n\n\n*Oklahoma: 1,635\n\n\n\n+California: 1,401\n\n\n\n*Arizona: 514\n\n\n\n*North Dakota: 82\n\n\n\n*South Dakota: 271\n\n\n\nTOTAL: 13,061\n\n\n\nSources: (March 2014) *HHS Summary Report; +California Department of Health Care Services\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Native American Times, News, native, news paper, tribe, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Navajo, first nations, indigenous", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "description": "Native American Times - News from the crossroads of Indian Country", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Publisher"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd982c\"", "article_summary": "In addition to mainstream viewpoints, American Indian health advocates and American Indian enrollees are visited to gauge the national health plan\u2019s implementation in Native populations.\nMainstream entities test the waters of ACA in Indian CountryDetails Parent Category: Life Published on Monday, 12 January 2015 17:16 Written by S.E.\nIf the government wants to reach the American Indians here, it\u2019s best to go to each tribe, Carter said.\n\u201cWe do work with partners at the local level to reach different communities, like Native American groups in certain parts of the country,\u201d McCarron stated.\nDue to their smaller population numbers, American Indian statistics are often overlooked, officials said."}
