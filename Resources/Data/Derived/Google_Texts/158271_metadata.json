Both candidates are running as centrist Republicans and pragmatists with establishment appeal.Kasich was viewed by many as one of the winners of the first Republican presidential debate, held earlier this month, and he\u2019s since seen his standing improve in polls nationally, as well as in New Hampshire, where he\u2019s staking his campaign.According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, front-runner Donald Trump has a double-digit lead over the GOP field in the Granite State, with Bush in second place at 11 percent support, followed closely by Kasich at 10 percent.Kasich has been camping out in New Hampshire and his political team is dominated by influential figures in the state, as well as veterans of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s operations there.In addition, New Day for America has been spending heavily in New Hampshire, having already booked a staggering $4 million in TV ads for July and August.Bush\u2019s super-PAC, Right to Rise, will begin spending in New Hampshire soon. The group has booked an estimated $15 million that will be spread across the carve-out states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.On Thursday, Politico reported that an intern at the Bush campaign issued a public records request to an economic development agency in Ohio seeking background information on Kasich.A spokesman for the former Florida governor's campaign told the DC publication it was \u201cbasic campaign due diligence.\u201d\u201cWe have interns monitor the events and collect information on the records of all the candidates \u2014 including Jeb \u2014 as standard operating procedure to have full information awareness,\u201d Bush spokesman Tim Miller told Politico . \u201cWe have seen many of the same requests about Jeb under Florida Sunshine Act and emails to reporters from GOP campaigns and we would expect as much.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "It\u2019s the latest sign of the growing threat Bush faces from Kasich.", "description": "It\u2019s the latest sign of the growing threat Bush faces from Kasich.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "It\u2019s the latest sign of the growing threat Bush faces from Kasich.", "title": "Pro-Kasich group says Bush donors expressing interest", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/251569-pro-kasich-group-says-bush-donors-expressing-interest", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/kasichfox.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-20T12:43:42-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-20T12:43-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/251569-pro-kasich-group-says-bush-donors-expressing-interest", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-20T12:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "2016 GOP presidential field,Jeb Bush, John Kasich,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-20T12:30:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T12:43:42-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/251569-pro-kasich-group-says-bush-donors-expressing-interest", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "It\u2019s the latest sign of the growing threat Bush faces from Kasich.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pro-Kasich group says Bush donors expressing interest"}, "dcterms.title": "Pro-Kasich group says Bush donors expressing interest"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf949\"", "article_summary": "The super-PAC supporting John Kasich\u2019s bid for the Republican presidential nomination says some of opponent Jeb Bush\u2019s donors are reaching out and expressing interest in potentially supporting the Ohio governor.\nThe Washington Post first reported the news late Wednesday, and an official for the pro-Kasich group, New Day for America, confirmed the conversations to The Hill.\n\u201cWe have seen many of the same requests about Jeb under Florida Sunshine Act and emails to reporters from GOP campaigns and we would expect as much.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENTThe official did not provide any further details about who has reached out, whether the donors were considering providing financial support to both candidates, or if the campaign had received any new commitments of support.Still, it\u2019s the latest sign of the growing threat Bush faces from Kasich.\nThe group has booked an estimated $15 million that will be spread across the carve-out states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.On Thursday, Politico reported that an intern at the Bush campaign issued a public records request to an economic development agency in Ohio seeking background information on Kasich.A spokesman for the former Florida governor's campaign told the DC publication it was \u201cbasic campaign due diligence.\u201d\u201cWe have interns monitor the events and collect information on the records of all the candidates \u2014 including Jeb \u2014 as standard operating procedure to have full information awareness,\u201d Bush spokesman Tim Miller told Politico ."}
