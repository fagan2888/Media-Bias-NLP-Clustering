Just weeks after coming under fire for saying he didn't think President Barack Obama loved America, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is making headlines again for remarks he made Thursday on a Big Apple radio talk show.Offering advice on how Obama could redeem his legacy, tarnished in part by the anti-police "tone" he has setresulting in police being shot, according to Giuliani, the president should take a page from comedian Bill Cosby's book and censure black men "about the large incidence of crime" they commit, the Washington Post reports."If an African-American president stood up and saidI hate to mention it because of what happened afterwardsthe kind of stuff that Bill Cosby used to say, the first guy to applaud him would be me," Giuliani told AM 970 host John Gambling. "If he does that, I'm telling you, whatever he does right or wrong he gets a place in history." Cosby was once considered entertainment royalty, but has been accused by dozens of women of drugging and sexually assaulting them over his decades-long career."It is the obligation of the President to explain . . . that our police are the best in the world," Giuliani continued, The New York Daily News reports.Giuliani compared Obama's opportunity to President Richard Nixon's decision to normalize relations with China in the 1970s."I explained it this way to a person very close" to the president, Giuliani said Thursday, the Post reports. "I said this is like Nixon going to China. Nixon could go to China because Nixon was a strong anti-communist going back to the McCarthy era…. Well this guy has credentials as an African-American. If he stands up and says, 'You see my family, my daughters, my wife, the way we're together.' This is the model. This is the model we need.""… This president has a chance to leave a legacy that no other president will have a chance to leave until we get another African-American president and who knows when that's gonna be, right."Giuliani acknowledged that while he disagrees with the president "on almost everything," he admires the husband and father that he is."I think he's a good family man and a good man," he said.
