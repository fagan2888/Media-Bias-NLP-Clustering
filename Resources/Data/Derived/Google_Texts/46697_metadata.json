It turns out that money talks. From the NYT: \u201cA billionaire retired investor is forging plans to spend as much as $100 million during the 2014 election, seeking to pressure federal and state officials to enact climate change measures through a hard-edge campaign of attack ads against governors and lawmakers. The donor, Tom Steyer, a Democrat who founded one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds, burst onto the national political scene during last year\u2019s elections, when he spent $11 million to help elect Terry McAuliffe governor of Virginia and millions more intervening in a Democratic congressional primary in Massachusetts. Now he is rallying other deep-pocketed donors, seeking to build a war chest that would make his political organization, NextGen Climate Action, among the largest outside groups in the country, similar in scale to the conservative political network overseen by Charles and David Koch.\u201d\n\n[National Journal: \u201cTom Steyer \u2026 may launch an advertising campaign panning [Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.] for supporting the Keystone XL pipeline. The three-term senator seeking reelection in a state much redder than it was six years ago says Steyer\u2019s criticism could actually help her win. ]\n\nYou get what you pay for - The seemingly sudden rebirth of anti-global warming evangelism takes on a different tone when set against the backdrop of today\u2019s announcement that the top Democratic benefactor has agreed to spend big to help limit the president\u2019s party\u2019s midterm losses. Whether it is good politics or not to again alarm moderate voters with scare words about man-made climate change and costly measures to combat it, money apparently matters more. Today, for example, President Obama will order the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation to crack down on truck emissions by the end of his term. In a campaign appearance at a grocery store distribution center in suburban Maryland, the president will also propose a new $200 million tax credit for companies that make green vehicles, like those subsidized enterprises backed by Steyer and other top Democratic contributors. Voters in Arkansas, North Carolina or Alaska might be unhappy with spending more money on groceries to finance the new Obama-complaint fleets or resentful about subsidizing already rich folks like Steyer, but $100 million in midterm moola will buy you a lot of attention in Obamaland.\n\nWe\u2019re going to fight global warming to prevent drought\u2026 Now watch this drive - Time: \u201cPresident Barack Obama traveled to California on Friday to highlight the state\u2019s drought emergency at two events near Fresno, calling for shared sacrifice to help manage the state\u2019s worst water shortage in decades. He then spent the rest of the weekend enjoying the hospitality of some of the state\u2019s top water hogs: desert golf courses\u2026 The 124 golf courses in the Coachella Valley consume roughly 17% of all water there, and one-quarter of the water pumped out of the region\u2019s at-risk groundwater aquifer, according to the Coachella Valley Water District. Statewide, roughly 1% of water goes to keep golf courses green. Each of the 124 Coachella Valley courses, on average, uses nearly 1 million gallons (3.8 million L) a day because of the hot and dry climate, three to four times more water per day than the average American golf course.\u201d\n\nStrong letter to follow - Breitbart: \u201cSens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) are gathering colleagues\u2019 signatures on a letter to networks ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox expressing their disapproval at the lack of global warming discussion on the channels\u2019 Sunday shows. According to Sanders, \u201cIt is beyond my comprehension\u2026 that their shows have discussed climate change in 2012, collectively, for all of eight minutes\u2019\u2026Sanders and his colleagues plan to send the letter because, according to Sanders, Sunday TV coverage is not proportional to the gravity of the situation. \u2018What [the networks] are saying is, climate change is a non-important issue, it is an irrelevant issue, and yet the scientific community tells us that it is the greatest crisis facing this planet,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nBAIER TRACKS: THIS IS GONNA HURT\n\n\u201cIt seems to be sinking in across the media \u2013 today in the New York Times \u2013 that Democratic control of the Senate is in real jeopardy. Democrats quoted both on the record and anonymously are waiting for Republicans to implode from within. While nasty Republican primary fights may produce the Democrats\u2019 desired outcome, so far it seems the GOP has its eyes on the prize: the majority. With it, the equation in Washington would change dramatically and a president who began in office with his party in control of both chambers of Congress would leave with control of neither. We'll see. But clearly the concern in Democratic circles is growing. And how about this? Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry points out this nuance from David Axelrod, longtime top strategist to President Obama, talking to the NYT about Republicans and the debt limit: \u2018This is a serious threat. And it would behoove Democratic activists and donors who are whipped up about 2016 to shift their focus, or they may be sitting here in November, looking at a Republican Senate to go along with the House.\u2019 Is there a note of some preemptive finger pointing here? Time will tell.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier\n\nOBAMACARE INCREASES THE COST OF YOUR FEMALE COUSIN\u2019S POCKETS\n\nWFTV: \u201cU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was full of excuses Monday when\u2026 asked her about mistranslations on the HealthCare.gov [Spanish] website\u2026 \u2018My understanding, it\u2019s a much better user experience now,\u2019 Sebelius said. But Mike Nieves, the head of a local marketing firm that specializes in cutting through cultural barriers, said the government failed to do just that\u2026 For \u2018monthly payment,\u2019 the website uses the word \u2018prima,\u2019 but to Nieves, it means \u2018female cousin\u2019\u2026 In one instance, the site reads, \u2018Costo de bolsillo.\u2019 \u2018They're trying to say, \u2018Out of pocket cost,\u201d but they're actually saying, \u2018Cost of my pocket.\u2019\u2026 On Monday, Sebelius told Channel 9 the translations weren\u2019t done by a computer but by a team of experts.\u201d\n\nWait. What? - \u201cAnd every economist will tell you this: That there isn\u2019t any job loss related to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d \u2013 Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to reporters in Orlando Monday.\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., appears in the noon ET hour]\n\nWeb woes worsen for Oregon ObamaCare - Daily Caller: \u201cFive months, hundreds of millions of dollars and two top exchange officials later, Oregon\u2019s Obamacare exchange was scheduled to finally launch a partial version of its website last week \u2014 and then delayed it again. Despite $340 million in federal funding and another $160 million from state taxpayers, Cover Oregon\u2019s site was unable to enroll any customers online on day one in October and officials quickly gave up on having online enrollment ready anytime soon\u2026\u201d\n\n[The Hill: \u201cRepublicans are launching investigations into three state-run ObamaCare exchanges that are failing disastrously. Lawmakers are setting their sights on exchanges in Oregon, Maryland and Massachusetts where Democratic governors embraced the healthcare law, and are demanding to know why their expensive online portals remain useless more than four months after launch. \u2026 \u2018The catastrophic breakdown of Cover Oregon is unacceptable, and taxpayers deserve accountability,\u201d wrote the group of lawmakers led by Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.)\u2019\u2026 Walden and the other lawmakers are laying the groundwork to claw-back some of the state\u2019s $304 million in grants if Oregon decides to abandon its state-run exchange and join the federal system.\u201d]\n\nOBAMA STARTS OVER ON SYRIA BUT WITH A WEAKENED HAND\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry complains that Syria\u2019s Assad regime, aided and abetted by Russia and other supporters, is to blame for stalled peace talks in Geneva. But the Obama administration continues to be plagued by its own uncertain Syria policy. As NYT reports, Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces, have stepped up attacks \u201c\u2026 emptying whole neighborhoods and creating what aid workers say is one of the largest refugee flows of the entire civil war\u2026While the United States explores potential new strategies, analysts say, Mr. Assad is forging ahead with his own: pounding civilians out of rebel-held districts or using military means to make life miserable for those left inside.\u201d Kerry told reporters that President Obama has asked his cabinet to come up with a plan. \u201cIndeed, [the president] asked all of us to think about various options that may or may not exist,\u201d Kerry said during a press conference in Beijing. As Assad presses on in what has been the deadliest phase of his campaign against the his country\u2019s sectarian majority and Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin basks in the reflected glow of a so-far successful Olympics, the U.S. is back to the drawing board.\n\n[Ed. note: Maybe the rebels should try telling Obama and Kerry that Assad is sitting on huge stockpiles of coal, which is apparently to Kerry \u201cthe world\u2019s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.\u201d]\n\nHitting them from the left - Richard Cohen writes in WaPo: \u201cOne can only imagine the profound effect this has had in Damascus, where Assad\u2019s inner circle must be spending sleepless nights wondering about options that \u201cmay not exist.\u201d Is this like the tooth fairy or maybe a new type of ray gun? Whatever it is, all over the Middle East, the toughest men imaginable \u2014 guys in sunglasses and Brioni suits \u2014 must be giggling. Options that \u201cmay not exist\u201d has the sound of Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion in the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d: \u201cPut \u2019em up. Put \u2019 em up.\u201d\n\nHitting them from the right - Michael Gerson points out: \u201c[Assad\u2019s] goal was to enter the Geneva 2 negotiations from a position of military strength in order to deflate hopes of a political transition. His sponsors and allies \u2014 Russia, Iran, Hezbollah \u2014 have shown no ambivalence, unlike some of the sponsors and allies of his opponents. These developments should mean something to Mr. Obama, the author of an executive directive (Presidential Study Directive on Mass Atrocities ) declaring the prevention of mass atrocities a \u201ccore national security interest and a core moral responsibility.\u201d At the moment, he stands judged by his own standard.\u201d\n\nCul de sac - NYT reports that a quiet discussion of shipping more arms to Syrian rebels has been renewed: \u201cA secret meeting in Washington last week among the intelligence chiefs from almost all of the countries attempting to oust the Assad government included extensive discussion about how to best provide that new lethal aid to rebel groups, the officials said. The gathering of the top intelligence officials from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Britain, France and the United Arab Emirates, and several others from the 11-nation group known as the Friends of Syria, reflected a belief that the diplomatic track has been exhausted unless Mr. Assad sustains significant military setbacks.\u201d\n\nEMAILS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT TOP HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIAL\n\nQuestionable tactics by Christian Marrone, the Obama administration\u2019s chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, are raising questions about how he got clearance for such a sensitive job. The Washington Times reports emails and documents show Marrone, an aide in the Pennsylvania state legislature in 2001, proposed questionable tactics, including a plan to hire a private eye to dig up information on then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ed Rendell. Such shady moves \u201ccaptured prosecutors\u2019 interest and led to the downfall of [Marrone\u2019s] former boss, [Democratic] state Sen. Vincent Fumo [who was then backing a rival Democrat for governor].\u201d The paper says the emails \u201ccontrast with Mr. Marrone\u2019s portrayal that he was an unwitting \u2018victim of Vince\u2019 who simply carried out orders without knowing what he was doing was wrong\u2026 This month, [Marrone] began overseeing a department with billions of dollars in grant money and access to some of the nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets\u2026\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nIn Fox News Opinion, columnist John Lott, breaks down the flaws in a recent report on school gun violence from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s gun control groups: \u201c[T]heir statistics are not what they seem. Included in the numbers are suicides. Also included are late night shootings taking place in school parking lots, on their grounds or even off school property, often involving gangs. As \u2018shootings,\u2019 they also include any incident where shots were fired, even when nobody was injured.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Now the project, and its spokesperson Hillary Clinton, will get a lot of face time on the largest Spanish-language media network in the United States. Clinton and Univision announced a multi-year partnership between \u2018Too Small To Fail\u2019 and the top-rated Spanish media platform that gives Clinton a direct line to the Hispanic population that both major parties are desperate to win in 2016. Saban has close ties to the Clintons, and routinely hosts the former Democratic First Couple at his 23,000 square-foot Beverly Hills mansion. Saban and his Saban Family Foundation had donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation by May 2012\u2026\u201d\n\nThis will really send them into orbit - Byron York argues Why Hillary Clinton\u2019s past is fair game in presidential race: \u201c[Hillary Clinton\u2019s] recent experiences are relevant to a presidential run. But so are her actions in the 90s, the 80s and even the 70s. It's not ancient history; it reveals something about who Clinton was and still is. And re-examining her past is entirely consistent with practices in recent campaigns\u2026 New voters also need to learn about Mrs. Clinton's checkered history as a lawyer\u2026 New voters also need to learn about Mrs. Clinton's purge of the White House travel office, which was done to steer business to another Clinton crony\u2026 Even in a national contest, a focus on Mrs. Clinton's past likely won\u2019t decide the outcome any more than [Mitt Romney\u2019s] time at Bain Capital decided the 2012 race. But it will help define Mrs. Clinton for millions of voters who weren't around or weren't paying attention in the 1990s. They need to know. And that\u2019s what campaigns are for.\u201d\n\nCHRISTIE CONTINUES CASH CULL\n\nWashington Examiner: \u201cNew Jersey Gov.

They are incapable of the reforms that are necessary. But the Republican Party as it stands today is also unprepared to do so,\u201d he said.\u201d\n\nFIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: OSBORN LOCKS UP AIR TIME\n\nNebraska Republican Senate frontrunner Shane Osborn is looking to maximize his resources by locking up airtime ahead of the state\u2019s hotly contested primary. The campaign is touting a \u201cstrong six-figure\u201d ad buy in the final four weeks before the May 13 nominating contest. The campaign will announce today hundreds of thousands of dollars to be spent in the Omaha, Lincoln and North Platte media markets. The move is more consequential since the Cornhusker State has not only five Republican Senate candidates vying for air time, but also six candidates in the GOP race for governor.\n\nThe most recent campaign finance reports show Osborn trailing Midland University President Ben Sasse in the cash race. Sasse, whom a recent polls shows surging into a tie with former state treasurer Osborn, boasted a $1 million war chest compared to Osborn\u2019s $582,000 cash-on-hand.\n\nFrom Osborn Campaign Manager Bill Novotny: \u201cShane is the only candidate in the U.S. Senate race running on a proven record of fiscal conservatism and leadership in our nation\u2019s military. We look forward to sharing with Nebraskans his message and his accomplishments as state treasurer and in the U.S. Navy.\u201d\n\nHAGAN HIT AGAIN AND AGAIN ON OBAMACARE\n\nThe conservative group Americans for Prosperity is once again hitting Sen.

Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, trailing Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona, R-Hawaii, 48 percent to 40 percent in their prospective November matchup. Abercrombie beat Aiona in 2010, 57 percent to 40 percent to take the governorship. However, according to the poll 45 percent of voters view Abercrombie unfavorably while Aiona enjoys a 58 percent approval rating.\n\n[The same poll finds Democratic Rep. Colleen Hanabusa leads incumbent Sen. Brian Schatz 48 percent to 40 percent ahead of the state\u2019s Aug. 9 Senate primary.]\n\nRGA WHACKS WALKER OPPONENT\n\nUSA Today: \u201c\u2026[T]he Republican Governors Association is on the air in Wisconsin with an ad slapping down Mary Burke, Democratic challenger to incumbent Gov. Scott Walker. The ad hits Burke for her tenure as Commerce secretary under Walker\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Jim Doyle, holding her responsible for job losses during his 2006-2010 term. It also criticizes her family business, Trek bicycles, for manufacturing most of its bikes in China instead of the USA. Burke \u2018would take Wisconsin backwards,\u2019 the ad says.\u201d\n\nTANCREDO LAUNCHES SPANISH LANGUAGE AD\n\nFormer Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., is best known for his hard-line stances on illegal immigration, but the 2012 presidential contender is hitting the airwaves with Spanish-language ads aimed at Hispanic voters in his Colorado gubernatorial bid. The campaign has launched vivatancredo.com and is airing radio spots that acknowledge a broken immigration system.\n\nMENACINGLY ADORABLE\n\nOne neighborhood in Phoenix has apparently been overrun by the tiniest of menaces \u2013 a pack of stray Chihuahuas. Distraught animal control officials told KNXV that they have received \u201cthousands\u201d of calls about the lap dogs running lose in the community of Maryvale, many times more than in other parts of Maricopa County. Does the link have unintentionally hilarious video of tiny dogs acting all tough? You bet it does.\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cSo the arrogance of [President Obama\u2019s agenda on global warming] is rather appalling, but worse is the application of it to our economy: shutting the coal industry, herding us into mass transit, getting us out of our larger cars. All of this is driven by this ideology, which in and of itself is almost a matter of theology.\u201d\u2014Charles Krauthammer, \u201cOn Special Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
