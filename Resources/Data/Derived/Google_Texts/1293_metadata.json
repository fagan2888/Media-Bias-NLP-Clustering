The team lost 100 games. Finished in last place, 28-and-a-half games out of first. They were the least-patronized team in the National League. The front office tired of the Padres\u2019 losing ways and applied pressure on manager Preston Gomez. One day there was a close call at third base which clearly went against San Diego. But Gomez skipped out of the dugout anyway to argue with umpire Harry Wendelstedt. Upon arriving at third base, Gomez told Wendelstedt he knew the call was right but he was on orders from the Padres\u2019 brass to \u201cput on a show.\u201d The Padres may not look like much on the field. But maybe the manager could show some spark and get into a good rhubarb with the umpires.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, Preston,\u201d replied Wendelstedt. \u201cTake as long as you want.\u201d\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans may not be as pathetic as Gomez\u2019s \u201971 Padres. But they sure can\u2019t figure out a way to avoid a calamitous shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on February 27. And like Gomez, they need to put on a good show and kick some dirt around the infield to show the conservative base they won\u2019t cave and will fight President Obama\u2019 immigration executive orders.\n\nCongress fully funded all federal departments except DHS in December. DHS was the lone stray because conservatives insisted to leaders they use that spending bill to block the executive orders. The House easily passed a DHS bill a few weeks ago. Now the Senate is stymied, unable to even summon the DHS legislation to the floor due to a Democratic filibuster. Democrats are more than willing to consider a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill. But not one with the immigration attachments.\n\nSenate Republicans have already engineered three procedural votes over the past few weeks to cut off the filibuster. Such an operation requires 60 yeas. Republicans only hold 54 Senate seats. Thus, the votes failed each time. Congress is now on recess for a week. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has scheduled a fourth procedural vote for Monday, February 23 \u2013 with little chance of success.\n\nMore On This... Will fight over immigration hurt the GOP?\n\nBut Republicans will put on a show.\n\nRepublicans will use the recess to stir up voters upset about the executive action. Republicans want them to call and write moderate Democratic senators who they think could be pressured into relenting to vote in favor of allowing the DHS bill to come to the Senate floor. For instance, Rep. Luke Messer (R-IN) cut a video message for Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), urging him to switch his vote.\n\n\u201cBy voting to block debate, you\u2019re voting to block the democratic process. If you don\u2019t like the bill we sent you, change it. Offer amendments. Let democracy work,\u201d beseeched Messer of his fellow Hoosier.\n\nThis may not get anywhere. But it boosts the GOP faithful \u2013 and blames the Democrats. And it comes at a time when the House Republican leadership and Senate Republican leadership can\u2019t agree on a path forward.\n\n\u201cThe House has done its job. We\u2019ve passed a bill. It\u2019s up to the Senate,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear we can\u2019t get anywhere in the Senate. The next move is obviously up to the House. It\u2019s clearly stuck,\u201d said McConnell.\n\nThe back and forth is driving Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson nuts. Johnson\u2019s become a permanent fixture of late on Capitol Hill, roaming the halls of Congress, practically begging for a solution. In fact Johnson says he\u2019s spending so much time doorstepping lawmakers that he doesn\u2019t have enough time to run his department.\n\n\u201cPlease solve this impasse,\u201d implored Johnson in an exclusive interview with Fox en route to appointments in the Rayburn House Office Building. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the House and Senate right now are pointing at each other. \u2018It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s the other body across the way.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe GOP infighting is a unique feature of the Republican-controlled Congress. The next week will afford Republicans the opportunity to direct their fire at President Obama for the executive order and portray Senate Democrats as obstructionists. And imagine what will be said when the GOP says that senators like Donnelly and others from swing states voted \u201cX\u201d number of times to prevent a bill to protect Americans from even coming up for debate? Moreover, these internal contretemps don\u2019t bode well for the future when Congress must conduct an epic fight to raise the debt limit, fund transportation programs and keep the entire government open for business this fall.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d (House members) like to leave the hot potato with us,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX). \u201cWe tried our best and the math didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they all just go home?\u201d snorted Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) of the Senate. \u201cMaybe they just need to pack up and they need to decide that for the next two years, we\u2019re just not going to do anything in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBut the Senate GOP\u2019s number two remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all got to work out. I can\u2019t tell you how. But it\u2019s going to,\u201d proffered Cornyn.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of that.\n\n\u201cThere is no plan which is scary,\u201d said one Senate Republican source.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not drafting. There is no contingency plan,\u201d said a Senior House GOP source.\n\nWith the deadline looming, some Republicans are batting around the idea of lopping off the immigration provisions and simply advancing the \u201cclean\u201d DHS spending bill with no attachments. A second option is a temporary, stopgap bill to fund the department for a few weeks. Such a measure is called a \u201cContinuing Resolution\u201d or \u201cCR\u201d in Congressional parlance.\n\n\u201cThe question is can we pass a clean CR through the House?\u201d asked Rep. John Carter (R-TX), chairman of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough,\u201d said one senior House Republican aide about the prospects of stripping the immigration language from the bill and just okaying the DHS funding.\n\nIt\u2019s generally thought that most of the House\u2019s 188 Democrats would vote yes on either bill. But with 433 members, 217 are needed to pass if all lawmakers vote. According to sources, it is possible that the Republican majority might not be able to cough up 29 of its own just to avoid defunding the Department of Homeland Security. Moreover, the House could stumble clearing a procedural hurdle of its own just to bring a \u201cclean\u201d or stopgap bill to the floor. Most bills in the House first require a \u201crule\u201d to establish the parameters of debate. But if a \u201crule\u201d fails, the House can\u2019t consider the underlying bill. The House narrowly approved the rule to bring up the last big spending bill called the \u201cCRomnibus\u201d in December. And that only came after some arm-twisting. In recent days, the House GOP leadership started cracking down on its deputy whips, committee chairs and subcommittee chairs over deviating on key procedural votes. The argument was that if those lawmakers wanted to remain in those positions, they must vote with leaders.\n\nBut if even a short-term or clean bill can\u2019t pass or if the procedural vote on the rule were to collapse.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a fix. We\u2019ll see how they get themselves out of it,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\nOn Thursday, Reps. Mo Brooks (R-AL), Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) and Labrador lifted a page from the Democrats\u2019 playbook.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell can change the rules of the Senate,\u201d said Labrador. \u201cAnd this is important enough for him to change the rules of the Senate.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not the rules, but Senate precedent.\n\nIn 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) unilaterally altered the Senate precedent with what\u2019s known as the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d Against violent objections from Republicans, Reid lowered the threshold from 60 yeas to just 51 to break some forms of filibusters. Conservatives want McConnell to turn the table on Senate Democrats and perhaps expand that practice. It would force Democrats to filibuster by actually seizing the floor for hours on end and talking, not just refusing to vote in favor of something.\n\n\u201cThe answer is not to change Senate rules,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who commandeered the floor for 21 hours in September, 2013 over Obamacare. \u201cI think the Senate rules wisely protect the minority.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option we\u2019re looking at right now,\u201d said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK).\n\nThat sort of talk agitated Labrador.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never a Republican strategy to win. There\u2019s always a Republican strategy to capitulate and wait,\u201d said the Idaho Republican.\n\nRepublicans know their base will light them up if they drop the immigrations provisions from the DHS bill. Boehner sidestepped a question about why the GOP had to marry the immigration language to the DHS measure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to have that debate on immigration,\u201d said DHS chief Johnson. \u201cBut don\u2019t tie it to funding an entire department.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of unfortunate hypotheticals which could prompt a resolution to this dispute. One is a major natural disaster requiring extensive assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The other is a terrorist attack. These storylines could break the deadlock quickly.\n\nUntil then, everyone\u2019s locked in. And until there\u2019s a reason to move, Republicans must stage a show on immigration.\n\nBack on the diamond, umpire Hunter Wendelstedt told San Diego skipper Preston Gomez to \u201ctake as long as you want\u201d when the Padres\u2019 owners demanded a \u201cshow.\u201d Republicans don\u2019t have Gomez\u2019s luxury for theatrics.
