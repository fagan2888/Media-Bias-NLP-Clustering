Friday\u2019s bullpen session was the first proper pitching since their injuries \u2014 but still at less than 100 percent.\n\nBut their timelines have meshed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not have someone in the same situation. But it is nice to feed off each other,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cYou have somebody who can tell you if something seems off or not right.\u201d\n\nAnderson and Chatwood will start throwing fastballs and change-ups on Monday in Los Angeles. Anderson is aiming for a return sometime before the all-star break July 13.\n\nChatwood\u2019s timeline is more difficult to pin down, since he\u2019s rehabbing a more delicate elbow injury.\n\nTheir returns could turn the tide of Rockies DL stints.\n\n\u201cWe have too many right now,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cSeems like we have half a roster back home.\u201d\n\nCarGo\u2019s biopsy comes back negative. Carlos Gonzalez, who remained in Denver while the Rockies started a weekend series against the Giants, got good news Friday.\n\nA biopsy showed the tumor removed from his left index finger Tuesday in Cleveland was a benign neuroma \u2014 a kind of callous of the nerves.\n\nIt was likely caused by repeated trauma to the finger in at-bats.\n\nRockies head trainer Keith Dugger described it as a \u201cfatty mass with tentacles.\u201d It was causing Gonzalez finger to swell too big to wear a batting glove. But the swelling wasn\u2019t normal and it would go away within in an hour.\n\nThe Rockies had to pull Gonzalez from the lineup three times before he underwent a surgery that turned from exploratory to excision.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tyler Chatwood, Brett Anderson have first bullpen sessions since DL trips", "title": "Tyler Chatwood, Brett Anderson have first bullpen sessions since DL trips", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/tyler-chatwood-brett-anderson-have-first-bullpen-sessions-since-dl-trips/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613_083402_rockies.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613_083402_rockies.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T20:36:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:44:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ea2\"", "article_summary": "Colorado pitchers Brett Anderson and Tyler Chatwood on Friday threw proper bullpen sessions, off a mound, for the first time since they were put on the 60-day disabled lists.\nBoth pitchers ramped up throwing sessions and long-toss on flat ground within the last two weeks, but only at partial strength.\nAnd the righty Chatwood suffered right flexor tendon inflammation in his right elbow during a game April 29.\nRockies head trainer Keith Dugger described it as a \u201cfatty mass with tentacles.\u201d It was causing Gonzalez finger to swell too big to wear a batting glove.\nThe left-handed Anderson broke his left index finger in an at-bat in San Francisco on April 12."}
