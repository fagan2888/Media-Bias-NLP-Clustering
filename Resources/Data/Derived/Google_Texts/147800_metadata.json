And it is striking every corner of the U.S. with no regard to age, gender or socioeconomic status.\n\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States today,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said.\n\nHHS committed the funds one day after the Senate passed a bill to address the epidemic on a near-unanimous vote, despite an outcry from Democrats who said Congress failed to free up enough money to make a real dent in the crisis.\n\nRepublican lawmakers had rejected an amendment by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat, that would have attached $600 million in emergency funding to the bill, which passed on a 94-1 vote Thursday.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said Congress set aside $400 million last year, or enough to carry out the bill\u2019s policies, and that lawmakers can free up more cash during this year\u2019s appropriations process.\n\nDubbed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the bipartisan legislation would help states monitor prescribing practices, expand the number of sites where parents can dispose of unneeded painkillers and distribute more naloxone \u2014 a treatment that can reverse the effects of an overdose \u2014 to law enforcement agencies and first responders, among other reforms.\n\nSenators pressured House leaders this week to take up and pass the legislation so that Mr. Obama can sign it into law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration awarded $94 million in Obamacare money Friday to health centers on the front lines of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, one day after Democrats complained that a Senate-passed bill to combat the crisis lacked necessary funding.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration awarded $94 million in Obamacare money Friday to health centers on the front lines of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, one day after Democrats complained that a Senate-passed bill to combat the crisis lacked necessary funding.", "title": "HHS awards $94 million to combat opioid crisis", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/11/hhs-awards-94-million-combat-opioid-crisis/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/30/health-overhaul-sign-upsjpeg-09945.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/30/health-overhaul-sign-upsjpeg-09945.jpg", "title": "HHS awards $94 million to combat opioid crisis", "description": "The Obama administration awarded $94 million in Obamacare money Friday to health centers on the front lines of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, one day after Democrats complained that a Se", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d6c\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration has awarded $94 million in Obamacare funds to health centers on the front lines of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, one day after Democrats complained that a Senate-passed bill to combat the crisis lacked necessary funding.\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States today,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said.\nHHS said unintentional overdose deaths from prescription painkillers nearly quadruped from 1999 to 2013, and heroin-related deaths increased 39 percent between 2012 and 2013.\nHealth centers will use the money to screen patients for drug abuse and administer medication-based treatments to wean addicts off their habit, while training health professionals on how to properly prescribe highly addictive painkillers.\nSenators pressured House leaders this week to take up and pass the legislation so that Mr. Obama can sign it into law."}
