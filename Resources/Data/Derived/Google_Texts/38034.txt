Justice Brace Yourselves: Marriage Equality’s Going To Have A Rougher Ride In The Courts From Here On Out CREDIT: AP Photo/Richard Vogel

On Friday, a federal district court in Wisconsin joined more than a dozen others in holding that the Constitution guarantees equal marriage rights to same-sex couples. Exactly zero federal judges have broken with this consensus since the Supreme Court declared the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional in 2013.

Now, however, these cases will move on to the United States Courts of Appeals, if they have not already done so. Currently, six federal appeals courts, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits, face marriage equality cases. Though it is fairly likely that equality will prevail in most of these circuits — the legal arguments for marriage equality are very strong, especially after the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision, and supporters of discrimination are left with a questionable states rights argument that no judge has yet embraced — it is unlikely that appellate court judges will show the same unanimity as their counterparts on the trial bench. Among other things, appointments to federal circuit courts have historically been much more politically charged than appointments to the lower-ranking district courts, so litigants are far more likely to encounter a judge who was selected for their loyalty to a particular ideology.

Here’s a breakdown of the six federal appeals courts considering marriage equality litigation, ranked from the courts most likely to side with equality to those that are most likely to uphold discrimination:

Ultimately, if at least one court of appeals rules in favor of equality and at least one backs discrimination, then that will all but guarantee that the Supreme Court will agree to decide this issue. As a general rule, the Supreme Court likes to hear cases where one federal circuit court disagrees with another on the same question of law.
