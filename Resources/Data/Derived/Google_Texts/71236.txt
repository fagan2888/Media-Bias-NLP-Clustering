A man with a loaded gun hidden in plain sight tried to smuggle the weapon into the Oklahoma County Jail.

The Sheriff says Thomas Lawson had a gun in his belt buckle. The .22-caliber pistol had four rounds ready to go, but detention officers found it Wednesday as they booked Lawson into custody.

The OCSO says this should serve as a warning to law enforcement to be vigilant.

"The suspect that was arrested had that weapon on him the entire time he was in the back of our deputy's vehicle and being transported to the Oklahoma County Detention Center," said Mark Myers with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's office.

Just last October, booking procedures were changed after two inmates smuggled guns into the jail.
