At the end of June, 9.9 million were enrolled.\n\nThe projection alarmed some insurers because it implied that they would not see an influx of healthy people, whose premiums could help defray the cost of care for sicker people in a well-balanced \u201crisk pool.\u201d\n\nIn applying for rate increases in 2016, many insurers filed data showing that they had lost money on their exchange business in 2014. To stop the losses and control costs, many have increased premiums and deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs, while reducing the number of doctors and hospitals available to consumers through their provider networks.\n\nConservatives want to let consumers buy policies with fewer mandated benefits, on the theory that such coverage would be more affordable. Some lawmakers say that insurers should be allowed to sell cheaper \u201ccopper\u201d plans alongside the bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans available in the marketplaces.\n\n\u201cObamacare piled mandates on the insurance industry that drive up costs and force many people to buy insurance that is more than they want or can afford,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming. \u201cThe only people who are consistently signing up are the ones who get subsidies from Washington.\u201d\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\nBut liberals draw a different lesson from insurers\u2019 troubles.\n\n\u201cWith the news that United Healthcare may drop coverage, it\u2019s further proof that we need to implement a public option,\u201d wrote Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, last week in a post on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHarvey J. Rosenfield, the founder of Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group based in California, suggested that \u201cmaybe the government should step in and run the system as Medicare for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are sticking their heads in the sand if they say there are not serious problems with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Mr. Rosenfield said, adding: \u201cPeople who were previously uninsured are indisputably better off, but many people in the middle class are struggling. They are entitled to buy health insurance, but that is an empty promise if the number of doctors and hospitals in your network has shrunk and deductibles have soared.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, unhappiness with the law has added momentum to an effort to replace it with a government-run health care program that would largely cut private insurers out. The initiative qualified for the 2016 ballot this month after supporters submitted over 158,000 signatures.\n\nState Senator Irene Aguilar, a Democrat, said frustration with rising premiums and deductibles had fueled disillusionment, as had the recent collapse of a nonprofit cooperative that was the most popular insurer on the Colorado exchange.\n\nThe new system would be expensive, raising $25 billion a year in revenue from a 6.67 percent payroll tax on employers and a 3.33 percent tax deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks.\n\n\u201cI like to say the ground has been tilled\u201d by the Affordable Care Act, Ms. Aguilar said. \u201cPeople have a better understanding now of the limitations of trying to do health coverage in the same way we\u2019ve always done it.\u201d\n\nThis month\u2019s Kaiser poll found that Democrats remained largely supportive of the health law. But some, like Mark Kaley, a small-business owner in Indianapolis, say they are increasingly angry at the private insurers selling plans through the exchanges.\n\nMr. Kaley said that he and his wife had \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d coverage from UnitedHealth this year, using the federal exchange even though they did not qualify for premium subsidies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhere is my premium payment going?\u201d Mr. Kaley asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s providing more health care to people who didn\u2019t have it before, then I\u2019m O.K. with it. But if it\u2019s going to a private insurance company who wants to pay larger dividends to its shareholders and salaries to its executives, I\u2019m not happy.\u201d\n\nReferring to the health law, Mr. Kaley said: \u201cAre there upsides to this? Yes. Were people in some way sold an optimistic view that is not panning out? Yes. People are angry and frustrated with that. The kinds of coverage and care they hoped they would have are just not there.\u201d\n\nThomas M. Harte, an insurance agent in Hampstead, N.H., and a former president of the National Association of Health Underwriters, said that New Hampshire residents had clearly benefited from the Affordable Care Act in some ways. In 2014, he said, insurance was available from only one carrier, Anthem. But now, he said, consumers also have several additional choices, including Harvard Pilgrim and the nonprofit cooperative insurance plans based in Maine and Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cAnthem is reducing its premiums,\u201d Mr. Harte said. \u201cOther plans are fighting for market share.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Harte said: \u201cEmployers are outraged about the burden of having to report to the Internal Revenue Service on the insurance coverage they provide to each of their employees. The amount of effort they spend to comply with the reporting requirements of health care reform is truly unbelievable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151127202002, "twitter":
