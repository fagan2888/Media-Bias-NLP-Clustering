Only 27 percent felt Common Core would improve academic achievement.\n\nIowa can do better for its students\u2014by cutting the cord to Common Core clean through.\n\nThese are the teachers charged with implementing \u201cIowa Core,\u201d which is a blend of Iowa\u2019s previous state standards with the national standards. The Iowa Board of Education approved Iowa Core in 2010. The board\u2019s action made Iowa one of the 46 states that agreed to adopt the national standards and implement them by the 2014-15 school year.\n\nStates hopped on the Common Core bandwagon largely to reap a bevy of tantalizing federal incentives.\n\nFor example, in exchange for adopting Common Core, Iowa could receive a waiver from sanctions levied by the federal No Child Left Behind law. It also had a chance to get some money from the Obama administration\u2019s $4.35 billion \u201cRace to the Top\u201d grant program. (It turned out Iowa lost its bid for grants twice but did get a waiver from No Child Left Behind.)\n\nIn the midst of the recession, most states took the federal bait\u2014often without considering the costs attached to Common Core, both financially and in terms of standards-setting autonomy.\n\nBut by July 2014, Iowa was having some second thoughts. Republican Gov. Terry Branstad and Iowa Department of Education Director Brad Buck informed the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium that the state would be withdrawing from the Common Core-aligned test.\n\nBut that announcement is not enough to reclaim Iowa standards.\n\nIowa lawmakers appropriated $2 million for fiscal year 2014 to \u201csupport the work of Iowa Core implementation.\u201d After the withdrawal from Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, the Iowa Legislature appointed a task force to develop new tests\u2014with guidance from the Smart Balanced consortium and the Next Generation Iowa Assessments.\n\nThe task force will make a recommendation for a new state test by Jan. 1.\n\nIowa can do better for its students\u2014by cutting the cord to Common Core clean through.\n\nThat\u2019s what organizations such as Iowa Restored Ed are working toward. These grassroots coalitions of parents and concerned citizens have sprung up across the nation as the drawbacks of national standards have become apparent.\n\nMany parents feel national standards have left them with no voice in the content that is taught in their children\u2019s schools.\n\nAnd when parents do have questions about Common Core, to whom do they address their concerns? Good luck knocking on the door of the U.S. Department of Education to find answers about Common Core textbooks, teacher professional development, homework or tests.\n\nIowa has long enjoyed a national reputation for educational excellence. Its Iowa Tests of Basic Skills exam has been used by many other states. Iowa understands how to design and implement valid assessments\u2014without the \u201chelp\u201d of the feds or outside groups like the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.\n\nJames Milgram, professor emeritus of mathematics at Stanford University, determined that the Common Core mathematics standards leave American students two grade levels behind their peers internationally by the time they reach seventh grade. He also found that they don\u2019t prepare students for admission into highly selective universities and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programs.\n\nThe English standards are also suspect. Sandra Stotsky, professor of education reform emeritus at the University of Arkansas, argues that Common Core\u2019s \u201cdiminished emphasis on literature in the secondary grades makes it unlikely that American students will study a meaningful range of culturally and historically significant literary works before graduation.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of \u201cimplementation year\u201d 19 states have made significant efforts to push back against Common Core. Indiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Louisiana have exited the standards. It is not too late for Iowa to reject Iowa Core and restore the state\u2019s education system to one that is by Iowans, for Iowans.\n\nOriginally appeared in the Des Moines Register.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 2013 survey by Professional Educators of Iowa found only 27 percent felt Common Core would improve academic achievement.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A 2013 survey by Professional Educators of Iowa found only 27 percent felt Common Core would improve academic achievement.", "title": "It's Not Too Late for States to Reject Common Core", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141109_CommonCore_Corona.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-09T10:58:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1rTbq32"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A 2013 survey by Professional Educators of Iowa found only 27 percent felt Common Core would improve academic achievement.", "title": "It's Not Too Late for States to Reject Common Core", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141109_CommonCore_Corona.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core", "published_time": "2014-11-09T10:57:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-09T10:58:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "common core, education, iowa"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89ec\"", "article_summary": "It is not too late for Iowa to reject Iowa Core and restore the state\u2019s education system to one that is by Iowans, for Iowans.\nFor example, in exchange for adopting Common Core, Iowa could receive a waiver from sanctions levied by the federal No Child Left Behind law.\nStates hopped on the Common Core bandwagon largely to reap a bevy of tantalizing federal incentives.\nThese are the teachers charged with implementing \u201cIowa Core,\u201d which is a blend of Iowa\u2019s previous state standards with the national standards.\nAnd when parents do have questions about Common Core, to whom do they address their concerns?"}
