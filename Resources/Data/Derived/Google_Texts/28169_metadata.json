Drivers will try again on Sunday. Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy\n\nRyan Hunter-Reay finished the rain-shortened first day of Indianapolis 500 qualifying in the same spot he finished last year's race \u2014 No. 1.\n\nNow he'll have to do it all over again Sunday.\n\nAfter Hunter-Reay posted the faster of two four-lap qualification runs Saturday, finishing with an average speed of 229.845 on the 2.5-mile oval, heavy rain washed out the rest of qualifying and both times from the completed runs.\n\n\"You just have to wait for it and keep your thoughts cool and calm and collected and get on with the job,\" he said. \"It's not a big deal. It's OK.\"\n\nSunday's schedule gives him one chance to requalify at a faster speed. The only other driver to finish a qualifying run was Colombia's Carlos Huertas. He had a four-lap average of 228.235, which temporarily gave Honda a rare chance to celebrate having the top two cars on the starting grid.\n\nChevrolet has dominated the early part of the season, taking all five poles and winning four of the first five races. The washout, the revised schedule and the high expectations for Pole Day might not help Hunter-Reay.\n\nIf weather permits, all drivers including Huertas and Hunter-Reay will get one attempt Sunday morning. The top 30 cars will be locked into the 33-car starting grid for the May 24 race with the nine fastest competing in the afternoon pole shootout.\n\nNASCAR Xfinity Series:Drew Herring was the fastest during qualifying for Sunday's 3M 250 at Iowa Speedway as a fill-in for Erik Jones.\n\nBut Jones, who was in Charlotte, N.C., for the Sprint Cup all-star event, will start from the back because he didn't qualify his own car.\n\nDaniel Suarez and Brian Scott will make up the first row for the race in Newton, Iowa.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Saturday's Indy 500 qualifying washed out", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/autoracing/saturdays-indy-500-qualifying-washed-out-b99501680z1-304020221.html", "image": {"width": 1999, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99501680z.1_20150516214840_000_gp2b4oqb.2-1.jpg", "height": 1258}, "type": "article", "description": "Ryan Hunter-Reay finished the rain-shortened first day of Indianapolis 500 qualifying in the same spot he finished last year\u2019s race \u2014 No. 1.
