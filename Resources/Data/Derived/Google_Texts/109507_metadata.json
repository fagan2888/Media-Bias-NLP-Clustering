This makes it the largest standalone housing scheme that the company has ever undertaken.\n\nGalliford Try has now picked up more than \u00a3800m of new work in the past two weeks, including more than \u00a3100m of affordable housing (see report here), more than \u00a3100m of building projects (previously reported here) and a major AMP6 framework deal with Southern Water, announced last week (here).\n\nThe Silvertown Way project will be delivered through an existing joint venture vehicle with Thames Valley Housing Association and deliver a third of the homes as market rent for its subsidiary Fizzy Living.\n\nThree Galliford Try Group companies will work on the development \u2013 Linden Homes, Galliford Try Partnerships and Galliford Try Infrastructure. The development includes a hotel, a restaurant, and office/commercial space as well as homes for sale, rent and shared ownership.\n\nIn addition, topping off a great fortnight for the company, Galliford Try has been appointed as preferred developer for a \u00a340m house-building scheme in the Bristol region, to build 210 homes for the Homes & Communities Agency (HCA).\n\nGalliford Try chief executive Greg Fitzgerald said: \"We are delighted to have been selected for both these schemes which underline our strong relationship with the GLA and HCA. These schemes are testament to the combined resources of the group and our proven expertise in regeneration and affordable housing projects. It underlines our continued investment in delivering much needed homes and working in long-term partnerships with our partners in the sector.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Greater London Authority (GLA) has selected Galliford Try as preferred developer to construct the Silvertown Way development in Canning Town, East London.", "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk", "description": "Greater London Authority (GLA) has selected Galliford Try as preferred developer to construct the Silvertown Way development in Canning Town, East London.", "creator": "@tcindex", "image": {"src": "http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/assets/news_articles/2014/09/1410763073_galliford.jpg"}, "title": "Galliford Try on a roll with \u00a3360m Silvertown Way scheme", "site": "@tcindex", "player": {"width": 320, "height": 240}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/construction-index-magazine/id511298344?mt=8", "iphone": "http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/construction-index-pocket/id422568285?mt=8"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Construction Index Magazine", "iphone": "The Construction Index Pocket Edition"}, "id": {"ipad": 511298344, "iphone": 422568285}}, "card": "summary"}, "alexaVerifyID": "rj--NM2U9otZSD3iS0q33ghe4BQ", "robots": "all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=422568285", "keywords": "Galliford Try,contract,contracts,over-20m", "google-site-verification": "HB3h71F1gLMBNeqoRFslFBRZwqdbLhVF2P7Jt3cdUUM", "verify-v1": "vB8hvP2GQOzMZW5qBfgcMyMELnvVqbiF4c/QuvBh0sQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe111c\"", "article_summary": "Three Galliford Try Group companies will work on the development \u2013 Linden Homes, Galliford Try Partnerships and Galliford Try Infrastructure.\nGreater London Authority (GLA) has selected Galliford Try as preferred developer to construct the Silvertown Way development in Canning Town, East London.\nGalliford Try chief executive Greg Fitzgerald said: \"We are delighted to have been selected for both these schemes which underline our strong relationship with the GLA and HCA.\nIn addition, topping off a great fortnight for the company, Galliford Try has been appointed as preferred developer for a \u00a340m house-building scheme in the Bristol region, to build 210 homes for the Homes & Communities Agency (HCA).\nThe development, which will create more than 1,100 mixed tenure homes across 11 individual blocks, has an approximate gross development value of \u00a3360m."}
