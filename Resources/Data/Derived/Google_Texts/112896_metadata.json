The flag was removed from the grounds of the South Carolina State House on July 10...\u201cWe are asking our fans and partners to join us in a renewed effort to create an all-inclusive, even more welcoming atmosphere for all who attend our events,\u201d NASCAR said in its statement. \u201cThis is an opportunity for NASCAR Nation to demonstrate its sense of mutual respect and acceptance for all who attend our events while collectively sharing the tremendous experience of NASCAR racing.\u201d..Reynolds and Carty, who had come to the speedway in an RV from their homes in Amsterdam, N.Y., and were parked in the speedway\u2019s RV Park, were talking happily about the races Friday when the subject of the flag came up. Both immediately said they had just bought Confederate flag stickers for their cars from a nearby fan gear retailer...The flag, which has been one of many sold by vendors near the speedway and was popular with fans, was not displayed by many in the park. Both said most fans are respecting NASCAR\u2019s wishes.But both were furious at the idea that the flag represented racism...\u201cBecause a few people made it racist,\u201d said Carty. \u201cThere is nothing negative about the Confederate flag. It\u2019s really not about racism, but a few people went crazy about it and this is what we have, and it\u2019s not right.\u201d..\u201cIf you go back into family histories in the South,\u201d Reynolds said, \u201cyou\u2019ll see someone in the family died fighting for that flag, and they weren\u2019t fighting for racism, they were fighting for what they saw as their country.\u201d..Kristen Lestock, the speedway\u2019s communications director, noted that the NASCAR advisory \u201cis not a ban.\u201d\u201cThough we have never experienced a complaint or problem during our NASCAR events here at New Hampshire Motor Speedway regarding the Confederate flag, the NASCAR industry certainly recognizes the potential divisive nature of this symbol,\u201d she said...\u201cOur goal is always to provide a fan-friendly atmosphere to all of our guests here, so we\u2019re simply asking NASCAR fans to focus on the one flag we all support with pride \u2014 the American flag. In addition, we encourage the flags of the NASCAR Nation, including driver and speedway flags,\u201d she said...The speedway offered an exchange program over the weekend which would have allowed fans to exchange their Confederate flags for an American flag or a racing flag of their choosing in the speedway gift shop. There was also a \u201csouvenir unit\u201d in campgrounds providing a free American flag to fans with a purchase of a souvenir, she said...The exchange program was not visited often over the weekend, speedway officials said.dseufert@newstote.com..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Reynolds and Chuck Carty were having a good time at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, getting ready for the weekend NASCAR races, until a reporter mentioned the issue of Confederate flags flying at NASCAR events.
