Jesse Jackson Sr. says Hamilton County's glitch-filled Election Day last week is part of a broader problem with voting in America.\n\nBecause rules and equipment vary from place to place, he said, access to the polls isn't assured for everyone, particularly minorities.\n\n\"Hamilton County's issue reminds us again that we're putting too little time into making voting work for everyone,\" Jackson told The Enquirer's editorial board Monday. \"It's not that complicated. Let everyone participate.\"\n\nBuy Photo The Rev. Jesse Jackson meets with the Enquirer editorial board. (Photo: Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)\n\nJackson, a civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, was in Cincinnati to meet with local ministers and some corporate officials related to his work with the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the civil rights group he founded in the 1970s. Election issues have been a recurring theme for Jackson, who also has generated news and controversy by speaking out about discrimination, poverty and the relationship between police and the communities they serve.\n\nHis comments about voting came less than a week after Hamilton County struggled with the introduction of new electronic sign-in technology that caused delays and confusion at several polling places. The board of elections still is investigating the problems, but board officials said last week that the computer may have been excluding some registered voters because an incorrect date was entered into the system.\n\nOther problems included poll workers who didn't know how to use the technology, the failure to use paper backup sign-in books at some locations, and the inability in some instances to print stickers that ensure voters receive the proper ballots.\n\nJackson didn't suggest the troubles were directly tied to discrimination, but he said leaving decisions about elections in the hands of the 50 states creates a wide range of complications, some of which disenfranchise minority voters. He favors a constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to vote nationwide and set universal rules for all the states, from how elections are run to voter eligibility.\n\n\"What happened in Hamilton County, it's so typical,\" Jackson said. \"We're still schizophrenic about democracy. We tout ourselves as the world's greatest democracy and we do so much to undercut it.\"\n\nJackson also addressed other issues in the news.\n\nOn the presidential campaign:\n\n\"I hope this election process next year won't be as ugly as it has been entertaining,\" he said.\n\nJackson, a Democrat, said he likes and respects Democratic front-runners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, but he did not endorse one over the other. When asked if he sees a Republican he can support, Jackson said the GOP primary has been ugly and suggested it might hurt the party's nominee in the general election next fall.\n\n\"I want all of them to keep running,\" he said of the primary.\n\nBuy Photo The Rev.

I'm glad he's in the process. I don't identify with his politics.\"\n\nOn the \"strike\" by black football players at the University of Missouri:\n\nJackson said he's encouraged that black athletes, who demanded the resignation of the school president, are taking a stand after minority students complained about racial slurs and discrimination on campus. Students elsewhere, including some at the University of Cincinnati, also have formed groups and are speaking up more about racial issues on campus.\n\n\"The problem is pervasive around the country,\" Jackson said.\n\nHe said black athletes, in particular, often struggle because their college life is so dominated by sports that they end up unprepared when they leave school. He said providing more mentoring and tutoring, as well as longer scholarships to carry them beyond their playing days, would give them a better chance to succeed.\n\nOn Ohio's Issue 1, the recently approved amendment that changes the way legislative districts are drawn:\n\nJackson said gerrymandering, the creation of district boundaries based on politics instead of geography, too often does a disservice to minority voters, limiting them to a few urban districts while white candidates thrive in most of the others.\n\n\"Anything that reduces gerrymandering has to be fairer than it used to be,\" he said.\n\nBuy Photo The Rev.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)\n\nOn opposition to Medicaid expansion:\n\nJackson said he marvels at how many poor, uninsured people, especially in the Deep South, oppose expanding insurance for the poor because of their dislike for President Barack Obama, who has championed the cause.\n\nKentucky, for example, has been a leader in implementing a state-run health care exchange under Obamacare, insuring thousands. Yet Kentucky just elected a governor who opposes that system.\n\n\"You've got people without insurance fighting against insurance,\" Jackson said. \"It's an odd couple.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1iO4bvW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Civil rights leader comes to Cincinnati to talk about Hamilton County's Election Day troubles", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "Civil rights leader comes to Cincinnati to talk about Hamilton County's Election Day troubles", "title": "Jesse Jackson talks Hamilton Co. vote woes", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/09/jesse-jackson-talks-county-vote-woes/75450386/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Civil rights leader comes to Cincinnati to talk about Hamilton County's Election Day troubles", "creator": "@enquirer", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/edc4fbc482bb19500416c30fd3edfcbde7b76b82/c=19-0-1582-1563&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg", "title": "Jesse Jackson talks Hamilton Co. vote woes", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Missouri", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Missouri", "title": "Jesse Jackson talks Hamilton Co. vote woes", "author": "Dan Horn", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b3256603ce1c30673280f8d26e7bdcd2582a206/c=341-0-1513-1563/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1570216c915dacd8d90bafd942b50605107884bf/c=19-0-1582-1563/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a91c530fef5f5e1e09c9726e8b1d0ce06e202229/c=0-0-1593-1198/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41fcdf6dbeb1e998c0ec52d13926e9636b7c8942/c=0-10-1593-910&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-09T22:27:22.353000-05:00", "shorthed": "Jesse Jackson talks Hamilton Co. vote woes", "articleid": 75450386, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d27fbf2d7202823367319f87ce5deec29cf11e3a/c=0-10-1593-910/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6d64de75721a0505ea33f5ea1f1f2dca04fdb19/c=718-0-1593-1563/local/-/media/2015/11/09/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635826889751237428-JESSE-JACKSON-1.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d94\"", "article_summary": "Jesse Jackson Sr. says Hamilton County's glitch-filled Election Day last week is part of a broader problem with voting in America.\nJesse Jackson meets with the Enquirer editorial board.\nJesse Jackson and state Rep.
