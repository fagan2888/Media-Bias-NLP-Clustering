His arrest resulted from a new cyber-bullying law. Now, in the year 2014, civil libertarians are concerned that application of this law could eventually lead to other kinds of arrests that go far beyond bullying.\n\nFree speech, as guaranteed in the First Amendment, weighs in the balance.\n\nBack in December 2010, Mackey-Meggs put together a Facebook page called the \u201cCohoes Flame.\u201d Writing anonymously, he mentioned certain students by name and described their sexual exploits including insinuations that some were engaged in homosexual activity. In one case, he talked about a female student having 14 sexual partners. He even went on and mentioned the name of each partner. The students were between the ages of 13 and 16.\n\nMost of his comments were so lewd they could not even be printed in newspapers, but one remark that could be printed described a female student who \u201cwill make out with any boy in history if drunk.\u201d\n\nMackey-Meggs was arrested and charged with eight counts of Internet bullying. He originally attempted to have his case dismissed on grounds of First Amendment protection, but the law was upheld, first by Cohoes City Court, and later by Albany County Judge Stephen Herrick. Herrick, however, added a new wrinkle by insisting the law should not apply to adult victims, but minors only.\n\nThis week, Mackey-Meggs\u2019 case went before the New York\u2019s Court of Appeals.\n\nCorey Stoughton of the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation is representing Mackey-Meggs. She has asked the court to overturn his conviction, claiming it violates not only the First Amendment but also the 14th Amendment and its guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\n\u201cBecause Albany County has made no effort to demonstrate that this broad criminalization of speech is necessary to protect minors from harm, the court should strike the cyber-bullying law down on its face,\u201d she said.\n\nAlbany County\u2019s law includes in its examples of cyber-bullying,\u201dsending hate mail, with no legitimate private, personal, or public purpose, with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm on another person.\u201d\n\nStoughton is concerned about the wide range of speech that can now be interpreted as having criminal intent:\n\n\u201cThese terms encompass countless emails, text messages, and postings on social networking and other websites, putting thousands of people in Albany County in jeopardy of criminal prosecution for expressing anger, criticism, intimacy, parody, gossip, and opinion.\u201d\n\nDefending the law, Albany County Attorney Thomas Marcelle attempted to assure the public that this new law does not endanger free speech.\n\n\u201cFreedom of speech is not the issue\u2026It was his desire to inflict harm on his victims that got him convicted of a crime, not his desire to enter into the marketplace of ideas\u2026.The Cyber-Bullying Law is precisely targeted at speech in the narrow circumstances where the communication has no purpose other than to inflict emotional harm upon a child \u2014 that is, in situations where the speaker has no intent to communicate ideas and is without the protections offered by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn point of fact, free speech is the issue and that does not suddenly become untrue simply because an attorney says so.\n\nOur wise forefathers understood that speech would sometimes be offensive. Otherwise, there would have been no need to protect it. What would have been the purpose of a First Amendment if every spoken word was going to sound agreeable and kind?\n\nHuman beings are easily affected by bad sounding practices or emotions and it is easy for attorneys to point out such unpleasantness to inspire new laws.\n\nBut when a law is stated broadly, words such as \u201cbullying\u201d or \u201chate\u201d turn the law into a Trojan Horse. Once inside those walls that once protected our freedom, the true implications of a law can end up forbidding all kinds of speech including sincere words from people who did not intend to either bully or hate.\n\nNobody likes a bully. But who is our society going to trust to determine a person\u2019s motive while writing something on the Internet or anywhere else? Have our litigious citizens and judges suddenly become mind readers?\n\nAs for hate, that too is a bad sounding word; that too can be a difficult motive to decipher.\n\nOn the other hand, not all hate is wrong. Aren\u2019t we supposed to hate things such as racism and injustice?\n\nWhat happens when people disagree as to what constitutes racism or injustice?\n\nSome believe we had just cause to send troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. Others compare us to the Nazis for waging such wars.\n\nSome believe it is impossible to criticize President Obama without a racist motive. Others believe the man is responsible for covering up a plethora of lies from Benghazi, to the IRS misuses. It is the scandals, not the skin color which concerns them.\n\nLet\u2019s face facts: Any honest gage regarding our country\u2019s communication skills between opposing camps, shows that we are a society that needs to be very careful where speech regulation is concerned.\n\nWe are told that conservative talk radio needs to be balanced by an equal amount of liberal programing. But liberal teaching at the university level should feel no similar obligation to offer an equal amount of conservative teaching.\n\nAnd of course, teaching itself gets confused by its varied labels:\n\nPeople are called hateful and intolerant for expressing disagreement with a same-sex lifestyle. They are not intolerant if they want to speak against Christianity.\n\nThose who object to abortion do not believe in choice. Those who want to tell you what to eat, drink, drive, or listen to on the radio do believe in choice.\n\nPeople are scientific if they question the existence of God. They are unscientific if they question global warming.\n\nPeople who speak out against to the Taliban\u2019s physical mutilation of educated woman are \u201cIslamophobes.\u201d Meanwhile, a real war against women can be found with any conservative American who does not believe our tax dollars should have to pay for birth control.\n\nRepublicans are told to \u201ctone down the rhetoric\u201d when they suggest that the Affordable Health Care Act will severely damage our country, but when Florida Congressman, Alan Grayson claims that the Republican plan for health care is to either not get sick or to die, he, supposedly, is not guilty of inflammatory language.\n\nDifferent perceptions of right and wrong have never been stronger in America. This is no time to start adding subtle nuances to speech freedom.\n\nYes, it would be better to have constructive dialogues rather than heated expression and name calling. But since designations such as \u201chate speech\u201d and motives such as \u201cbulling\u201d seem to be in the eye of the beholder, the safest road is to simply protect all expression.\n\nIf that idea sounds familiar, take another look at the First Amendment. Our ancestors already figured this out long ago.\n\nThis is Bob Siegel, making the obvious, obvious.\n\nBob Siegel is a radio talk show host and columnist.
