Julie also shares that starting January 1st, the Affordable Care Act will also cover Autism treatment.\n\nCovered CA\n\nCenter For Autism & Related Disorders\n\nUnderstanding the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Impact on Autism Treatment Coverage\n\nBy Julie Kornack\n\nSenior Public Policy Analyst\n\nCenter for Autism and Related Disorders, Inc.\n\nWhile the media and politicians might want you to think otherwise, it\u2019s not that difficult to understand the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as \u201cObamacare\u201d) and, more specifically, whether you can now access insurance to cover autism treatment in your state. While the federal exchange website has experienced some problems, many of the state exchanges, such as those in California, Kentucky, and New York, are running smoothly. If you currently don\u2019t have insurance that pays for autism treatment, you may live in one of the 27 states that is now offering that coverage through its state exchange, and you may qualify for federal subsidies to reduce the costs of that insurance.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance, you are eligible to purchase insurance through your state exchange, and federal subsidies make the insurance extremely affordable for those who qualify.\n\nDoes my state offer coverage for autism treatment?\n\nEach state offers either a state-based marketplace, a federally-facilitated marketplace, or a state-federal partnership marketplace that acts as the marketplace where you can purchase insurance. If you live in one of the 27 states listed below or in Washington, D.C., then your state offers coverage for autism treatment through its marketplace.\n\nStates Offering Coverage for Autism Treatment through ACA Marketplace\n\n(In addition to autism coverage through the state or federal marketplace, you may live in a state with an autism mandate. That means that you may already have a health insurance policy that is required to cover autism treatment. To find out more, go to CenterforAutism.com and click on the Affordable Care Act banner.)\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThe cost of health insurance through your state\u2019s marketplace begins with the monthly insurance premium, a fixed monthly fee. If you require healthcare, then you will also have to pay a deductible, co-insurance, and co-pays. The deductible, co-insurance, and co-pays are collectively referred to as \u201ccost-sharing,\u201d that is, your share of the cost when you need to use your insurance. The annual total of your cost-sharing, often referred to as out-of-pocket costs, cannot exceed $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family, and premium and cost-sharing subsidies will reduce those costs substantially for those who qualify.\n\nMetals \u2013 Coverage Levels and Your Co-Insurance: The policies offered through your state exchange have four different levels of coverage called \u201cmetals.\u201d These metals reference how much your policy will pay for a covered service and what your co-insurance will be. Policies will cover between 60-90% of covered costs, depending on which \u201dmetal\u201d you choose, and you will be responsible for the remaining amount (10-40%) up to the out-of-pocket maximum. Premium subsidies are based on the cost of silver plans, which cover 70% of covered costs, but the subsidies may be applied to a bronze, gold, or platinum plan. While premium subsidies can be applied to any \u201cmetal\u201d level, cost-sharing subsidies are only available for silver plans. Keep in mind that most preventive care is covered at 100%.\n\nCoverage Levels (\u201cMetals\u201d)\n\nMetal Coverage Your Share of Cost Your Maximum Out-of-Pocket Cost (Excluding Premium) Platinum 90% 10% $6,350 \u2013 individual $12,700 \u2013 family Gold 80% 20% $6,350 \u2013 individual $12,700 \u2013 family Silver 70% 30% $6,350 \u2013 individual $12,700 \u2013 family Bronze 60% 40% $6,350 \u2013 individual $12,700 \u2013 family\n\nCo-Pays: While co-pays will vary, the Affordable Care Act requires annual out-of-pocket costs, including co-pays, to be capped at $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family, and people whose income is at or below 400% of the federal poverty level will qualify for reduced out-of-pocket costs, including reduced co-pays. While insurance carriers have to limit your cost to that out-of-pocket maximum, the way those out-of-pocket costs accrue has been left to the insurance carriers. That means, some plans will have higher deductibles and lower co-pays, and other plans will have low deductibles and higher co-pays.\n\nWhat kind of help can I get to pay for my insurance?\n\nOf course, even 10% of expensive medical procedures can represent a prohibitive cost for many of us, which is why the Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to help you afford the insurance premium and the cost sharing. You are eligible for federal tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies if your income is 250% of the federal poverty level (FPL) or less. This means that your premium, deductible, co-pays, and co-insurance will be significantly reduced. If your income is 400% FPL or lower, federal tax credits will reduce the cost of your monthly premium, but incomes above 250% of FPL will not qualify for the cost-sharing subsidies that lower the cost of your deductible, co-pays, and co-insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Poverty Level (FPL)*\n\nPersons in Family 100% FPL 150% FPL 200% FPL 250% FPL 300% FPL 350% FPL 400% FPL Reduced Premium, Deductible, Co-Insurance, & Co-Pays Reduced Premium 1 $11,490 $17,235 $22,980 $28,725 $34,470 $40,215 $45,960 2 $15,510 $23,265 $31,020 $38,775 $46,530 $54,285 $62,040 3 $19,530 $29,295 $39,060 $48,825 $58,590 $68,355 $78,120 4 $23,550 $35,325 $47,100 $58,875 $70,650 $82,425 $94,200\n\n*FPL is slightly higher in Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nYour Subsidized Cost in Addition to Insurance Premium\n\nIncome Level for Family of Four Coverage Co-Insurance (Your Share of Cost with Subsidy ) Your Maximum Out- of-Pocket Cost (Excluding Premium) 100-150% FPL $23,550 \u2013 $35,325 94% 6% $2,250 \u2013 individual $4,500 \u2013 family 150-200% FPL $35,325 \u2013 $47,100 87% 13% $2,250 \u2013 individual $4,500 \u2013 family 200-250% FPL $47,100 \u2013 $58,875 73% 27% $5,200 \u2013 individual $10,400 \u2013 family\n\nFind out if you qualify.\n\nThe initial rush to the marketplace websites has subsided and Healthcare.gov is working more efficiently, so take a few minutes to find out about the different plans available in your state and whether it makes sense to purchase insurance through your state exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senior Public Policy analyst Julie Kornack shares insight on the approaching Affordable Care Act deadline for \u00a0those who want coverage starting January 1st 2014.
