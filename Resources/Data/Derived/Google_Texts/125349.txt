The Sheboygan Rifle and Pistol Club would like to invite everyone to its free 60th anniversary Open House Saturday from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. We are located at W765 Rowe Road — just south of Whistling Straights on County Highway LS.

All outdoors people, shooters, neighbors, members of other clubs or just friends who would like to see our setup and activities are invited to help us celebrate our first 60 years as a fixture in Sheboygan County.

Safe, accessible shooting opportunities will be offered for those who wish to try them, and we will also have displays of all of our clubs various activities, including shooting demonstrations of “Cowboy Action” and others going on throughout the day.

We will also be exhibiting our educational classes, club history and all of our safety measures and regulations that we have in place that help keep our club a good neighbor and will keep us going strong into the future.

The event is free to attend, and food and drink will be available at reasonable cost or free in some cases. Whether you stop in for 10 minutes or the whole day you are welcome to join us.

Thank you Sheboygan. We’d love to have you as our guests.
