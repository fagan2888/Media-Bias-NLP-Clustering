Burwell, Scott Lemieux kindly calls me \u201cObamaCare\u2019s fiercest critic\u201d for my role in that ObamaCare case. Other words he associates with my role include \u201cdefiant,\u201d \u201cludicrous,\u201d \u201cfarcical,\u201d \u201cdumber,\u201d \u201csnake oil,\u201d \u201cludicrous\u201d (again), \u201cirrational,\u201d \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201ccomically transparent,\u201d and \u201cdishonest.\u201d\n\nSomewhere amid the deluge, Lemieux reaches his main claim, which is that (somehow) I admitted: \u201cthe King lawsuit wasn\u2019t designed to uphold the statute passed by Congress in 2010. It was intended to \u2018enfranchise\u2019 the people who voted against the bill.\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure what Lemieux means. But perhaps Lemieux doesn\u2019t understand my point about how the Supreme Court helped President Obama disenfranchise his political opponents.\n\nAs all nine Supreme Court justices acknowledged in King, \u201cthe most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase\u201d is that Congress authorized the Affordable Care Act\u2019s premium subsidies, employer mandate, and (to a large extent) individual mandate only in states that agreed to establish a health-insurance \u201cExchange.\u201d That is, all nine justices agreed that the plain meaning of the operative statutory language allows states to veto key provisions of the ACA\u2014sort of like the Medicaid veto that has existed for 50 years and lets states destroy health insurance for millions of poor Americans. The Exchange veto includes the power to shield millions of state residents from the ACA\u2019s least-popular provisions: the individual mandate and the employer mandate.\n\nWhen 34 states exercised those vetoes by refusing to establish Exchanges, it was a repudiation of the ACA, driven by voters who elected ACA opponents to statewide offices in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. In the 2010 elections, the first to be held after President Obama signed the ACA, Republicans netted control of six governorships, 22 state legislative chambers, and took outright control of more state legislatures than they had since 1952. During 2012, when states had to make the crucial decision about whether to establish an Exchange, Republicans controlled 29 governorships, two legislative chambers (and thus the entire legislature) in 26 states, and one legislative chamber in a further five states. That doesn\u2019t even include Nebraska\u2019s legislature, which is unicameral, non-partisan, and also refused to establish an Exchange. Public opposition to the ACA was a major\u2014if not the major\u2014factor in these gains, as well as GOP gains in Congress. This should not be surprising, given the ACA\u2019s instant and enduring unpopularity.\n\nSo when President Obama chose to implement those subsidies and mandates in states that refused to establish Exchanges, he wasn\u2019t just exceeding the powers Congress granted him under the ACA. He wasn\u2019t just imposing taxes and spending money directly contrary to \u201cthe most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.\u201d He was actively disempowering his political opponents in the states by stripping state officials of a veto that \u201cthe most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase\u201d granted them. He disenfranchised Republican and independent voters\u2014individual Americans who put those state officials into office\u2014by taking away the effect of their votes.\n\nAnd when the Supreme Court strained to reach its counter-textual King ruling, it did not merely ratify these never-authorized taxes and entitlements. It also ratified the president\u2019s sweeping attempt to disenfranchise his political opponents. Nixon had nothing on these guys.\n\nIn the face of the disenfranchisement of millions of voters for partisan advantage, Lemieux responds with hand-waving: \u201cAllegedly, single special elections in 2009 and 2011 are supposed to be decisive repudiations of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d I honestly don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. The relevant 2009 and 2011 elections were for state offices in New Jersey and Virginia, and were not special elections. The only special election that really bears on any of this was Scott Brown\u2019s special election to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts\u2014also a repudiation of the ACA\u2014and that was in January 2010.\n\nLemieux claims the 2012 presidential race is a more accurate reflection of the demos than pesky state and congressional elections anyway, because \u201cthe man who signed the ACA [got] nearly five million more votes than his opponent.\u201d That\u2019s true, but it hardly means what Lemieux implies. Since the president\u2019s opponent had supported an identical law while governor of Massachusetts, but then distanced himself from it, one could as credibly claim the voters would have preferred an ObamaCare opponent, but barring that they preferred sincerity to opportunism. That interpretation would be fortified by the fact that those same voters have consistently opposed the ACA, and elected a Congress (it\u2019s a law-making body) devoted to repealing it.\n\nAs the high concentration of colorful descriptors in Lemieux\u2019s blog post suggests, it could stand even more debunking. But I\u2019ll leave off here to see if he and I can at least agree on where we disagree.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nixon had nothing on these guys.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Nixon had nothing on these guys.", "title": "King v.
