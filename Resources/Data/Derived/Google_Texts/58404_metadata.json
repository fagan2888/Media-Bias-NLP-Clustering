The 14-year-old, apparently unsure of what she saw at the time, told a detective she did not want to file a false accusation if the object wasn\u2019t really a gun, and said she was also worried about \u201cbeing retaliated against for telling on the female\u201d student, according to a report by the officer who conducted the interview.\n\nThe following day, investigators say 15-year-old Dorothy Dutiel shot and killed a 15-year-old classmate with a handgun, identified by family members and friends as May Kieu, before turning the gun on herself. Glendale police announced Friday the department is recommending a class 6 felony charge against the 15-year-old boy who supplied the handgun to Dutiel.\n\n[RELATED: PD: Teen suspect in murder-suicide got gun from classmate]\n\nDespite the striking similarities between the incidents at Independence High School just one day apart, it\u2019s unclear if the two are connected.\n\nAccording to the police report, the 14-year-old witness told the detective she knew the two female students killed in the murder-suicide, but insisted the girl with the gun the previous day was not one of them. She said the girl was African-American and in 9th grade; Dutiel is white, Kieu is of Asian descent, and both were in 10th grade.\n\n[Slideshow: 2 teens shot dead at Independence High]\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what investigators make of the interview, but it\u2019s included in the 87-page preliminary report released Friday. Included with the report were dozens of pictures, including images of a backpack left inside Dorothy Dutiel\u2019s room on the day of the shooting with a loaded magazine inside it. The backpack is covered in lime green spots.\n\n\u201cBefore I left their home, I advised [the 14-year-old witness] that if she ever saw a person with a gun on campus she should tell a teacher, administrator, or school resource officer immediately,\u201d Det.
