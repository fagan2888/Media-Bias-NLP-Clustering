They\u2019re an easy way to get in your daily recommended amount of fruits and vegetables and, if you\u2019re like this writer, to make use of all the produce that\u2019s about to go bad in your fridge. Smoothies are especially great on those mornings you\u2019re running late but don\u2019t want to skip a meal or settle for fast food.\n\nThe thing is, not all fruits and vegetables or milks and spices complement each other.
