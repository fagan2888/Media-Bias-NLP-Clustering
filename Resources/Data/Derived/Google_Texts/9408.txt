Holy hell, our old pal, Agenda 21, the secret UN plot to steal all our golfs, is making an appearance in the Republican senatorial primary in the newly insane state of North Carolina.

Brannon, a physician, is running as the tea party alternative to North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, who has been the presumed frontrunner for the GOP nomination. A March 11 poll from the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling found Brannon and Tillis tied at 14 percent to lead the Republican primary field. For the uninitiated, Agenda 21 is a non-binding UN plan regarding sustainable development that is the subject of numerous fringe conspiracy theories. Glenn Beck, for instance, wrote a dystopian novel about it, and Beck's news site, The Blaze, has warned readers that it could lead to a one-world government. "This scam of Agenda 21, this scam of humans are poisoning the earth, is a scam," Brannon said. "They are using that to control you, to control me, to control life." "That's why Obamacare, Agenda 21, NDAA, all these things are the collective over the individual. The spirit of 1776 must be rebirthed because we are living in the Orwellian 1984."..."I want to know how Agenda 21 is attacking our private property," he said. "This is going to be bloody because Mr. Tillis does not want that kind of fight, he's not comfortable with those forums. So I'm going to disagree with this. This is truly confrontational because you know what happened? They took my Constitution away."
