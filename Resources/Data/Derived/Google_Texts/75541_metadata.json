(Photo: AP)\n\nNEWARK - Newark police officials say a cyberattack shut down some of their computer systems for three days last week.\n\nBut they say the attack didn\u2019t disrupt the delivery of emergency services. And there\u2019s no indication that any information stored on the affected servers was compromised.\n\nActing Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose told NJ.com (http://bit.ly/23NRHam) that department staffers couldn\u2019t access the various systems while crews worked to clear servers of a virus implanted during the attack.\n\nThe virus temporarily locked down the servers, blocking access to the program used to track and analyze crime data and another used to dispatch police and emergency officers.\n\nA backup system was used for dispatch services.\n\nDepartment officials wouldn\u2019t say what security measures failed during the attack. But they say additional safeguards have been implemented to \u201creduce the likelihood\u201d of another attack.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
