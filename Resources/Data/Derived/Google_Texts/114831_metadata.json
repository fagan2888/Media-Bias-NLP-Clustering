This talk of black skin or white skin, that's something I don't like and I didn't know why [it was happening].'\n\nSouleymane says one member of the group of around 30 or 40 white men pointed at his skin and then to his own, as if to say only one kind was allowed on the train.\n\nIn the footage he can be seen twice trying to enter the tightly packed carriage, but both times being shoved back out through the train door.\n\nHe said what happened had not much hurt him physically, but had damaged his morale 'a lot', meaning he will now only use his car and not the Paris underground.\n\nSouleymane lost his phone in the scuffle but managed to get on the next train, arriving home to a wife and family with whom he could not bring himself to discuss what happened, unable to believe a group of foreigners had stopped him going home in his own city because of the colour of his skin.\n\nHe is pictured here in the video trying to get on the train but was immediately forced back by the fans\n\nIt was only when a French journalist tracked him down the next day and showed him Mr Nolan's video that he realised he had to speak out about it and make a complaint to police.\n\nHe said what happened was Chelsea's 'responsibility', and the club have offered him a place in the director's box at Stamford Bridge for the return match against PSG next month.\n\nFrench president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has called to pledge his personal support.\n\nFive people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's ground following investigations into the incident and face lifetime bans if they're found guilty of any offence\n\n\n\nFrench police have handed the pictures of seven men they believe to be involved to their British counterparts.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police have also released images of three more Chelsea fans they believe took part.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Parisian,Souleymane,S,target,racism,Chelsea,fans,Metro,says,really,afraid",
