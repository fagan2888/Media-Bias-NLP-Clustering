FDA has issued a final rule to implement the menu labeling provisions added to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by the Affordable Care Act. Under the new requirements, restaurants or similar retail food establishments (in chains of 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and selling substantially similar menu items) must provide calorie and other nutrition information for standard menu items. Although the menu labeling requirements originally were scheduled to take effect on December 1, 2015, FDA extended the compliance date to December 1, 2016. Then, as part of the omnibus spending legislation passed in December 2015, Congress further delayed FDA’s ability to enforce compliance with menu labeling requirements until one year after final guidance is published. Despite the issuance of draft guidance and delays in implementation, many industry stakeholders have remained concerned about FDA’s requirements and how they apply to different food service models and food products.
