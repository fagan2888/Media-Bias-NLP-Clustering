The lead article, \u201cKing v. Burwell and the Triumph of Selective Contextualism,\u201d is by Jonathan Adler and yours truly. Here\u2019s the abstract:\n\nKing v. Burwell presented the question of whether the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue tax credits for the purchase of health insurance through Exchanges established by the federal government. The King plaintiffs alleged an IRS rule purporting to authorize tax credits in federal Exchanges was unlawful because the text of the ACA expressly authorizes tax credits only in Exchanges \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d The Supreme Court conceded the plain meaning of the operative text, and that Congress defined \u201cState\u201d to exclude the federal government. The Court nevertheless disagreed with the plaintiffs, explaining that \u201cthe context and structure of the Act compel us to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.\u201d The Court reached its conclusion by disregarding portions of the ACA\u2019s text and considering only selected elements of the ACA\u2019s structure, context, and purpose. The King majority\u2019s selective contextualism embraced an unexpressed congressional \u201cplan\u201d at the expense of the plan Congress actually enacted.\n\nOur article\u2014which is available now at SSRN\u2014quotes Darth Vader more often than any previous Cato Supreme Court Review article.
