She has appealed.\n\n\u201cThink about it this way: You wouldn\u2019t want men to be allowed to shower and dress with your 15-year-old daughter,\u201d Cormier\u2019s lawyer, David Kallman, told The Daily Signal.\n\nCormier originally complained after unsuspectingly encountering a transgender person, identified as Carlotta Sklodowska, in the women\u2019s locker room of the Planet Fitness in Midland, Mich., on Feb. 28, 2015.\n\nAfter checking with a front desk employee and a Planet Fitness corporate office, Cormier discovered that the corporation\u2019s\u2019 \u201cno judgment policy\u201d means the gym does not judge who is male and who is female, even when it comes to locker room use.\n\nCormier, of Sanford, Mich., filed suit in March against two Planet Fitness entities\u2014PF Fitness-Midland LLC in Michigan and Pla-Fit Franchise LLC in New Hampshire\u2014alleging that the gym had violated her civil rights under state law as well as invaded her privacy and breached its contract with her.\n\nLawyers for Planet Fitness asked the court to dismiss the case.\n\nMidland County Circuit Court Judge Michael J. Beale did so Jan. 4, writing that the gym\u2019s \u201cinclusive\u201d policy did not \u201cgo beyond the bounds of decency.\u201d\n\nCormier appealed Jan. 28.\n\nIn response to Planet Fitness\u2019 motion to dismiss, Cormier\u2019s lawyers asked:\n\nWhat is their \u2018judgment-free zone\u2019 supposed to mean? Does it mean, as their actions imply, that they lack all sense of judgment? Does it mean their customers cannot exercise any judgment in what they wear, or say, or do while in the facility? Or does it mean customers can exercise in the buff, knowing they will not be \u2018judged\u2019 for doing so?\n\nBeale dismissed Cormier\u2019s invasion of privacy complaint, explaining that after being told about the \u201cjudgment-free\u201d policy, she should have known the women\u2019s locker rooms at Planet Fitness were not for women alone.\n\nBeale also dismissed Cormier\u2019s privacy and civil rights complaints on the grounds that they asserted a harm that could happen rather than harm that did happen as a result of the Planet Fitness policy.\n\nThe judge\u2019s opinion \u201cignores the fact that Planet Fitness\u2019 policy allowing the presence of a man in the women\u2019s locker room when women are in various stages of undress is offensive behavior in and of itself,\u201d Kallman Legal Group, which represented Cormier, said in a press release.\n\n\u201cA woman should not have to wait until she is viewed naked by a man, or until worse objectionable behavior occurs, in order to secure legal protection.\u201d\n\nMichigan state Rep. Gary Glenn, R-Midland, said he hopes the Michigan Court of Appeals will take the case.\n\n\u201cThe man in this case defines himself as a \u2018male slut-in-training,\u2019\u201d Glenn told The Daily Signal, citing statements on Sklodowska\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cEven he defines himself as a male. It is not difficult to explain why a woman would be uncomfortable in the same locker room.\u201d\n\nGlenn said the case is one example of what he expects to be widespread behavior if Michigan adopts \u201cgender identity\u201d legislation.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that the rights, comfort, and safety of women will be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe LGBT advocacy group Equality Michigan praised Planet Fitness for its sensitivity to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals.\n\n\u201cThis incident clearly illustrates that those who are most in danger in sex-segregated spaces are transgender and gender-variant people, and we congratulate Planet Fitness on valuing the safety of our most marginalized and targeted people,\u201d Yvonne Siferd, Equality Michigan\u2019s director of victim services, said in a formal statement in March.\n\n\u201cEquality Michigan hopes that more businesses follow Planet Fitness\u2019 lead and create more safe spaces for their customers who are under attack just for being their authentic selves.\u201d\n\nKallman told The Daily Signal he plans to file Cormier\u2019s appeal brief in a month or so, after which Planet Fitness will file its legal briefs, with oral arguments likely to follow.\n\nPlanet Fitness declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"What is their \u2018judgment-free zone\u2019 supposed to mean?
