The higher the quality of service, based on certain criteria, the more the hospital would receive.\n\n\u201cWe are offering competitive salaries plus pay for performance,\u201d Medical Center Vice-President of Human Resources Mary Caudella said. \u201cWhen we meet goals, all get bonuses.\u201d\n\nThe new contract, if ratified, would allow union members to share in bonuses for quality of service, thereby incentivizing quality care, Jersey City Medical Center spokesman Mark Rabson said.\n\nTaking the vote tomorrow and Friday are American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 1199J members, which represents 500 Medical Center nurses, Rabson said.\n\nAlso voting are AFSCME Council 52 locals 2254 and 3680 which represents 600 Medical Center workers with jobs such as respiratory therapists, environmental services, paramedics, clerks, mental health workers, transporters and laboratory and other technicians jobs, Rabson said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the changes in healthcare reflected nationally we asked our unions to work with us in meeting these new goals,\u201d Rabson said. \u201cThese are based around the hospital\u2019s four pillars of patient safety, clinical quality, patient satisfaction/engagement and the hospitals overall financial picture.\u201d\n\nIf ratified, the contracts would run through 2017, Rabson said.\n\nThe nurses\u2019 union leader said today that she did not want to comment until after the vote. The union leader for the other two locals could not be reached for comment.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','jersey-city'", "title": "Three Jersey City Medical Center union locals to vote on new contracts tomorrow and Friday", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Three Jersey City Medical Center union locals to vote on new contracts tomorrow and Friday\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/02/three_jersey_city_medical_center_union_locals_to_vote_on_new_contracts_tomorrow_and_friday.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/14027160-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12243162\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-19T23:23:44Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/14027160-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Three union locals at the Jersey City Medical Center are to vote on a contract agreement which would give them a stake in performance bonuses the hospital may receive for providing quality care under Obama Care."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014,  6:23 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/jcmcjpg-9e0acc95232de93cjpg-146e2b4b30d63f2d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Hudson County\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Three union locals at the Jersey City Medical Center are to vote on a contract agreement which would give them a stake in performance bonuses the hospital may receive for providing quality care under Obama Care.", "title": "Three Jersey City Medical Center union locals to vote on new contracts tomorrow and Friday", "url": "http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/02/three_jersey_city_medical_center_union_locals_to_vote_on_new_contracts_tomorrow_and_friday.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, February 19, 2014,  6:23 PM", "article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "Three union locals at the Jersey City Medical Center are to vote on a contract agreement which would give them a stake in performance bonuses the hospital may receive for providing quality care under Obama Care."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are offering competitive salaries plus pay for performance,\u201d Medical Center Vice-President of Human Resources Mary Caudella said.\nThree union locals at the Jersey City Medical Center are to vote on a contract agreement which would give them a stake in performance bonuses the hospital may receive for providing quality care under Obama Care.\nTaking the vote tomorrow and Friday are American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 1199J members, which represents 500 Medical Center nurses, Rabson said.\n\u201cWhen we meet goals, all get bonuses.\u201dThe new contract, if ratified, would allow union members to share in bonuses for quality of service, thereby incentivizing quality care, Jersey City Medical Center spokesman Mark Rabson said.\nThe nurses\u2019 union leader said today that she did not want to comment until after the vote."}
