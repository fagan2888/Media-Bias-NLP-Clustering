Barack Obama\u2019s cavalcade trundled up the road and into Del Sol high school on Friday to bring his case for the most sweeping immigration reform in decades to a rally in Nevada\u2019s gambling capital.\n\nA bright desert sun illuminated two contrasting tableaux. From the school entrance snaked hundreds of people, mostly Latino, giddy and upbeat, come to hear and cheer a president who had decided to shield almost five million illegal immigrants from deportation by offering them temporary legal status and work permits. Across the street stood about two dozen protesters \u2013 white, indignant and angry \u2013 with megaphones. Placards amplified the message: \u201cNo amnesty!\u201d \u201cDeport them all!\u201d \u201cOust Obama!\u201d\n\nDemocrats from Washington who hitched a ride to the event on Air Force One could not resist smiling. It was a banner day for civil rights. But, more prosaically, the scenes on both sides of the highway sprinkled optimism on their chances of keeping the White House after Obama.\n\n\u201cThe Latino vote is going to stay solid Democratic,\u201d said Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico governor and one of the party\u2019s leading Latino figures. \u201cI think the party in deep trouble is the Republican party. They\u2019re digging themselves in a very bad hole with Latino voters for 2016.\u201d Dolores Huerta, a veteran and well-known labour activist, agreed. \u201cI think they can win Congress, but not the presidency. There are 50,000 Latino kids that turn 18 every month \u2013 not just on the west coast or in the south-west; you\u2019re talking about Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland.\u201d Obama\u2019s unilateral action, taken without congressional approval, is a political gamble. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 48% of Americans disapproved of him going solo, versus 38% who approved. But 57% supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Analysts on both sides say it could pave the way for another Democrat in the White House, especially if Republicans fall into the trap of overreacting.\n\nObama electrified the Las Vegas audience. \u201cWe\u2019re not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe welcome them as fellow children of God.\u201d He exuded brio, a contrast to two weeks ago when the GOP swept the midterm elections, seizing control of the Senate and strengthening its grip on the House, a rout that seemed to repudiate an unpopular, apparently lame-duck president. A conservative agenda \u2013 picking apart Obamacare, cutting spending \u2013 beckoned. Obama\u2019s executive order, made in an emotional White House address on Thursday and reinforced in Las Vegas, wrested back the initiative, forcing his foes to fight on treacherous terrain.\n\nMitt Romney sabotaged his 2012 campaign when he urged undocumented people to \u201cself-deport\u201d. It alienated Latinos, the fastest-growing group of voters. The GOP\u2019s official postmortem made a blunt conclusion: \u201cIf Hispanics think that we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies.\u201d Moderate Republicans later backed a bipartisan Senate immigration bill, hoping to detoxify their image, only to see conservative colleagues in the House kill it.\n\nLatinos, however, turned much of their ire on Obama for his refusal to take unilateral action. Worse, deportation levels soared, prompting the nickname \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d. Disenchantment depressed Latino turnout in the mid-terms, costing Democrats several races.\n\nLast week\u2019s executive action leaves about six million of the estimated 11 million undocumented Latinos vulnerable to deportation, and grants only three-year protection to beneficiaries. The most far-reaching aspect is the creation of a \u201cdeferred action\u201d programme that will benefit the estimated 3.7 million undocumented immigrants who are parents of US citizens or permanent legal residents. Activists call it a first step to comprehensive reform. Politically, however, it is a leap that has restored Latino faith in Obama and the Democrats. \u201cThis goes a long way,\u201d said Maria Elena Durazo, a leader in the hotel workers\u2019 union Unite. \u201cIt will show that a Democratic president had the courage to stand with Latino families.\u201d\n\nLatinos lag white and black people in election turnout, but their demographic clout \u2013 14% of the electorate \u2013 weighs more at every election. Delia Lago, 53, a Vegas hotel worker, had a chilling message for Republicans. She hopes to become a citizen \u2013 a voting citizen \u2013 next year and has 14 US-born grandchildren, all citizens. Would they ever vote Republican? Her nose wrinkled: \u201cThey don\u2019t make us feel welcome.\u201d\n\nPickets outside the school exemplified the GOP\u2019s perceived hostility to Latinos. \u201cAs a taxpayer I\u2019m done paying bills for illegal immigrants,\u201d said Gary Adams, 61. \u201cAll they do is take and Obama gives, gives, gives.\u201d Ty Romsa, 54, held a placard comparing Obama to Mussolini.\n\nLatinos queuing to see Obama heard the protesters\u2019 chants. Some laughed, others rolled their eyes. \u201cI think they\u2019re uneducated,\u201d said Jason Eusteqio, 16. \u201cOr they just don\u2019t get what the president is saying,\u201d said his friend Jorge Ramirez, also 16. \u201cImmigrants built this country.\u201d\n\nHuerta, the activist said racism plagued Republicans: \u201cIt\u2019s just too much for them, they can\u2019t overcome it.\u201d Durazo was equally dismissive. \u201cRepublicans just don\u2019t like Latinos, period. They want you to be a cheap labour force, to be quiet and just do what they tell you to do.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders reject such accusations but admit the perception of intolerance damages chances of capturing the White House. \u201cIf you overreact, it becomes about us, not President Obama,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham. Michele Bachmann, a House Republican, did not get the message. Obama\u2019s action, she told the Washington Post, was an effort to increase the number of \u201cilliterate\u201d Democratic voters.\n\nIN NUMBERS\n\n\n\n\u25a0 America\u2019s Hispanic population topped 54 million as of 1 July, 2013, an increase of 2.1% over 2012.\n\n\u25a0 US births have been the main driving force behind that increase since 2000, a trend continued in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\u25a0 Natural increase (births minus deaths) accounted for 78% of the total change from 2012 to 2013.\n\n\u25a0 At 47%, New Mexico has the highest Hispanic population share. California has the largest Hispanic population (14.7 million).\n\n\u25a0 Texas, second-largest state by Hispanic population, saw the greatest numerical increase in Hispanics from 2012 to 2013, growing by 213,000.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "President\u2019s move to grant amnesty to 5 million immigrants delights Hispanics at rally in Las Vegas, writes Rory Carroll", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Rory Carroll", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "President\u2019s move to grant amnesty to 5 million immigrants delights Hispanics at rally in Las Vegas, writes Rory Carroll", "title": "Obama has shown courage to stand with us, say America\u2019s joyful Latinos", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/22/obama-wins-over-latinos-with-immigration-reform", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/11/22/1416661530611/Barack-Obama-010.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=4c603e0f40448ec4176625546725f8c4", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/22/obama-wins-over-latinos-with-immigration-reform?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/22/obama-wins-over-latinos-with-immigration-reform", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/22/obama-wins-over-latinos-with-immigration-reform?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@rorycarroll72", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/11/22/1416661530611/Barack-Obama-010.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2014/nov/22/obama-wins-over-latinos-with-immigration-reform?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Barack Obama,US immigration,Democrats,Republicans,US elections 2016,US news,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2014-11-22T15:45:36.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rorycarroll", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T14:23:08.000Z", "tag": "Barack Obama,US immigration,Democrats,Republicans,US elections 2016,US news,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/11/22/1416661530611/Barack-Obama-010.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6622e1735af51ed9cc4e9b2464776c54", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,US immigration,Democrats,Republicans,US elections 2016,US news,World news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cf3\"", "article_summary": "But, more prosaically, the scenes on both sides of the highway sprinkled optimism on their chances of keeping the White House after Obama.\n\u201cIf you overreact, it becomes about us, not President Obama,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham.\nAnalysts on both sides say it could pave the way for another Democrat in the White House, especially if Republicans fall into the trap of overreacting.\nObama\u2019s executive order, made in an emotional White House address on Thursday and reinforced in Las Vegas, wrested back the initiative, forcing his foes to fight on treacherous terrain.\n\u201cAll they do is take and Obama gives, gives, gives.\u201d Ty Romsa, 54, held a placard comparing Obama to Mussolini."}
