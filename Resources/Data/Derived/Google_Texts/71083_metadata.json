For a year, Carr has been traveling up to 2,000 miles a week, crisscrossing the state to pitch sleepy crowds, slogging along in a quixotic bid to unseat a powerful incumbent. The polls weren\u2019t budging. The money wasn\u2019t coming in.\n\nBut Carr was convinced his primary challenge to Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander was primed to catch fire. The spark may have finally come last month, when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was bounced in a GOP primary by an unknown challenger named Dave Brat. The black swan upset buoyed Carr\u2019s campaign, opening a fresh spigot of cash and prompting comparisons to the Virginia economics professor who was written off by everyone until he toppled Cantor. A poll highlighted in conservative media on Monday showed Alexander\u2019s lead shrinking to just seven points after series of other surveys showed Alexander with a comfortable lead.\n\nNow Carr, a little-known state representative and businessman, says he has a real shot on Aug. 7 to oust Alexander, the courtly senior U.S. senator and a Tennessee institution for the past four decades. \u201cI think it\u2019s very much a 50-50 proposition,\u201d Carr told TIME in a phone interview Tuesday as he traveled to a campaign event in Cleveland, Tenn. As for the comparisons to Brat, he adds, \u201cthere are common threads.\u201d\n\nIndeed there are, beginning with the obstacles. Both were unknown challengers summarily ignored by not only the national media but also national Tea Party groups. Both were massive underdogs against well-known figures with huge campaign war chests.\n\nLike Brat, Carr gathered steam slowly. He won the endorsements of some local Tea Party groups, then gained favor with conservative talk-show hosts. Both hammered the incumbent for supporting \u201camnesty,\u201d an issue with special resonance as the migrant crisis on the southern border escalates. Both caught the attention of Laura Ingraham, the conservative pundit who campaigned for Brat and endorsed Carr on July 14.\n\nNow the dominoes are falling into place for a legitimate challenge, Carr\u2019s allies say. Ingraham will visit Nashville to rally support for Carr next week. \u201cI\u2019m all in for Joe Carr,\u201d she said on her radio show. \u201cHe\u2019s no-nonsense, a citizen legislator.\u201d The Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund gave an endorsement. A local Super PAC chipped in with a six-figure TV ad buy. Carr has a growing ground network, and the yawning gap in the polls is beginning to shrink. \u201cThings are happening at exactly the right time,\u201d said a Carr campaign consultant.\n\nSo can Carr spring the upset?\n\nIt still looks like a long shot. Alexander has a lead in the polls, a massive cash advantage and a savvy campaign that is courting conservatives by accentuating his role in opposing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA former governor and president of the state\u2019s flagship university, he has succumbed to none of the usual traps of incumbency. While he never mentions Carr\u2019s name, Alexander has campaigned like a man at risk, unlike former his colleague Richard Lugar, who lost a 2012 primary in Indiana. He is a ubiquitous presence in Tennessee, thwarting the gripes about absentee representation that soured the base on Cantor. Another Tea Party candidate may also cut into Carr\u2019s support. Throw in the fact that Tennessee\u2019s primary is an open contest that permits crossover voting, and Alexander (whose campaign did not respond to an interview request) just doesn\u2019t look much like a vulnerable candidate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s covering all his bases,\u201d said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who conducted polling on the race. \u201cHe shows no serious weaknesses.\u201d\n\nThen there is the matter of the challenger himself. While Brat\u2019s smooth rhetoric helped him spring an upset, Carr\u2019s candidacy has some rough edges. According to the Memphis Flyer, Carr voiced some support for former Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin\u2019s disastrous comments about rape and pregnancy. Before deciding to challenge Alexander, Carr bailed on a race against Rep. Scott DesJarlais, the embattled Tennessee Republican who opposes abortion except when when it comes to his mistress. And when Carr announced his candidacy last summer, the banner ad on his website urged voters to support \u201cCarr for U.S. Sentate\u201d [sic].\n\nWhich is why Alexander may be less Eric Cantor than Lindsey Graham, another southern Senator whose bouts of bipartisanship make him a target for disaffected conservatives. Graham helped author the Gang of Eight immigration overhaul that Alexander is now catching flak for supporting. And while the Tea Party painted a bulls-eye on his back, Graham went out and pasted his six primary opponents by 40 points.\n\nThat\u2019s how it normally goes for Senate incumbents, who won re-election last cycle at a 91% clip. Beating Alexander will be hard. But Carr is convinced he can do it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great chance to win,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if Joe Carr is the Republican nominee on Aug. 8.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Conservatives have their sights set on Lamar Alexander, but he'll be tough to beat", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Conservatives have their sights set on Lamar Alexander, but he'll be tough to beat", "title": "Meet The Tea Party's Next Target", "url": "http://time.com/2988193/lamar-alexander-joe-carr-tennessee-senate-race/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ap459360073815.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ap459360073815.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Meet The Tea Party's Next Target", "description": "Conservatives have their sights set on Lamar Alexander, but he'll be tough to beat", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "dave brat, eric cantor, joe carr, lamar alexander, tennessee, senate, 2014, midterm elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Dave Brat, Eric Cantor, joe Carr, Lamar Alexander, Tennessee, Senate, 2014, midterm elections"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85b7\"", "article_summary": "Both were unknown challengers summarily ignored by not only the national media but also national Tea Party groups.\nHe won the endorsements of some local Tea Party groups, then gained favor with conservative talk-show hosts.\nAnd when Carr announced his candidacy last summer, the banner ad on his website urged voters to support \u201cCarr for U.S. Sentate\u201d [sic].\n\u201cHe\u2019s no-nonsense, a citizen legislator.\u201d The Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund gave an endorsement.\nAnother Tea Party candidate may also cut into Carr\u2019s support."}
