In 2012, the priority for voters was considered Obamacare and the economy. According to the Washington Times, Republican primary voters now say that national security and terrorism should be the number one priority.

Twenty-seven percent of GOP primary voters said the top priority for the federal government should be addressing national security and terrorism, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The deficit and government spending were No. 2 at 24 percent, followed by job creation and economic growth at 21 percent, religious and moral values at 12 percent, and immigration at 8 percent.

Combining GOP voters’ first and second choices, national security and terrorism still won out with 53 percent, with the deficit/government spending and job creation/economic growth at 42 percent apiece, immigration at 26 percent, religious and moral values at 17 percent, and health care at 13 percent.

GOP presidential hopefuls with Capitol Hill experience like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania have been touting their foreign policy credentials and say such experience will be needed for a Republican presidential candidate to go toe-to-toe with Democrats’ likely nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Among all adults, the top three first-choice priorities were job creation/economic growth at 29 percent, national security and terrorism at 21 percent, and the deficit and government spending at 17 percent.

Among Democratic primary voters, the first-choice top issues were job creation/economic growth at 37 percent, health care at 17 percent, climate change at 15 percent and national security/terrorism at 13 percent.
