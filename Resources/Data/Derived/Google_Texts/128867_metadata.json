Scott Smiley defied all odds last Sunday when he became the first blind veteran to successfully complete an Ironman.\n\nThe race in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, took place during record-breaking temperatures, causing 188 competitors to drop out of the contest.\n\nIt takes much more than a hot day to deter Smiley.\n\n\"Let's do this, Major!\" Heard from the crowd as Army Major (Retired) Scotty Smiley took off on the bike. #HopeUnseen pic.twitter.com/vXhGB4Y4ZG \u2014 GleasonIronman (@GleasonIronman) June 28, 2015\n\nWith the help of his brother-in-law Andy Cooper as his partner and guide, Smiley completed the 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run, accomplishing one of his life\u2019s loftiest goals to date.\n\nHow did the 35-year-old veteran find the strength to finish the race after 16 hours of effort? He looked to his family for strength. His wife Tiffany even rode her bike alongside Smiley and Cooper for half of the marathon.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing to hear them as I transitioned from the bike to the run\u2014throughout the run just screaming my name,\u201d Smiley told People. \u201cAnd then to be there to give my wife and my boys a hug, it was a great feeling.\u201d\n\nBlind and Inspired by the touch of his wife and children, Scotty Smiley Finishes #IMCDA @maybellandgrace @HopeUnseen pic.twitter.com/J5D5Z68wSE \u2014 Maybell and Grace (@maybellandgrace) July 1, 2015\n\nTiffany has always been Smiley\u2019s biggest supporter, but there was a time when even she did not think this day would be within reach.\n\nIn April of 2005, Smiley was badly wounded by a suicide car bomb while leading a platoon in northern Iraq. The attack left him blind and partially paralyzed by shrapnel on the right side of his body.\n\nThe injury devastated the Spokane, Wash., family, plunging Smiley into a deep depression. \u201cHow was I going to take care of my wife, the woman that I love, if I could not even take care of myself?\u201d Smiley asked himself in an interview with KENS5 Eyewitness News.\n\nEven Tiffany was beginning to lose faith and give up on the couple\u2019s dreams, especially any hope of starting a family.\n\nOne day, she had a change of heart.\n\n\u201cI could let my mind go that way and say we are ruined and we are not going to be able to do anything,\u201d Tiffany told KENS5 Eyewitness News. \u201cOr I could go the other way and just be his biggest cheerleader. And I just sort of took that on, even if I didn\u2019t believe it myself.\u201d\n\nSmiley found a renewed determination through his faith and his family. \u201cIt was just through prayer, my family\u2019s support and God\u2019s love and grace that I started moving my right hand and moving my right foot,\u201d he told People.\n\nSince overcoming his physical limitations, Smiley has become the United States Army\u2019s first blind active-duty officer, earned an MBA from Duke University, taught leadership at West Point and has become a loving father to three little boys.\n\nHe is also a world-class athlete and adventurer. Smiley has climbed Mount Rainier, learned to surf, gone skydiving and won an ESPY award from ESPN as Best Outdoor Athlete. Becoming an ironman is merely another physical feat in his long list of amazing undertakings.\n\n16 hours 51 minutes of courage. 2 of the toughest guys on the planet. #HopeUnseen #IMCDA pic.twitter.com/r3jrmaHsQ1 \u2014 GleasonIronman (@GleasonIronman) June 29, 2015\n\nThroughout his fun and action-packed life, Smiley never forgets why he perseveres.\n\n\u201cAt my lowest point, my wife said, \u2018You know, Scotty, you\u2019re not doing this for yourself, you\u2019re doing this for those who can\u2019t be here,'\u201d Smiley told People. \u201cAnd it really just inspired me to look past my own pain and misery and realize, \u2018You\u2019re doing this for a higher calling, you\u2019re doing this for something more than just yourself.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "You'll be inspired.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You'll be inspired.", "title": "This Blind Veteran Overcame All Odds to Complete Ironman", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Ironman-Feature-Edit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T16:07:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NzEiue"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You'll be inspired.", "title": "This Blind Veteran Overcame All Odds to Complete Ironman", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Ironman-Feature-Edit.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "military", "published_time": "2015-07-02T15:38:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T16:07:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "veteran, ironman, blind, marathon, adventure"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAnd it really just inspired me to look past my own pain and misery and realize, \u2018You\u2019re doing this for a higher calling, you\u2019re doing this for something more than just yourself.\u2019\u201d\nRetired Army Maj.
