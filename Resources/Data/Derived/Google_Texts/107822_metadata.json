Republican presidential hopefuls have called for rolling back much of what Obama has done, while Hillary Clinton and the other Democrats want to go further.\n\nThe latest expansions came in the $1.8 trillion budget deal that Congress approved last month, which made permanent hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for low- and moderate-income families and boosted aid for college students.\n\nThe tax credits have received much less public attention than other social-welfare spending, including the Affordable Care Act, but they have become the government\u2019s largest cash-assistance program to fight poverty, with more than 40 million people receiving benefits each year.\n\nThe assistance was broadened on a temporary basis, mostly in Obama\u2019s first year. Making that expansion permanent will help at least 16 million people, according to estimates from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington think tank.\n\nThat \u201cwould rank among the biggest anti-poverty achievements, outside of health reform, in years,\u201d said Robert Greenstein, the center\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe expanded aid for low-income Americans reflects Obama\u2019s belief in leveraging government power to combat income inequality, which he has called \u201cthe defining challenge of our time.\u201d Even with the expanded aid, the U.S. tax system provides far more benefits to wealthy Americans than it does to the poor, a point frequently cited by liberals.\n\nObama\u2019s ability to lock in and even expand his social programs despite Republican congressional majorities has fueled a fury among conservative voters that many direct against the GOP leadership, whom they accuse of repeatedly surrendering to the White House.\n\nAfter the budget deal, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was forced to defend himself against such critics. \u201cWe fought for as much as we could get,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to pick up next year \u2026 and keep going for more.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans\u2019 2016 budget blueprint \u2014 which provides an outline of the party\u2019s governing vision \u2014 proposes hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs for the poor.\n\nMany Republican politicians argue that costly government programs such as those Obama has pushed are stunting economic growth, depressing wages and creating a \u201cculture of dependency.\u201d\n\nThat argument has proved extremely potent, helping deliver historic GOP majorities in Congress and animating the campaigns of many of the 2016 GOP presidential contenders.\n\nBut Republicans have been unable to use their majorities to reverse the growth in social programs, as the year-end budget deal underscored.\n\nIn addition to the tax benefits for low-income families, the deal, which gained support from majorities of Democrats and Republicans, also boosted federal aid for low- and middle-income college students through increased grants and tax breaks.\n\nMoreover, it protected the core of the president\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act, although it delayed three taxes included in the law.\n\n\u201cThat seems like a pretty worthwhile trade-off,\u201d said former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., a onetime mentor who helped Obama chart his health care agenda after he was first elected.\n\nThe 2010 health care law has extended government-subsidized health coverage to millions of poor and working-class Americans in the last two years.\n\nTo many Republicans, the failure to repeal it marks the most notable lapse by the GOP leadership. Today, as the law\u2019s coverage expansion enters its third year, close to 20 million low- and moderate-income Americans rely on health insurance provided through the law, including state Medicaid programs for the poor and subsidized commercial insurance available on HealthCare.gov and other government-run insurance marketplaces.\n\nThat expansion has driven a historic decline in the nation\u2019s uninsured rate, dropping the share of adults without insurance from 18 percent at the end of 2013 to 11.6 percent in the third quarter of this year, according to national surveys from Gallup.\n\nThe number could continue to fall as additional conservative states, including Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming, look for ways to expand their Medicaid programs in 2016, following the 30 states that already have used the law to broaden coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Despite Republican majorities in Congress through much of his tenure and increasingly insistent calls from GOP presidential candidates to rein in \u201cfree stuff,\u201d President Barack Obama has engineered the largest expansion of the federal government\u2019s safety net in half a century, a record he cemented further as he closed out his seventh year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Noam N.
