The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was identified as a primary driver of slow job growth and increased part-time employment in 90 recorded segments concerning the economy. More than three-quarters -- 69 -- of those segments came from Fox News, which has invested considerable time and attention to attacking President Obama's signature health care law.\n\nThe claim that ACA has a negative effect on the job market has been addressed and debunked by independent economists, but the myth persists as a talking point in the media. At Fox, the myth is a central theme of economic discussions.\n\nMeanwhile, the negative effect of spending cuts on reducing economic growth and labor market demand went relatively unmentioned in the media. Only 37 recorded segments concerning the economy mentioned the harmful impact of spending cuts, the majority of which -- 27 -- came from MSNBC.\n\nEconomists agree that the austerity measures enacted over the past several years have dragged down economic growth. Nobel Prize-winning economists Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz have written and commented about the effect of depressed spending at length, as have many others. However, cable and broadcast news coverage of the economy consistently ignore the views of economists in favor of discussions centered around optics and political horse races. Only 3 percent of featured guests in these segments during the past three months have been professional economists.\n\nThe lack of serious discussions of economic policy, in favor of politically driven talking points, has had a tangible effect on the economy and government. The vitriol directed at health care reform from the right-wing reached its peak on October 1 when House Republicans, emboldened by supportive media, opted to shut down the government rather than concede their demand that Democrats dismantle the ACA in exchange for a temporary extension of current spending.\n\nThe ACA was signed into effect on March 23, 2010, and has been subject to constant media scrutiny for more than three years. Calls to have the law repealed, or to have significant portions delayed, have been pushed by right-wing outlets for the past several months in preparation for the start of enrollment for state-based exchanges on October 1.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "Cable and broadcast television outlets, driven largely by Fox News, promoted the myth that the Affordable Care Act is forcing employees into part-time work and killing full-time jobs, while ignoring serious discussions of the labor market and the effect of policy proposals on job growth.\nMedia Matters&nbsp;research, which looked at economic news co", "title": "Labor Market Coverage Dominated By Right-Wing Obamacare Myth", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/10/02/labor-market-coverage-dominated-by-right-wing-o/196230", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/images/item/Q3-ocare.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-02T14:51:09-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/10/02/labor-market-coverage-dominated-by-right-wing-o/196230", "title": "Labor Market Coverage Dominated By Right-Wing Obamacare Myth", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "CNN", "published_time": "2013-10-02T14:51:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-02T14:28:37-04:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/craig-harrington/224"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ca5\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the negative effect of spending cuts on reducing economic growth and labor market demand went relatively unmentioned in the media.\nMedia Matters research, which looked at economic news coverage over the past three months, revealed an overwhelming bias in news coverage of the effects of health care reform on the American job market.\nThe claim that ACA has a negative effect on the job market has been addressed and debunked by independent economists, but the myth persists as a talking point in the media.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) was identified as a primary driver of slow job growth and increased part-time employment in 90 recorded segments concerning the economy.\nThe ACA was signed into effect on March 23, 2010, and has been subject to constant media scrutiny for more than three years."}
