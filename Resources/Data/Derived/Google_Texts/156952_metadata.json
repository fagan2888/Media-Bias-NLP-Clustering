That was ten years ago.\n\nToday\u2019s optimism is reported in the recently released Wells Fargo Construction Industry Forecast 2015.\n\nOf course this time, as economists like to say, it\u2019s different. The last recession was sparked by a massive, mortgage based credit bubble. And this time, there aren\u2019t enough houses being sold or mortgages being made to come anywhere near a bubble.\n\nBut otherwise, the economy, in terms of Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201cOptimism Quotient,\u201d looks strong\u2014historic, in fact, at 130. The next best score, 109, was reached in 2005. A score of 100 is generally considered good. Below 100 signals concerns.\n\nIt is interesting to note that contractor\u2019s confidence began to creep downward after 2005, from 102 the following year to 86 and 80 in 2007 and 2008 when the recession officially began. From 2008 to 2009, contractor optimism plummeted from 80 to 42, an all-time low. This might lead one to believe that contractor sentiment is a leading indicator of the economy in general.\n\nSome highlights (you can download the entire report here). When asked what factors create the greatest opportunity for growth in the construction industry today, contractors listed the following:\n\n60 percent\u2013improving national economic situation\n\n48 percent\u2013increased consumer confidence\n\n38 percent\u2013improving local economic situation\n\n31 percent\u2013 stable regulatory environment\n\n26 percent\u2013the residential construction market\n\nThe report also found that 70 percent of the contractors said they would increase equipment acquisition in 2015, compared to just 34 percent in 2014. And this year 62 percent of contractor respondents said they expected to increase equipment rentals compared with just 37 percent last year.\n\nThe biggest concerns contractors listed include:\n\n67 percent\u2013political/regulatory environment\n\n67 percent\u2013national economic uncertainty\n\n37 percent\u2013local economic uncertainty\n\n27 percent\u2013rising interest rates\n\n24 percent\u2013Tier 4 emission standards\n\nOf the political issues that dominate concerns 72 percent listed tax incentives such as the bonus depreciation deductions, 62 percent said the highway funding bill and 47 percent named the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nUnless the doomsayers like David Stockman turn out to be right, the economy looks to be on a winning streak for some time. Most of the major banks and economists have predicted growth rates for this year at anywhere from two to three percent or a little better.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Construction, construction industry, construction industry 2015, construction optimism, construction optimism quotient, contractor optimism, Wells Fargo 2015 Industry Forecast, Wells Fargo Construction Industry Forecast, Wells Fargo Construction Industry Forecast 2015", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "NextGEN": "1.4.3", "bt": {"author": "Tom Jackson", "type": "equipment", "id": 90920, "pubDate": "2015-09-03T7:07:52", "modDate": "2015-10-03T7:07:52"}, "keywords": "construction,construction industry,construction industry 2015,construction optimism,construction optimism quotient,contractor optimism,wells fargo 2015 industry forecast,wells fargo construction industry forecast,wells fargo construction industry forecast 2015", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "From 2008 to 2009, contractor optimism plummeted from 80 to 42, an all-time low.\nToday\u2019s optimism is reported in the recently released Wells Fargo Construction Industry Forecast 2015.\nBut otherwise, the economy, in terms of Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201cOptimism Quotient,\u201d looks strong\u2014historic, in fact, at 130.\nThis might lead one to believe that contractor sentiment is a leading indicator of the economy in general.\nThe last time contractors were this optimistic, the economy tanked and went into the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression."}
