For readers that never tuned in, (looking at you, President Obama) Red Eye was a big ole middle finger to the omnipresent panel-with-pundits programming that continues to litter the cablesphere. The table talk would cover everything from Al Qaeda, to Obamacare to the latest kitten YouTube video with the kind of gravitas rarely seen in a Steve Kroft sext. And the best convos would involve a mix of regulars that included, but weren\u2019t limited to, current congressmen, presidential contenders, White House press secretaries, former CIA operatives, Avenue Q puppets, Mexican wrestlers, transvestite actresses and\u2026Oderus Urungus, (R.I.P.).\n\nI know all of this because, for the first seven years, I was the co-host. Which basically entailed voicing an anthropomorphic broadsheet made to look like the paper of record (our New York Times correspondent was, well, the actual New York Times), physically harmful Man On The Streets, and being constantly referred to as either a \u201crepulsive sidekick\u201d or\u2014which my mom loved\u2014a \u201csequential hermaphrodite.\u201d\n\nAndy Levy was our libertarian ombudsman who\u2019d correct what we got wrong midway through the hour, Greg was the conservative host, and yours truly as the goofy liberal/possible heroin addict.\n\nIt was messy, it was nonsensical and it had no business being on the Most Powerful Name In News\u2122. But, thanks to our meth-friendly time slot (3 a.m., EST), the powers that be sort of forgot about us and we had trial-by-fire time to actually learn as we haphazardly went. And it started to kinda flourish! All thanks to a super devoted fan base, and the fact that our inaugural guests rightly assumed they could go out and get loaded with us after the show wrapped.\n\nIt was also, in its own little way, the most fair and balanced bit of programming on the channel.\n\nI\u2019d known Greg since 2000. He was my editor-in-chief at Stuff magazine (R.I.P., part two) and he claims\u2014although I still don\u2019t remember this\u2014that I introduced myself at his welcoming party as the \u201cfirst editor you\u2019ll fire.\u201d He didn\u2019t. He actually ended up teaching me a lot.\n\nAnd if my copy wasn\u2019t up to snuff? Best believe GG\u2019s edit would involve \u201cTHIS WOULD BE GOOD IF IT WAS FUNNY AND WELL-WRITTEN, ASSHOLE\u201d as constructive criticism. It was kicker-writing boot camp and, in hindsight, it was exactly what I needed.\n\nFour years, and many HR warnings later, Greg was in London editing Maxim U.K. and making a name for himself, via various satellite appearances, at FOX News as a conservative guest that was actually funny. NewsCorp. brass eventually approached him about helming a late, late night unscripted free-for-all while they focused on their real priority: a big budget conservative answer to The Daily Show titled\u2026 The Half Hour News Hour.\n\nI know, right?\n\n(I don\u2019t really remember it either.)\n\nBut with the higher-ups\u2019 eyes on that festering little turd of a TV show, Greg could pretty much do what he wanted, and hire accordingly.\n\nSo when he called me to see if I wanted to be on staff for this crapshoot, my first question was: \u201cDid you already hire a former Director\u2019s Guild Of America executive that leaves pithy comments on your HuffPo columns?\u201d Thankfully, he had indeed snagged one Andy Levy.\n\nMy second question: \u201cDo you like nice things and having fun?\u201d (Okay. I didn\u2019t have a second question. Obviously, I was already in.)\n\nNow, to say Greg and I always got along would be like saying Brian Williams is a Purple Heart winner. Indeed, I was off the show as of November 2013, for reasons so undisclosed that I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m allowed to write the word \u201cundisclosed\u201d.\n\nUpside? Gutfeld tolerated me way longer than Simon did Garfunkel.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Fox News Channel, television, media, U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201502280300, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Fox News Channel, Television, media, US News", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Guy Behind the Guy Behind 'Red Eye' Looks Back", "tags": "entity:publishedmedium/fox_news_channel,entity:product/television,topic:media,topic:us-news", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "A former FOX News correspondent/\u201drepulsive sidekick\u201d weighs in on his old boss leaving his old show.", "title": "The Guy Behind the Guy Behind 'Red Eye' Looks Back", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/27/the-guy-behind-the-guy-behind-red-eye-fox-news-one-attempt-at-funny.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/27/the-guy-behind-the-guy-behind-red-eye-fox-news-one-attempt-at-funny/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1425130743605.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "A former FOX News correspondent/\u201drepulsive sidekick\u201d weighs in on his old boss leaving his old show.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Bill Schulz", "article": {"section": "us-news", "published_time": "2015-02-28T03:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/bill-schulzhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/27/the-guy-behind-the-guy-behind-red-eye-fox-news-one-attempt-at-funny", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Guy Behind the Guy Behind \\\\u0027Red Eye\\\\u0027 Looks Back\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/27/the-guy-behind-the-guy-behind-red-eye-fox-news-one-attempt-at-funny.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/27/the-guy-behind-the-guy-behind-red-eye-fox-news-one-attempt-at-funny/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47504358.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/27/the-guy-behind-the-guy-behind-red-eye-fox-news-one-attempt-at-funny\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-28T03:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Bill Schulz\",\"tags\":[\"fox_news_channel\",\"television\",\"media\",\"us-news\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/bill-schulz", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0747\"", "article_summary": "On Thursday, FOX News announced that Greg Gutfeld would be leaving Red Eye to develop a one-hour weekend program.\nFor readers that never tuned in, (looking at you, President Obama) Red Eye was a big ole middle finger to the omnipresent panel-with-pundits programming that continues to litter the cablesphere.\nNow, to say Greg and I always got along would be like saying Brian Williams is a Purple Heart winner.\nIt was messy, it was nonsensical and it had no business being on the Most Powerful Name In News\u2122.\nIt was also, in its own little way, the most fair and balanced bit of programming on the channel."}
