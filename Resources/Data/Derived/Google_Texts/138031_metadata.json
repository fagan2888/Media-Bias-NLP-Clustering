We also delve into the controversy over a recent New York Times column by former executive editor, Bill Keller.\n\nKeller questioned the value of tweets and blogging by a cancer patient named Lisa Bonchek Adams, who writes about her journey through cancer, attracting thousands of followers along the way, many who find comfort in her words. Keller seemed to prefer a more stoic and silent approach to life-threatening disease. We explore the friction between those in traditional publishing and the bloggers and tweeters who chafe at established rules.\n\nWe switch gears with Linda to talk about a new ESPN documentary that revisits the sage between U.S. figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, a feud that polarized the nation during the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillihammer, Norway.\n\nFrom there we move on to Dave Zirin, an iconoclastic sportswriter for The Nation, who has a way of framing the national reaction to the excitable Seattle Seahawk cornerback, Richard Sherman. We take a deeper look with him.\n\nAt the end, a game from your childhood that's still being played by adults. Since we're on football, let's hear it for miniature football , a form of the sport that focuses on amity instead of abuse.\n\nLeave your comments below, email us at colin@wnpr.org, or tweet us at wnprcolin.\n\nGUESTS:\n\nLinda Holmes writes and edits NPR's entertainment and pop-culture blog, Monkey See\n\nwrites and edits NPR's entertainment and pop-culture blog, Monkey See Vance Warren is on the Board of Directors for the Miniature Football Coaches Association\n\nis on the Board of Directors for the Miniature Football Coaches Association Dave Zurin is the sports editor for The Nation", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "Through no act of overarching planning, all three of our segments today will deal directly, or otherwise, with sports.
