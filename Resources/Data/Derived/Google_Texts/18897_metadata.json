(Times Staff / JULIA WILKINSON)\n\nA trail of cameraman, photographers and reporters followed Tom Wolf in and out of several Chester Upland classrooms last week, shuffling to capture every move the Democratic gubernatorial candidate made.\n\nWolf \u0097 the race frontrunner, according to various polls \u0097 was making his second Delaware County campaign event in less than a week, having previously stopped in Media to accept the endorsement of Planned Parenthood. The appearances were Wolf\u0092s first publicized county visits since he overwhelmingly captured the Democratic nomination in May.\n\nHis opponent, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, has made regular visits to Delaware County since his re-election efforts heated up last winter.\n\nExpect both candidates to reappear in Delaware County before the Nov. 4 general election, perhaps multiple times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFairing well, if not winning, the four suburban Philadelphia counties is essential to any gubernatorial candidate. Three of them rank among the state\u0092s five most populated counties. The fourth \u0097 Chester County \u0097 ranks seventh.\n\nWhether the Philadelphia suburbs play a critical role this year remains to be seen. Wolf holds a double-digit advantage in the polls; the closest shows him leading by 11 points. Others have him up by nearly 25 points, prompting some to wonder whether Corbett still holds a viable chance to win.\n\n\u0093When you\u0092re that far down, you need to hit a home run in every corner of the state,\u0094 said Tim Malloy, a pollster for the Quinnipiac University poll, which has Wolf up by 24 points. Corbett is \u0093just in a deep, deep hole with not much time.\u0094\n\nCorbett won the Philadelphia suburban counties by 23,626 votes in 2010, despite losing Delaware and Montgomery counties. It marked the first time in at least two decades that Delco did not support the winning candidate. Yet, Corbett lost just four counties on the way to a 9-point win against Dan Onorato.\n\nThe polling numbers suggest a different outcome this time. The latest Franklin & Marshall College poll, released in late August, showed Wolf winning in each of its seven regional breakdowns, including by a 31-point margin in the Philadelphia suburban counties.\n\nCorbett campaign manager Mike Barley acknowledged the need for Corbett to do well in the Philadelphia suburbs, but said the governor does not necessarily need to win them. Instead, he stressed the importance of voter turnout, both in Delaware County and Republican strongholds across the state.\n\n\u0093Clearly, you can get caught up looking at different counties,\u0094 Barley said. \u0093If you\u0092re not doing well in one county, you need another county to outperform. It\u0092s a matter of trying to offset votes.\n\n\u0093It comes down to turnout. Can we turn out voters and can they turn out their voters?\u0094\n\nAcross the state, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 1 million voters. Democrats also hold the advantage in Delco, but local Republicans are quick to note they have more active voters.\n\nBarley said turnout in heavily Democratic Philadelphia could play a big factor in the race. The higher the turnout there, the more votes Republicans need to make up across the state. But Barley also noted Democrats are notorious for staying home during midterm elections and praised the state GOP for its organization.\n\n\u0093This race is close,\u0094 Barley said. \u0093Do I believe we\u0092re winning at the moment? No. Do I believe we\u0092re going to win at Election Day? Yes.\u0094\n\nCorbett has spent considerable time in Delaware County, having made 10 visits since January as part of his campaign or in his official capacity. Wolf has made three campaign stops.\n\n\u0093Obviously, Corbett is here more often because it\u0092s desperation,\u0094 said David Landau, chairman of the Delaware County Democratic Party. \u0093If he can\u0092t make any inroads here, he has no prayer of winning.\u0094\n\nDelaware County GOP chairman Andy Reilly countered, claiming Wolf is taking Delco voters for granted.\n\n\u0093To me, it\u0092s Tom Wolf taking the voters of Delaware County for granted,\u0094 Reilly said. \u0093I think it\u0092s a risky play.\u0094\n\nWolf campaign spokesman Jeffrey Sheridan said the campaign does not form its strategy based on where Corbett appears. He heralded the support Wolf received in both Philadelphia and its suburbs during the primary, saying Democrats share much excitement for Wolf.\n\n\u0093Gov. Corbett \u0097 his schedule doesn\u0092t dictate ours in any way,\u0094 Sheridan said. \u0093Our strategy has not changed throughout this election. It\u0092s Tom getting out to meet with businesses and families and workers and talking with them, whether it\u0092s on the factory floor or a plant somewhere.\u0094\n\nSheridan also praised the work of Katie McGinty and her Campaign for a Fresh Start, which has traversed the state blasting Corbett for underfunding schools while refusing to tax natural gas drillers.\n\nDuring his Delco visits, Corbett has attempted to reclaim the education narrative, repeatedly noting the 2011 state education cuts resulted from the loss of federal funding. He also has tied property tax increases to the state\u0092s ballooning pension costs.\n\nWhether those messages resonate by Nov. 4 remains to be seen.\n\nMatthew Kerbel, chairman of the Villanova University Department of Political Science, said voters have had four years to settle their opinion on Corbett. As an incumbent, Corbett has little room to grow.\n\n\u0093The danger is you reach a point where voters just stop listening to you,\u0094 Kerbel said. \u0093They made up their minds and they tune you out.\u0094\n\nKerbel said he was unsure whether voters have reached that point, but he was pessimistic about Corbett\u0092s chances.\n\n\u0093The numbers aren\u0092t moving and they haven\u0092t moved in a very long time,\u0094 Kerbel said. \u0093Nothing seems to be resonating.\u0094\n\nDespite his frequent Delco appearances, Corbett has done most of his campaigning alone. Only local Republicans in safely held seats have appeared next to him. Local Democrats have been quick to tie their opponents to Corbett in any way possible.\n\nTerry Madonna, a pollster at Franklin & Marshall College, said that is typical of races in which the candidate at the top of the ticket is struggling.\n\n\u0093They\u0092re never a team when the head of the ticket isn\u0092t doing well,\u0094 Madonna said. \u0093They don\u0092t know what team means in that case.\u0094\n\nBarley said the lack of dual campaigning was a \u0093matter of scheduling,\u0094 saying the Corbett campaign notifies the local GOP of its events. Reilly agreed, saying Republicans like state Senate candidate Tom McGarrigle often have their own campaign obligations established by the time they are notified.\n\nAsked whether it would be detrimental for McGarrigle to appear alongside Corbett, McGarrigle campaign chairman Michael Puppio pointed to the county\u0092s history of ticket-splitting.\n\n\u0093I don\u0092t believe this election will be any different,\u0094 Puppio said. \u0093Our voters are sophisticated enough to make decisions on each and every candidate.\u0094\n\nBy contrast, several Democratic candidates appeared alongside Wolf at his Media appearance, including John Kane, McGarrigle\u0092s opponent for the open seat in the 26th Senatorial District.\n\nYet, James Hedtke, a history and political science professor at Cabrini College, wondered whether Wolf will generate many coattails, in part because he does not have the patronage following of a typical politician. Democrats also have made the election more of an anti-Corbett vote than an anti-Republican vote, he said.\n\n\u0093That is not being driven home by the Democrats and I think that is a big mistake,\u0094 Hedtke said. \u0093I think that\u0092s going to hurt the Democrats at the local level.\u0094\n\nKane spokesman Aren Platt acknowledged that a strong top of the ticket does not necessarily trickle down to the local races. But he said Democrats remain excited by the political climate, saying local candidates have an opportunity to show voters that they share the same anger toward Harrisburg.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s more like blocking in football,\u0094 Platt said. \u0093Some of the defenders have been moved away and there\u0092s a path. But we all have to get there on our own.\u0094\n\nThe political climate is much different than in 2010, when tea party conservatives and anger toward Obamacare sparked a nationwide Republican wave, Madonna said. Now, people are upset about education.\n\nNo Pennsylvania governor has overcome the polling deficit Corbett faces. No governor has lost his re-election bid, either.\n\n\u0093As I like to say,\u0094 Madonna said, \u0093He\u0092s going to make history either way.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Primos Politics news, PA Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "County poised for big role in governor\u0092s race", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140921/NEWS/140929944", "image": {"width": "640px", "identifier": "http://www.delcotimes.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DC/20140921/NEWS/140929944/AR/0/AR-140929944.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "469px"}, "type": "article", "title": "County poised for big role in governor\u0092s race"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "A trail of cameraman, photographers and reporters followed Tom Wolf in and out of several Chester Upland classrooms last week, shuffling to capture every move the Democratic gubernatorial candidate made.", "title": "County poised for big role in governor\u0092s race", "url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140921/NEWS/140929944", "image": {"src": "http://www.delcotimes.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DC/20140921/NEWS/140929944/AR/0/AR-140929944.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@delcotimes", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563336340", "iphone": "id508962453", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.thedelawarecountydailytime"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Primos Politics news, PA Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A trail of cameraman, photographers and reporters followed Tom Wolf in and out of several Chester Upland classrooms last week, shuffling to capture every move the Democratic gubernatorial candidate made."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9005\"", "article_summary": "Expect both candidates to reappear in Delaware County before the Nov. 4 general election, perhaps multiple times.\nInstead, he stressed the importance of voter turnout, both in Delaware County and Republican strongholds across the state.\nTom Corbett, has made regular visits to Delaware County since his re-election efforts heated up last winter.\n\u0093Obviously, Corbett is here more often because it\u0092s desperation,\u0094 said David Landau, chairman of the Delaware County Democratic Party.\nWolf \u0097 the race frontrunner, according to various polls \u0097 was making his second Delaware County campaign event in less than a week, having previously stopped in Media to accept the endorsement of Planned Parenthood."}
