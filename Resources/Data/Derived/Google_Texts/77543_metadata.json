Nearly 10,000 cases have been reported in the state so far this year, and babies are especially prone to hospitalization or even death.\n\nSix out of 10 infants who have become ill during the current outbreak are Latino. Evidence explaining this is inconclusive, but experts have a few theories that range from a lack of Spanish language outreach to Latino cultural practices.\n\n\u201cHispanics have larger household sizes and there may be cultural practices around visiting new infants that increase the number of contacts,\u201d says Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of California\u2019s department of public health.\n\nBabies cannot get their first dose of the vaccine until they are two months old. Some adults may be infected and not know it. The more siblings and extended family members that babies live or visit with, the more exposure they may have to whooping cough.\n\n\u201cAunts, uncles, grandparents who may not have had a booster shot. They may be passing it on that way,\u201d says Michael Rodriguez, a family physician at UCLA.\n\nHowever, he points out that several other ethnic groups have large family sizes or live together because financial resources are limited. These factors alone cannot explain why Latino babies are disproportionately impacted.\n\n\u201cIt really speaks to the lack of access to health insurance that\u2019s particularly predominant within the Latino community,\u201d says Sarah de Guia, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, an advocacy group.\n\nLatinos make up 62 percent of the uninsured, she says, either because they cannot afford to pay for health insurance, or because they are afraid that signing up for coverage will expose family members who are not lawfully present in the U.S. Many undocumented parents are afraid they will be discovered and deported if they enroll their children, who are legal immigrants or citizens, into government coverage, like Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the primary reason why people are not getting the preventive care that they need,\u201d she says \u2013- like whooping cough vaccinations. \u201cAnd then that impacts everyone.\u201d\n\nPublic health officials attribute the ongoing epidemic to several factors.\n\nWhooping cough is cyclical in nature and tends to peak every three to five years. The last outbreak of the disease in California was in 2010.\n\nBut doctors are discovering that immunity from the current vaccine may be wearing off on a similar timeline. Medical recommendations suggest booster shots after eight years, but doctors are seeing kids who received a booster three years ago getting sick. Public health officials are currently considering an update to the recommendations to account for the dip in immunity after three years.\n\nCompounding the problem of the vaccine is the fact that many kids in some areas are not getting vaccinated at all. The highest rates of whooping cough are found in the Bay Area counties of Sonoma, Napa, and Marin, which also have some of the highest rates of parents who opt-out of vaccinating their children.\n\nDoctors believe these kids are the root of the current and recent epidemics.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of unvaccinated children that acted as the kindling to start an outbreak,\u201d said Dr. Paul Katz, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael. \u201cThose children were able to infect all the other children who were vaccinated but were too early for a booster \u2013- they became the rest of the wood to start the fire.\u201d\n\nAll of these factors combine to put babies at risk, especially babies who are not old enough to be vaccinated.\n\nAnd if Latino children and adults do not have health coverage, they are less likely to be visiting the doctor regularly and getting their booster shots, says Rodriguez.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s public health department has done some outreach to encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated in the third trimester, in order to pass immunity on to the fetus. But little outreach has been done in Spanish, and most materials are distributed directly to doctors\u2019 offices \u2013- materials Latinos won\u2019t see if they don\u2019t have insurance and aren\u2019t going to the doctor.\n\nAdvocate Sarah de Guia says more work needs to be done so pregnant women \u2013- and adults -\u2013 in Latino communities know they need to renew their vaccinations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for public officials to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate outreach to make sure people are getting the message in their language, and in a way they will understand,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six out of 10 infants who have become ill during the current whooping cough epidemic are Latino.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Whooping Cough Infections Unusually High Among Latino Babies\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/12\\/18\\/whooping-cough-infections-unusually-high-among-latino-babies\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-18 00:03:12\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-12-18 11:28:52\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23054,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Latino Health\",\"Vaccine\",\"Whooping Cough\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/12\\/6358613209_ee1a0662ef_o2-e1418860428207.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Six out of 10 infants who have become ill during the current whooping cough epidemic are Latino.", "title": "Whooping Cough Infections Unusually High Among Latino Babies", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/12/18/whooping-cough-infections-unusually-high-among-latino-babies/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/12/6358613209_ee1a0662ef_o2-640x440.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "latino health,vaccine,whooping cough", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By April DemboskyPublic health officials are trying to understand why Latino babies are contracting whooping cough at much higher rates than other babies.\nThe more siblings and extended family members that babies live or visit with, the more exposure they may have to whooping cough.\nWhooping cough is cyclical in nature and tends to peak every three to five years.\nCalifornia is battling the worst whooping cough epidemic in 70 years.\nThese factors alone cannot explain why Latino babies are disproportionately impacted."}
