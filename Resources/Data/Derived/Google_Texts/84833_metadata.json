Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz and most of the declared, potential and theoretical GOP presidential field campaigned at Nashua\u2019s First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit on Friday and Saturday. The two-day event was the first gathering of the 2016 field in the crucial primary state.\n\nThe crowd fawned over Cruz and his calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act, abolish the IRS and \u201cdestroy radical Islam,\u201d on Saturday afternoon, as attendees interrupted him with applause and cheers.\n\nCruz also gave a keynote speech at the New Hampshire Young Republicans\u2019 annual convention, attended a fundraising house party and promoted his fierce defense of the Second Amendment in a forum with a New Hampshire hunting and fishing group to cap off the weekend.\n\nIn an hour-long town hall with the Londonderry Fish & Game Club, Cruz told members he\u2019ll continue to push for hearings as to whether soldiers on military bases should be allowed carry their own concealed firearms, according to Politico.\n\nAnd Cruz might have made inroads with libertarians who backed former Texas congressman Ron Paul for president in 2012 but are sheepish about his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. While the younger Paul stresses the GOP\u2019s chronic need to expand, Cruz instead offered \u201cliberty without compromise\u201d to mobilize an army of conservatives, according to Bloomberg Politics. On childhood vaccinations, for instance, he would leave requirements to states \u2014 a stance that could bolster credibility with libertarian-inclined voters.\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke at the summit Friday afternoon and pitched activists on his executive experience, a common theme among the governors seeking to elbow aside the senators in the field.\n\nPerry, who hasn\u2019t formally entered the 2016 race, urged the party to reject another young senator \u2014 a shot at the sitting president and three GOP rivals still serving their first terms in the Senate, Cruz, Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nIt\u2019s a shot that resonates with many voters. When asked which GOP Republican 2016 hopeful had the right kind of experience to be president, 65 percent of respondents chose a governor while 22 percent chose a senator, according to a CNN poll released Monday.\n\nCruz mum on if he\u2019d attend same-sex wedding\n\nThe question of the week for some declared and potential Republican presidential candidates was whether they\u2019d go to a same-sex wedding. Rubio said he would. Former Sen. Rick Santorum said he wouldn\u2019t. Cruz told radio host Hugh Hewitt he\u2019d never been asked and instead of giving a clear yes or no, emphasized that marriage laws should be decided by the states.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments next week on whether state bans on same-sex marriages are constitutional. Cruz has introduced a bill to protect such bans, and with eight Texas congressmen, he filed an advisory brief urging the high court to keep definitions of marriage up to states.\n\nRepublican leadership punts Obamacare repeal despite Cruz\u2019s best efforts\n\nEliminating the Affordable Care Act is one of the linchpins of Cruz\u2019s campaign, and that might only happen if he wins in 2016.\n\nCongressional Republican leadership has given up on a full repeal of the law, which provides more than 20 million Americans with health insurance or Medicare. Instead, GOP senators are mulling potential amendments to Obamacare and stopgaps should the Supreme Court strike down critical parts of it, according to the Los Angeles Times.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNC9jcnV6LXJvdW5kdXAtc3R1bXBpbmctaW4tbmgtZHVja2luZy1oeXBvdGhldGhpY2FsLWludml0ZXMtdG8tc2FtZS1zZXgtd2VkZGluZ3MuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "This is the first in a series of regular news roundups on Sen.
