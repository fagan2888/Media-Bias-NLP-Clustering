The only one confirmed in Colorado, solo wanderer M56, hasn\u2019t emitted a signal since October 2012.\n\nFish and Wildlife director Dan Ashe acknowledged disagreement among federal biologists and, speaking from Aspen in a teleconference with journalists, called his decision complex and challenging.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about whether we believe the climate is changing. We do,\u201d Ashe said.\n\n\u201cWe know too little about the ecology of wolverines. \u2026 We can\u2019t make a reasonable prediction that wolverines will likely be endangered in the immediate future.\u201d\n\nThe federal proposal to protect wolverines was based on beliefs that species needs heavy late-season snow to form dens and that snow may decrease across suitable habitat.\n\n\u201cWe found we had to question this assumption,\u201d Ashe said.\n\nBeyond climate change, federal biologists who conducted the analysis on wolverines \u201creally didn\u2019t see any other significant threats,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the wolverine population is estimated at fewer than 300, that number probably has increased since the mid-19th century and appears at least stable, Ashe said.\n\nThe decision not to list surprised Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials, who were evaluating the new federal posture, state spokesman Matt Robbins said.\n\nColorado high country offers suitable habitat, and the state has been seen as potentially useful for possible efforts to protect wolverines. Federal officials say they will continue to encourage states to reintroduce wolverines.\n\nColorado wildlife commissioners a few years ago asked staffers to launch stakeholder discussions for a state project to help wolverines.\n\nWolverines remain on the state\u2019s list of endangered species, which means they can\u2019t be hunted here.\n\nA lone male wolverine, M56, trekked from Wyoming into Colorado in 2009 with a cigar-size transmitter in his belly. For years, M56 seemed to thrive, roving as far as 100 miles from forests west of Fort Collins across Interstate 70 to the Mosquito Range mountains southeast of Leadville.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s discussions, which included the ski resort industry, fizzled.\n\nWildlife conservation groups decried the federal decision not to protect wolverines as wrong and on Tuesday began building a lawsuit against the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re insisting on a level of certainty that won\u2019t exist until wolverines are extinct,\u201d Earthjustice attorney Tim Preso said.\n\nThe Endangered Species Act \u201crequires this agency to follow the best available science, and in this case the science points in one direction,\u201d Center for Biological Diversity endangered species director Noah Greenwald argued. \u201cThe agency went against its own biologists.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Feds turn away from protecting wolverines as Colorado\u2019s M56 is MIA", "title": "Feds turn away from protecting wolverines as Colorado\u2019s M56 is MIA", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/12/feds-turn-away-from-protecting-wolverines-as-colorados-m56-is-mia/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140812__Wolverinep1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140812__Wolverinep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T10:24:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:13:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Endangered Species Act \u201crequires this agency to follow the best available science, and in this case the science points in one direction,\u201d Center for Biological Diversity endangered species director Noah Greenwald argued.\nWolverines won\u2019t get protection as a threatened species, federal authorities announced Tuesday \u2014 citing scientific uncertainty about precise impacts of climate change.\nColorado high country offers suitable habitat, and the state has been seen as potentially useful for possible efforts to protect wolverines.\nWildlife conservation groups decried the federal decision not to protect wolverines as wrong and on Tuesday began building a lawsuit against the Fish and Wildlife Service.\nWolverines remain on the state\u2019s list of endangered species, which means they can\u2019t be hunted here."}
