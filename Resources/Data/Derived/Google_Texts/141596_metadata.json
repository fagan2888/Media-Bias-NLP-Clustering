She\u2019s filled out 93 applications since losing her job in June but is still struggling to find work. Living in Michigan, which cut its unemployment aid, Sandefur got six fewer weeks of benefits than most jobless Americans\u2014and now her extended federal benefits could end, too. \u201dMy sister only works part-time, my mom\u2019s on Social Security, and we\u2019re barely making a go of it,\u201d says Sandefur, 49, who lives with her relatives in Brant, Michigan.\n\nSince the beginning of the recession, seven states have cut their unemployment benefits to less than 26 weeks\u2014the prevailing standard since the 1950s. So far, emergency federal benefits have cushioned the blow of most of these cuts, kicking in after state benefits expire. But at the end of December, those federal benefits are scheduled to disappear as well, cutting off unemployment checks to 1.3 million jobless Americans and delivering a double whammy to states that have already reduced their benefit weeks to historic lows.\n\nIn addition to the 1.3 million who would lose their benefits immediately, the expiration of federal benefits would affect 3.5 million more jobless Americans by the end of 2014. That\u2019s how many unemployed workers are still expected to be job-hunting after their state benefits expire, according to the Obama administration, which is pressing to continue the emergency federal aid as part of a year-end budget deal.\n\nThe end to federal benefits would deal a particularly sharp blow to jobless Americans in states that have already cut back their own unemployment programs to ease the debt they\u2019ve taken on to pay for them. Michigan has already cut state benefits for unemployed workers like Sandefur down from 26 to 20 weeks. Georgia, Missouri, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, and Arkansas have also cut anywhere between 1 and 14 weeks of state benefits. Some states have also made it harder to qualify for aid and have shrunk their checks as well.\n\nStates haven\u2019t been this stingy toward the jobless since the 1950s.\n\nUp until now, jobless workers everywhere but North Carolina have been able to rely on the federal benefits to make up for their states\u2019 cutbacks. \u201cThe federal extension in place kind of camouflaged what they have done,\u201d says George Wentworth, an attorney at the National Employment Law Project. But now those federal benefits are on the chopping block as well, scheduled to expire December 29 unless Congress decides otherwise.\n\nCongressional Democrats and the Obama administration are trying to stop the unemployment cliff. \u201cThat abrupt transition\u2014one day you have it, one day you don\u2019t\u2014is going to a huge burden. There are people who are out looking for work who are receiving it, and they\u2019re depending upon it,\u201d says Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. During 2012\u2019s fiscal cliff talks, Congressional leaders agreed to a year-long extension of the benefits, and Democrats are hoping for a similar deal this time around. \u201cSenator Murray is very interested in finding a path to an extension before the end of the year,\u201d said Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for Patty Murray, a lead Democratic budget negotiator.\n\nThe emergency unemployment aid has been at the heart of Congress\u2019s response to the recession, and Democrats argue the help is still necessary given the state of the labor market. Though unemployment has fallen from the post-crisis high of 10.2 percent to 7.3 percent, there are 4.1 million Americans who have been out of work for more than 26 weeks. The long-term unemployed still make up more than one-third of all unemployed workers. \u201cThat\u2019s higher than at any point prior to the Great Recession, going back to the mid-1970s,\u201d says Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University.\n\nDemocrats also point out that ending federal benefits would dampen economic growth, as those who receive them to tend spend the money quickly. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimates that letting the benefits expire would reduced GDP growth in 2014 by 0.16 percentage points, or nearly $25 billion.\n\nBut Republicans aren\u2019t keen on the idea of continuing the aid. \u201cThis program\u2014which has already added too much to the deficit, and helped keep unemployment too high for too long\u2014should be allowed to finally come to an end,\u201d said Rep. David Camp, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, arguing that the program has actually raised the unemployment rate by deterring workers from taking jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s also highly unclear how the program will be incorporated into a budget agreement, which Democrats and Republicans are still far from reaching. In 2012, the year-long extension cost $30 billion, and politically feasible offsets remain scarce.\n\nCongress has already scaled back federal unemployment benefits since the height of the recession, when they hit an unprecendented length of 73 weeks; combined with the standard 26 weeks of state benefits, the aid to the jobless lasted as long as 99 weeks. Federal benefits now last anywhere between 14 and 47 weeks, depending the state\u2019s unemployment rate and length of their own benefit period. (Recently cutting jobless aid to 19 weeks, North Carolina does not meet the threshold to receive any federal benefits.) Sequestration also cut the size of federal unemployment checks. Altogether, the federal benefits have cost about $252 billion since they began in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nState governments that have reduced jobless aid say the cost of the program\u2014and the debt they\u2019ve incurred because of it\u2014forced them to make permanent cutbacks. Overwhelmed with benefit claims during the recession, many states borrowed from the federal government when their own unemployment trust funds ran dry. Rather than tax employers more to pay for the program, states like Michigan cut back on benefits instead, and highly indebted states like California are currently weighing their choices.\n\nSherry Phurrough, 49, recently exhausted her state unemployment benefits in Georgia, which now offers only 18 weeks of aid. Though she\u2019s found a few weeks of temporary work, in the human resources department of a manufacturer, she worries about what\u2019s going to happen when the stint ends next month. \u201cI\u2019m divorced and have two kids at home,\u201d says Phurrough. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t have a big savings account or a rich relative. I pray about my situation, and that God comes through and gives the answers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Unless Congress acts, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits by the end of the year.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/all/facing-the-unemployment-cliff", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Unless Congress acts, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits by the end of the year.", "title": "Facing the unemployment cliff", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/all/facing-the-unemployment-cliff", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/167567670.jpg?itok=uPMigslC", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/all/facing-the-unemployment-cliff", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/167567670.jpg?itok=GkwXDmVh", "height": 553}, "title": "Facing the unemployment cliff", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Unless Congress acts, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits by the end of the year."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-19T04:00:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "suzykhimm", "title": "Facing the unemployment cliff", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/all/facing-the-unemployment-cliff", "published": 1, "date": "11/19/2013 04:00:00 EST", "tags": "economy,jobs,unemployment,unemployment-rate,all-in"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Unless Congress acts, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits by the end of the year.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, Jobs, Unemployment, Unemployment Rate"}, "article_summary": "So far, emergency federal benefits have cushioned the blow of most of these cuts, kicking in after state benefits expire.\nSherry Phurrough, 49, recently exhausted her state unemployment benefits in Georgia, which now offers only 18 weeks of aid.\nSince the beginning of the recession, seven states have cut their unemployment benefits to less than 26 weeks\u2014the prevailing standard since the 1950s.\nFederal benefits now last anywhere between 14 and 47 weeks, depending the state\u2019s unemployment rate and length of their own benefit period.\nBut now those federal benefits are on the chopping block as well, scheduled to expire December 29 unless Congress decides otherwise."}
