That, as Mr. Clifton knows well, remains the chief reason why the jobless rate has fallen.\n\nYet Mr. Obama has been going around the country crowing about the unemployment rate falling into the mid-5 percent range, down from its 10 percent peak in October of 2009. The declining jobless rate proves his policies were working and had pulled the economy out of its deep recession, he claims.\n\nThe nightly network news shows have been among his principal accomplices and cheerleaders in this shady con job.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the data-gathering arm of the Labor Department, reported that the unemployment rate in January came in at 5.6 percent. Sounds good, you say?\n\nMr. Clifton tells us \u201csomething many Americans \u2014 including some of the smartest and most educated among us \u2014 don\u2019t know. The official unemployment rate is extremely misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re hearing much celebrating from the media, the White House and Wall Street about how unemployment is \u2018down,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, \u201cNone of them will tell you this: If you, a family member or anyone is unemployed and has subsequently given up finding a job \u2014 if you are so hopelessly out of work that you\u2019ve stopped looking over the past four weeks \u2014 the Department of Labor doesn\u2019t count you as unemployed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. While you are as unemployed as one can possibly be, and tragically may never find work again, you are not counted in the figure we see relentlessly in the news,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cRight now, as many as 30 million Americans are either out of work or severely underemployed. Trust me, the vast majority of them aren\u2019t throwing parties to toast \u2018falling\u2019 unemployment,\u201d Mr. Clifton says.\n\nBut the government\u2019s statistical sleight-of-hand tricks don\u2019t stop there in this administration\u2019s numbers shell game. Many others are uncounted, too.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re an out-of-work engineer or health care worker or construction worker or retail manager: If you perform a minimum of one hour of work a week and are paid at least $20 you\u2019re not officially counted as unemployed in the much reported 5.6 percent. Few Americans know this.\u201d\n\nAnother labor survey scandal that doesn\u2019t get much if any attention in the news media: \u201cThose working part time but wanting full-time work,\u201d Mr. Clifton explains. \u201cIf you have a degree in chemistry or math and are working 10 hours part time because it is all you can find \u2014 in other words, you are severely underemployed \u2014 the government doesn\u2019t count you in the 5.6 percent,\u201d he goes on to say.\n\nMr. Clifton\u2019s organization has long been in the business of taking daily tracking surveys, including polls to produce its own unemployment rate. Gallup\u2019s surveys of workers 18 and older put the real unemployment rate at 7 percent and the underemployment rate at a whopping 16 percent.\n\nSo when he reads glowing accounts in the newspapers about the declining unemployment rate \u2014 without any report of the underhanded caveats in the phony figures put out by the BLS \u2014 he was furious and decided to go public with his anger and call a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other way to say this. The official unemployment rate, which cruelly overlooks the suffering of the long-term and often permanently unemployed as well as the depressingly underemployed, amounts to a big lie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a lie that has consequences, because the great American dream is to have a good job, and in recent years, America has failed to deliver that dream more than it has at any time in recent memory,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother figure that hardly ever gets mentioned in the nightly news \u2014 and never by Mr. Obama\u2019s Democratic allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere \u2014 is the shrinking size of the U.S. labor force.\n\nOne of the ways we measure the health of our economy is by the percentage of adult, working-age Americans who are employed. \u201cRight now, [the economy] is delivering at a staggeringly low rate of 44 percent, which is the number of full-time jobs as a percent of the adult population, 18 years and older,\u201d Mr. Clifton says.\n\nOrdinarily, when the CEO of the nation\u2019s top polling organization charges that the numbers being cited by the president of the United States have been cooked and are not to be believed, it would be big news. It would be a scandal, of course, if the occupant in the White House were a Republican.\n\nYet, not surprisingly, the three major news networks ignored Mr. Clifton\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d story.\n\nBut the American people know when they are being lied to about the job market getting \u201cbetter and better,\u201d as CBS News anchor Scott Pelley said about the latest job report without challenging any of its dubious data.\n\nIn 2014, Mr. Obama\u2019s economy grew at a dismally weak 2.4 percent, and created relatively few full-time jobs when compared to the explosive recoveries in the 1980s or the late 1990s.\n\nAt the end of the third year of the Reagan recovery, the economy was soaring by nearly 8 percent and in a single month alone created over 1.1 million new jobs.\n\nYet the liberal news media continues to dish out the \u201cbig lie,\u201d asking us to believe that Mr. Obama\u2019s anemic, part-time economy is producing \u201ca boom in jobs.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the past six years of the Obama economy, I've been telling readers that the administration has been juggling its job data to make the unemployment rates look much lower than they really are.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For the past six years of the Obama economy, I\u2019ve been telling readers that the administration has been juggling its job data to make the unemployment rates look much lower than they really are.", "title": "DONALD LAMBRO: Obama hides jobs failure by not counting long-term unemployed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/10/donald-lambro-obama-hides-jobs-failure-by-not-coun/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/10/2_102015_b3-lambro-gallup-ch8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/10/2_102015_b3-lambro-gallup-ch8201.jpg", "description": "For the past six years of the Obama economy, I've been telling readers that the administration has been juggling its job data to make the unemployment rates look much lower than they really are.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "DONALD LAMBRO: Obama hides jobs failure by not counting long-term unem"}, "Author": "Donald Lambro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Jim Clifton, United States Department Of Labor, Gallup"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ca1\"", "article_summary": "Trust me, the vast majority of them aren\u2019t throwing parties to toast \u2018falling\u2019 unemployment,\u201d Mr. Clifton says.\nMr. Clifton tells us \u201csomething many Americans \u2014 including some of the smartest and most educated among us \u2014 don\u2019t know.\nGallup\u2019s surveys of workers 18 and older put the real unemployment rate at 7 percent and the underemployment rate at a whopping 16 percent.\nThe official unemployment rate is extremely misleading.\u201d\u201cRight now, we\u2019re hearing much celebrating from the media, the White House and Wall Street about how unemployment is \u2018down,\u2019\u201d he says.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the data-gathering arm of the Labor Department, reported that the unemployment rate in January came in at 5.6 percent."}
