According to Republican leaders like House Budget Chairman Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, these risk corridor provisions are \u201cmassive insurance company bailouts.\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has even introduced a bill to strip them from the ACA. Some conservative groups are calling them \u201cnothing more than a built-in, blank check bailout for insurance companies.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat\u2019s most remarkable about their comments on risk corridors is that Republican leaders are denouncing a model they created to smooth out rate increases in prescription drug coverage under Medicare. When Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted in 2003 to create Medicare Part D, he called the law \u201cthe most important social legislation \u2026 in my memory\u201d and said it provided \u201ca genuine opportunity for the private sector to actually compete in offering this new drug benefit.\u201d House Republican Leader John Boehner made similar comments, noting in 2007, \u201cBy almost every measure, this drug benefit has exceeded expectations, and it continues to score high marks among seniors for providing big savings on their prescription costs.\u201d\n\nAn innovative part of the law McConnell and Boehner voted for was its \u201crisk corridors\u201d program, a new idea back in 2003. The corridors are a mechanism to distribute or balance risks across insurance companies, so that those that sign up healthier enrollees help those that attract sicker enrollees. Under the program, if insurers\u2019 actual costs for medical claims are more than 3 percent below their expected costs, they will transmit a portion of their profits into the federal Treasury. Those funds will then be redistributed to insurers whose actual costs exceed their expected costs by more than 3 percent. The provisions were included in Medicare Part D to give the insurers confidence to enter a new market. And they worked.\n\nAt the time, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) described the Part D risk corridors as one of the \u201cincentives that the secretary can use\u201d to get the new plans started \u201cin a strong way\u201d and said that \u201con risk adjustment \u2026 these plans are enabling many beneficiaries to lower their out-of-pocket costs substantially, and that\u2019s particularly true for beneficiaries with chronic illnesses.\u201d The Bush administration highlighted the risk corridors as a strategy to \u201cinsure against higher than expected drug costs.\u201d Notably, the Part D risk corridors are a permanent feature of the program.\n\nHenry Waxman represents California\u2019s 33rd District,\n\nSander Levin represents Michigan\u2019s 9th District, and is the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: Republicans are criticizing an Affordable Care Act policy that was once their own.", "title": "The Latest GOP Lie About Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/gop-risk-corridor-lie-obamacare-103129.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/04/140204_john_boehner_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Members Only,Obamacare,Opinion,Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: Republicans are criticizing an Affordable Care Act policy that was once their own.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Members Only The Latest GOP Lie About ObamacareThere\u2019s a saying that \u201cnothing is more admirable in politics than a short memory.\u201d But we are amazed by the audacity of the latest attack by Republican leaders on the Affordable Care Act.\nThose funds will then be redistributed to insurers whose actual costs exceed their expected costs by more than 3 percent.\nThe target of Republicans\u2019 new criticism is a sensible mechanism to ensure an even distribution of risks across insurance companies.\nThe provisions were included in Medicare Part D to give the insurers confidence to enter a new market.\nHenry Waxman represents California\u2019s 33rd District,Sander Levin represents Michigan\u2019s 9th District, and is the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee."}
