I love those guys very much and I respect them hugely as musicians and as songwriters and everything but I just don\u2019t want to do that thing that people do\u2026I despise nostalgia. I\u2019m not good at looking back.\u201d\n\nAnd that, we assumed, was that. But last week, former guitarist Peter Buck \u2014 still busy with the Baseball Project supergroup he founded with Mills, Scott McCaughey, Steve Wynn and Linda Pitmon, among other things \u2014 told the San Diego Union Tribune, in an interview about his Todos Santos Music Festival, that perhaps all was not lost after all.\n\nWhen the newspaper asked Buck if R.E.M. would consider reuniting for a benefit tour for the charity of their choice, Buck gave an almost-definite, totally-99.999 percent-sure answer:\n\n\u201cI had dinner last week with (former R.E.M. members) Mike (Mills) and Michael (Stipe), and I think the feeling is that we did exactly what we set out to do \u2014 more probably,\u201d Buck told the Union Tribune. \u201cAnd we reached a point where, if we kept going, what would it mean to us? \u201cI think our last record (the 2011 album \u2018Collapse Into Now\u2019) is pretty good. But was it our best record? Will we ever make our best record again? Probably not. I can\u2019t see us saying: \u2018Let\u2019s get together for four months again and go on the road again.\u2019 I can\u2019t see it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Tis the season for wishing that \"probably not\" will become \"maybe so\" one day soon ...", "title": "A new hope for R.E.M. fans: Is Peter Buck hinting at a chance for a reunion?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "'Tis the season for wishing that \"probably not\" will become \"maybe so\" one day soon ...", "title": "A new hope for R.E.M. fans: Is Peter Buck hinting at a chance for a reunion?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/22/a_new_hope_for_r_e_m_fans_is_peter_buck_hinting_at_a_chance_for_a_reunion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/rem.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Tis the season for wishing that \"probably not\" will become \"maybe so\" one day soon ...", "title": "A new hope for R.E.M. fans: Is Peter Buck hinting at a chance for a reunion?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/rem.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Erin Keane", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Michael Stipe, mike mills, Music, Peter Buck, R.E.M.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Michael Stipe, mike mills, Music, Peter Buck, R.E.M., Entertainment NewsThis time last year, R.E.M.\nmembers) Mike (Mills) and Michael (Stipe), and I think the feeling is that we did exactly what we set out to do \u2014 more probably,\u201d Buck told the Union Tribune.\nfans sighed a collective resigned sigh over former frontman Michael Stipe\u2019s declaration that a reunion of the beloved band, which disbanded in 2011, would \u201cnever happen.\u201d As Stipe told CBS\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d at the time, \u201cThere\u2019s no point.\nWhen the newspaper asked Buck if R.E.M.\nwould consider reuniting for a benefit tour for the charity of their choice, Buck gave an almost-definite, totally-99.999 percent-sure answer:\u201cI had dinner last week with (former R.E.M."}
