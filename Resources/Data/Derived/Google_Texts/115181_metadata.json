Angus King (I-Maine) on Tuesday over one of the Obamacare architects\u2019 controversial assertion that the health care law made it through Congress thanks to a \u201clack of transparency\u201d and the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201d The video of MIT professor Jonathan Gruber making the revealing comments at a University of Pennsylvania event in October of 2013 went viral this week.\n\nKing said he was unsure of what Gruber was talking about and made it clear he doesn\u2019t \u201cendorse those kinds of comments.\u201d He then defended the way Obamacare was passed.\n\n\u201cEverybody knew that there were going to be additional taxes required to support the premiums under the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t see it as any deep dark conspiracy,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cReally? Senator, he said he wasn\u2019t transparent. He wasn\u2019t telling the truth,\u201d host Brian Kilmeade responded.\n\nThe senator then seemingly downplayed Gruber\u2019s role in crafting Obamacare. King was not in the Senate when the law was voted on.\n\n\u201cWho was he? I don\u2019t know where he was in the process,\u201d King said.\n\nWhen co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle argued Gruber\u2019s comments confirm the American people were purposefully not informed that Obamacare would \u201ctax and penalize\u201d people, King went slightly off topic and stressed the importance of having insurance.\n\nWait a minute, wait a minute. Tax and penalize? Hold it, hold it, hold it,\u201d King interjected. \u201cWe\u2019ve got eight million people that have insurance now that didn\u2019t before and don\u2019t lecture me about this because 40 years ago, I had insurance. If I hadn\u2019t had it, it caught a cancer that saved my life. If I hadn\u2019t had insurance I\u2019d be dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201d Kilmeade asked.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with having insurance, man. If you don\u2019t have insurance, it\u2019s a high risk,\u201d King shot back.\n\nConfronted again with claims that Gruber\u2019s remarks show \u201cthey lied about a health plan to the American people,\u201d King asserted he was only \u201cone guy\u201d involved in the creation and passage of Obamacare. He then suggested the TV hosts believe \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t have health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you that cruel? That is what you\u2019re saying,\u201d the senator added.\n\n\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d a frustrated Kilmeade reacted.\n\nWatch the video via Fox News below:\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The hosts of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d confronted Sen.
