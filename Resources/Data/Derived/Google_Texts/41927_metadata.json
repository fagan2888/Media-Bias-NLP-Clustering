Wisconsin\u2019s GOP primary Tuesday, Senate Democrats are renewing an old argument that \u2014 should he win the Republican nomination \u2014 the senator from Texas would be as much of an electoral disaster as Donald Trump.\n\nIn a memo to be released Tuesday, the Democratic Senatorial Committee says that Cruz\u2019s agenda and record make him a political poison pill for re-election-seeking GOP senators, who would face the same obstacles with him at the top of the party\u2019s ticket as they would with Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s a break from the political committee\u2019s relentless focus on the New York billionaire, who the group has argued is key to unraveling the Republicans\u2019 Senate majority.\n\nThe Democratic committee has tried branding the GOP as the \u201c#partyofTrump\u201d while demanding its candidates answer whether they agree with the GOP front-runner\u2019s controversial take on issues ranging from abortion to Muslim immigration.\n\n\u201cCruz\u2019s out-of-touch brand of obstructionist fringe politics will be yet another obstacle for vulnerable Senate incumbents and candidates across the country and Cruz at the top of the ticket could be just as bad if not worse for the Republicans\u2019 majority status,\u201d the memo read.\n\nCruz\u2019s supporters have suggested a win in the Badger State would give him new momentum in the presidential primary, boosting his effort to block Trump from clinching the nomination before the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nThe timing of the memo suggests Democrats are also cognizant that they might not face Trump in the fall, and are preparing for the reality another candidate might emerge.\n\nRegardless of Tuesday\u2019s outcome, Trump will still maintain a sizable delegate advantage as the primary moves to New York on April 19, where polls suggest he sports a big, early advantage.\n\nRepublicans have generally been split on whether Trump or Cruz would make a weaker general election candidate, with some arguing that Trump\u2019s unconventional appeal to blue-collar voters could make him a force in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio.\n\nRecently, however, the front-runner\u2019s string of ever-more-controversial comments \u2014 coupled with weak poll numbers when matched up with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 have led many GOP leaders to conclude Cruz would be a stronger candidate.\n\nOne mid-March poll from CNN/ORC found a large split between the two candidates, with Cruz tying Clinton while Trump trails her by 12 points.\n\nThe memo digs up old reports about Republicans publicly doubting that Cruz would make a strong candidate, before outlining potential general election weak spots for the senator on everything from his leading role in the government shutdown to his support for defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThey will try to run their own races but Cruz will force them to answer for their out-of-touch records \u2013 from standing with him to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood to bombastic national security ideas that make our country less safe,\u201d the memo said. \u201cAlong the way, voters will come to reject their politics for candidates who will truly represent their interests in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nContact Roarty at alexroarty@cqrollcall.com and follow him on Twitter @Alex_Roarty Get
