Netanyahu addressed members of Congress in Washington, D.C., last week. The Clinton controversy followed closely behind in interest.\n\nBy contrast, those among the \u201cBeltway elite\u201d focused on Clinton first, followed by Israel.\n\nAccording to Echelon, though \u201cBeltway elites\u201d and the general population are interested in Clinton\u2019s scandal, there was a notable difference in when the issue was discussed between the two groups. Conversation among \u201celites\u201d peaked on the day news broke that Clinton used a personal email address to conduct official business. Conversation among everyday Americans followed two days later.\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s press conference Tuesday, Twitter users found their feed dominated by mentions of the former secretary of state, according to Echelon Insights. The 2016 hopeful maintained an 80 percent share of political conversations in the hour following her address.\n\nClinton is billed as the leading Democratic presidential contender in what is currently a narrow field. However, there has been speculation as to how the recent controversy will play into her 2016 bid.\n\n>>> Benghazi Investigator Trey Gowdy: \u2018Huge Gaps\u2019 in Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails\n\nPollster John Zogby, who just completed a national survey of 1,349 Democratic voters, found that Clinton has a sizeable lead of 46 percent to 13 percent over Vice President Joe Biden, another presidential prospect. Zogby noted, however, that Clinton\u2019s lead shrinks to 10 percentage points when all challengers are added together. Another 20 percent remain undecided.\n\n\u201cBill has always had a better process for shaking these things off. She\u2019s not as smooth,\u201d says @TheJohnZogby\n\n\u201cHow do you explain undecideds in a Democratic primary for a woman who has 100 percent name recognition?\u201d Zogby asked in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cHillary Clinton is not home free.\u201d\n\nZogby said the biggest challenge facing Clinton is her ability to focus on policy issues at a time when pundits and the press want to talk about the latest scandal or controversy.\n\n\u201cWhen you get into Iowa, is she going to be able to talk about issues?\u201d Zogby said. \u201cThe Clintons know how to take the heat. Bill has always had a better process for shaking these things off. She\u2019s not as smooth.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Republican strategist Rick Wilson told The Daily Signal that Clinton now faces a skeptical media and must be prepared to answer difficult questions when she runs for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely problematic, I think, in terms of how she faces up to an actual campaign when she can\u2019t be behind the shield anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t be behind the bubble anymore. It\u2019s going to be a very different environment for her.\u201d\n\nWilson worked for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani when he mounted a challenge to Clinton in the race for the U.S. Senate in New York. When asked if Clinton could regain the public\u2019s trust following this email scandal, Wilson said he didn\u2019t believe so.\n\n\u201cRedemption requires contrition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe least contrite human beings on earth are Hillary and Bill Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedemption requires contrition,\u201d says @TheRickWilson. \u201cThe least contrite human beings on earth are Hillary and Bill Clinton.\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the political spectrum, Roland Martin suggested the controversy would fade by the time voters had to make a choice at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think for a second this email issue will matter to voters. This has nothing to do with partisan politics,\u201d Martin, host of NewsOne Now, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe overriding issue, if Clinton does run, will be the economy, leadership on foreign affairs, and getting Congress and the White House to work together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not dismissing the issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just don\u2019t see it being that major to voters.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from outside the U.N. Security Council chambers in New York City today, the former secretary of state attempted to downplay the controversy surrounding her use of a private email address. Clinton said her motives behind doing so were a matter of convenience.\n\n\u201cI thought using one device would be simpler,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cObviously, it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think for a second this email issue will matter to voters,\u201d says @rolandsmartin\n\nLast week, The New York Times reported that Clinton used a personal email address to conduct official business during her tenure as the top U.S. diplomat. Then, it was revealed that a private domain, clintonemail.com, and server were registered to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., with the names of the accounts registered to Clinton\u2019s aides.\n\nThe former secretary of state conducted business using the email address hdr22@clintonemail.com instead of an official government-issued account.\n\nDuring her news conference today, Clinton said that she would make 30,000 of her work-related emails public. However, she conceded that thousands were deleted, as she felt they were of a personal nature.\n\n\u201cThey were about personal and private matters that I believe were in the scope of my personal privacy and particularly that of other people,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey had nothing to do with work. I didn\u2019t see a need to keep them.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: Hillary\u2019s Message Was \u2018Just Trust Me.\u2019 That\u2019s Not Good Enough.\n\nRob Bluey contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton set social media on fire as she addressed revelations that she used her personal email address to conduct official government business.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Hillary Clinton set social media on fire as she addressed revelations that she used her personal email address to conduct official government business.", "title": "What Difference Does It Make?
