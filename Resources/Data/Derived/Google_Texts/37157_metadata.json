The piece notes that while the Affordable Care Act has allowed many women to gain insurance that covers contraception and other preventive care without cost-sharing, accessing healthcare services is still difficult for those in areas with few healthcare providers. The authors explain that if Planned Parenthood clinics were to close, many communities\u2019 remaining providers would be unable to serve all of the clinics\u2019 former patients \u2013 and some communities would be left without any safety-net provider at all.\n\nWomen\u2019s Health Issues is the official journal of the Jacobs Institute of Women\u2019s Health, which is based at the Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. The commentary, \"Turning Back the Clock on Women\u2019s Health in Medically Underserved Communities,\" was co-authored by Sara Rosenbaum, JD, the Harold and Jane Hirsh Professor of Health Law and Policy at Milken Institute SPH, and Susan F. Wood, PhD, the Executive Director of the Jacobs Institute of Women\u2019s Health at Milken Institute SPH.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnderserved communities need more healthcare providers, not fewer,\u201d Rosenbaum said. \u201cI have been working with community health centers for almost four decades, and I know how much they have achieved. But they don\u2019t have the capacity to replace the high-quality reproductive healthcare that millions of women get from Planned Parenthood clinics today.\u201d\n\nIn the commentary, Rosenbaum and Wood highlight two federally funded providers that promote access to care for those with low incomes: Community health centers and Title X\u2013funded family planning centers. Community health centers provide comprehensive primary care in medically underserved areas, while Title X centers offer family planning and other preventive reproductive health services. Both charge fees on a sliding scale to accommodate low-income patients. While both of these safety-net providers are present in some areas, many poorer communities have only one or the other. Funding cuts that result in Planned Parenthood clinics\u2019 closures would leave many low-income women without a source of reproductive healthcare, the authors say.\n\n\u201cTitle X plays an essential role in US women\u2019s health, and Planned Parenthood plays an essential role in Title X,\u201d said Wood, who also noted that a US House of Representatives proposal would eliminate the Title X program completely. \u201cCutting federal funding for Planned Parenthood \u2013 or, even worse, for the entire Title X program \u2013 would be catastrophic for millions of women.\u201d\n\nAbout Women\u2019s Health Issues:\n\n\n\nWomen's Health Issues is the official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health, and the only journal devoted exclusively to women's health care and policy issues.
