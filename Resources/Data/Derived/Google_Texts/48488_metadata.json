Burnett\u2019s performance Sunday afternoon would have earned him the lowest ERA in the National League. He woke up tied for second, after all, with Atlanta Braves starter Shelby Miller.\n\nBurnett then pitched seven scoreless innings, dropping his ERA to 1.38 after eight starts and 52 innings. But when Miller lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning and settled for a shutout, reducing his mark to 1.33, Burnett would have to settle for second.\n\nBurnett\u2019s seven scoreless innings were plenty to stop the Pirates losing streak at four games. They beat the Chicago Cubs, 3-0, at Wrigley Field, avoiding a series sweep.\n\n\u201cSome things are going good,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cPlays are being made, guys are playing hard. I\u2019m making a pitch here or there.\u201d\n\nSince 1900, Burnett is the only Pirates pitcher to hold opponents to two runs or fewer in his first eight starts. He allowed three hits, all singles, Sunday and struck out seven. He walked five, but the bases on balls were more indicative of Burnett picking his spots against the Cubs lineup than a lack of control.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to miss, I\u2019d rather miss where I was instead of over the plate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss over the plate, especially these guys or any big league lineup at Wrigley.\u201d\n\nThe defense behind Burnett helped him. Andrew McCutchen slid to catch Chris Coghlan\u2019s softly hit ball after running in toward the infield, then threw to first base to double off Miguel Montero and end the second inning. Burnett picked off Addison Russell after Russell walked in the third, and Neil Walker\u2019s diving stop stole a base hit from Dexter Fowler later in the inning. McCutchen made another nice catch in the seventh, running down Jorge Soler\u2019s well-struck liner near the warning track in left-center field.\n\n\u201cWhen we play defense like we did, when you get a performance like A.J. put together, you\u2019re going to have a pretty good chance of at least getting an opportunity to win,\u201d said Walker, whose RBI double added an insurance run.\n\nCubs starter Jake Arrieta was almost as good. He allowed one run, on a bloop double and a single, in seven innings and struck out seven.\n\nThe Pirates took advantage of a Cubs misplay to score their first run in the fifth. Starlin Castro began backpedaling for Josh Harrison\u2019s popup, but he didn\u2019t get there in time. The ball dropped and Harrison took second. Francisco Cervelli\u2019s single scored Harrison, and though Anthony Rizzo cut off Soler\u2019s throw and caught Cervelli in a rundown, the Pirates led, 1-0.\n\nManager Clint Hurdle won a challenge in the sixth that defused a potential Cubs scoring opportunity. Castro walked with one out. He stole second and his front foot beat Cervelli\u2019s throw, but Jung Ho Kang applied the tag to Castro\u2019s left thigh as his back foot hit the bag.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the play, though, that\u2019s getting reviewed now more than ever before,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cThe play that continues to get looked at is that slide, because he beats the throw.\u201d\n\nVideo review officials in New York ruled that Castro\u2019s foot was momentarily off the bag as he slid, overruling the call, and Miguel Montero struck out on the next pitch to end the inning.\n\nCervelli hit an infield single against Zac Rosscup to lead off the eighth. After taking second on pinch-hitter Sean Rodriguez\u2019s sacrifice bunt, Cervelli scored on Walker\u2019s double and the Pirates led, 2-0. Starling Marte\u2019s double drove in another run.\n\nThe Pirates are off today before a two-game interleague series begins Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins at PNC Park.\n\nBill Brink: bbrink@post-gazette.com and Twitter @BrinkPG.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pirates converted another stellar start from A.J.
