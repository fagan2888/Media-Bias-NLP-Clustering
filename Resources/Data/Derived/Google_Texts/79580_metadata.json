Fallon accepted a challenge that Dunham had issued him earlier this week, to take part in a lip sync battle. The video of it is below. That epic battle took place tonight, and the winner was\u2026read on, to find out! Fallon also did his weekly \u201cThank You Notes\u201d comedy segment in this terrific Friday night episode.\n\nFallon started off the Tonight Show by getting a standing ovation from the studio audience. He thanked his audience for being there, then did his monologue, joking about the NBA Finals and Lebron showing his privates on live T.V., while adjusting his shorts.\n\nA member of The Roots laughed at Fallon, for calling LeBron\u2019s privates, \u201cprivates.\u201d The Roots member had a different term he used, and the audience was about to vote on who had the best term. Then, another member of The Roots interrupted and said tha he had a better way to describe LeBron\u2019s privates. When he said what it was, Fallon said \u201cThat was better.\u201d\n\nFallon said that Mitt Romney and his family had gone hiking lately. He said he had a clip of it, then showed a clip of the Von Trapp family from The Sound of Music. Fallon then joked about members of Congress wearing seersucker suits in honor of Seersucker Day. \u201cIn other news, ISIS is still a big problem for America,\u201d he said. Fallon also joked about an alarm clock that had been invented that woke people up by employing various smells, like bacon and money.\n\nAt his desk, Fallon said that Channing Tatum was an upcoming guest in a couple of weeks. He asked the Tonight Show viewers to have their kids write one or two pages about a character called \u201cMagic Mike,\u201d and he and Tatum would then act out a couple of them.\n\nFallon mentioned his upcoming lip sync battle versus Lena Dunham, and he said that Colin Quinn has written a book and he was in an upcoming movie with Amy Schumer called Train Wreck. Fallon said that \u201che is going to win an Academy Award.\u201d\n\nNext up on the Tonight Show, Fallon did his weekly \u201cThank You Notes.\u201d He and announcer Steve Higgins joked with keyboard player, James Posey. They said it looked like he had a napkin sticking out of his suit coat pocket.\n\nSome of the \u201cThank You Notes\u201d were \u201cThank you, Degrassi, for moving to Netflix after being on Teen Nick for ten seasons. I guess Degrassi is always greener on the other side. Thank you, outdoor weddings in the summer, for being the most romantic way to watch two people sweating through really expensive clothes. Thank you, relish, for being a really scary story that pickles say around a campfire.\u201d Fallon concluded his \u201cThank You Notes\u201d with \u201cThank you, Turtle Wax, for sounding like what the Teenage Ninja Turtles get before swimsuit season.\u201d\n\nAfter the first commercial break of the Tonight Show, Fallon introduced Lena Dunham. He explained the rules of the lip sync battle, and said that they would do two songs each. Fallon went first, and lip synced I\u2019ve Never Been Too Me, from 1982, by a singer called Charlene. He lip synced into a mirror to start out and then switched to using just his microphone. There was even a spoken part to the song, a rather long one. Fallon KILLED with his performance!\n\nThen, Dunham was up. Her first song was Outside, by Calvin Harris (featuring Ellie Goulding). Dunham worked the stage and the audience, dancing as she lip synced. She did a fantastic job.\n\nFallon then lip synced to a Run DMC song called Run House. He had the audience swaying their arms in the air. Fallon RULED with his performance, but Dunham had one more song to go.\n\nDunham lip synced Queen\u2019s song, Fat Bottom Girls. The Tonight Show audience clapped along as she lip synced to Freddie Mercury and Queen\u2019s hit. She chose an awesome song, one that might have given her the overall victory tonight on the Tonight Show.\n\nFallon said \u201cGuys, is the winner me? Or is it Lena Dunham?\u201d The audience applauded louder for Dunham, so Fallon graciously declared her to be the winner.\n\nFollowing more commercials on the Tonight Show, Fallon introduced Dunham, who had changed from the short black skirt she had been wearing for the lip sync battle to a black-and-white dress. They talked more about lip sync battles. Fallon said he could not top Queen. Dunham said that a choreographer friend of hers had helped with her dance to the Queen song.\n\nThey both talked about the HBO series, Girls. He asked if she could give any spoilers from the upcoming season. She said that they would be going to Japan. Dunham mentioned that both her back and her mom\u2019s back had gone out. She removed her mother\u2019s shoes to help her out because of her back, and some of the Japanese people just thought she did it because she was being very respectful.\n\nOn the Tonight Show, Dunham talked about her and Amy Schumer being two of several comediennes who were interviewed, and they had been told they could say whatever they wanted to say. Dunham said that she and Schumer tried to outdo each other, and it sounded as if she was talking about sex and wanting to be naked on T.V. every other sentence.\n\nFallon then brought up work that Dunham was doing to help get dogs adopted. Dunham loves animals, and her work helping them out showed a different side of her than what many people see.\n\nWhen the Tonight Show returned from another break, Fallon introduced comedian Colin Quinn. He did a stand-up comedy routine. He said that \u201cEverybody does an appearance on Law & Order.\u201d He said that he walked onto the set, \u201cand was the most famous person there.\u201d Quinn said he \u201cshould have been the lead cop, but was not even a well-known murderer,\u201d on the show.\n\nQuinn based his routine on his appearance on Law & Order. He said he ran some sort of a flower shop, and the cops suspected him from the start. He turned out to be the murderer, and he had shears in his hands and gloves on as the cops showed up. He talked about \u201cLilacs being more loyal than humans.\u201d\n\nAfter another commercial break, the Tonight Show came back on and Fallon interviewed Quinn. Fallon told him \u201cYou always took care of me on Saturday Night Live.\u201d Fallon mentioned Quinn\u2019s new book, and Fallon bragged that he had a new book that came out the same day as Quinn\u2019s. Quinn then showed Fallon a photo that Amy Schumer had sent him the very day his book came out, of a dog defecating on his book.\n\nFallon told Quinn that he was great in the movie Trainwreck. He plays Amy\u2019s father in the movie. In the clip that Fallon showed, Quinn explained the concept of \u201cmonogamy\u201d to his two daughter when they were kids. He then said \u201cSo, that\u2019s why me and your mom are getting a divorce.\u201d\n\nBesides being in the movie Train Wreck, Quinn, Schumer, and comedian Mike Birbiglia will all be on the road for the \u201cTrain Wreck Comedy Tour.\u201d All of those people are hilarious, so it will probably be a Must See show for whoever lives in a city included in the tour.\n\nThe Tonight Show was uber entertaining this Friday, with Jimmy Fallon and Lena Dunham taking part in a lip sync battle. He and Dunham also talked about the upcoming season of Girls. Comedian Colin Quinn was the second guest of the night, and he did a stand-up routine and then talked with Fallon about the movie he is in with Amy Schumer, Train Wreck.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nTonight Show Lip Sync Battle: Fallon vs Dunham\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nUniversal Media Village\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "This Friday night on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon\u2019s guests were actress and comedienne, Lena Dunham, from HBO\u2019s Girls, and comedian Colin Quinn.
