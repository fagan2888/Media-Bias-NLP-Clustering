That happens for one reason and one reason only: For cynical gain. And it has no place in our politics.\n\nLooking for an easy way to ruin Sunday dinner? Bring up the debate over whether Pennsylvania should take advantage of language in the federal healthcare reform law allowing state officials to add a half-million uninsured citizens to the Medicaid rolls.\n\nLeft or right, there\u2019s no shortage of opinion on the issue. It won\u2019t be long before tempers start to flare and the gravy boats start to fly.\n\nBut a mass e-mail that the liberal advocacy group Keystone Progress sent out to its followers Tuesday hit a new low, breathlessly claiming that Gov. Tom Corbett \u201ckilled 4 people\u201d that day by failing to accept the billions of dollars in federal money Pennsylvania would receive by expanding the joint state and federal entitlement program.\n\nYou can disagree with Corbett\u2019s policies. If you\u2019ve met him, you may like him or dislike him.\n\nBut calling him a killer? That\u2019s disgusting. And it has no place in our discourse. You don\u2019t need to be liberal or conservative to accept that premise. You mostly just need to have a brain and a heart.\n\nBut that\u2019s the state of our politics now. We\u2019ve crossed some line. It\u2019s not enough that you disagree with someone\u2019s policies and want to see them defeated in the marketplace of ideas and at the ballot box.\n\nNow the architect of those ideas also has to be personally destroyed. And I\u2019ll stipulate up front that both the left and the right are guilty of these offenses. It\u2019s not the exclusive province of one party or one ideological camp.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the debate, Corbett, a Republican, wants Washington to allow him to move the 500,000 people who would be eligible for coverage under the Medicaid expansion into the private market, where they\u2019d be allowed to purchase health insurance on a sliding scale.\n\nThe administration expects to submit its application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services next month. And in a radio interview last week, Corbett said he\u2019s optimistic about its chances.\n\nThe move has angered Democrats who charge that Corbett\u2019s plan, which wouldn\u2019t take effect until Jan. 1, 2015 (assuming Washington approves it), would leave the uninsured without coverage for another year.\n\nThey\u2019re also concerned it would still be unaffordable and come with diminished benefits. Another sticking point is a job-search requirement that\u2019s been sought by no other state (Iowa and Arkansas have similar \u201cprivate option\u201d programs).\n\nThere is an undeniable layer of politics to this debate. With approval ratings that barely register in the double-digits, Corbett is widely considered the most vulnerable Republican governor in the country.\n\nHis Democratic challengers, quite sensibly, are seeking to exploit any vulnerability they can find as they try to break a decades-old tradition of sitting governors serving the constitutional maximum of two, four-year terms.\n\nIn its e-mail, Keystone Progress boss Michael Morrill said the shock tactics were necessary \u201cto call attention to Corbett\u2019s refusal to allow expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe claim was based on research by Harvard University and the City University of New York concluding that up to 1,491 people would die this year because they didn\u2019t have coverage, he wrote.\n\nThe e-mail directs supports to a website with a fairly despicable name: \u201cTomCorbettKilled4PeopleToday.com,\u201d where they can sign a letter (with their local lawmaker copied in) urging Corbett to change his mind.\n\nBecause there\u2019s nothing quite calling someone a killer to get them to change their ways.\n\n\u201cWhy is Corbett turning down federal funding for Medicaid expansion? Because he is playing politics over Obamacare in an election year,\u201d the e-mail charges either blissfully, or more likely deliberately, unaware that it is doing the exact same thing. \u201cHe wants to turn Medicaid over to his corporate insurance friends and impose illegal restrictions on those who can be covered.\u201d\n\nBecause he got lousy advice for his first three years, Corbett is about as popular as Attilla the Hun in some parts of Pennsylvania. Dodging schoolkids in Philadelphia hasn\u2019t done him any favors either. But as those of us who covered him in 2010 can tell you, there\u2019s an actual human being lurking beneath the Dracula mythology.\n\nOn the trail, he got positively misty-eyed talking about how much he was looking forward to being a grandfather.\n\nIn periodic meetings in the Linglestown Giant, he and I chatted about grilling and baseball. And gets downright goofy when he talks about his dogs. It was a side of Corbett rarely seen in public and official settings.\n\nAnd maybe if his handlers had allowed the public to see a little more of that side of Corbett \u2014 the one his friends and allies complain has gotten utterly lost \u2014 then maybe his numbers wouldn\u2019t be what they are right now. And maybe he wouldn\u2019t be in the fight of his political life this year. But that\u2019s where he is. And that's where his policies have gotten him. So he has to play the hand he\u2019s been dealt.\n\nI disagree with Corbett on matters of policy. That\u2019s no secret. And I think he\u2019s dead wrong on Medicaid. But I still believe now, as I did in 2010, that he\u2019s basically a decent guy who\u2019s trying to do the best job he can based on the principles that guide him. I just think they\u2019re wrongheaded and bad for the state.\n\nBut a killer? Only the most heartless \u2014 or politically cynical \u2014 of people would hurl that kind of charge.\n\nWhen I e-mailed Morrill to tell him I disagreed with tactics and that effectively accusing Corbett of murder would do nothing to further his cause, he offered the most slender of defenses.\n\nHis group, he told me, had poached the idea from former Florida Gov. Charlie Christ, who accused his Republican successor, Rick Scott, of a similar crime.\n\nAs if that made it OK.\n\nThen, he added, \u201cWhen your actions result in the deaths of people, it means you are responsible for their deaths. That is not the same as murder.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s appalling and utterly indefensible. It\u2019s also complete bull.\n\nIn case Morrill forgot, here\u2019s what he wrote to his supporters: \u201cTom Corbett killed 4 people today.\u201d\n\nAnd his website is called \u201cTomCorbettKilled4PeopleToday.com.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not what the study from the Harvard and CUNY researchers says. Not even a little bit.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mention Corbett by name. It accuses him of nothing.\n\nAmong the dry recitation of facts, figures and potential economic impacts, it estimates a low of 398 people to a high of 1,491 who might die if the state doesn\u2019t expand its Medicaid rolls.\n\nAgain, the numbers, as the chart makes clear, are estimates. That\u2019s nowhere near guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn interviews, Corbett has said he\u2019s skeptical that Washington will live up to its funding commitments for the expansion. The feds are supposed to initially shoulder 100 percent of the cost, with the states picking up 10 percent of the tab by 2016. Pennsylvania has among the most expensive Medicaid programs in the country.\n\nCorbett has pointed to Washington\u2019s lousy track record on special education funding to buttress his claim.\n\nAnd you can agree or disagree with that. But calling someone a killer? That happens for one reason and one reason only: For cynical gain.\n\nAnd it has no place in our politics.\n\nJohn L.
