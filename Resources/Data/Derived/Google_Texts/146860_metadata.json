One of the primary reasons that anti-choice activists have been so successful is because they have effectively framed these state-level restrictions in terms of \u201cwomen\u2019s health and safety,\u201d claiming that abortion clinics need to be better regulated to ensure that women are getting the best quality care.\n\nBut the individuals who spend their lives working to protect women\u2019s health \u2014 the doctors who specialize in reproductive issues \u2014 see right through that claim.\n\nDr. Serdar Bulun, the chair of Northwestern University\u2019s department of obstetrics and gynecology, testified before a federal judge last week about an abortion restriction in Wisconsin that\u2019s purportedly about keeping women safer. Bulun was chosen by the judge as the \u201cimpartial expert\u201d to comment on the state law, which requires abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges from local hospitals, as it\u2019s up for debate in court. And the doctor didn\u2019t have many good things to say.\n\n\u201cI think it is an unacceptable experiment to see if you decrease access [to abortion clinics] and see if more women die,\u201d Bulun testifed, after he was asked if Wisconsin\u2019s new law could increase maternal mortality. \u201cIt is not acceptable. It is not ethical. People will resort to illegal abortions. Should we do any experiment for this? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nBulun\u2019s comments speak to the fundamental contradiction at the heart of admitting privileges requirements, which are rapidly spreading across the country (just last month, Oklahoma and Louisiana became the latest states to approve this particular abortion restriction). Even though they\u2019re framed in terms of ensuring that women are safe, these laws actually do the direct opposite when they\u2019re put into practice.\n\nAdmitting privilege laws essentially create a bureaucratic maze that\u2019s too difficult for abortion providers to navigate, since hospitals frequently refuse to grant privileges to doctors who work in abortion clinics. Many hospitals want to avoid pressure from anti-choice activists, and are therefore wary to be publicly associated with abortion. And admitting privileges are actually a business arrangement, based on how much money a hospital can make from the patients transferred to them by an outside doctor. Since abortion is such a safe medical procedure, and hardly any abortion patients ever have serious complications that require hospital care, it just doesn\u2019t make much financial sense for hospitals to enter into these partnerships with abortion doctors.\n\nSo in that context, it\u2019s not hard to understand what happens after a state passes an admitting privileges law. Abortion providers attempt to get privileges, many of them ultimately fail, and the doctors without privileges are forced to stop practicing. Then clinics start to shut down.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in Texas, where an admitting privileges law took effect last fall \u2014 hundreds of miles of the state is now left without a single abortion clinic, and desperate women are resorting to buying illegal abortion-inducing drugs on the black market. Even aside from the Lone Star State, admitting privilege requirements are particularly taking hold in the South, where millions of women of reproductive age may lose access to nearby clinics.\n\n\u201cAdmitting privileges may not be advantageous for the patient,\u201d Dr. Serdar Bulun concluded.\n\nHe\u2019s hardly the first medical professional to point out that admitting privileges don\u2019t have anything to do with women\u2019s safety. When other states have considered similar admitting privilege requirements, doctors located there have been quick to speak out against them. The nation\u2019s leading group of OB-GYNs, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), opposes these laws because they don\u2019t have any basis in best medical practice. So does the Texas Hospital Association.\n\nIn fact, after Texas\u2019 law took effect, ACOG issued an open letter to lawmakers imploring them to stop passing anti-choice measures like this that interfere in the doctor-patient relationship. \u201cWhile we can agree to disagree about abortion on ideological grounds, we must draw a hard line against insidious legislation that threatens women\u2019s health,\u201d the group\u2019s president wrote on behalf of its 58,000 members.\n\nNonetheless, doctors\u2019 opinions don\u2019t necessarily dissuade the lawmakers and judges who make the final decisions about abortion restrictions. Despite medical professionals\u2019 repeated objections to admitting privilege laws, these laws continue to gain political traction. Depending on how the legal challenge in Wisconsin ends up \u2014 as well as similar lawsuits in Alabama and Mississippi \u2014 this issue could be headed all the way to the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"People will resort to illegal abortions.
