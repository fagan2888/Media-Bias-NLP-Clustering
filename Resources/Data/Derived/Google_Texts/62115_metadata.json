Chris Christie\u2019s (R) former deputy chief of staff got the boot from her boss on a national stage. But Democratic strategist James Carville has his own ideas of what Christie should\u2019ve done to Bridget Anne Kelly, and it involves a scrub brush and a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike.\n\nAppearing at the National Press Club on Saturday to speak about their new book, \u201cLove & War,\u201d the political world\u2019s odd couple Mary Matalin and Carville discussed an array of topics, from their work on the 1992 Presidential campaign to the recent political scandal involving Christie. When talks of \u201cbridgegate\u201d \u2014 the name given to the premeditated closure of lanes onto the George Washington Bridge \u2014 arose, the duo was asked how they would have handled it themselves. And Carville\u2019s strategy elicited some laughs for how he thought Christie should\u2019ve responded.\n\n\u201cYea, I would\u2019ve worked the tollbooth,\u201d the Democratic strategist said of Christie. \u201cAnd I would\u2019ve had Bridget Anne Kelly scrubbing commodes at the rest stop on the turnpike.\u201d\n\nThat, Matalin said, was a \u201cgood idea.\u201d\n\nCarville criticized Christie\u2019s decision to go straight to Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich to apologize and said he should\u2019ve gone directly to the residents of Fort Lee instead.\n\n\u201cJames thought about this for hours and he had all sorts of strategies and he got to go on Wolf and talk about it\u2026\u201d Matalin joked.\n\nThe former Republican strategist, however, said the only thing she would have changed about Christie\u2019s press conference was the duration. The governor spoke for close to two hours, taking nearly every reporter\u2019s questions.\n\nThough Carville and Matalin primarily discussed their 20 years of marriage and two children, politics did come up, albeit in a lighthearted manner.\n\nWhen discussing how the Republican Party can succeed in future elections, Matalin said the GOP needs to stick to its roots and try \u201cnot to be the lesser version of Democrats.\u201d She also said Republicans spend too much time defending strawmen from attacks that just aren\u2019t true, such as the war on women.\n\n\u201c2016 is going to be undergirded by what happens in 2014,\u201d Matalin said.\n\nWhen it comes to the Democratic Party, Carville noted that the Left should focus on growing incomes.\n\n\u201cOur charge for the future in this country is to somehow or another bring the prosperity across the great forth of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch Matalin and Carville\u2019s whole discussion here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "New Jersey Gov.
