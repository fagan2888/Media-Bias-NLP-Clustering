It\u2019s now on Gov. Mary Fallin\u2019s desk, waiting for her signature, The Journal Record\u2019s Dale Denwalt reports:\n\n\u201cFor six years, we\u2019ve had our hands tied,\u201d said state Rep. Glen Mulready, an author of the bill. So far, even though the Legislature has approved development of a waiver, officials are unsure what policies the waiver will include. Mulready, R-Tulsa, said he would like to see an expansion of the insurance premium rate bands that were compressed under the ACA, sometimes known as Obamacare. \u201cSo you have younger people paying more than they should be paying; they\u2019re supplementing the older folks,\u201d he said.\n\nOklahoma Health and Human Services Secretary Terry Cline would be allowed to develop and submit the waiver.\n\nOver the next several months, agencies will meet with each other and with industry stakeholders to craft a plan. Deputy Health Secretary Julie Cox-Kain told Denwalt the federal government could receive the comprehensive waiver request early next year.\n\nKain\u2026also said one of the problems seen with ACA implementation has been the increase of premiums, particularly among younger, healthy people. On the federally facilitated marketplace, she said, more plans have the highest deductible. With such high deductibles, insured people are still receiving uncompensated care because they haven\u2019t reached the limit. \u201cWe have some families in Oklahoma with deductibles as high as $20,000 for a family of four,\u201d Cox-Kain said. \u201cThey essentially have insurance then that\u2019s only good if they have something really catastrophic.\u201d\n\nThe waiver would allow the state to modify or ignore some parts of the ACA as insurers try to cut costs through the reduction of benefits packages and narrowing of provider networks.\n\nAccording to Denwalt, whatever Oklahoma decides to do, it has to meet four guidelines:\n\nThe number of people with coverage cannot be reduced\n\nThe request cannot increase the federal deficit\n\nInsurance coverage must be as affordable as before\n\nThe waiver must still allow for comprehensive health insurance coverage. \u201cThere are multiple steps we\u2019ll have to walk through, and we\u2019ll have to convince the federal government that we met all four of those guardrails before they will consider our waiver application,\u201d Cox-Kain said.\n\nKGOU produces journalism in the public interest, essential to an informed electorate.
