Today is Friday, July 3, and here are some story lines I don't want you to miss.\n\n\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nCatch the Merger Wave\n\nMerger fever is coursing through the healthcare industry, as insurers, hospitals and drug companies vie for Obamacare spending that could top $1 trillion over the next decade. On Thursday, Woodland Hills insurer Health Net agreed to be acquired by St. Louis-based Centene, creating a Medicaid colossus. Then, in the latest deal, Aetna announced it would buy rival Humana. As the corporate competition for healthcare dollars grows fierce, consumer advocates predict that ordinary Americans won\u2019t see savings anytime soon.\n\nFiorina Rising\n\nHer poll numbers hover around 3%, but Carly Fiorina is killing it on the campaign trail. Early in the race, many Republicans had written her off as unelectable: She has never held public office and she was fired as Hewlett-Packard's CEO.

The next test: Will she crack the top 10 to win a spot at the first Republican debate?\n\nWelcome to 'Billionaires Beach'\n\nJust in time for a hot holiday weekend, a new pathway to the sands of Malibu has opened to the public. It's paved, it's wheelchair-accessible and, in true Malibu style, it was the center of a years-long battle between the California Coastal Commission and a beachfront landowner. The new accessway -- which leads to Carbon Beach, the sumptuous strand that's home to the likes of David Geffen, Larry Ellison and Jamie McCourt -- won't be officially unveiled until next week, but lucky visitors have already stumbled across it.\n\nInternational Studies\n\nThe UC system released its profile of this fall's freshman class, and here's what you need to know: Across the nine undergraduate campuses, only 60% of in-state applicants made the cut, apparently a new low. UCLA was the most selective, admitting 16.2% of California applicants. At both UCLA and Berkeley, foreign and out-of-state students were capped at 30%, as promised by UC President Janet Napolitano. But the number of out-of-staters at Irvine, San Diego and Davis saw a big increase. Among the Californians admitted, 36.3% are Asian American, 29.6% are Latino, 25.4% are white and 4.3% are African Americans.\n\nMourning Glory\n\n\"At your own grandmother's funeral. Dressed like a girl,\" his aunt hissed as he made his way toward the casket in the historic basilica. But Paul Valdez was determined to wear the ornate black frock to honor Eva Griego, who had made a name for herself as Santa Fe, N.M.'s go-to dressmaker for communions, quincea\u00f1eras and weddings -- and who never faltered in her support of a gay grandson who dressed in drag.
