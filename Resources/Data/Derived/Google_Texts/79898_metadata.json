The Obama administration says they do not, arguing that freedom of religion is an individual right, not a corporate one.\n\nAt issue is a provision of the healthcare law that requires companies with more than 50 employees to cover preventive care services, which include such contraceptives as morning-after pills, diaphragms, and IUDs.\n\nThe law was challenged by the Hobby Lobby, a chain of 500 craft stores employing 13,000 people; Mardel Christian bookstores, with 35 outlets and 400 employees; and Conestoga Wood Specialties, whose 950 employees make doors and other parts for kitchen cabinets.\n\nThe Obama administration says freedom of religion applies only to the owners of companies challenging the law, not to the companies themselves.\n\nHobby Lobby and Mardel are owned and operated by an Oklahoma family, David and Barbara Green and their children. Hobby Lobby's official statement of purpose commits it to \"honoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with biblical principles.\"\n\nNorman and Elizabeth Hahn of Pennsylvania, who own Conestoga Wood with their three sons, are Mennonite Christians.\n\nBoth the Greens and the Hahns believe that the use of some contraceptives amounts to abortion, destroying a human life by interfering with a fertilized egg.\n\n\"This case is entirely about whether the government can coerce families of faith to buy these life-destroying products and coverage for other people,\" Matt Bowman, a lawyer for Conestoga Wood, said in an interview.\n\nThe Obama administration argues that the freedom of religion applies only to the Greens and the Hahns individually, not to the for-profit corporations they run. It's the corporations, not the family members themselves, who are required to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives under Obamacare, the government says.\n\nAnd because the Supreme Court has never said that a for-profit corporation can claim it has freedom of religion, the government says, the law does not violate the Constitution.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Does requiring contraceptive coverage violate religious freedom? 2:26 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nThe administration also says the law serves an important public purpose.\n\n\"Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended,\" U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrelli said in a court filing. He said contraceptives \"reduce the risk of adverse outcomes of pregnancies that are too closely spaced.\" Women's groups say oral contraceptives also reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50 percent.\n\nBut the owners of the three companies challenging the contraceptive coverage law say they are not required to check their religious beliefs at the corporate door.\n\nPaul Clement, a lawyer for Hobby Lobby, said in a filing that the Supreme Court \"has never suggested that free exercise rights are purely personal, or that individuals could not exercise religion when in engaged in particular activities like making money or when using particular means like a corporation.\"\n\nIt can't be, he says, that the First Amendment singles out religious exercise as the only right that cannot be exercised while earning a living.\n\nThe companies are among more than three dozen for-profit corporations that challenged the contraceptive mandate in federal courthouses nationwide. Hobby Lobby and Mardel prevailed in the lower courts, but Conestoga Wood lost its claim.\n\nThe companies rely not only on the Constitution but also on a federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the federal government cannot \"substantially burden a person's exercise of religion,\" even if the burden results from a general law intended to apply to everyone.\n\nThey have the support of friend-of-court briefs from religious groups as well as 21 states and 107 members of the U.S. House and Senate. Neither the Constitution nor federal laws, they argue, can deprive a group \u2014 even a for-profit corporation \u2014 of religious freedom.\n\nThe ACLU and other civil liberties groups line up on the other side. Julian Bond, former chairman of the NAACP, warns that while religious motivations have inspired reforms toward social justice, \"religion has frequently played the opposite role in our nation's history, invoked by those who sought to perpetuate discrimination based on race or gender.\"\n\nSlavery and Jim Crow laws, Bond says, were once defended on religious grounds.\n\nThe Supreme Court will issue its decision sometime before the term ends in late June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The argument is the most closely watched of this year's Supreme Court term.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/supreme-court-takes-dispute-over-obamacare-religion-n58041", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_12/267221/140320-supreme-court-building-1638_270584ad8e0c4320a6cced0bb491c96f.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The argument is the most closely watched of this year's Supreme Court term."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The argument is the most closely watched of this year's Supreme Court term.", "title": "Supreme Court Takes Up Dispute Over Obamacare and Religion - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_12/267221/140320-supreme-court-building-1638_270584ad8e0c4320a6cced0bb491c96f.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-21", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/supreme-court-takes-dispute-over-obamacare-religion-n58041", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,U.S. news,Crime & Courts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbff\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday takes up the most closely watched issue of its term: Does the Obamacare law violate the religious freedom of private employers by requiring them to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives?\nThe Obama administration says freedom of religion applies only to the owners of companies challenging the law, not to the companies themselves.\nThe Obama administration says they do not, arguing that freedom of religion is an individual right, not a corporate one.\nNeither the Constitution nor federal laws, they argue, can deprive a group \u2014 even a for-profit corporation \u2014 of religious freedom.\nAnd because the Supreme Court has never said that a for-profit corporation can claim it has freedom of religion, the government says, the law does not violate the Constitution."}
