Let\u2019s just say things didn\u2019t look good Sunday night,\u201d he posted on Facebook. \u201cBut thanks to a combination of good doctors, decent hospital food and 2nd term Obamacare, I\u2019m doing much better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMoore said he was scheduled to be discharged Friday, but it was not clear Saturday whether he had been released. In his postings form the hospital, Moore asked supprters to help promote his new movie because he had to cancel his scheduled appearances.\n\nMoore has said the U.S. health care system is broken.\n\n\u201cWe have to work toward Medicare for all, so that everyone\u2019s covered, a single-payer system, all these things,\u201d he has said. \u201cIn the end, we can\u2019t allow private insurance \u2014 people making a profit off of people getting sick. Private insurance is not the way to go.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn light of those comments, there was no information released on how Moore paid for his treatment.\n\nMoore\u2019s newest film Where to Invade Next, is scheduled to be released Friday.
