One is an excellent photographer, while his wife has cut off my head in many travel photos.\n\nOf course, visiting Hoover Dam is one of the top 10 free things to do in Southern Nevada. Grabbing a glimpse of engineering magnificence draws a million visitors every year to take a tour.\n\nBut last Sunday was different. As a local, I had toured the dam countless times. This trip was to walk the bridge that overlooks the dam, to see it from a unique and memorable perspective. And to take photos.\n\nWe were not the only ones walking the bridge thinking and talking about Heather Price Papayoti\u2019s suicide on Jan. 10.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t look down at the Colorado River 900 feet below and fail to imagine the 42-year-old woman\u2019s last minutes, or wonder about the cause, especially since we were there near sunset, about the time she jumped to her death.\n\nShe had been so deliberate in her actions, taking a cab from Tempe, Ariz., after a behavioral counseling meeting. The drive was 280 miles long, plenty of time for her to think.\n\nAt sunset, there aren\u2019t as many people. It\u2019s colder. There\u2019s a magnificent shadow of the bridge itself splayed across Hoover Dam \u2014 a photographer\u2019s dream.\n\nThen going down to the dam itself, we looked up and saw the new bridge and envisioned a woman falling, falling, falling.\n\nHer family has asked for stronger safety measures to deter future suicides. But then people could simply go down to the dam itself, where the wall is shorter and easier to crawl over than the bridge.\n\nIt\u2019s simply impossible to suicide-proof the world or every bridge.\n\nPapayoti\u2019s Facebook page shows a pretty blonde wearing a helmet and sun glasses. Perhaps it\u2019s skydiving gear. She\u2019s a fan of the Cleveland Browns. Born in 1971, she graduated from Bristol High School in 1989 in Bristol, R.I. She said her hometown was West Farmington, Ohio, and she last lived in Ahwahtukee, Ariz., an urban village annexed by Phoenix. The page said she had attended Kent State University and worked at Honeywell International.\n\nHer family issued a statement that said: \u201cWe were blessed with her laughter and light for all the years we shared with her. Sadly the darkness of depression and anxiety consumed her in recent months and despite treatment, she was unable to conquer it.\u201d\n\nSince the bridge opened in October 2010, seven people have committed suicide. This one was unique because a Boulder City woman photographing the scene captured Papayoti, looking down at the dam, her shoulder reaching to the top of the bridge\u2019s guardrail. It\u2019s narrow enough so that people cannot stand atop it, like they do the Hoover Dam walls. But it\u2019s not so high it can\u2019t be climbed. A foot on the ledge below, another foot on the guardrail, and it\u2019s over the wall. There\u2019s no place to stand and reconsider.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge is a suicide magnet, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times in September. It\u2019s considered the No. 1 suicide site in the United States, partly because access is easy. The railing is 4 feet high. (The O\u2019Callaghan-Tillman bridge railing is 4 feet, 6 inches high, tall enough for a short woman to peek over.) Over the years, an estimated 2,000 people have died after jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe George Washington Memorial Bridge in Seattle is the second deadliest bridge in the United States, while the San Diego-Coronado Bridge is considered the third deadliest.\n\nJohn Bateson, author of \u201cThe Final Leap: Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge,\u201d wrote that research shows that people fixate on a particular form of death. If a bridge isn\u2019t available, they don\u2019t go find another way. He urged the creation of a safety net to catch jumpers. He said out of the small number of jumpers who survive \u201cnearly all have said afterward it was the Golden Gate Bridge or nothing. They didn\u2019t have a Plan B.\u201d\n\nHe supported the concept of spending the money to prevent suicides from bridges.\n\nThat goes against the popular thought that people wishing to commit suicide would find another way.\n\nI agree with the Nevada Department of Transportation official quoted in the Review-Journal who said netting would appeal to daredevils who would jump, thinking it would be fun.\n\nThe bridge didn\u2019t kill Heather Papayoti. She killed herself.\n\nAs much as we\u2019d like to protect everyone, our world cannot be bubble-wrapped.\n\nJane Ann Morrison\u2019s column appears Monday, Thursday and Saturday.
