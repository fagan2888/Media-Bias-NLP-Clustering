Chris Christie in recent Granite State polling \u2014 a simple numbers argument, made after Fiorina finished ahead of Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in Tuesday\u2019s Iowa Caucuses.\n\nYet despite this straightforward approach, it\u2019s hard not to discern a bit of larger symbolism in Ayotte going to bat for her party\u2019s only female White House hopeful. She and Fiorina are a rare breed in American politics \u2014 conservative Republican women who defy conventional gender politics. They oppose government spending and abortion rights with equal vigor, and they\u2019re both challenging traditional (read: liberal) notions of feminism even as a more traditional feminist may win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nOf the two, Fiorina is more explicit about trying to change the dialogue. In a presidential field full of Republicans who attack Hillary Clinton, she\u2019s perhaps the Democratic candidate\u2019s chief antagonist. She talks constantly about wanting to debate Clinton in the general election and she\u2019s attacked the former secretary of State harshly in the meantime. (\u201cUnlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband,\u201d she said at a Fox Business debate last month.)\n\nFiorina also sought explicitly to redefine feminism in a speech on the subject in October. \u201cFeminism began, of course, as a rallying cry to empower women,\u201d she said, \u201cto vote, to get an education, to enter the workplace. But over the years, feminism has devolved into a left-leaning political ideology where women are pitted against men and used as a political weapon to win elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cA feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses,\u201d Fiorina declared. \u201cA woman may choose to have five children and home school them. She may choose to become a CEO or to become a candidate.\u201d\n\nAs a candidate, Fiorina has rejected \u201cthe progressive view of feminism,\u201d talking instead about reducing out-of-wedlock births and supporting over-the-counter birth control.\n\nAyotte is also making this conservative case for contraception as she\u2019s facing a tough re-election bid in New Hampshire. She even raises the issue in one of her early campaign web videos. Left-leaning women\u2019s groups argue she\u2019s trying to distract from her opposition to the Affordable Care Act and its contraception mandate \u2014 and that her plan would make birth control more expensive \u2014 but the senator\u2019s stance allows her to square limited government principles with a message aimed at women.\n\nIt\u2019s not her only such message either. Ayotte is running on her support for \u201cflex time \u201d for working mothers as well as employers providing \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for women working during pregnancy. Almost all of the videos on her campaign YouTube page thus far are targeted at women, including a flattering feature story on CBS News about how she and other female senators work well together in a bipartisan way.\n\n\u201cWhile values trump gender, one thing we do find about women is they\u2019re generally more collegial and focused on problem solving,\u201d said Mindy Finn, founder of the conservative women\u2019s group Empowered Women. Finn thinks conservatives like Ayotte and Fiorina are valuable to disproving the fallacy that all women agree on political issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not as common for conservative women to run, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly common,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked about the effect of Fiorina\u2019s run, Finn said it gives young conservative women a model to emulate \u2014 a powerful right-of-center woman with a record of accomplishment.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that there were many debates where the majority of pundits felt that she won,\u201d Finn said. \u201cShe was able to move herself based on polling from the under card debate to the main stage. \u2026 She\u2019s defied expectations.\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, Fiorina\u2019s Super PAC was still pushing for her inclusion in ABC\u2019s debate. The group\u2019s creative team released a satirical promo for the news network : \u201cOn Disney\u2019s ABC, we\u2019ve Frozen Carly out, turned the debate Inside Out \u2014 all part of our Mickey Mouse operation.\u201d Meanwhile, Fiorina\u2019s campaign pledged to air a television ad in New Hampshire during Sunday\u2019s Superbowl\n\nFollow Graham on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Kelly Ayotte made the case Thursday for including Carly Fiorina in Saturday's Republican presidential debate, the New Hampshire senator's\u00a0argument had", "og": {"site_name": "InsideSources", "description": "When Kelly Ayotte made the case Thursday for including Carly Fiorina in Saturday's Republican presidential debate, the New Hampshire senator's\u00a0argument had", "title": "Advocating for Fiorina, Ayotte Boosts a Kindred Spirit in New Hampshire \u2013 InsideSources", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/18135263992_f94f150051_o.jpg", "url": "http://www.insidesources.com/advocating-fiorina-ayotte-boosts-kindred-spirit-new-hampshire/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Kelly Ayotte made the case Thursday for including Carly Fiorina in Saturday's Republican presidential debate, the New Hampshire senator's\u00a0argument had", "creator": "@InsideSourcesDC", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/18135263992_f94f150051_o.jpg", "title": "Advocating for Fiorina, Ayotte Boosts a Kindred Spirit in New Hampshire \u2013 InsideSources", "site": "@InsideSourcesDC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.insidesources.com", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-02-06T15:59:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s still not as common for conservative women to run, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly common,\u201d she said.\nFinn thinks conservatives like Ayotte and Fiorina are valuable to disproving the fallacy that all women agree on political issues.\nShe and Fiorina are a rare breed in American politics \u2014 conservative Republican women who defy conventional gender politics.\nWhen Kelly Ayotte made the case Thursday for including Carly Fiorina in Saturday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, the New Hampshire senator\u2019s argument had nothing to do with gender.\nAyotte is also making this conservative case for contraception as she\u2019s facing a tough re-election bid in New Hampshire."}
