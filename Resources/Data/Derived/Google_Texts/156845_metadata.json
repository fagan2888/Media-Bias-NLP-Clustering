As Joseph Walker and George Stahl note in the Wall Street Journal , \u201cInsurance companies are aiming to hold down healthcare costs by paying less for services from doctors and hospitals, who then look to reduce supply-chain expenses by using fewer vendors in exchange for greater discounts. That\u2019s pushing device makers like Abbott to offset pricing pressure from their customers with deals that let them offer greater volume and more products.\u201d\n\nAs we reported last week, the acquisition will allow Abbott and St. Jude to compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market and hold the No. 1 or 2 positions across large, high-growth cardiovascular device markets. \u201cThis best-in-class combined portfolio will have the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health, reduce costs for payors and deliver greater value to customers,\u201d said the companies in a press release announcing the deal. When combined, the merged company will have annual cardiovascular sales of $8.7 billion, according to the Journal.\n\nThe dynamics of the healthcare market, shaped by Obamacare as well as industry fundamentals, will continue to favor consolidation. As noted by MassDevice, \u201cWhile a good number of the large M&A deals have been concentrated in the cardiovascular and orthopedic segments, which have been plagued by large, heavily mature product categories, we should expect to see more consolidation generally.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that healthcare companies are second only to the technology industry in global deal activity thus far this year. The tech sector made $145.78 billion in deals so far compared with $121.12 billion for the healthcare industry, according to data from Dealogic cited in the Wall Street Journal article.\n\nTaking the long view, StarTribune columnist Lee Shafer sees the medical technology industry following a cycle of consolidation articulated more than a dozen years ago by management consulting firm A.T. Kearney in the Harvard Business Review .\n\n\u201cThe first stage is when a few upstarts jump out to lead in a market that\u2019s just developing, aggressively grabbing market share to make it tougher for others to jump in. Stage two is about getting bigger, buying competitors and complementary product lines,\u201d writes Shafer.\n\nThat\u2019s followed by a period of megadeals and large-scale consolidation with the goal of being among a handful of industry powerhouses.\n\n\u201cThe last stage is where the medical device industry is headed, if it\u2019s not already there,\u201d continues Shafer. At that point, a handful of companies split up the market. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly where Abbott wants to be, joining the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic.\u201d\n\nOn its path to the medtech firmament, however, Abbott will need to clear one hurdle that has to do with another acquisition it made in February. Abbott agreed to buy in vitro diagnostic test maker Alere for $5.8 billion, an acquisition that would make it a leader in the rapidly growing point-of-care diagnostics sector.
