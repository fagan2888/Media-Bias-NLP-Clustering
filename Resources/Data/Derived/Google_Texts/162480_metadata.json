The data comes from a report by Australia\u2019s Climate Council.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAustralia instituted a carbon tax in 2012, but ended it last July after a push from conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott. In its place, Abbott had favored instituting a system to pay polluters that cut their emissions.\n\nThe country had seen its emissions fall by 11 percent the two years the tax was in place, but they increased by 4.3 percent last year.\n\nThe report comes as Australian officials works on a emissions reduction goal ahead of a United Nations climate conference later this year. The Climate Council \u2014 which had pushed Australia to reduce its emissions by 30 percent within the next ten years \u2014 said the country isn\u2019t doing enough to contribute to to an international climate deal.\n\n\u201cThe news that emissions have gone up in Australia will do little to counter the impression that Australia is acting as a \u2018free rider\u2019 on the back of other countries\u2019 efforts,\u201d Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie said, according to the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Australia\u2019s electric utilities increased their carbon emissions after the country ended its carbon tax last year.", "description": "Australia\u2019s electric utilities increased their carbon emissions after the country ended its carbon tax last year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Australia\u2019s electric utilities increased their carbon emissions after the country ended its carbon tax last year.", "title": "Australia electric emissions rise after carbon tax ends", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/246929-australia-electric-emissions-rise-after-carbon-tax-ends", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/sydneyoperahouse07062015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/246929-australia-electric-emissions-rise-after-carbon-tax-ends", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-06T11:47-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-06T11:47:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/246929-australia-electric-emissions-rise-after-carbon-tax-ends", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Australia\u2019s electric utilities increased their carbon emissions after the country ended its carbon tax last year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Australia electric emissions rise after carbon tax ends"}, "dcterms.title": "Australia electric emissions rise after carbon tax ends"}, "article_summary": "Australia\u2019s electric utilities increased their carbon emissions after the country ended its carbon tax last year.\nADVERTISEMENTAustralia instituted a carbon tax in 2012, but ended it last July after a push from conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nEmissions from the country\u2019s electricity grid increased by 6.4 metric tons during the last fiscal year, the Associated Press reported Sunday.\nThe country had seen its emissions fall by 11 percent the two years the tax was in place, but they increased by 4.3 percent last year.\nThe report comes as Australian officials works on a emissions reduction goal ahead of a United Nations climate conference later this year."}
