Madden was arrested Friday and charged with murder and sex crimes in the death of Gabriella Doolin, a 7-year-old Kentucky girl whose body was found in a creek minutes after she disappeared during a football game Saturday night, Nov. 14. (Photo: Sky Walker/WKRN via AP)\n\nA Kentucky man was indicted Friday on charges of kidnapping, raping and killing a 7-year-old girl whose body was found in a creek soon after she disappeared from a youth football game.\n\nFollowing the indictment in Scottsville, Kentucky, local Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Clint Willis said he had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty against Timothy Madden, who is charged in Gabriella Doolin\u2019s death last month.\n\nWillis said he planned to discuss the matter with the child\u2019s family after the holidays.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a meeting you would want to have with this family right before Christmas,\u201d Willis said in a phone interview.\n\nMadden, a former construction worker who has maintained his innocence, was indicted on murder, kidnapping, first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy charges. His arrest warrant says the child died of manual strangulation and drowning.\n\nShe disappeared while attending a Nov. 14 game to cheer on her brother. She was found dead less than a half-hour later in a creek. The death and arrest of a local man stunned people in Scottsville, a town of about 5,000 near the Tennessee state line. On the day of the child\u2019s funeral, residents lined streets holding pink and blue balloons that were released as the hearse drove by.\n\nMadden\u2019s attorney, Travis Lock, said Friday he was not surprised by the indictment.\n\n\u201cThis gets us one step closer in the process to the time when we will be entitled to the evidence that the commonwealth possesses to support its belief that they have the right guy,\u201d Lock said by phone.\n\nMadden\u2019s next court appearance is an arraignment set for Jan. 13 in Allen Circuit Court. Madden pleaded not guilty at his initial appearance last month in district court.\n\nThe police citation said Madden\u2019s DNA collected during the investigation matched that recovered from the child during the autopsy. So far, Lock said, he has received a two-page preliminary DNA report. Willis said some DNA evidence is still being tested.\n\nMeanwhile, Lock said he was denied access to meet with Madden on the day of his client\u2019s arrest. Lock said he was contacted by a Madden relative on the morning of the arrest, and Madden reached out to him shortly before taken into custody.\n\n\u201cThat is a clear-cut violation of Timothy Madden\u2019s civil rights,\u201d Lock said.\n\nMadden, in his late 30s, professed his innocence in a jailhouse media interview after his arrest. Lock said he first met with Madden the day after the arrest.\n\nLock\u2019s complaint was downplayed by Willis, who said: \u201cIf he didn\u2019t say anything incriminating during those meetings, what difference does it make? I\u2019m not really sure how it comes into play.\u201d\n\nLock also is trying to track down surveillance video from local convenience stores that might show his client before and after the child\u2019s death. Lock said Friday he\u2019s been told the video exists and is being preserved but he has yet to see it.\n\nNo decision has been made on whether to ask that the trial be moved, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly something we will very seriously consider when that time comes,\u201d Lock said.\n\nAnother high-profile child slaying occurred this week in Kentucky. An Indiana man has been indicted on a murder charge after police say he fatally stabbed 6-year-old Logan Tipton in the head during a burglary in Versailles in central Kentucky.\n\nPolice said the kindergartner was killed in his bed in the pre-dawn attack. A Woodford County grand jury charged Ronald Exantus, 32, with murder, first-degree burglary, two counts of second-degree assault and one count of fourth-degree assault.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1QCWFSd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Kentucky man was indicted Friday on charges of kidnapping, raping and killing a 7-year-old girl.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "A Kentucky man was indicted Friday on charges of kidnapping, raping and killing a 7-year-old girl.", "title": "Murder, other charges for man in girl\u2019s death", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/12/12/murder-other-charges-man-girls-death/77202934/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Kentucky man was indicted Friday on charges of kidnapping, raping and killing a 7-year-old girl.", "title": "Murder, other charges for man in Gabriella Doolin's death", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c157ad3f7ab198e014c7004bc2cbfca57a77f487/c=236-0-965-729&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Child abduction", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Child abduction", "title": "Murder, other charges for man in girl\u2019s death", "author": "Bruce Schreiner", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/crime", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c12293288ce0c0018961fd1f767ebff4fbc48459/c=327-0-874-729/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/681755fbaaf9913e6d529adbace384f3e2dbacea/c=236-0-965-729/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecf82eeaa0008a90900152b7bac59f5b9f4fc83d/c=115-0-1085-729/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/88bfbefa39d3d9aa9d27d1ad2d7d1a02ee54490e/c=0-26-1200-704&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-12T10:39:28.753000-05:00", "shorthed": "Murder, other charges for man in girl\u2019s death", "articleid": 77202934, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/771a5f788e178ca564bdb8ae965bb781746844a6/c=0-26-1200-704/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16bf59fcd2f41e2465cb4e9d267d2ce78774101e/c=396-0-804-729/local/-/media/2015/11/20/Louisville/Louisville/635836379145597279-Missing-Girl-Homicide-init.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Gabriella Doolin, Timothy Madden,"}, "article_summary": "Following the indictment in Scottsville, Kentucky, local Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Clint Willis said he had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty against Timothy Madden, who is charged in Gabriella Doolin\u2019s death last month.\nMadden, a former construction worker who has maintained his innocence, was indicted on murder, kidnapping, first-degree rape and first-degree sodomy charges.\nThe death and arrest of a local man stunned people in Scottsville, a town of about 5,000 near the Tennessee state line.\nA Woodford County grand jury charged Ronald Exantus, 32, with murder, first-degree burglary, two counts of second-degree assault and one count of fourth-degree assault.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a meeting you would want to have with this family right before Christmas,\u201d Willis said in a phone interview."}
