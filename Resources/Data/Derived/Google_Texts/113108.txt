Death is a certainty, but as author Ann Neumann finds, medical technologies have changed what dying means.

In her new book, “The Good Death,” Neumann sets out to understand what dying looks like, and what a “good death” means today. Her journey was sparked by a personal tragedy. Neumann’s father was diagnosed with lymphoma, and she left her job to care for him full-time.

After his passing, she volunteered as a hospice volunteer, talked to advocates working to legalize assisted suicide in the country, and attended meetings with those who are opposed to the idea.

Ann Neumann will be talking about her new book, "The Good Death” tomorrow, March 29, at 12:00 p.m. at an event at the University of Southern California. For more information and to RSVP, click here.
