I know, I know: The question itself sounds like a stupid conservative caricature of liberal excess. But a friend sent along the text of the following provision, which is buried on page 930 of the president\u2019s FY 2015 budget proposal. She thought it looked \u201cfishy.\u201d I must agree:\n\nPerhaps a budget expert can steer me in the right direction here, but that passage certainly reads like a proposal to allocate $575 million in taxpayer dollars to fund abortions (\u201creproductive health\u201d is the correct euphemism, yes?) in corners of the globe where human population growth is deemed (by whom?) to be \u201cthreatening\u201d plants and animals. A creepy Malthusian dystopia. I keep trying to convince myself that I must be misinterpreting this, but I also remember that upon entering office, President Obama appointed a \u201cscience czar\u201d with a disturbing paper trail. In a 2009 Politifact analysis \u2014 which rated some conservative criticisms of John Holdren \u201cpants on fire\u201d false \u2014 the left-leaning fact-checkers conceded that Holdren did, in fact, co-author a volume that discussed a number of radical population control measures:\n\nIn a section on \u201cInvoluntary Fertility Control,\u201d Holdren and the other authors discuss various \u201ccoercive\u201d means of population control \u2014 including putting sterilants in the drinking water. But they stop well short of advocating such measures\u2026Later, the authors conclude, \u201cMost of the population control measures beyond family planning discussed above have never been tried. Some are as yet technically impossible and others are and probably will remain unacceptable to most societies \u2026 \u201cCompulsory control of family size is an unpalatable idea, but the alternatives may be much more horrifying\u201d\u2026The authors argue that compulsory abortions could potentially be allowed under U.S. law \u201cif the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society.\u201d Again, that\u2019s a far cry from advocating or proposing such a position.\n\nThe point of dredging this up is not to relitigate the Holdren controversy; it\u2019s simply a reminder that the Obama administration has embraced some rather extreme figures and policy positions on these issues. So again I ask, with all sincerity: Does the president\u2019s new budget propose funding overseas abortions to combat \u201cthreats\u201d to \u201cbiodiversity\u201d? Or am I missing something? Maybe this idea is limited to various forms of birth control, which is covered by the \u201cfamily planning\u201d distinction. But as I noted above, \u201creproductive health\u201d is one of the Left\u2019s code words for abortion. One of this president\u2019s first official acts was to lift the federal restriction on subsidizing abortions abroad, so he\u2019s unlikely to harbors any moral qualms on this. In any case, what\u2019s the explanation for the environmentalist stipulations?\n\nUPDATE \u2013 A Capitol Hill budget maven notes that President Bush\u2019s last budget contained somewhat similar language, but within the context of fighting AIDS, not saving the planet. The Bush administration also barred taxpayer funds from financing overseas abortions.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Real question: Does Obama\u2019s budget fund overseas abortions to protect endangered animals?", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "No, seriously \u2014 does it? \u00a0I know, I know: The question itself sounds like a stupid conservative caricature of liberal excess.
