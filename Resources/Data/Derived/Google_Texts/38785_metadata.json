The groups discovered Aetna funneled more than $3 million to the American Action Network, a not-for-profit conservative organization that qualifies as a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d group under the Internal Revenue Service code. Aetna also gave more than $4 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the pro-business 501(c)(6) trade group.The American Action Network and the Chamber of Commerce have been fierce opponents of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of health insurance. Conversely, Aetna has generally supported the ACA and viewed the law as favorable to its business.Not-for-profit 501(c)(4) organizations such as the American Action Network are not required to publicly disclose their funding sources, and they can be involved with lobbying and political campaigns as long as that is not their \u201cprimary activity,\u201d according to the IRS . Those organizations, known as \u201cdark money\u201d groups because of their opaque financial connections, have proliferated since the 2010 Citizens United decision loosened restrictions between companies and political contributions.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini replied to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in June 2012, saying his company was not trying to influence the electoral process. \u201cNo funds were provided to these organizations for lobbying purposes,\u201d Bertolini wrote . \u201cHowever, we have provided funds to these organizations for educational activities.\u201dEvery year, Aetna also releases a political contribution report. In 2013, Aetna spent almost $6 million on state and federal lobbying through trade associations and political action committees. However, the reports make no mention of social welfare groups like the American Action Network.\u201cWe agree that transparency and accountability with respect to political expenditures are important,\u201d Aetna said in a statement. \u201cThe company complies fully with all state and federal laws concerning the disclosure of its political and lobbying activity.\u201dMany investors have not been satisfied with Aetna's responses. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli led the charge for the proposal at Aetna's annual shareholder meeting this year. DiNapoli is a trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S., which holds more than 1.2 million Aetna shares. He said that \u201cfunding partisan organizations like the Chamber and AAN may not be in the best interests of Aetna and its shareholders.\u201d\u201cWe need to know whether Aetna is using our investment in ways that benefit long-term value or if it is putting the company's reputation and its bottom line at risk,\u201d DiNapoli said last week in a news release . \u201cAetna should join the growing ranks of major corporations that have chosen to pull back the curtain on their political spending.\u201dUltimately, 71% of Aetna shareholders voted against the proposal . Similar proposals failed at Aetna's 2012 and 2014 meetings. Political science experts say these types of votes at publicly traded companies have been increasingly common since the Citizens United decision, even though they often flop. But many investors are still pushing to know if their money is being used to fund groups that advance certain causes or support specific legislation.\u201cNot all 501(c) groups are equally transparent in their motives,\u201d said Robert Boatright , a political science professor at Clark University who studies political interest groups and campaign finance. \u201cOn the other hand, it's reasonable for shareholders to request a bit more disclosure of such expenditures, particularly because they are becoming more common.\u201d Lisa Gilbert , director of the Congress Watch division of advocacy group Public Citizen, said about one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies disclose all political spending. The New York State Common Retirement Fund has pushed seven of its portfolio companies to adopt those types of disclosures this year alone.The proposals are unpopular with company executives. David Primo , a political science professor at the University of Rochester and a contributing scholar at the conservative Mercatus Center, said that's because the proposals give activist investors a roadmap to go after companies on political grounds without any financial benefits \u201cIs it going to lead to better manager use of shareholder dollars? I think that's a very speculative sort of argument,\u201d Primo said in an interview.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington started a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2014 to create standard financial reporting of political activities. The group cited Aetna as one company that has not lived up to its commitment to provide full disclosure of all political spending.The petition has received approximately 1.2 million comments . \u201cIt's political spending, but it shouldn't be a political issue,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cIt's information investors want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Aetna shareholders voted against a measure that would have required the health insurance giant to disclose political donations made to not-for-profit groups.
