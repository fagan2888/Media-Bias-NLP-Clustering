Bush\u2019s Iraq misadventure and to spread more fairly the proceeds of a quarter-century-old boom for which they credited Bill Clinton. The Election Eve collapse of Lehman Brothers changed things. It showed that there had been no boom at all, only a multitrillion-dollar real-estate debauch that Clinton\u2019s and Bush\u2019s affordable-housing mandates had set in motion. It also showed how fast historians\u2019 likely rankings of presidents can shift: Clinton went from above average to below average, Bush from low to rock bottom.\n\nObama may wind up the most consequential of the three baby-boom presidents. He expanded certain Bush \u00adpolicies \u2014 Detroit bailouts, internet surveillance, drone strikes \u2014 and cleaned up after others. We will not know for years whether Obama\u2019s big deficits risked a future depression to avoid a present one, or whether the respite he offered from \u201chumanitarian invasions\u201d made the country safer. Right now, both look like significant achievements. Yet there is a reason the president\u2019s approval ratings have fallen, in much of the country, to Nixonian lows. Even his best-functioning policies have come at a steep price in damaged institutions, leaving the country less united, less democratic, and less free.\n\nHealth-care reform and gay marriage are often spoken of as the core of Obama\u2019s legacy. That is a mistake. Policies are not always legacies, even if they endure, and there is reason to believe these will not. The more people learn about Obamacare, the less they like it \u2014 its popularity is still falling, to a record low of 37 percent in November. Thirty states have voted to ban gay marriage, and almost everywhere it survives by judicial diktat.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "01-13-15", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "01-13-15", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/01/13/history-will-eviscerate-him-obama-will-go-down-americas-gorbachev", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/ObamaLegacy011315.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "History Will Eviscerate Him: Obama Will Go Down as America's Gorbachev"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/ObamaLegacy011315.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"History Will Eviscerate Him: Obama Will Go Down as America's Gorbachev\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2015\\/01\\/13\\/history-will-eviscerate-him-obama-will-go-down-americas-gorbachev\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/ObamaLegacy011315.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-13T10:03:29-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"72202\"}", "prism.section": "nation", "dc.date": "2016-05-26", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"History Will Eviscerate Him: Obama Will Go Down as America's Gorbachev\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2015\\/01\\/13\\/history-will-eviscerate-him-obama-will-go-down-americas-gorbachev\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/ObamaLegacy011315.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-13T10:03:29-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"72202\"}", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "History Will Eviscerate Him: Obama Will Go Down as America's Gorbachev"}, "article_summary": "Thirty states have voted to ban gay marriage, and almost everywhere it survives by judicial diktat.\nHealth-care reform and gay marriage are often spoken of as the core of Obama\u2019s legacy.\nYet there is a reason the president\u2019s approval ratings have fallen, in much of the country, to Nixonian lows.\nObama may wind up the most consequential of the three baby-boom presidents.\nPolicies are not always legacies, even if they endure, and there is reason to believe these will not."}
