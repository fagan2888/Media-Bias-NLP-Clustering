MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) — Miami Dade College is trying to make it easier for its students to sign up for health care through the state exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.

The college, which has partnered with several local groups, hosted a workshop at its north campus on Saturday. They plan to hold a second one next weekend at its Kendall campus. Trained counselors will be onsite to answer questions and help students enroll.

Enticing young, healthy Americans to sign up for coverage is crucial to the success of so-called “Obamacare” as insurers are betting on them to balance out the cost of caring for older, sicker adults.

The college has one of the highest numbers of Hispanic students in the country. Federal health officials say two-thirds of uninsured residents in the Miami-area are Hispanic and can take advantage of the exchange.
