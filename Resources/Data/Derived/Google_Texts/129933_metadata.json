Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) would be the rare speaker with no prior House leadership experience. Credit: Getty Images\n\nBy of the\n\nIf Paul Ryan is going to succeed as speaker of the House, he is going to have to handle three daunting divides that make this arguably the toughest job in American politics today.\n\nOne is a tactical divide among House Republicans between a more purist and militant minority and a more pragmatic majority.\n\nOne is an extreme ideological divide between the two parties that has produced century-high levels of polarization.\n\nAnd one is a divided government in which a Democratic President, a GOP Senate constrained by the filibuster rule and a Republican House are almost never on the same page.\n\nCan any speaker succeed under these conditions? Can Ryan?\n\nHere are some reasons to think the Janesville Republican might overcome the obstacles before him, as well as some reasons to think he might not.\n\nFirst, why Ryan might succeed:\n\nHe has shown skills a speaker needs. Ryan would be the rare speaker with no prior House leadership experience. But as chairman of two committees, he has shown an ability to rally his caucus behind controversial legislation, has been a prolific fundraiser (for both himself and for the Republican National Committee) and has been adept and at ease with the media.\n\n\u201cPaul has the communication skills,\u201d says Wisconsin GOP colleague Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, who calls outgoing Speaker John Boehner \u201ca technician and fundraiser.\u201d\n\nSensenbrenner says Ryan\u2019s skills will be especially important when it comes to satisfying the party\u2019s frustrated base that House Republicans are doing everything they can to advance a conservative agenda despite the Democrats\u2019 control of the White House and their ability to use the filibuster to block bills in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cThe House \u2014 and Boehner specifically \u2013 has ended up being blamed for not being able to lay legislation on the president\u2019s desk for him to veto,\u201d says Sensenbrenner, who says one of Ryan\u2019s political tasks will be to help keep the GOP base energized, rather than angry at its own leadership, so it turns out in the 2016 election.\n\nHis colleagues like him. Ryan is collegial and has good relationships across the aisle, which could count for something on those occasions when Republicans and Democrats have to work together. Democrats hate his budgets and Medicare proposals, but they don\u2019t hate the author. In Wisconsin, you can\u2019t find a Democrat who will say a good word about Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Not so with Republican Ryan.\n\n\u201cHe has not been afraid to reach across the aisle to see if there is common ground,\u201d Democratic Rep. Ron Kind of La Crosse says.\n\n\u201cI disagree with him on so many things, but this is a guy that keeps his word, and that is worth its weight in gold around here,\u201d says Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee).\n\nThe GOP caucus has managed to overcome its divisions in getting behind Ryan. That\u2019s a start. The dysfunction among House Republicans is not just the product of an unruly caucus but leadership failures as well, says Catholic University political scientist Matthew Green, who wrote a book about the speakership. He says Boehner was erratic in how he punished party renegades and allowed alienation to brew to the point where there was not only dissent in the caucus but organized dissent in the form of the 40-member House Freedom Caucus. That was fatal.\n\n\u201cBoehner\u2019s leadership style has contributed to these divisions,\u201d Green says. \u201cA lot of folks have bought into this narrative that the Freedom Caucus is a perfectly cohesive group of bullies or terrorists, saying, \u2018You must do this or else.\u2019\u201d Green says that some of them have shown signs of flexibility, including their agreement to back Ryan without insisting he agree to a long list of demands.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of negotiation that makes a party work, and that allows it to keep its factions together,\u201d says Green.\n\nRyan \u201cwas able to unify diverse forces in the Republican conference this week. I was honestly surprised he was able to do that,\u201d Sensenbrenner said last week. He is one of the most conservative members of the House but a critic of the oppositional approach of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nRepublicans have a powerful political motivation to avoid a governing crisis.\n\nAs Sensenbrenner warns, \u201cif we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we\u2019re going to end up taking a shellacking in the election.\u201d\n\nRyan thinks the job is doable, and he\u2019s a smart guy. Could he be wrong? Sure. But he doesn\u2019t have a history of miscalculating. Every big career decision has worked out pretty well for him: using the job of House budget chair to become the domestic agenda-setter for his party; not running for Senate; not running for governor; passing up previous chances to run for House leadership.\n\n\u201cDespite being considered in many ways a policy nerd or whatever, he\u2019s actually pretty thoughtful politically,\u201d said Steve King, a Republican National Committee member from Wisconsin who has known Ryan since before he entered Congress.\n\nInterviewed before Ryan committed to the speaker\u2019s race, King said Ryan would do it if he thought there was \u201cnot only a good chance, but it\u2019s pretty certain\u201d he could make it work.\n\nAnd now, some reasons why Ryan might not succeed:\n\nThe hard-line House Freedom Caucus isn\u2019t going away. A large majority of its members have agreed to back Ryan for speaker, but it remains capable of massive disruption. It\u2019s unclear exactly how Ryan will treat all its demands for changes in the way House Republicans do business, and how the group will respond if it doesn\u2019t get what it wants.\n\n\u201cWe know what the Freedom Caucus is against but we don\u2019t know what the Freedom Caucus is for,\u201d says Sensenbrenner. \u201cTherein lies the problem.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not a magician. There are real questions about whether the House GOP caucus is governable right now under any speaker. For some GOP lawmakers and for some conservatives outside Congress, almost any deal or compromise with Democrats is a capitulation.\n\nYet Congress needs to pass funding bills and a debt-ceiling fix that will require some Democratic votes.\n\nThat will challenge the unity of the GOP caucus.\n\n\u201cThere is a group over there that is incapable of getting to yes,\u201d says Democrat Kind. \u201cAs the majority party, they do have a responsibility to govern. I don\u2019t know if Paul is going to be able to correct that situation.\u201d\n\nRyan will have to lead on a broader set of issues than he did as a committee chairman and master new skills. Ryan\u2019s focus has always been on economic, budget and fiscal issues, not social issues or foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be a policy specialist, but when you\u2019re speaker, you\u2019re going to have to deal with a whole range of issues that may be outside your comfort zone,\u201d says Green, the political scientist.\n\nRyan also will have to learn the art of using both carrots and sticks to enforce discipline in this caucus.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll have to meet one of the true tests of a successful speakership, says Green, which is to \u201cpass legislation that frames issues in ways that help his party and the presidential candidate of his party even if they don\u2019t become law.\u201d\n\nOne thing that both Republicans and Democrats can agree on is that the job of speaker is so challenging right now that Ryan\u2019s decision to seek it is a huge personal gamble.\n\nDemocrat Gwen Moore says she walked over to Ryan on the House floor about two weeks ago after the push began in the GOP caucus to draft him for speaker.\n\n\u201cI was concerned about him on a personal level, as a colleague and as a friend \u2026 that were he to take this job, he would inherit the same 40 or so Freedom Caucus people and that it would be no different for him,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI told him I was very concerned it was a fool\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nFollow Craig Gilbert on Twitter @WisVoter", "article_metadata": {"title": "4 reasons Paul Ryan might succeed as speaker \u2014 and 3 reasons he might not", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/336923261.html", "image": {"width": 1540, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/42801179-getty_493570930.jpg", "height": 1030}, "type": "article", "description": "If Paul Ryan is going to succeed as speaker of the House, he is going to have to handle three daunting divides that make this arguably the toughest job in American politics today.", "title": "Reasons Ryan may succeed as speaker \u2014 or not"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/42801179-getty_493570930.jpg", "description": "If Paul Ryan is going to succeed as speaker of the House, he is going to have to handle three daunting divides that make this arguably the toughest job in American politics today.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "4 reasons Paul Ryan might succeed as speaker \u2014 and 3 reasons he might not"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe know what the Freedom Caucus is against but we don\u2019t know what the Freedom Caucus is for,\u201d says Sensenbrenner.\nAnd now, some reasons why Ryan might not succeed:The hard-line House Freedom Caucus isn\u2019t going away.\nOne is a tactical divide among House Republicans between a more purist and militant minority and a more pragmatic majority.\nThere are real questions about whether the House GOP caucus is governable right now under any speaker.\nU.S. Rep.
