A Justice Department spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. The government has until Feb. 10 to file its own brief.\n\nGeneva College, which is affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, is one of 37 nonprofits challenging an Affordable Care Act mandate that requires them either to cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing medications or to sign a paper that certifies they morally object to providing the coverage.\n\nSigning the paper would trigger a process that would have a third party, such as a private insurer, provide the coverage.\n\nThe nonprofits contend the requirement violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that blocks the federal government from placing a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise unless it has a compelling reason to do so.\n\n\u201cThe government mandate is unlawful, unjust and unnecessary,\u201d said William J. Edgar, interim president of the college. \u201cGeneva College is confident that the Supreme Court will restore justice by upholding freedom of conscience and freedom of religion for all Americans.\u201d\n\nSome of the nonprofits, such as Geneva, object to providing coverage for abortion-inducing drugs but don't object to covering contraceptives. Others, including the nonprofits tied to the Pittsburgh and Erie Catholic dioceses, object to both.\n\nThe government regulation effectively relegates Catholic Charities and other diocese programs to \u201cjunior varsity\u201d status, said Paul M. Pohl, one of the lawyers representing the dioceses.\n\n\u201cIt's the first time in American history that religious organizations get divided into two categories,\u201d he said.\n\nThe underlying concern for the nonprofits is \u201cthat their health plans are being hijacked,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother brief, filed with the court by the dioceses Monday, argues that the government has failed to prove how the opt-out requirement is less restrictive than the government directly providing coverage for women whose health plans don't provide it.\n\nThe nonprofits initially won injunctions in Pittsburgh and Erie federal courts blocking the requirement, but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February overturned those rulings.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that signing the paper doesn't pose an additional burden on the nonprofits because they wouldn't be required to pay for the coverage. The dioceses and Geneva argued that signing the document makes them an active participant in providing the coverage and violates their religious freedom.\n\nThe government could fine the nonprofits if they refuse to provide the coverage and also refuse to sign the paper.\n\nBrian Bowling is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
