Yes, most of them were raised in locales where the Colorado conditions of Monday are commonplace, but they made two round trips to the Pepsi Center on game day.\n\nBut Roy said he didn\u2019t consider calling off the morning skate, or making it optional.\n\n\u201cBecause yesterday we stayed in the gym (for off-ice workouts), I thought it was good for us to be on the ice,\u201d Roy said. \u201cBut it seems like the guys like to be in the morning skate, to feel the puck. We were there 20 minutes, 30 minutes max, and the guys like that. I try to adapt to what they like in making sure we do whatever we can to let them be prepared for the game.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brad Stuart, Jan Hejda ready to play for Avalanche vs. Coyotes", "title": "Brad Stuart, Jan Hejda ready to play for Avalanche vs. Coyotes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/16/brad-stuart-jan-hejda-ready-to-play-for-avalanche-vs-coyotes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140415_121046_jan-hejda-avs-041514.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140415_121046_jan-hejda-avs-041514.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-16T12:28:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:15:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey had a good morning skate and they\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said.\n\u201cBut it seems like the guys like to be in the morning skate, to feel the puck.\nBut Roy said he didn\u2019t consider calling off the morning skate, or making it optional.\nDefensemen Brad Stuart (head and neck) and Jan Hejda (knee), banged up in the final stages of the Avalanche\u2019s victory over Dallas Saturday, will play Monday night against the Arizona Coyotes at the Pepsi Center.\nWe were there 20 minutes, 30 minutes max, and the guys like that."}
