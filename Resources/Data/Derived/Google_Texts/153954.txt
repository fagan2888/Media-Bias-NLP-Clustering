BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A father and son from western New York have been sentenced for drug dealing, and two other relatives are also likely prison-bound.

Federal prosecutors said Friday that 36-year-old Eric Humphrey of Amherst received a sentence of five years in prison, while his 55-year-old father, John Humphrey Jr., was sentenced to one year.

The men were among four relatives arrested in 2010 on charges they sold cocaine and crack cocaine. The others, Charles Humphrey Jr. and James Humphrey Jr., also have been convicted and are awaiting sentencing.

At the time of the arrests, authorities seized $153,000 in cash, cocaine, crack cocaine and marijuana, along with three vehicles. A liquor license for a Buffalo sports bar owned by Eric Humphrey was revoked.
