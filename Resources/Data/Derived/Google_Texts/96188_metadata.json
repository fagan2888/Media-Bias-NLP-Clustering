(Illustration: Graham Smith)\n\nAs a teenager, Noam Angrist was certain he was going to be a doctor. He\u2019d placed as a semi-finalist in the USA Biology Olympiad and was preparing for the pre-med track. Then, a life-threatening blood clot near his heart and lungs sent him to the hospital for three weeks. The experience made him see what he calls \u201cthe jarring failures in our health care system.\u201d\n\nWhen he got to MIT and started asking himself where he should focus \u201csuch that I could really add value in this world,\u201d he figured that, while being a doctor could be rewarding, we already have many superb physicians. \u201cWhat is really needed is a systemic overhaul,\u201d he realized. \u201cThat\u2019s how I fell in love with economics.\u201d\n\nHe started as a research assistant for Jonathan Gruber, helping the professor examine the impacts of the Affordable Care Act, work that involved analyzing massive datasets and interacting with top brass at the United States Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cIt was a life-changing experience,\u201d Angrist says, \u201cthat sealed my commitment to better understanding the social world around us via an awesome combination of compelling theory and empirical experimentation.\u201d\n\nEventually, Angrist wants to help establish what he envisions as \u201cthe equivalent of the FDA for social policy \u2014 a regulatory arm committed to ensuring that only social programs that add value, evidenced via research showing clear causal chains from interventions to social impact, \u2018go to market,\u2019 so to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the job. Being on the cutting edge, discovering what others haven\u2019t, bringing coherence to chaos, and catapulting into existence ideas and programs previously thought impossible, or not thought up at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile many accomplished academics advise key policymakers, I\u2019d love to take it a step further,\u201d Angrist says, \u201censuring that this body exists and has a heavy role in ensuring that the word \u2018evidence\u2019 is not thrown around lightly. What makes medicine effective, in addition to great doctors and technology, are drugs \u2014 stamped by the FDA \u2014 that actually work. Why don\u2019t we apply the same hard standard to social programming? Excellent social science is a key ingredient.\u201d\n\nFor others, creating a new government agency may sound quixotic. But at 23, Angrist has already been a policy analyst at the World Bank, where he created datasets on educational quality, and at the White House, where he helped think through ways to test technologies in conjunction with Google and the Department of Education, and wrote memos for President Obama on the \u201ccrowd-out effects of public health insurance.\u201d He\u2019s a Rhodes and a Fulbright scholar.\n\nAlso, he, along with a fellow Fulbright honoree, founded Young 1ove, a Botswana-based non-profit that teaches young Africans how not to get HIV.\n\n\u201cA little over a year ago, I heard the story of a young lady in Botswana\u2019s struggle with a coercive \u2018sugar daddy\u2019 who infected her with HIV,\u201d Angrist says. \u201cI was deeply moved, and a paper I had read in a development economics class invaded my brain.\u201d\n\nMIT\u2019s Jameel Poverty Action Lab had evaluated an hour-long \u201csugar daddy awareness\u201d class in Kenya that reduced teen pregnancy \u2014 a proxy for unprotected sex and HIV transmission \u2014 by 28 percent. \u201cIt was a landmark study showing positive impact. Yet it was never scaled,\u201d Angrist says. \u201cThe missed opportunity plagued me. A program like this in Botswana could have saved the lady I spoke with\u2019s life. I scouted the aid world for a seed grant, found one, and leapt into action.\u201d\n\nSo far, Angrist and his colleagues at Young 1ove have forged a partnership with the United Nations, put together a 200-page \u201cYoung-1ove-in-a-box\u201d curriculum, and trained 50 young staffers in Botswana. Equipped with a hard-won mandate from the Ministry of Education to reach every child in the nation, the organization\u2019s tested \u201csugar daddy awareness\u201d class has been given to 29,000 young people at 343 schools across Botswana, where 45 percent of 40-year-old men have HIV and \u201csugar daddies\u201d are, as Angrist puts it, \u201ca persistent parasite.\u201d The next step is to expand into Malawi, Zambia, Swaziland, Lesotho, and Namibia.\n\n\u201cThe community has embraced Young 1ove,\u201d Angrist says, \u201cin part because, contrary to typical engagements with AIDS initiatives, we are backed by evidence and a conviction to understand AIDS issues at the community level.\u201d\n\nAngrist was born and raised in Boston and grew up spending a lot of time in his mother\u2019s native Israel. (She\u2019s the head of Boston University\u2019s Hebrew program, and his father is an economist at MIT.) He says that Boston\u2019s concentration of academia showed him \u201cthe potential for sheer intellect and innovation to change the world, [while] Jerusalem taught me the importance of having cultural roots, and the ability for much to be accomplished in a short lifetime. Israel, in just a few decades, more than tripled its population, doubled wages, dropped infant mortality from 36.5 per 1,000 to just 3.9, and emerged as the \u2018start-up nation.\u2019 Perhaps I can harness my education and short life span to transcend boundaries, as my origins prove is possible.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not focused on econometrics, Angrist says, \u201cI\u2019m a total foodie. Bring on the Iron Chef battles, tastings, and late-night cooking.\u201d He also teaches calculus at the University of Botswana, runs workshops on development economics at high schools in Gaborone, and coaches crew \u2014 he prepared Botswana\u2019s first rowing team in preparation for the Youth African Games.\n\nA plaque on his desk reads CARPE DIEM. \u201cThere are a lot of things in life that you can get back,\u201d Angrist says, \u201cMoney, awards, pride, social connections, and so forth, but time is one thing you can never get back. Once a minute is gone, it\u2019s gone forever, so you have to make every single second count.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cInterests and Skills\u201d section of his curriculum vitae, alongside \u201cStata,\u201d \u201cHebrew,\u201d and \u201cBasic Setswana,\u201d lists \u201cRestaurant Waiting,\u201d \u201cFake Sugar,\u201d and \u201cEconometrics Jokes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to wanting to be a doctor, at some point Angrist also wanted to be a marine biologist: \u201cI was intrigued by the idea of discovering the unknown \u2014 the ocean \u2014 which, while murky and hard to understand, engulfs us, comprising over three quarters of our world. I gave that up when I realized that I could do the same thing as a social scientist and entrepreneur. That\u2019s the job. Being on the cutting edge, discovering what others haven\u2019t, bringing coherence to chaos, and catapulting into existence ideas and programs previously thought impossible, or not thought up at all.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll be publishing profiles of this year\u2019s list of the 30 top thinkers under 30 throughout the month of April.
