The Republican-controlled legislature has sent a right-to-work bill to the desk of Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat.\n\nThe governor has promised to block the legislation. But Republicans say they\u2019re already lining up the votes to overcome that veto. Barring any unforeseen developments, West Virginia soon will become the 26th state to adopt a right-to-work law.\n\nLong a bastion of organized labor, West Virginia has remained a blue state for most of the 20th century, voting in presidential elections for Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and against Republican George H.W. Bush in 1988. But its place on the political spectrum may have shifted significantly.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s regulatory \u201cwar on coal\u201d created casualties in the fossil fuel-dependent state and an opportunity for Republicans in 2014. During state elections that year, \u201cit seemed like everyone was running against Obama,\u201d Mike Plante, a longtime Democrat strategist based in Charleston, W.Va.,told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe Grand Old Party won big, taking control of the state legislature for the first time in 83 years. At the top of the Republican agenda: bringing West Virginia in line with the rest of the South on the right to work.\n\nMore than half of the states in the country have adopted right-to-work laws. And almost every state in the South is doing it. Currently, Kentucky and West Virginia are the only states holding out.\n\nThe legislation advanced out of the state Senate by a party-line vote, 17-16. The House last week followed suit, approving the measure 54-46. Tomblin has until Thursday to veto the bill.\n\nFor workers, the measure wouldn\u2019t change much. It simply ensures that the decision to join a union is voluntary and that employees cannot be forced to pay union dues. But for state economies, it could change everything. It\u2019s a prerequisite for many manufacturers, who say they\u2019ll locate only in right-to-work states.\n\nWest Virginia wants a piece of that action. Proponents say the move would provide a more hospitable environment to attract much-needed industry.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, has led the push for the legislation in the state Senate since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe realized it might be a politically unpopular thing to do,\u201d Carmichael told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut under previous leadership, West Virginia has taken the easy route, and the result is our last-place economic finish.\u201d\n\nThe Mountain State has been traveling downward on a rocky road in recent years. It ranks toward the bottom in most measures. In part the result of an anemic coal economy, the state regularly runs a budget deficit, and only half of West Virginians can find a job.\n\nFor seven consecutive years, Gallup has ranked West Virginia as the most \u201cmiserable\u201d state in America, based on its polling.\n\nLooking to neighboring right-to-work states, Carmichael says he hopes the legislation will \u201cresult in higher growth rates and just give us a chance to move up the economic ladder like everyone else.\u201d\n\nAnd although the Senate majority leader stopped short of calling the law an economic elixir, he pointed to a positive study by West Virginia University\u2019s Bureau of Business and Economic Research.\n\nCommissioned by the legislature, the WVU study reported that employment in right-to-work states \u201cgrew more rapidly\u201d than in states without such a law and \u201cby a factor of 5.7 between 1950 and 2014.\u201d\n\nThe study also concluded that the policy \u201cleads to long-run rates of GDP growth that are around 0.5 percentage points higher\u201d than states without the law.\n\nHoppy Kercheval, a longtime commentator on West Virginia politics, wrote that the law would result in $325 million in new growth\u2014something he called a \u201cneeded improvement\u201d but \u201ccertainly not a boom.\u201d\n\nBut Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, a Democrat, disputes those numbers and suspects Republican motives for pushing them. The bill amounts to \u201ca political tax on labor unions,\u201d he said.\n\nSince coming to power, Republicans have \u201cbeen running the political playbook of the Koch brothers,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cIt\u2019s very telling that their entire agenda seems to be trying to hurt people. I don\u2019t see anything that they\u2019re advancing to help people.\u201d\n\nCarmichael and Kessler both say they expect a fight in the next election. The minority leader said \u201cthe labor community, workers, and state employees\u201d are mobilizing.\n\nNational advocates on both side of the issue flocked to West Virginia as the debate amplified in recent years. They continue to choke local media markets with ads and deploy grassroots activists in a lobbying blitz on Charleston.\n\nDozens of national and local labor unions rallied in opposition. At a demonstration in front of the state house last March, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka promised to punish lawmakers who support right-to-work. He told the crowd:\n\nWe know who they are. We know what they are \u2026 [and] when you turn the light in a dark room full of cockroaches, those cockroaches scatter for cover everywhere. We\u2019re going to turn the lights on them every day until we take this state back.\n\nSo far, labor unions have made good on that promise. The West Virginia Democratic Party has registered challengers against every Republican supporter of a right-to-work law in the state Senate. And Carmichael isn\u2019t surprised.\n\nThe Senate majority leader said members of his party knew they could \u201cincur a political cost,\u201d but \u201cthey\u2019re willing to make a hard decision and do the right thing.\u201d\n\nRight now, West Virginia Republicans still enjoy broad support for their initiative. A West Virginia Metro News poll conducted in September showed that 60 percent of likely voters favor the law.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped both sides from targeting one of the state\u2019s key voting blocs: coal miners.\n\nPhil Smith, a spokesman for United Mine Workers of America, said nonunion workers benefit from safety protocols negotiated by unions. He argues that the legislation could be especially damaging to collective bargaining and do irreparable harm because of \u201cinherent dangers in coal mining.\u201d\n\nSmith calls right to work \u201cthe right to freeload.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a characterization that Jason Huffman, state director for the free-market group Americans for Prosperity, flatly rejects. He says union bosses have been using \u201cscare tactics\u201d to prove their point and notes that the current right-to-work bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything to roll back state or federal safety measures.\u201d\n\nHuffman points to an AFL-CIO \u201cDeath on the Job\u201d study that reported that 23 of 25 right-to-work states had fewer fatalities than West Virginia.\n\nSince early 2013, Americans for Prosperity has mined support for the effort. The son of a West Virginia coal miner, Huffman describes his group\u2019s efforts \u201cas an attempt to get us out of last place, and to bring jobs back into this big beautiful state.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Mountain State may not see an economic upswing immediately from the right-to-work campaign, upcoming elections will provide a roadmap.\n\n\u201cThis November will decide if the state continues to become more of a red state like the rest of the South,\u201d Kercheval said. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats are all on the record. It\u2019s a defining moment for West Virginia\u2019s political landscape.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "West Virginia's Republican legislature advances a right-to-work bill.
