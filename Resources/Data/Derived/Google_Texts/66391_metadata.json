Last year, Jindal founded what looks like a pre-presidential organizing committee called America Next. In its mission statement, Jindal says:\n\nThere is a great sense in this country that the leftwing Obama experiment has been a failure\u2026. A rebellion is brewing outside the Washington Beltway.\n\nAccording to The Weekly Standard, Jindal is putting together seasoned political operatives for America Next:\n\nJindal will serve as America Next\u2019s honorary chairman, while the day-to-day operations will be run by Jill Neunaber, a veteran of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign\u2026 Curt Anderson, a spokesman for America Next, says the group will have \u201cexperts all over the country, including Governor Jindal, working on policy plans.\u201d\n\nCurt Anderson helps run On Message Inc., a high-powered (and Louisiana-connected) political strategy and media firm. Anderson has worked for Steve Forbes and for the Bush/Cheney election team, and he helped elect Jindal governor. According to his On Message bio, \u201cIn 2010 Curt co-authored Governor Jindal\u2019s new book, Leadership and Crisis.\u201d Other professionals at On Message include Wes Anderson, Jindal\u2019s pollster, and Timmy Teepell, Jindal\u2019s top political strategist. His On Message bio says:\n\n[Teepell] served as Chief Strategist on Governor Jindal\u2019s re-election campaign and won it by a historic margin. Teepell directed Governor Jindal\u2019s transition successfully and later advised multiple new Governors on their transitions. In his job as Jindal\u2019s Chief of Staff, Teepell helped implement historic reforms that have turned his home state of Louisiana around. In recent years, Teepell served as a campaign consultant to the Republican Governors Association assisting in winning multiple races around the country.\n\nAnderson, who consults for America Next, is helping Jindal staff that organization up, too, says the Baton Rouge Advocate: Ad Policy\n\nThe governor\u2019s longtime political adviser Curt Anderson, of OnMessage Inc., confirmed Monday that Chris Jacobs is joining the nonprofit\u2019s staff as a policy director\u2026. Jacobs worked for Jim DeMint, a U.S. senator from South Carolina who now runs The Heritage Foundation.\n\nAnd National Review says that Jindal has tapped Spencer Zwick, a top fundraiser for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, \u201cfor an assist with introductions to some of the Romney campaign\u2019s top givers.\u201d\n\nIs Jindal running? It sure sounds like it. To Politico, he gave the usual demurral:\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no satisfying the press\u2019s appetite for all this 2016 speculation, and that\u2019s fine\u2014none of it matters in real life. The whole thing is ridiculous and we are getting way ahead of ourselves.\n\nOf course, by any standard measure, Jindal is indeed way ahead of himself. Still, the New Orleans Times-Picayune put his chances this way:\n\nJindal\u2019s move may have been savvy. Among the probable Republican presidential candidates, Jindal is often ignored or dismissed. In the wake of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s downfall, a stunt at the White House, well timed and expertly executed, could expose him to conservative primary voters who might find much to admire in a politician with the courage to confront Obama.\n\nBased on his record in Louisiana, his past as a politician and Washington policy geek, and his hiring of folks from outfits such as the Heritage Foundation, is seems clear that Jindal will present himself as an authentic far-right governor who\u2019s committed to dismantling the social safety net. He has experience in Washington trying to do exactly that. Back in the late 1990s, in a little-known part of his career but one that gets a mention on his official Republican Governors Association bio, Jindal was the executive director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. As such, Jindal was part of the group that laid the plans, only partially successful, to privatize and voucherize Medicare. GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe\n\nIn Louisiana, he tried and failed to enact a sweeping tax reform plan that would have eliminated the state\u2019s income tax and replaced it with a far more regressive sales tax. The idea was intensely unpopular in Louisiana, and the governor\u2019s popularity went into a steep dive as a result. As The New York Times, reporting on Jindal\u2019s defeat on the issue, said:\n\nThen he announced he was shelving it. \u201cGovernor, you\u2019re moving too fast, and we aren\u2019t sure that your plan is the best way to do it,\u201d Mr. Jindal said, describing what he had heard from legislators and citizens alike. \u201cHere is my response,\u201d he said. \u201cO.K., I hear you.\u201d The plan, to get rid of the state income and corporate taxes and replace the lost revenue with higher and broader sales taxes, was not dropped altogether. Mr. Jindal emphasized that he was still committed to losing the income tax, but that he would defer to the Legislature to suggest how exactly to make that work.\n\nBut Jindal isn\u2019t giving up on the idea. Said Teepell, \u201cYou go through temporary rough patches. But that\u2019s not going to slow him down.\u201d\n\nLike Christie, Jindal supports charter schools and vouchers and getting rid of teacher tenure. Unlike Christie, Jindal refused to accept the expansion of Medicaid under Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nDown in Lousiana, everyone knows he\u2019s running. Said Bob Mann, a former aide to the state\u2019s Democrats and a professor at Louisiana State University:\n\nYou don\u2019t get any argument from anybody down here that Jindal\u2019s running for president\u2014it\u2019s just an accepted fact, like the sun rising in the East. There\u2019s an overriding sense among insiders here\u2026that most of the higher-profile initiatives that he\u2019s embarking on here are all with the national audience in mind. He\u2019s totally devoted to building relationships outside of Louisiana. Louisiana is no longer in his focus\u2014he\u2019s looking way beyond us.\u201d\n\nAs for whether or not Jindal\u2019s tax initiative was really meant to pass or whether it was designed to win favor among national Republicans, Mann says: \u201cI question whether he really wants to do something or if he just wants the headline that he tried to do it, worked really hard and these nasty tax-raising Democrats foiled him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jindal_vp_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Bob and Barbara Dreyfuss", "description": "It seems that he is, but it isn\u2019t clear that other Republicans are taking him seriously.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "It seems that he is, but it isn\u2019t clear that other Republicans are taking him seriously.", "title": "Is Bobby Jindal Serious About 2016?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/bobby-jindal-serious-about-2016/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jindal_vp_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T07:50:50+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It seems that he is, but it isn\u2019t clear that other Republicans are taking him seriously.", "title": "Is Bobby Jindal Serious About 2016?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/bobby-jindal-serious-about-2016/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jindal_vp_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jindal_vp_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "March 3rd, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Is Bobby Jindal Serious About 2016?", "keywords": "Bobby Jindal, 2016 election, campaign, Louisiana, governors, Republicans, The Nation, Bob and Barbara Dreyfuss", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 110393, "sailthru.tags": "Campaigns and Elections,Elections,The Right,The Christie Watch", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "Bob and Barbara Dreyfuss", "published_time": "2014-03-03T19:24:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T07:50:50+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "It seems that he is, but it isn\u2019t clear that other Republicans are taking him seriously.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jindal_vp_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Anderson has worked for Steve Forbes and for the Bush/Cheney election team, and he helped elect Jindal governor.\nHis On Message bio says:[Teepell] served as Chief Strategist on Governor Jindal\u2019s re-election campaign and won it by a historic margin.\nAccording to his On Message bio, \u201cIn 2010 Curt co-authored Governor Jindal\u2019s new book, Leadership and Crisis.\u201d Other professionals at On Message include Wes Anderson, Jindal\u2019s pollster, and Timmy Teepell, Jindal\u2019s top political strategist.\nTeepell directed Governor Jindal\u2019s transition successfully and later advised multiple new Governors on their transitions.\nIn its mission statement, Jindal says:There is a great sense in this country that the leftwing Obama experiment has been a failure\u2026."}
