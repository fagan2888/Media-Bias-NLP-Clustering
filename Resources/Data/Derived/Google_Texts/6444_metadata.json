Supporters of the plan worried that the actual policies it called for would get tied up in Oregon and Washington.\n\nRepublicans controlled the Washing- ton state senate, supporters noted, and they\u2019d been cool to some of the more am- bitious emissions reduction ideas.\n\nBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer was no doubt aware of the dynamics and the stakes when he began pouring money into a pivotal special election for a single state Senate seat in Washington.\n\nDADDY GREENBUCKS\n\nSteyer cut his teeth at Farallon Capital Management, a massive hedge fund that he founded and led until 2012. He has since become the most politically potent environmentalist moneyman in the country.\n\nFarallon has come under fire for what critics say are environmentally destructive business practices, but Steyer is a darling of the environmental Left (Bill McKibben calls him \u201cdaddy greenbucks\u201d) for the money he has poured into the cause.\n\nIn Washington, Steyer\u2019s group, NextGen Climate Action, funneled money through two other independent expen- diture groups to support the reelection campaign of Democrat state Sen. Nathan Schlicher, and to attack his opponent, Republican state Rep. Jan Angel.\n\nThe race, Democrats in the state predicted, would decide which party enjoyed a de facto majority in the state Senate (two Democrats caucused with Republicans at the time, effectively giving the GOP its majority).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once leery about the supposed evils of unlimited campaign cash, liberals are now embracing a larger view of money's role in politics..05/23/2016 20:52:27PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Once leery about the supposed evils of unlimited campaign cash, liberals are now embracing a larger view of money's role in politics.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Dark Money Rising", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/02/02/dark-money-rising-n1787339", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/216/2013-08-04T130321Z_1_CBRE973109U00_RTROPTP_3_DREAMWORKS-EXPAND.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Once leery about the supposed evils of unlimited campaign cash, liberals are now embracing a larger view of money's role in politics.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Dark Money Rising", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/02/02/dark-money-rising-n1787339", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/216/2013-08-04T130321Z_1_CBRE973109U00_RTROPTP_3_DREAMWORKS-EXPAND.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Dark Money Rising, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98a5\"", "article_summary": "Republicans controlled the Washing- ton state senate, supporters noted, and they\u2019d been cool to some of the more am- bitious emissions reduction ideas.\nOctober 28, 2013 the governors of California, Oregon, Washington, and the premier of British Columbia signed a pact pledging to take a variety of actions to reduce carbon emissions.\nBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer was no doubt aware of the dynamics and the stakes when he began pouring money into a pivotal special election for a single state Senate seat in Washington.\nSupporters of the plan worried that the actual policies it called for would get tied up in Oregon and Washington.\nThe race, Democrats in the state predicted, would decide which party enjoyed a de facto majority in the state Senate (two Democrats caucused with Republicans at the time, effectively giving the GOP its majority)."}
