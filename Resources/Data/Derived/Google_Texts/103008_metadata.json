But the allotted time seemed to have left unanswered questions about other possibilities, which the court\u2019s subsequent order is now seeking.\n\nMark Rienzi, lead attorney for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented the Little Sisters of the Poor, called the court\u2019s order \u201can excellent development.\u201d\n\nHe said it shows the court \u201cunderstood the sisters\u2019 concern that the government\u2019s current scheme forces them to violate their religion.\u201d In a March 29 statement, he also said the attorneys \u201clook forward to offering alternatives that protect the Little Sisters\u2019 religious liberty while allowing the government to meet its stated goals.\u201d\n\nPriests for Life also reacted confidently, saying: \u201cWe see this as a positive development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court appears to be looking for a least restrictive alternative that would not burden our religious beliefs, which will ultimately mean that the government did not satisfy its burden under Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\u201d the group said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other side, some groups that filed amicus briefs on behalf of the Justice Department, which is representing the Obama administration, also viewed the court\u2019s action in a positive light.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the court\u2019s order as a twist she hadn\u2019t expected, but she also said the request for more information could be interpreted as a recognition that \u201ctaking contraception out of health plans is harmful.\u201d\n\nAnd Greg Lipper, senior counsel at Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said in a blog post that \u201cit\u2019s foolish to read tea leaves\u201d in the court\u2019s order, but he would do so anyway.\n\nHe called it \u201ca decent sign for the government,\u201d which he said signaled that at least five justices seemed to think that the challengers\u2019 proposed alternatives to the government\u2019s accommodation would \u201charm women by preventing them from receiving seamless and convenient coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the court thought that those other alternatives were sufficient, then it wouldn\u2019t be looking for a way to ensure that women retained accommodation-style seamless coverage,\u201d he added.\n\nVivian Hamilton, a law professor at William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Virginia, told Catholic News Service that although she would be careful about \u201creading too much into the justices\u2019 request for more information,\u201d it did seem to suggest that they are \u201cconsidering whether an accommodation might be crafted that would both permit the government to meet its compelling interest in ensuring that women have the ability to obtain contraceptive health coverage yet also respect religious employers\u2019 objection to participating \u2014 even indirectly \u2014 in the provision of such coverage.\u201d\n\nAnother interpretation, from legal analyst Lyle Denniston, who writes for http://www.scotusblog.com, a blog on the Supreme Court, said the specific wording of the court\u2019s order makes it seem that the justices have accepted, even if tentatively, the views of both sides.\n\nIf lawyers representing religious employers and the government do not come up with satisfactory answers to the order, Denniston said the justices will have to make their decision based on the oral arguments.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, the decision could very well hinge on the word \u201chijack,\u201d which was used seven times in the 94 minutes of oral arguments to refer to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments the government was \u201chijacking\u201d insurance plans to make religious groups provide contraceptive coverage against their will.\n\n\u201cThe petitioner has used the phrase \u2018hijacking,\u2019 and it seems to me that that\u2019s an accurate description of what the government wants to do,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts told U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote everyone is looking at in this case, also picked up on the hijacking theme. When Verrilli explained that it was necessary to include contraceptive coverage in employer health plans instead of in a separate plan, Kennedy said: \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary to hijack the plans.\u201d\n\nKennedy sided with the majority in the 2014 Hobby Lobby ruling when it said family-owned companies run on religious principles could object to the contraceptive coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act for religious reasons.\n\nIn the March 23 argument, Kennedy questioned whether it would be difficult for the government to arrange alternative access to contraceptive coverage that would not force religious groups to be complicit.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s so easy to provide, if it\u2019s so free, why can\u2019t they just get it through another plan?\u201d he asked.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s back to the drawing board for both sides to come up with more answers.\n\nAnd the only clear signal is that a decision on this case is not likely to come down soon, especially with the extra homework for both sides; it will likely be released near the end of the term in late June.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2016/04/04/courts-order-in-contraceptive-case-could-be-way-to-avoid-tie-decision/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/a6781dde4f564e6634578bdb1834b530-750x500.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Both sides in Little Sisters of the Poor case spin Justices' request for additional briefs as good news, while experts say it reveals a court looking to avoid a split decision.", "title": "Court\u2019s order in contraceptive case could be way to avoid tie decision"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the allotted time seemed to have left unanswered questions about other possibilities, which the court\u2019s subsequent order is now seeking.\nIn the March 23 argument, Kennedy questioned whether it would be difficult for the government to arrange alternative access to contraceptive coverage that would not force religious groups to be complicit.\nIn oral arguments, the discussion centered on health exchanges, grandfathered clauses and exemptions, and ways to provide seamless health care coverage.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s so easy to provide, if it\u2019s so free, why can\u2019t they just get it through another plan?\u201d he asked.\nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr.Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote everyone is looking at in this case, also picked up on the hijacking theme."}
