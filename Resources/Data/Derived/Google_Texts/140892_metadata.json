What did Rice initially tell the team and the NFL happened in the elevator? Did head coach John Harbaugh propose releasing Rice when the team first learned of the incident?\n\nThese are just some of the questions that are left unanswered after the Ravens put out a strongly worded denial yesterday to last Friday\u2019s blockbuster ESPN report that reconstructed how the NFL and team have addressed the Rice incident. Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti also answered questions from the media, talking for 45 minutes and doubting the unnamed sources in the report. \"Almost everything in there is anonymous, but it's clear from the subject matter that it's Ray's attorney, it's Ray's agent, it's Ray's friends,\u201d Bisciotti said. Don Van Natta, the ESPN journalist who broke the story, defended his work shortly after Bisciotti finished his press conference.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to know whom to believe and there are likely elements of truth in both accounts. But on some disagreements\u2014such as whether Harbaugh suggested releasing Rice\u2014there is no grey area. Someone is lying: either Van Natta\u2019s sources or the Ravens organization. The truth may come out over time. For now, we just don\u2019t know.\n\nIn the meantime, we can\u2019t let questions of blame overshadow the need to make progress on the issue of domestic violence. Ultimately, the most important outcome of this incident is not whether Bisciotti is lying or Roger Goodell keeps his job. It\u2019s what Rice, the Ravens and the NFL do to reduce domestic violence in the future. Last week, Goodell announced that the league would support the National Domestic Violence Hotline and National Sexual Violence Resource Center, as well as mandating all team employees receive training on stopping abuse. That\u2019s a good start, but it\u2019s just that\u2014a start. The league should also donate the salaries forfeited by players suspended for abuse to a fund to help domestic violence victims. My colleague Jonathan Cohn has also suggested each team donate money for the fund as well.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It's whether the NFL commits to combat domestic violence", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "It's whether the NFL commits to combat domestic violence", "title": "What Really Matters in the Ray Rice Saga Is Not the Culpability of the Baltimore Ravens", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/8885f7181c769b6949c2357dc2592e514a7c250b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119533/ray-rice-nfl-must-commit-help-reduce-domestic-violence-incidents", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/8885f7181c769b6949c2357dc2592e514a7c250b.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "What Really Matters in the Ray Rice Saga Is Not the Culpability of the Baltimore Ravens", "description": "It's whether the NFL commits to combat domestic violence", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/8885f7181c769b6949c2357dc2592e514a7c250b.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"What Really Matters in the Ray Rice Saga Is Not the Culpability of the Baltimore Ravens\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119533/ray-rice-nfl-must-commit-help-reduce-domestic-violence-incidents\",\"section\":\"QEDaily\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-23T11:30:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119533,\"author\":\"Danny Vinik\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"QEDaily\",\"QED\",\"NFL\",\"Baltimore Ravens\",\"Domestic Violence\",\"Roger Goodell\",\"Steve Bisciotti\",\"Ray Rice\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "QEDaily", "published_time": "2014-09-23"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "The league should also donate the salaries forfeited by players suspended for abuse to a fund to help domestic violence victims.\nIt\u2019s what Rice, the Ravens and the NFL do to reduce domestic violence in the future.\nIn the meantime, we can\u2019t let questions of blame overshadow the need to make progress on the issue of domestic violence.\nWhat did Rice initially tell the team and the NFL happened in the elevator?\nLast week, Goodell announced that the league would support the National Domestic Violence Hotline and National Sexual Violence Resource Center, as well as mandating all team employees receive training on stopping abuse."}
