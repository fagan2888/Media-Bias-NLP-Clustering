Wow.\n\nGretchen McCulloch\n\nBut what really interests me as a linguist is that doge speak is recognizably doge even when it\u2019s not on an image at all. Let\u2019s take a look at a particularly brilliant example from tumblr, although there are many shorter ones (check out this twitter or this subreddit): What light. So breaks. Such east. Very sun. Wow, Juliet.\n\nWhat Romeo. Such why. Very rose. Still rose.\n\nVery balcony. Such climb.\n\nMuch love. So Propose. Wow, marriage.\n\nVery Tybalt. Much stab. What do?\n\nSuch exile. Very Mantua. Much sad.\n\nSo, priest? Much sleeping. Wow, tomb.\n\nSuch poison. What dagger. Very dead. Wow, end. In typical tumblr-collaborative fashion, this was written by a different author per line, a full list of which can be found here, but which I omit for ease of reading. It\u2019s recognizably doge, but there\u2019s nary a shiba nor a fluorescent font in sight. Various creative people on the internet have also come up with forms of doge that riff on different aspects of it, such as doge script (based on javascript), dogecoin (based on bitcoin), dogegit or this YouTube easter egg.\n\nIvan Sekretarev / AP\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nI\u2019m Black. I\u2019m a Guy. And I\u2019m Obsessed With Figure Skating.\n\nRobert Samuels\n\nSometimes, I wonder what it would be like to be a football fan. No one questions your blackness; no one assumes you\u2019re gay. Maybe I\u2019d still have all my original teeth. But no, Mrs. Stern, my second-grade teacher, told her class about figure skating. I remember staring at the Newsweek article she tacked on the bulletin board and thinking the woman featured in the piece was the most beautiful I\u2019d ever seen. Kristi Yamaguchi: my first celebrity crush and the reason I will forever be a dude who loves figure skating.\n\nCBS Films\n\nAl-Jazeera America\n\nHate Lena Dunham? You\u2019ll Love Llewyn Davis\n\nRaina Lipsitz\n\nLlewyn is difficult but familiar; Hannah is a sloppy monster. The Coens have artistic authority; Dunham is uppity. Critics don\u2019t hate \u201cGirls\u201d with such venom only because it\u2019s female-centric. Other shows about women haven\u2019t provoked this level of hostility. Although it, too, attracted negative attention, \u201cSex and the City\u201d had solid ratings and a devoted following \u2014 in part because it was a fantasy. The characters lived in fabulous apartments, wore beautiful clothes and slept with handsome men. The characters on \u201cGirls\u201d have normal bodies and awkward sex and apologize for neither. Hannah spends a lot of time naked. She makes people uncomfortable \u2014 not because she\u2019s a woman but because, as Gunn noted of Skyler, she doesn\u2019t \u201cconform to a comfortable ideal of the archetypical female.\u201d Hannah\u2019s not there to titillate straight male viewers or model designer clothing. She\u2019s just herself, fat tummy, questionable haircuts, weird outfits, solipsism and all. Maybe some viewers really do hate Hannah because she\u2019s a selfish brat. But there\u2019s no better explanation than sexism for so many critics\u2019 willingness to tolerate and even sympathize with Llewyn Davis and Ben Stone and Walter White \u2014 while openly yearning for Hannah Horvath to choke. And there are few standards more punishing than the one by which we judge female artists.\n\nKarl-Josef Hildenbrand / AP\n\nDeadspin\n\nThe Hater's Guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nDrew Magary\n\nCurling. Why don't they call it by its real name? ICE BOCCE. I feel like Putin should hire some of those frantic ice shavers to help clean the roads. Cross Country Skiing. The worst. The absolute fucking worst Winter Olympics event there is. If any sport deserved wrestling's cruel fate (i.e., a traditional sport that got bounced from the Games strictly as punishment for not being compelling enough on TV), it's cross country skiing. We never win this event. We never even come close. The gold medal always goes to Bjorn Flugenblugen of Oslo, who treks 20 miles through a Norwegian forest every day just to get to the pickle store. I don't know why we're giving these GLORY VIKINGS a world stage for skiing on flat land just so they can go home to endorse their country's favorite brand of tiny, adorable pumpernickel bread. Even when they add a GUN to this event, it's boring. You don't see any medal event for cross country sled paddling, do you? All sports should take place downhill: skiing, luging, skating, boxing. Everything is improved when done at speeds of up to 90mph. I demand more downhill skating.\n\nHBO\n\nThe Los Angeles Review of Books\n\nPretty Girl Privilege\n\nAnne Helen Petersen\n\nGirls, for all of its flaws, does speak truth to (most) power. Networking doesn\u2019t work, and if it does, it\u2019s morally repugnant; cultural capital gets you nowhere; standardized good looks get you a degrading job at a gentlemen\u2019s club. Which is why I like Marnie \u2014 or, more precisely, Girls\u2019 horrible treatment of Marnie. There are Marnies all over contemporary media, they just get everything that we\u2019ve been conditioned to expect their looks, class, and education level meriting: outrageous success, perfect happiness. In Hollywood films, all these Marnies lack is a man \u2014 which they conveniently gain by the end of the three act structure. Katherine Heigl\u2019s a Marnie; Jennifer Garner\u2019s a Marnie; Jennifer Aniston is very often a Marnie. They\u2019re not classy by birth (Marnies aren\u2019t Gwyneths, after all: Jessa is a Gwenyth) but by try.\n\nAP Photo / Wong Maye-E\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nWhat Does Pussy Riot Mean Now?\n\nMiriam Elder\n\nThe six weeks since Masha, 25, and Nadya, 24, were suddenly released from prison as part of an amnesty issued by President Vladimir Putin have been a whirlwind. When they were first arrested in February 2012 after performing an anti-Putin punk anthem in Moscow\u2019s main cathedral, they were unknowns, disguised by balaclavas in a video that would become the single best-known piece of art to emerge from post-Soviet Russia. One chaotic, revelatory trial and lengthy prison sentence later, they find themselves being flown first-class to Singapore, Holland, Ireland, Sweden, and now New York. Berlin is next. They\u2019ve met government ministers and rock stars, drag queens, and Stephen Colbert. Nadya and Masha entered prison at the height of a promising era. Moscow had risen up against Vladimir Putin. Protest was alive; change appeared to be around the corner. Pussy Riot took this further than anyone, adopting striking visuals and a form of protest Russia had rarely seen. Wearing bright clothes and masks, they would storm sites \u2014 Red Square, churches, fashion runways \u2014 and shout and dance around while someone filmed. Though often referred to as a band, they never actually played instruments during these guerrilla performances. They never had plans to put out an album \u2014 that would be against their anti-capitalist ethos, they said. Their arrest signaled the beginning of the end. But they don\u2019t seem to have realized this. In the two years since they were arrested, a small handful of opposition activists have issued reports on corruption, environmental catastrophe, and decline in freedoms, upping their output in the lead-up to the Sochi Olympics. It lands in a void.\n\nNBC / Margaret Norton / AP\n\nThe AV Club\n\nJay Leno Was Good at Being Bad\n\nMatt Wild", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most intriguing articles about entertainment we&#39;ve come across in the past seven days", "author": "Nolan Feeney, Ashley Fetters, and Spencer Kornhaber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The most intriguing articles about entertainment we&#39;ve come across in the past seven days", "title": "Olympic Glamour, Doge Grammar: The Week's Best Pop-Culture Writing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/shiba_inu/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/02/olympic-glamour-doge-grammar-the-weeks-best-pop-culture-writing/283549/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Gretchen McCullochBut what really interests me as a linguist is that doge speak is recognizably doge even when it\u2019s not on an image at all.\nClick the links in the article titles to read the full pieces, and let us know what we've missed:Amy Sancetta / APThe ToastA Linguist Explains the Grammar of Doge.\nKatherine Heigl\u2019s a Marnie; Jennifer Garner\u2019s a Marnie; Jennifer Aniston is very often a Marnie.\nPussy Riot took this further than anyone, adopting striking visuals and a form of protest Russia had rarely seen.\nIt\u2019s recognizably doge, but there\u2019s nary a shiba nor a fluorescent font in sight."}
