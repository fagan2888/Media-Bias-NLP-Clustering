Analysts agree that demographics buoy the long-term prospects for health care, as the aging U.S. population will increasingly need care of all sorts. In developing countries, health care infrastructures are rapidly being built. Innovation shows no signs of stopping, with expanding pipelines of new products, drugs, devices and technology.\n\nSweeping changes in health care policy and rising employment mean more people have health coverage. More coverage means more utilization of health care services at every point on the spectrum, from over-the-counter drugs to specialized home care and therapy.\n\nETFs are a cost-efficient way for investors to get in on all of this growth. Robert Goldsborough, manager, research analyst and ETF specialist with Morningstar, lists Health Care Select Sector SPDR Vanguard Health Care ETF as top picks for the category.\n\n[Read: How to Budget for Health Care Expenses in Retirement.]\n\nKeep in mind, however, that because health care is so robust, it\u2019s not as overvalued as some other sectors and is considered less likely to face a correction. If this sector appeals to you, you\u2019ll probably not gain by waiting for a temporary drop in valuations. \u201cThis is not a bargain-hunting situation,\u201d Goldsborough says.\n\nAlthough U.S. consumer utilization of health care service has not entirely rebounded from its prerecession levels, other trends have converged to power health care growth, Goldsborough says.\n\nHealth care trends are somewhat independent of overall economic conditions, he adds. That means even if the U.S. economy takes a dip, the health care sector is likely to be less affected, thus stabilizing portfolios. \u201cHealth care tends to perform well when the market is down,\u201d says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research. Meanwhile, health care was the best-performing sector in the second quarter of this year, she points out.\n\nHere are some of the underlying factors analysts say are behind that performance.\n\nPharmaceutical companies chronically complain about the burdensome regulatory process for new drugs, but the pipeline has become more efficient, opening the way for a steady introduction of new products, Goldsborough says. \u201cThe regulatory environment is more favorable than it has been,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had new development in several areas, plus pharmaceutical companies have been buying biotech startups. The drug development is surprisingly strong.\u201d\n\nMishra is a fan of the pharmaceutical subsector because the product and profitability life cycle for new drugs is relatively long \u2013 and there\u2019s plenty in the pipeline. Her recommendations for this subsector are PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF and iShares US Pharmaceuticals ETF.\n\n[Read: Everything You Need to Know About Exchange-Traded Funds.]\n\nOn the other hand, the medical devices subsector would seem to be equally stable, but it isn\u2019t. If you are analyzing the holdings of an ETF, look hard at its proportion of device manufacturers, because their sales are sometimes tied to elective surgery and treatments, Mishra says.\n\nDeveloping countries are also driving health care growth for international companies, Goldsborough says. Pharmaceutical and device firms are likely to have strong sales in China for the next seven years, given that country\u2019s population and health infrastructure growth.\n\nHealth care ETFs are a smart way to enter the sector because there are plenty of funds that offer diversified exposure, says Josh Emanuel, chief investment officer of the Elements Financial Group LLC. Health care fund performance is driven by the results of individual stocks \u2013 not just a general market lift. That validates the stability of the sector, Emanuel says.\n\nIf the sector is so wonderful, why not assemble your own basket of health care stocks? Because there are still some underperformers, Emanuel points out, such as GlaxoSmithKline, which trails sector leader Amgen by 25.5 percent so far this year. \u201cThat\u2019s important because stock selection is a huge factor if you buy individual companies,\u201d he says.\n\n[See: 7 Ways to Take Advantage of Your 401(k).]\n\nPicking winners in the biotechnology subsector is best left to experts who understand the many factors that go into growth potential, from technical development to patent and regulatory approvals to testing to market launch.\n\nEven the low fees of an ETF include transaction costs and the expense of rebalancing the fund. If you assemble your own health care portfolio, you have to pay for transactions and rebalancing on your own. And that\u2019s assuming you have enough money to buy \u201cmeaningful\u201d amounts of each company you want, Emanuel adds.\n\nSome investors say, \"Why should I pay a fee for a passive ETF?\" Well, you're paying the fee because you\u2019re not paying the transaction costs, and you\u2019re getting diversification.\n\n\u201cHealth care is where you go for yield \u2013 along with telecom,\u201d Emanuel says. \u201cOver time, health care has never been\u200b the source of a bull market or the cause of a bear market.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"150129_Wine\",\"text\":\"August is the best month to buy wine on sale.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "With sweeping changes in health care access, these ETFs may be a good investment, analysts say.", "zone": "personal-finance/home/mutual-funds/articles", "author": "Joanne Cleaver", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "With sweeping changes in health care access, these ETFs may be a good investment, analysts say.", "title": "Is Now the Time to Invest in Health Care ETFs?", "url": "http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/mutual-funds/articles/2014/09/18/is-now-the-time-to-invest-in-health-care-etfs", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dbimages/master/32093/FE_PR_100122_RetireSpot_Health425.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With sweeping changes in health care access, these ETFs may be a good investment, analysts say.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Is Now the Time to Invest in Health Care ETFs? - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "money-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-09-18", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/519a745/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fdbimages%2Fmaster%2F32093%2FFE_PR_100122_RetireSpot_Health425.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "health care,Affordable Care Act,FundsBucket-Investing [Consumer Advice],mutual funds,exchange traded funds,investing,stock market,Joanne Cleaver", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-09-18"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z36xst", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "health care industry, pharmaceuticals, ETFs, health sector, stock market, health care ETFs, biotechnology, medical devices, Affordable Care Act, exchange-traded funds"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf50\"", "article_summary": "Although U.S. consumer utilization of health care service has not entirely rebounded from its prerecession levels, other trends have converged to power health care growth, Goldsborough says.\nRobert Goldsborough, manager, research analyst and ETF specialist with Morningstar, lists Health Care Select Sector SPDR Vanguard Health Care ETF as top picks for the category.\nSweeping changes in health care policy and rising employment mean more people have health coverage.\nAnalysts agree that demographics buoy the long-term prospects for health care, as the aging U.S. population will increasingly need care of all sorts.\nMore coverage means more utilization of health care services at every point on the spectrum, from over-the-counter drugs to specialized home care and therapy."}
