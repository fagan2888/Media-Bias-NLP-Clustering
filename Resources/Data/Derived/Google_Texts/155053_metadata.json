But elected officials looking for the biggest bang for their buck often turn their attention elsewhere.\n\nAfter all, not everybody likes babies, and an increasing number of Americans are now health-conscious enough to consider things like deep-fried butter at least somewhat alarming. But almost everybody hates the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nRelated: Taxpayers Lose $23 Million in IRS Phone Scam\n\nFor that reason, beating up on the IRS has become something approaching a reflex for politicians, including a number of high-profile presidential candidates, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who regularly promises to eliminate the agency if he wins the Oval Office.\n\nWhile the constant political attacks may seem like harmless posturing, the fact is that the IRS serves the rather vital function of making sure the federal government has money to pay its bills, and years of legislative chipping away at its capabilities, accelerated in the wake of the targeting scandal that followed the 2012 elections, have made it exceedingly difficult for the agency to perform even its most basic function: making sure Americans pay the taxes that Congress has voted into law.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen hammered that point home this week in a speech before the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, revealing that the agency is now so low on manpower that there is a less than 1 percent chance that a given tax return will be checked for accuracy.\n\n\u201cThe IRS completed about 1.2 million individual audits in fiscal 2015,\u201d Koskinen said on Tuesday. That\u2019s 13,700 less than the previous year. Even more disturbing, the decline in audits in 2015 was not a one-year aberration. The number for 2015 was 350,000 below five years ago. That\u2019s a drop of 22 percent, and corresponds exactly to the number of revenue agents, which is also down 22 percent since 2010.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Using Private Tax Collectors Is a Losing Strategy for the IRS\n\nAdditionally, taxpayers who call the IRS for assistance now find it somewhere between difficult and impossible to get their questions answered.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers who called the IRS had long wait times on the phones,\u201d Koskinen told the accounting society. \u201cOn bad days, fewer than 40 percent of calls were able to reach a live assistor, and that was after a 30-minute wait or longer. And taxpayers who needed in\u2013person help at IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers often waited in very long lines just to get in the door.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s biggest problem is that political opportunism has trumped common sense. Regardless of how much people dislike paying taxes, nobody can credibly argue that the government doesn\u2019t need tax revenue to operate.\n\nAnd, Koskinen pointed out, constant budget cuts at his agency, while politically popular, are absurdly expensive in terms of the amount of federally mandated tax revenue that is simply not collected.\n\n\u201cBetween 2005 and 2010, the revenue generated from audits averaged $14.7 billion annually,\u201d he said. \u201cBut since 2010, it has averaged only $10.5 billion a year, which is a drop of nearly 30 percent, and translates to more than $20 billion in uncollected revenue over the past five years.\n\nRelated: Desperate IRS Rehires 300 Poor Performers\n\n\u201cThese numbers show that when you have fewer employees doing compliance work, you end up leaving tax revenue on the table. In cutting the IRS budget, the government is forgoing billions just to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars, since we estimate that every $1 invested in the IRS produces $4 in revenue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s become politically convenient for members of Congress to behave as though the IRS is some sort of illegitimate, confiscatory machine that each April robs Americans of their hard-earned money. In painting that picture, of course, they conveniently forget that all tax laws originate in Congress, and can\u2019t become law in the first place without the approval of both the House and Senate.\n\nKoskinen\u2019s speech likely won\u2019t have much impact on Congressional attitudes toward his agency. But as the House and Senate slog toward inevitable fights over appropriations for federal spending over the next few weeks, it\u2019s worth remembering that many of the same members who will likely be complaining about the country\u2019s fiscal management are actively preventing it from gathering the revenue it needs to honor the obligations they have, themselves, voted for.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Beating up on the IRS has become something approaching a reflex for politicians, including a number of high-profile presidential candidates, like Texas Sen.
