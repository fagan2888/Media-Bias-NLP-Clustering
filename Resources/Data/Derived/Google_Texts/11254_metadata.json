That trend is also posing a challenge for healthcare providers.\n\nSkyrocketing home prices have forced much of Austin's low-income population to move out of the central city. And that migration has made it harder for groups working to help those living in poverty to reach people in need. Marianna Gomez is a strategy analyst at Central Health. The government-funded group connects low-income Travis County residents with affordable health care services.\n\n\u201cHistorically there have been pockets of poverty in Austin particularly on the east side, and we did have a lot of services in that part of town,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nBut as new development rolls in, many longtime residents are getting priced out. For groups like Central Health, it\u2019s important to track where they\u2019re going.\n\n\u201cA lot of the low-income population is moving to Pflugerville, Manor, and so we have to think about how to respond to those changes and think about where our service locations are and what types of services we\u2019re providing in our different clinics.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, providers are trying to figure out how to reach those faraway patients. Jill Ramirez is president and CEO of the nonprofit Latino Healthcare Forum. They\u2019re working to get more Austin residents insured through the Affordable Care Act. But as more of their clients move away from the city, Ramirez says they\u2019ve had to get creative.\n\n\u201cSo in order for us to be able to get to them, we rely a lot usually on schools, where people naturally meet.\u201d\n\nGomez with Central Health says she wants to see more research on these changing demographics \u2013 like what bus routes could connect more people with healthcare facilities?\n\n\u201cTransportation is obviously something we want to take into consideration because if you can\u2019t get to your healthcare provider, then what will happen after that? You might miss even more days of work.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Gomez says the change is gradual, but Central Health is planning for the future. She says that could mean concentrating more primary care services in the suburbs, and focusing specialty care in the city center.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Austin", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that Austin\u2019s rapid growth and gentrification have forced some residents out of their longtime neighborhoods.
