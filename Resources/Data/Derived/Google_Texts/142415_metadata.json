Oh, and the family lives in a \u201cwhite house,\u201d though theirs is a modest ranch on Madera Street. Normally, the family doesn\u2019t do anything special on the annual President\u2019s Day holiday.\n\nBob and Becky married 18 years ago. As the babies started coming, they struggled to figure out distinctive names in the milieu of two large extended families. Dorothy Jo came first, followed by a half-dozen brothers, one every couple of years.\n\n\u201cWith all our cousins, we were looking for unique names,\u201d said Bob, 44, who teaches science at Wahlert Catholic High School. \u201cI had a student named Grant and we liked it.\u201d\n\nThe next son was named for a favorite television character - Carter. \u201cThen we realized we had a pattern,\u201d said Becky, 42, who runs an in-home day care business. As the next four sons came along, the couple picked presidents\u2019 names that had some connection to family members - in the case of Lincoln, because Becky lived across the Mississippi River in his home state for a time. As the oldest of their seven children, Dorothy Jo became known as \u201cthe First Lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are all nice, strong names,\u201d Becky said.\n\nFriends and family enjoyed offering suggestions for future presidential monikers - Jackson and Harrison were future possibilities for additional sons. But the next baby girl would have been named Audrey.\n\nNone of the boys expresses a strong interest in following their namesake by running for president.\n\nThey are more focused on being good students - Grant, 15, is a freshman at Wahlert; Carter, 12, is a seventh-grader at Mazzuchelli Middle School; Wilson, 10, Pierce, 7, and Lincoln, 5, are in grades four, two and kindergarten respectively at Holy Ghost School; and Truman, 3, is at home.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Telegraph Herald, http://www.thonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Dubuque couple did not intend to name their sons after U.S. presidents, but once they realized their pattern, they kept going.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Dubuque couple did not intend to name their sons after U.S. presidents, but once they realized their pattern, they kept going.", "title": "Dubuque family names follow presidential pattern", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/22/dubuque-family-names-follow-presidential-pattern/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/22/e51b3a1c57307d074c0f6a706700b9a0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/22/e51b3a1c57307d074c0f6a706700b9a0.jpg", "description": "A Dubuque couple did not intend to name their sons after U.S. presidents, but once they realized their pattern, they kept going.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dubuque family names follow presidential pattern"}, "Author": "MARY NEVANS-PEDERSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Becky Oberfoell, Wilson, Truman, Bob Oberfoell, Grant"}, "article_summary": "As the oldest of their seven children, Dorothy Jo became known as \u201cthe First Lady.\u201d\u201cThey are all nice, strong names,\u201d Becky said.\n\u201cI had a student named Grant and we liked it.\u201dThe next son was named for a favorite television character - Carter.\nDUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) - A Dubuque couple did not intend to name their sons after U.S. presidents, but once they realized their pattern, they kept going.\nFriends and family enjoyed offering suggestions for future presidential monikers - Jackson and Harrison were future possibilities for additional sons.\nThe Telegraph Herald reports (http://bit.ly/MCfckG ) the six sons of Bob and Becky Oberfoell are: Grant, Carter, Wilson, Pierce, Lincoln and Truman."}
